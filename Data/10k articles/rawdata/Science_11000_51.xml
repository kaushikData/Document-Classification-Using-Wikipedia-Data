'''Arago Glacier''' ({{Coord|64|51|S|62|23|W|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] flowing into [[Andvord Bay]] just northwest of [[Moser Glacier]], on the west coast of [[Graham Land]]. It was mapped by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] from air photos taken by [[Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd]] in 1956&amp;ndash;57, and named by the [[United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] in 1960 for [[François Arago]], the [[France|French]] [[geodesist]] who first demonstrated the application of photography to mapmaking in 1839.

[[Muscat de Saumur]] was first cultivated in 1842 by Auguste Courtiller, who created it by selecting seedlings from a Pinot Noir Précoce vine with open pollination. Courtiller worked in the Jardin des Plantes of the city of [[Saumur]].

As a paleontologist, he described the ammonites species ''Ammonites cephalotus'' (syn. of ''[[Neoptychites telinga]]'') in 1860 and ''[[Kamerunoceras salmuriensis]]'' in 1867. He also named the genus ''[[Cupulina]]'' in 1861.

The task aims to test the quantity of objects that can be held in working memory while preventing participants from using [[mnemonics]] or other memory techniques separate from the working memory to increase recall capacity.  In the experiment, participants view a sequence of three-letter constructs called trigrams, and are asked to perform simple algebraic computations such as counting backwards by 3s from 999 between each trigram.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt; A trigram consists of 3 [[morpheme|non-morphemic]] letters, the importance of which is that each letter represents a different independent object to be stored in working memory; therefore, trigrams avoid letter combinations that depict words or common acronyms. The algebraic computations are administered between trigrams to assure the participant isn't using mnemonic strategies to [[Chunking (psychology)|chunk]] the letters into a single object.  Variants of the Brown–Peterson task are still used today, all with the same fundamental concept of administering items for the participant to remember whilst preventing the usage of additional cognitive resources to augment working memory.&lt;ref name="pubmed"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Procedure ==

The Brown–Peterson task refers to two studies published in the late 1950s that used similar procedures, one in 1958 by John Brown&lt;ref name=JB /&gt; and a second in 1959 by Lloyd and Margaret Peterson.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt;

The first experiment involved 24 psychology students at [[Indiana University]] at the time. The examiner proceeded by spelling a random three-letter nonsense syllable and then enunciating immediately afterwards a random three-digit number. The subject would then count backwards by some assigned number, either three or four, from the enunciated number.

After a set interval, a light signal was flashed to prompt the subject to cease verbally counting and to recall the random, three-letter nonsense syllable. The time interval between the enunciation by the examiner of the nonsense syllable (exposure to the syllable) and the signal prompt to the participant was known as the recall interval; the time interval between the signal prompt and the enunciation of the third letter by the participant was known as a latency.
In order to maintain [[reproducibility]] of results, each participant was tested eight times using each recall interval, which were 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 seconds. In addition, each nonsense syllable appeared an equal amount of times; the trials were split evenly in terms of counting by either three or four. No successive items contained the same letters, and the time between signal for recall and the next trial was always 15 seconds. In addition, the examiner and participant were instructed to enunciate in rhythm with a 120 BPM metronome, such that two letters or numbers were spoken per second.

The second experiment involved 48 psychology students from Indiana University. The exact procedure from the first experiment was followed for 24 of the students, but the other 24 were asked to repeat the stimulus (i.e., the nonsense syllable) aloud until the examiner stated the three-digit number. Therefore, the only difference between the two experiments was that there was a variable gap between the examiner's enunciation of the stimulus and the number, during which maintenance rehearsal took place. The inspiration behind this experiment was Brown's disbelief that repetition would strengthen the 'memory trace. The purpose of the second experiment was basically to prove or disprove this notion. However, the analysis of the study concluded that forgetting was found to progress at differential rates dependent upon the amount of rehearsal that took place'.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt;

== Interference ==
{{main article|Interference theory}}
There are two types of interference:

'''Retroactive interference''': This type of interference occurs when new information disrupts the recall of old information.

'''Proactive interference''': This type of interference occurs when old information disrupts the recall of new information.

Proactive interference affects participant performance in the Brown–Peterson task. The first time the students participate in the task, they show little loss of information.&lt;ref name=Revlin&gt;

| isbn = 978-0-7167-5667-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after multiple trials, the task becomes increasingly challenging when letters from the early trials are confused with letters in the current trial. 
Fortunately, proactive interference can be hindered if the information to be remembered is changed to a different type of information. For example, in the Brown–Peterson task there appeared to be little proactive interference when the participants switched from recalling letters to recalling numbers.&lt;ref name=Revlin /&gt;

== Rehearsal ==

A key aspect of the Brown–Peterson task is the fact that it blocks [[Memory rehearsal|rehearsal]], which is used to better recall items in [[short-term memory]]. Rehearsal is the concept of directing attention to material that was just learned. This way, it can lengthen the duration of one's short-term memory capacity. In order to accurately calculate the duration of short-term memory using the Brown–Peterson task, such a method must be blocked so as not to falsely increase an unaltered duration. There are two different types of rehearsal:

'''Maintenance rehearsal''': This method of rehearsal uses repetition of the items in memory. It is essentially "saying something repeatedly in order to keep it in mind".&lt;ref name=Revlin /&gt; An example could be attempting to memorize a shopping list while out shopping for groceries. Instead of remembering to take the list out to the store, the shopper could leave it at home and proceed to repeat each word. As useful as this type of rehearsal may seem, it does not guarantee the ability to recall what was memorized after it is no longer rehearsed

'''Elaborative rehearsal''': This is type of rehearsal is also known as creative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal uses creativity to increase capacity of short-term memory and accurately recall items. Creating associations and connections between something significant to the person memorizing and the item(s) to be memorized is one example of elaborative rehearsal. Another example is the use of mnemonic devices, which are a creative way to mentally arrange the items to be memorized.

Three key words in rehearsal are Association, Location, and Imagination. Association is an important factor in rehearsal, as it is the part of elaborative rehearsal where people make connections with the items and things significant to them. This helps increase capacity of short-term memory as they are recalling items with the help of something meaningful to them. Location is another factor, as incorporating location into what they are trying to memorize may be another association to a significant location in particular, thus making the item much easier to recall. Finally, imagination is essentially the creativity of elaborative rehearsal. It combines creativity with the items to recall in such a way that makes them easiest to recall.

In [[classical mechanics]], a '''central force''' on an object is a [[force (physics)|force]] that is directed along the line joining the object and the origin{{ref label|defn|a|a}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Mechanics|last1=Taylor|first1=John R.|date=2005|publisher=Univ. Science Books|isbn=1-891389-22-X|location=Sausalito, Calif.|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = F( \mathbf{r} ) \hat{\mathbf{r}} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \vec{ \text{ F } } &lt;/math&gt; is the force, '''F''' is a [[vector field|vector valued force function]], ''F'' is a scalar valued force function, '''r''' is the [[position vector]], ||'''r'''|| is its length, and &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; = '''r'''/||'''r'''|| is the corresponding [[unit vector]].

Not all central force fields are [[conservative force|conservative]] nor [[circular symmetry#Spherical symmetry|spherically symmetric]]. However, it can be shown that a central force is conservative if and only if it is spherically symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=John R.|title=Classical Mechanics|date=2005|publisher=Univ. Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=1-891389-22-X|pages=133–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Central forces that are conservative can always be expressed as the negative [[gradient]] of a [[potential energy]]:-
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = - \mathbf{\nabla} V(\mathbf{r})\text{, where }V(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{|\mathbf{r}|}^{+\infin} F(r)\,\mathrm{d}r&lt;/math&gt;
(the upper bound of integration is arbitrary, as the potential is defined [[up to]] an additive constant).

In a conservative field, the total [[mechanical energy]] ([[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and potential) is conserved:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} m |\mathbf{\dot{r}}|^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) = \text{constant}&lt;/math&gt;
(where '''ṙ''' denotes the [[derivative]] of '''r''' with respect to time, that is the [[velocity]]), and in a central force field, so is the [[angular momentum]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times m\mathbf{\dot{r}} = \text{constant}&lt;/math&gt;
because the [[torque]] exerted by the force is zero. As a consequence, the body moves on the plane perpendicular to the angular momentum vector and containing the origin, and obeys [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's second law]]. (If the angular momentum is zero, the body moves along the line joining it with the origin.)

It can also be shown that an object that moves under the influence of ''any'' central force obeys Kepler's second law. However, the first and third laws depend on the inverse-square nature of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and do not hold in general for other central forces.

As a consequence of being conservative, these specific central force fields are irrotational, that is, its [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] is zero, ''except at the origin'':
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla\times\mathbf{F} (\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{0}\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
Gravitational force and [[Coulomb force]] are two familiar examples with &lt;math&gt; F( \mathbf{r} ) &lt;/math&gt; being [[Inverse-square law|proportional to 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] only. An object in such a force field with negative &lt;math&gt; F( \mathbf{r} ) &lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to an attractive force) obeys [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

The force field of a spatial [[harmonic oscillator]] is central with &lt;math&gt; F( \mathbf{r} ) &lt;/math&gt; proportional to ''r'' only and negative.

By [[Bertrand's theorem]], these two, &lt;math&gt; F( \mathbf{r} ) = -k/r^2 &lt;/math&gt;and ''&lt;math&gt; F( \mathbf{r} ) = -kr &lt;/math&gt;'', are the only possible central force fields where all bounded orbits are stable closed orbits. However, there exist other force fields, which have some closed orbits.

==Notes==
{{note label|defn|a|a}}This article uses the definition of central force given in Taylor&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Another common definition (used in ''ScienceWorld''&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/CentralForce.html|title=Central Force|author=Eric W. Weisstein|authorlink=Eric W. Weisstein|year=1996–2007|work=ScienceWorld|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=2008-08-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) adds the constraint that the force be spherically symmetric, i.e. &lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = F( ||\mathbf{r}|| ) \hat{\mathbf{r}} &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5613">'''The Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS''' is a Centre of Competence of the [http://www.swiss-academies.ch/index.php Swiss Academies of Arts and Science], based on a mandate in the Swiss federal law on research. It is an advisory body, financed by public money, and devoted to [[technology assessment]]. (The abbreviation «TA» which is used to describe TA-SWISS stands for [[Technology Assessment]], and reflects the activities of the Centre.)

==Mission==
The object of the Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS is to follow technological changes and developments and to identify the social, legal and ethical consequences of new technologies. Another element of its mission is to encourage the discussion of scientific and technological challenges.

The recommendations that result from TA-SWISS projects are used to assist the decision making process, and are intended for the Swiss Parliament and the Federal Council. Depending on the topics covered, these recommendations may also be of interest to other groups, such as professional associations, commercial enterprises, universities and stakeholder groups, as well as public administrations. The media, in their role as disseminators of information, are also kept regularly informed about the activities of TA-SWISS.

TA-Swiss is full member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network&lt;ref&gt;EPTA is a network of those bodies in Europe that are devoted, at least among other tasks, to advise Parliaments, see [http://eptanetwork.org EPTA homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a founding member of the German speaking Network NTA (Netzwerk Technikfolgenabschätzung).&lt;ref&gt;NTA is the association of technology assessment institutions and practitioners in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, see [http://www.netzwerk-ta.net NTA homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The activities of the Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS are further divided into two areas:

1. Studies (interdisciplinary scientific analyses)
Recent studies have covered the following topics:

2. Participative projects (consultations aimed at gathering the views of citizens)
Numerous events have been organised within the scope of the participative projects – PubliForums, publifocus and other forms of dialogue, for example:
* publifocus «[https://www.ta-swiss.ch/en/medical-treatments/ Medical treatments]» (2012)
* Dialogue «[https://www.ta-swiss.ch/en/internet-of-the-future/ The Internet and me]» (2010)

* publifocus [https://www.ta-swiss.ch/en/publifocus-ehealth/ eHealth and the electronic patient file] (2008)

==History==
Experimental beginnings: The Centre for Technology Assessment began its work in 1992. Following a number of parliamentary interventions, the Federal Council assigned the Swiss Science and Technology Council the task of developing a system of technology assessment for Switzerland over a four-year pilot phase (1992–1995).

Institutionalisation of technology assessment: In its Message relating to the promotion of training, research and technology for the years 1996-1999, the Federal Council defined the bases for the institutionalisation and financing of technology assessment in Switzerland. In 1999, technology assessment was firmly fixed in the law on research. In this way, the Federal Council reinforced the independence of TA-SWISS, which until 2007 was affiliated to the Swiss Science and Technology Council.

In 2008 a change in the law on research conferred the legal basis on the incorporation of the mandate for TA-SWISS within the Association of Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. Accordingly, since 1 January 2008 TA-SWISS has been a Centre for Excellence of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences.

Accessed 2009.05.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] introduced the chained-dollar measure in 1996.  Chained dollars generally reflect dollar figures computed with 2009 as the base year.

==Terms==
''Constant Dollars:'' weighted by a constant/unchanging basket/list of goods and services.

''Chained Dollars:'' weighted by a basket/list that changes yearly to more accurately reflect actual spending. The basket is an average of the basket for successive pairs of years; example of paired years are 2010-2011, 2011-2012, etc.

The technique is so named because the second number in a pair of successive years becomes the first in the next pair.  The result is a continuous "chain" of weights and averages.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/consumptionbriefs/recs/natgas/chained.html Chained Dollars] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830211736/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/consumptionbriefs/recs/natgas/chained.html |date=August 30, 2007 }}, citing EIA, ''Annual Energy Review 1999''.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of using the chained-dollar measure is that it is more closely related to any given period covered and is subject to less distortion over time.&lt;ref&gt;Mark McCracken, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">'''Community development planning''' consists of a public participatory and usually interactive form of [[town]] or [[neighborhood]] planning and design in which diverse community members (often termed “stakeholders”) contribute toward formulation of the goals, objectives, planning, [[Funding|fund]]/[[resource]] identification and direction, planned project [[implementation]]s and re[[evaluation]] of documented local planning policy. It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) [[region]]al, [[city]] and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and [[public activism]]. It often promotes [[public/private partnership]] as a means to harness physical development activities in support of community-defined goals.&lt;ref&gt;The Practice of Local Government Planning, 2nd Edition (the "Green Book"). 1979. International City Management Association. Washington, DC. Pages 62 and 553-599.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, it seeks community consensus for proposed allocations of scarce resources among competing demands. In more vigorous application, community members access a full gamut of planning tools, shaping and being shaped by shared understanding of a complex community information base, directly informing and guiding local plan content, influencing resulting development budgets, projects and thus future [[infrastructure]] and land uses, as well as helping coordinate the work of overlapping [[jurisdiction]]s, levels of [[government]], internal and adjacent communities and various providers, such as [[Chamber of commerce|business associations]], [[utilities]] and [[school]]s.

A '''composite cross population''' (CCP) is created by crossing a number of plants from different lines, and subsequently bulking [[seed]]s from the resulting offspring. This makes a CCP a population of plants with a lot of inherent genetic diversity, in contrast to [[monoculture]]s where all plants are clones and homozygous at all loci (fully inbred). In recent years CCPs have been proposed as a way to create modern [[landrace]]s of wheat, barley and oats. Research is done to explore whether they are better suited for organic farming than the modern cultivars. 
They are suited for participatory breeding of crops, which is in contrast to cultivars owned by big breeding companies.&lt;ref name="Doring2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Döring|first1=Thomas F.|last2=Knapp|first2=Samuel|last3=Kovacs|first3=Geza|last4=Murphy|first4=Kevin|last5=Wolfe|first5=Martin S.|title=Evolutionary Plant Breeding in Cereals—Into a New Era|journal=Sustainability|date=17 October 2011|volume=2011|issue=3|doi=10.3390/su3101944|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.384.6538&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of using CCPs in plant breeding was initially published in 1956.&lt;ref name=Suneson1956&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miscugli.it/public/componenti/725/files/Suneson_1956%20%28SC%202306%29.pdf|title=An Evolutionary Plant Breeding Method|last=Suneson|first=Coit A.|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yield data for 4 different populations for 8–28 years were presented in the article and after 8–15 years of repeated breeding under natural selection, the populations out-yielded the reference cultivar.

== Stages==

Creating a CCP involves 3 steps: initiation, multiplication and mixture. The population then goes into the maintenance phase.&lt;ref name=Doring2011 /&gt;

===Initiation===
A number of lines, generally 7-30, with interesting properties, such as yield or baking quality, are selected and all possible crosses of them are done. If many lines of different genetic background are used, a huge amount of genetic diversity will be present.

===Multiplication===
Seeds from crosses are sown out and harvested separately for a growing season or two until enough seeds are available.

===Mixture===
All seeds are mixed in equal portions to produce the first CCP generation.

===Maintenance===
The population is grown repeatedly and possibly changes due to natural selection. Each year seeds are saved after harvest, and used as seed for the next growing season. Plants that are successful under the prevailing growing conditions will give more seeds and contribute more to the next generation, compared to less successful plants. Disease will cull susceptible plants and the population will over time become resistant to the common diseases, but only if the initial population has resistance genes present.

== Pros ==
When [[genotype]]s grown together in a diverse population have different profiles of resource use they complement each other in the exploitation of the limiting resource and therefore are subject to smaller between-plant competition.

In case of disease or environmental change some plants will take over when others fail. Yield stability over years and environments can be better than pure lines due to compensation.&lt;ref name=Doring2011 /&gt;

Participatory [[plant breeding]] (PPB) methods represent alternatives aimed to improve local adaptation breeding, to promote genetic diversity, to empower farmers and rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://orgprints.org/6493/1/driebergen.pdf|title=Participatory Plant Breeding Methods for Organic Cereals|last=Desclaux|first=Dominique}}&lt;/ref&gt; In PPB farmers are actively participating in developing new cultivars or populations, e.g. by performing selection.

== Cons ==
Different genotypes may compete with each other in a way that is not beneficial for the population.&lt;ref name=Doring2011 /&gt; A pure line optimized for a certain environment or usage outperforms the CCP under these specific conditions.

There is no reason to believe that the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] selection will work in the desired direction for desired traits such as baking quality.

[[Common bunt|Common Bunt]] is a seed borne disease in wheat. In conventional farming it is controlled by fungicide treatment of seeds. In organic farming seeds can be cleaned by brushing before sowing, but it is also desirable that plants have genetic resistance. A CCP, including crosses of resistant cultivars, was grown with heavy common bunt infection for 5 years and it appeared to get more resistant, but the common bunt's virulence appeared to change at least as fast. The overall result was that infection levels went up.&lt;ref name=BORGEN1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrologica.dk/publikationer/Populations_Vingsted2015.pdf|title=Improving quality and health in diverse populations of wheat|last=Borgen|first=Anders|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic resource ==

CCPs can be a valuable resource of genetic material. They can be used to preserve valuable genetic diversity for future use, or as base for new breading programs. Promising plants can be selected and multiplied, generating new varieties.&lt;ref name=GENEPOOL&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-agricultural-science/article/morphological-diversity-in-a-barley-composite-cross-derived-population-evolved-under-low-input-conditions-and-its-relationship-with-molecular-diversity-indications-for-breeding/42D1BDE0B1DEF438C1EF9E485D0585F3|title=Morphological diversity in a barley composite cross-derived population evolved under low-input conditions and its relationship with molecular diversity: indications for breeding
|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EU Seed Law ==

It is legal under EU law to sell and buy seeds from a composite cross population as an experiment in the period 1 March 2014 to 31 December 2018.&lt;ref name=EULAW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014D0150|title=COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION of 18 March 2014 on the organisation of a temporary experiment providing for certain derogations for the marketing of populations of the plant species wheat, barley, oats and maize pursuant to Council Directive 66/402/EEC

'''Conventionally grown''' is an [[agriculture]] term referring to a method of growing edible [[plant]]s (such as [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s) and other products. It is opposite to [[organically grown|organic growing methods]] which attempt to produce without synthetic chemicals ([[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, [[hormone]]s) or genetically modified organisms. Conventionally grown products, meanwhile, often use fertilizers and pesticides which allow for higher [[Crop yield|yield]], out of [[season]] growth, greater resistance, greater longevity and a generally greater mass.Conventionally grown fruit: PLU code consists of 4 numbers (e.g. 4012).
Organically grown fruit: PLU code consists of 5 numbers and begins with 9 (e.g. 94012)
Genetically engineered fruit: PLU code consists of 5 numbers and begins with 8 (e.g. 84012).

The '''cross-entropy''' ('''CE''') '''method''' is a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] method for [[importance sampling]] and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. It is applicable to both [[Combinatorial optimization|combinatorial]] and [[Continuous optimization|continuous]] problems, with either a static or noisy objective.

The method approximates the optimal importance sampling estimator by repeating two phases&lt;ref&gt; Rubinstein, R.Y. and  Kroese, D.P. (2004), The Cross-Entropy Method: A Unified Approach to Combinatorial Optimization, Monte-Carlo Simulation, and Machine Learning, Springer-Verlag, New York {{ISBN|978-0-387-21240-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;:

#Draw a sample from a probability distribution.
#Minimize the [[cross entropy|''cross-entropy'']] between this distribution and a target distribution to produce a better sample in the next iteration.

[[Reuven Rubinstein]] developed the method in the context of ''rare event simulation'', where tiny probabilities must be estimated, for example in network reliability analysis, queueing models, or performance analysis of telecommunication systems. The method has also been applied to the [[traveling salesman problem|traveling salesman]], [[quadratic assignment problem|quadratic assignment]], [[Sequence alignment|DNA sequence alignment]], [[Maxcut|max-cut]] and buffer allocation problems.

==Estimation via importance sampling==
Consider the general problem of estimating the quantity 

&lt;math&gt;\ell = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{u}}[H(\mathbf{X})] = \int H(\mathbf{x})\, f(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{u})\, \textrm{d}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is some ''performance function'' and &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt; is a member of some [[parametric family]] of distributions. Using [[importance sampling]] this quantity can be estimated as 

&lt;math&gt;\hat{\ell} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N H(\mathbf{X}_i) \frac{f(\mathbf{X}_i; \mathbf{u})}{g(\mathbf{X}_i)}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}_1,\dots,\mathbf{X}_N&lt;/math&gt; is a random sample from &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;. For positive &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the theoretically ''optimal'' importance sampling [[probability density function|density]] (PDF) is given by 

&lt;math&gt; g^*(\mathbf{x}) = H(\mathbf{x}) f(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u})/\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

This, however, depends on the unknown &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;. The CE method aims to approximate the optimal PDF by adaptively selecting members of the parametric family that are closest (in the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence|Kullback–Leibler]] sense) to the optimal PDF &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt;.

==Generic CE algorithm==
# Choose initial parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;; set t = 1.
# Generate a random sample &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}_1,\dots,\mathbf{X}_N&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot;\mathbf{v}^{(t-1)})&lt;/math&gt;
# Solve for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}^{(t)} = \mathop{\textrm{argmax}}_{\mathbf{u}} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N H(\mathbf{X}_i)\frac{f(\mathbf{X}_i;\mathbf{u})}{f(\mathbf{X}_i;\mathbf{v}^{(t-1)})} \log f(\mathbf{X}_i;\mathbf{v}^{(t-1)})&lt;/math&gt;
# If convergence is reached then '''stop'''; otherwise, increase t by 1 and reiterate from step 2.

In several cases, the solution to step 3 can be found ''analytically''.  Situations in which this occurs are
* When &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the [[Exponential family|natural exponential family]]
* When &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[discrete space|discrete]] with finite [[Support (mathematics)|support]]
* When &lt;math&gt;H(\mathbf{X}) = \mathrm{I}_{\{\mathbf{x}\in A\}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{X}_i;\mathbf{u}) = f(\mathbf{X}_i;\mathbf{v}^{(t-1)})&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the [[Maximum likelihood|maximum likelihood estimator]] based on those &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}_k \in A&lt;/math&gt;.

== Continuous optimization&amp;mdash;example==
The same CE algorithm can be used for optimization, rather than estimation. 
Suppose the problem is to maximize some function &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for example, 
&lt;math&gt;S(x) = \textrm{e}^{-(x-2)^2} + 0.8\,\textrm{e}^{-(x+2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;. 
To apply CE, one considers first the ''associated stochastic problem'' of estimating
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(S(X)\geq\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;
for a given ''level'' &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;, and parametric family &lt;math&gt;\left\{f(\cdot;\boldsymbol{\theta})\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, for example the 1-dimensional 
[[Gaussian distribution]],
parameterized by its mean &lt;math&gt;\mu_t\,&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t^2&lt;/math&gt; (so &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\mu,\sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; here).
Hence, for a given &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;, the goal is to find &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; so that
&lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{KL}}(\textrm{I}_{\{S(x)\geq\gamma\}}\|f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}})&lt;/math&gt;
is minimized. This is done by solving the sample version (stochastic counterpart) of the KL divergence minimization problem, as in step 3 above.
It turns out that parameters that minimize the stochastic counterpart for this choice of target distribution and
parametric family are the sample mean and sample variance corresponding to the ''elite samples'', which are those samples that have objective function value &lt;math&gt;\geq\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.
The worst of the elite samples is then used as the level parameter for the next iteration.
This yields the following randomized algorithm that happens to coincide with the so-called Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm (EMNA), an [[estimation of distribution algorithm]].

===Pseudo-code===
 // Initialize parameters
 mu:=-6
 sigma2:=100
 t:=0
 maxits:=100
 N:=100
 Ne:=10
 // While maxits not exceeded and not converged
 '''while''' t &lt; maxits and sigma2 &gt; epsilon
   // Obtain N samples from current sampling distribution
   X:=SampleGaussian(mu,sigma2,N)
   // Evaluate objective function at sampled points
   S:=exp(-(X-2)^2) + 0.8 exp(-(X+2)^2)
   // Sort X by objective function values in descending order
   X:=sort(X,S)
   // Update parameters of sampling distribution                  
   mu:=mean(X(1:Ne))
   sigma2:=var(X(1:Ne))
   t:=t+1
 // Return mean of final sampling distribution as solution
 '''return''' mu

'''''Echoes of Life: What Fossil Molecules Reveal about Earth History''''' is a book written by [[Susan M. Gaines]], [[Geoffrey Eglinton]], and Jurgen Rullkotter concerning [[organic chemistry]] and, in particular, the links between the living and the material Earth. It was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2008.

==Synopsis==
''Echoes of Life'' chronicles the history of the discipline of [[organic geochemistry]]. In early experiments, [[Alfred E. Treibs]] identified organic molecules, which he extracted from various samples, as chemically altered [[chlorophyll]].  He explained the chlorophyll as having come from plants that died millions of years ago. Since Treibs' discovery, thousands of [[biomarkers]] (a term coined 25 years after Treibs' discovery) have been identified.&lt;ref name="Alfred Treibs"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaines|Eglinton|Rullkotter|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter one, entitled ''Molecular Informants: A Changing Perspective of Organic Chemistry'', gives a brief overview on the history of organic chemistry and explores the possibilities inherent in the science. It also describes how the authors first became interested in the subject and the work they have done within the field.&lt;ref name="Chapter 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaines|Eglinton|Rullkotter|2008|pp=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter two entitled ''Looking to the Rocks: Molecular Clues to the Origin of Life'' looks at the findings of Sir [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]] and [[Melvin Calvin]] discoveries of organic compounds in petrol and the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to organic molecules during [[photosynthesis]]. Early experiments had shown that organic compounds can form spontaneously under conditions similar to the [[Abiogenesis|pre-biotic]] era of earth.&lt;ref name="Chapter Two" /&gt; These findings led to speculation on the possible discovery on the origins of life. The chapter ends with the authors saying as a precursor to the next chapter
{{quote|If it was hard to resist the mystique and romance of three-billion-year-old rocks that might contain clues to the origin of life on Earth, it was even harder to resist a hunt for signs of life or its precursors on other planets—if only for the thrill of seeing and handling their rocks.&lt;ref name="Chapter Two"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaines|Eglinton|Rullkotter|2008|pp=17–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Murchison-meteorite-ANL.jpg|left|thumbnail|100px|Fragment of the Murchison meteorite]]
Chapter three entitled ''From the Moon to Mars: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life.'' A [[Carbon]]aceous [[Meteorite]] which was found in [[Hungary]] in 1857, which was examined by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] was found to have organic compounds which he believed were [[Extraterrestrial life|Extraterrestrial]] in origin. The book moves on to [[Marcellin Berthelot]] who in 1864 claimed to have found "petroleum-like hydrocarbons" in a meteorite found near [[Orgueil]]. [[Louis Pasteur]] also ran experiments on this meteor and concluded it was sterile and not capable of generating life. The discovery of the [[Murchison meteorite]] also led to the finding of 70 amino acids most of which are not native to earth's biosphere. The authors look into the work done on samples brought back from the [[Apollo program]] missions. Geoffrey Eglinton one of the authors had been given a sample and although he knew there had never been life on the moon they had hoped to find organic compounds. None were found within those samples, which led to disappointment. These findings led the authors to speculate on the possibility of answering the question of whether there has ever been life on [[Mars]] and if future missions will bring back viable samples for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaines|Eglinton|Rullkotter|2008|pp=39–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The book has received positive reviews in specialist scientific journals such as [[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]]&lt;ref name="Russell Shapiro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Russell|date=January 2009|title=Echoes of Life: What Fossil Molecules Reveal about Earth History|journal=Astrobiology|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert,|volume=9|issue=1|pages=138–139|doi=10.1089/ast.2008.0915|url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2008.0915|ref=harv|bibcode=2009AsBio...9..138S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the [[Astrobiology Society of Britain]].&lt;ref name="David K.

'''''Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics''''', published in March 1902, is a work of [[scientific literature]] by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] which is considered to be the foundation of modern [[statistical mechanics]]. Its full title was ''Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, developed with especial reference to the rational foundation of thermodynamics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadamard, Jacques|authorlink=Jacques Hadamard|title=Review of ''Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, Developed with especial Reference to the Rational Foundations of Thermodynamics'' by J.

==Overview==
In this book, Gibbs carefully showed how the laws of [[thermodynamics]] would arise exactly from a generic [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical]] system, if one allowed for a certain natural uncertainty about the state of that system.

The themes of thermodynamic connections to statistical mechanics had been explored in the preceding decades with [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], and [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] together writing thousands of pages on this topic.&lt;ref name="cercignani"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cercignani | first = Carlo | author-link = Carlo Cercignani | title = Ludwig Boltzmann: The Man Who Trusted Atoms | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780198501541}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Gibbs' aims in writing the book was to distill these results into a cohesive and simple picture (Gibbs wrote in 1892 to his colleague [[Lord Rayleigh]], "Just now I am trying to get ready for publication something on thermodynamics from the a priori point of view, or rather on 'statistical mechanics' [...] I do not know that I shall have anything particularly new in substance, but shall be contented if I can so choose my standpoint (as seems to me possible) as to get a simpler view of the subject."&lt;ref name="cercignani"/&gt;). He had been working on this topic for some time, at least as early as 1884 when he produced a paper (now lost except for its abstract) on the topic of statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Gibbs, "On the Fundamental Formula of Statistical Mechanics, with Applications to Astronomy and Thermodynamics." Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, '''33''', 57-58 (1884). Reproduced in ''The Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs, Vol II'' (1906), [https://archive.org/stream/scientificpapers02gibbuoft#page/16/mode/2up pp.&amp;nbsp;16].&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs' book simplified statistical mechanics into a treatise of 207 pages. At the same time, Gibbs fully generalized and expanded statistical mechanics into the form in which it is known today. Gibbs showed how statistical mechanics could be used even to ''extend'' thermodynamics beyond classical thermodynamics, to systems of any number of degrees of freedom (including microscopic systems) and non-[[extensive variable|extensive]] systems.

At the time of the book's writing, the prevailing understanding of nature was purely in classical terms as [[quantum mechanics]] had not yet been conceived; even basic facts taken for granted today (such as the existence of atoms) were still contested among scientists. Gibbs was careful in assuming the least about the nature of physical systems under study, and as a result the principles of statistical mechanics laid down by Gibbs have retained their accuracy (with some changes in detail but not in theme), in spite of the major upheavals of modern physics during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tolman |first=R.

V. Kumaran wrote the following comment regarding ''Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics'':
{{Quotation|... In this, he introduced the now standard concept of ‘ensemble’, which is a collection of a large number of indistinguishable replicas of the system under consideration, which interact with each other, but which are isolated from the rest of the universe. The replicas could be in different microscopic states, as determined by the positions and momenta of the constituent molecules, for example, but the macroscopic state determined by the pressure, temperature and/or other thermodynamic variables are identical. Gibbs argued that the [average of the] properties of the system, averaged over time, is identical to an average over all the members of the ensemble if the ‘ergodic hypothesis’ is valid. The ergodic hypothesis, which states that all the microstates of the system are sampled with equal probability, is applicable to most systems, with the exception of systems such as quenched glasses which are in metastable states. Thus, the ensemble averaging method provides us an easy way to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system, without having to observe it for long periods of time. Gibbs also used this tool to obtain relationships between systems constrained in different ways, for example, to relate the properties of a system at constant volume and energy with those at constant temperature and pressure. Even today, the concept of ensemble is widely used for sampling in computer simulations of the thermodynamic properties of materials, and has subsequently found uses in other fields such as quantum theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kumaran, V.|title=Josiah Willard Gibbs|journal=Resonance|date=July 2007|pages=4–11|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/012/07/0012-0026}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Elizabeth Rosa Landau''' is an American journalist and science communicator. She is the Senior Storyteller at the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

== Education ==
Landau grew up in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]], where she watched [[Carl Sagan]]'s TV series [[Cosmos (television series)|Cosmos.]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/4158/elizabeth-landau/|title=Solar System Exploration: NASA Science|website=Solar System Exploration: NASA Science|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landau earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology at [[Princeton University]] ([[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]) in 2006. As a student, she completed study-abroad programs at [[University of Seville]] and [[Universidad de León]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/oip/announcements/archive/index.xml?id=16304|title=ARCHIVE&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Office of International Programs|last=University|first=Princeton|website=www.princeton.edu|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her return, she became a production intern at [[CNN en Español]] in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She earned a master’s in journalism from [[Columbia University]], where she focused on politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bestpitchievergot.com/elizabeth-landau/|title=Using Images To Pitch Your Story To Journalists - NASA &amp; Former CNN Writer Elizabeth Landau|date=2015-04-01|work=Best Pitch I Ever Got|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FastContact''' is an algorithm for the rapid estimate of contact and binding [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energies]] for [[Protein-protein interaction prediction|protein-protein complex structures]]. It is based on a statistically determined [[solvation|desolvation]] contact potential and [[Coulomb]] [[electrostatic]]s with a distance-dependent [[dielectric constant]]. The application also reports residue contact free energies that rapidly highlight the hotspots of the interaction.

The programme was written in [[Fortran 77]] by Carlos J. Camacho and Chao Zhang at the Department of Computational Biology, [[University of Pittsburgh]], PA.&lt;ref name=fastcontact&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Camacho CJ, Zhang C |title=FastContact: rapid estimate of contact and binding free energies |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=2534–2536 |year=2005 |id= |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bti322 |pmid=15713734}}&lt;/ref&gt; A web server for running FastContact online or downloading the binary was set up by P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4352">'''Fuzzy rules''' are used within [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy logic systems]] to infer an output based on input variables. [[Modus ponens]] and [[modus tollens]] are the most important rules of inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A mathematical introduction to logic|last=B.|first=Enderton, Herbert|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0122384523|edition= 2nd|location=San Diego, Calif.|oclc=45830890}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A modus ponens rule is in the form
:Premise: ''x is A''
:Implication: '''''IF''' x is A '''THEN''' y is B''
:Consequent: ''y is B''

In crisp logic, the premise ''x is A'' can only be true or false. However, in a fuzzy rule, the premise ''x is A'' and the consequent ''y is B'' can be true to a degree, instead of entirely true or entirely false.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncertain rule-based fuzzy logic systems : introduction and new directions|last=1938-|first=Mendel, Jerry M.,|date=2001|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|isbn=978-0130409690|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|oclc=45314121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by representing the linguistic variables ''A'' and ''B'' using [[fuzzy set]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a fuzzy rule, modus ponens is extended to ''generalised modus ponens:.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''

:Premise: ''x is A''*
:Implication: '''''IF''' x is A '''THEN''' y is B''
:Consequent: ''y is B''*

The key difference is that the premise ''x is A'' can be only partially true. As a result, the consequent ''y is B'' is also partially true. Truth is represented as a [[real number]] between 0 and 1, where 0 is false and 1 is true.

== Comparison between Boolean and fuzzy logic rules ==
As an example, consider a rule used to control a three-speed fan. A binary IF-THEN statement may be

:'''IF'''   ''temperature'' &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; ''30''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is 3''

The disadvantage of this rule is that it uses a strict temperature as a threshold, but the user may want the fan to still function at this speed when temperature = 29.9. A fuzzy IF-THEN statement may be
:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

where ''hot'' and ''fast'' are described using [[fuzzy set]]s.

== Fuzzy rule connectors ==
Rules can connect multiple variables through [[fuzzy set operations]] using [[t-norm]]s and [[T-norm|t-conorms]].

'''T-norms''' are used as an ''AND'' connector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin Larsen|first=P.|date=1980|title=Industrial applications of fuzzy logic control|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020737380800502|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|volume=12|issue=1|pages=3–10|doi=10.1016/s0020-7373(80)80050-2|issn=0020-7373|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mamdani|first=E.H.|date=1974|title=Application of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plant|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers|volume=121|issue=12|pages=1585|doi=10.1049/piee.1974.0328|issn=0020-3270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fuzzy Set Theory - and Its Applications|last=H.-J.|first=Zimmermann,|date=1991|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401579490|edition= Second, revised|location=Dordrecht|oclc=851369348}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot '''AND''' humidity is high''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

A degree of truth is assigned to ''temperature is hot'' and to ''humidity is high.'' The result of a t-norm operation on these two degrees is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is fast''.

'''T-conorms''' are used as an ''OR'' connector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot '''OR''' humidity is high''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

The result of a t-conorm operation on these two degrees is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is fast''.

The [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a fuzzy set is used as a negator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is '''NOT''' hot''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is slow''

The fuzzy set ''not hot'' is the complement of ''hot.'' The degree of truth assigned to ''temperature is not hot'' is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is slow''.

T-conorms are less commonly used as rules can be represented by ''AND'' and ''OR'' connectors exclusively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2925">'''Georges Vigarello''' (born 16 June 1941) is a French [[historian]] and [[sociologist]]. He is a Research Director at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] (EHESS) of [[Paris]]. His main research interests include the [[sociology of the body]], the history of [[hygiene]], representations of the body over the centuries, and the social dimensions of [[sport]].

==Background==
Born in [[Monaco]], Georges Vigarello initially obtained a teaching diploma (''CAPES'') in Sport and Physical Education, and subsequently gained an advanced teaching degree (''agrégation'') in [[philosophy]].

He briefly taught at the [[Paris 8 University|Paris Vincennes University]], then the stronghold of [[post-structuralism]]. The influence of prominent philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] is particularly visible in his first book ''Le corps redressé'' (1978). Vigarello soon developed a personal, more historically rigurous approach to the sociology of the body.

Before entering the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|EHESS]], he held the position of Professor of Educational Studies at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]]. He has served as a junior member of the Institut Universitaire de France (a French national agency for advanced academic research), and currently chairs the Scientific Committee of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|French National Library]].

The paperback edition of his books (as well as the many translations) made him known to a wider French and international audience.

He is best known for his work at [[Blohm &amp; Voss (aircraft)|Blohm &amp; Voss]], where he worked as Head of New Projects under Chief Designer [[Richard Vogt (aircraft designer)|Richard Vogt]] during the World War II era. After the war, he moved the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]], where he worked on a variety of projects.

==Early years==
Hans Amtmann was born in Sande, on the outskirts of [[Bergedorf]], near [[Hamburg]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]], in October 1906. He was the second of two brothers. From the age of nine he was educated at the Hansa School. During this time he learned to play the violin, before moving on to study naval architecture at the State Technical College in [[Hamburg]]. In his final term he took a course in aeronautics.&lt;ref name="paperclips"&gt;Amtmann (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

==German aeroplane designer==

After only one month working as a naval architect, Amtmann was offered a position as an aircraft designer at [[Junkers]] in [[Dessau]]. He worked on the wings of the [[Junkers G 38|G 38]] and [[Junkers Ju 52|Ju 52]] all-metal transports, and on [[in-flight refuelling]], [[rocket-assisted take-off]] and preliminary design work. There he also met [[Hermann Pohlmann]], who would go on to design the famous [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' or dive-bomber before eventually becoming Amtmann's superior in another company.

In 1933 Amtmann moved to [[Heinkel]] at [[Warnemünde]] on the shores of the [[Baltic sea]], where he worked on the fuselage of the [[Heinkel He 70|He 70]] transport before becoming involved once again on new project work.

Wanting to return to Hamburg, Amtmann obtained a position as an aircraft designer at the newly established [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau]], under the design leadership of [[Richard Vogt (aircraft designer)|Richard Vogt]].&lt;ref&gt;William Green; ''Warplanes of the Third Reich'', Fourth impression, Macdonald and Jane's, 1979, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He started work there as one of Vogt's first recruits, early in 1934, and was soon appointed Head of Preliminary Design. He would remain there, working on Vogt's great range of unconventional and ingenious ideas, throughout its official renaming as a subsidiary of [[Blohm &amp; Voss]] shipbuilders, until it was shut down at the end of World War II in 1945. Due to the workload on Vogt, Amtmann's old colleague Pohlmann would later also join B&amp;V as Deputy Chief Designer, so becoming his immediate superior.

He married Margret, whom he had known since his days as a naval architect, on 10 October 1934. They had four children; three boys and a girl.

In 1941 he was awarded the [[War Merit Cross]] for his outstanding aircraft work.&lt;ref&gt;Amtmann (1988), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amtmann was subsequently appointed project engineer for the proposed [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 237]] ''stuka'' or dive-bomber attack aircraft, which had been personally approved by Hitler, but the order was obstructed by others and the work delayed until the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;Amtmann (1988), pp. 55, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; He also took over and led the design of the [[Blohm &amp; Voss P 200|P 200]] transatlantic passenger flying boat project for [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]], with the intention of building it when the war was over.&lt;ref&gt;Amtmann (1998) Pt.1, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 40|BV 40]] interceptor glider, flown in prototype form, gave him experience of the prone pilot position, which would help his later career.

Immediately after the factory was shut down at the end of hostilities, B&amp;V kept a core design team together in rented rooms at a museum. But money soon ran out and Amtmann took a teaching job.

==American "paperclip"==
in October 1946 Amtmann left his teaching job, having been recruited under the American [[Operation Paperclip]] to work in the US. Vogt would also be recruited, but Pohlmann would stay behind and later help to resurrect the Hamburger Flugzeugbau. Amtmann was sent to [[Wright Field]], where he resumed work on a prone pilot bed, working for the biomedical facility under H. T. E. "Ed" Hertzberg.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Dempsey; ''50 Years Of Research On Man In Flight'', US Air Force, 1988.[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA189875] (retrieved 18 February 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Amtmann developed a patent control system for the pilot and the bed was test flown in a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bomber and later in a [[Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed F-80E Shooting Star]] jet fighter. During this work he also developed a protective shield for the pilot's helmet during emergency ejection which was widely adopted. Another invention was a flying fuel tank system in which the fuel tank glider was attached to the wing tips in parasite configuration. By a coincidence his erstwhile Chief, Richard Vogt, was also at Wright Field and came up with the same idea, beating Amtmann to the patent office.

His family were eventually allowed to come over from Germany and join him early in 1948. But he did not become a legal immigrant until 1 January 1949. The paperwork had to be carried out at a border crossing, so the "Operation Paperclip" migrants were taken in batches, under military escort, across the Canadian border at [[Niagara Falls]] and then walked back over the bridge into the US, where they signed their immigration papers. He signed US citizenship papers in March. He escorted the rest of his family on the same exercise several months later and they received their papers in 1950.

Amtmann left US Government employment in 1951, to work for [[Consolidated Vultee]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]], back in his old role of preliminary design. He worked on the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] ICBM system. Following a company separation or aero and missile divisions, under the new company name of [[Convair]] he developed the [[Convair P6Y|P6Y]] flying boat for the US Navy, but they withdrew the requirement. He was also involved in the Convair series of supersonic delta-winged jets, proposing his own design for a four-engined seaplane similar to, but larger than, the [[Convair F2Y Sea Dart]].

Made redundant in 1961, he joined [[General Atomic]] and worked on the [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion]] space propulsion system, which proposed using a controlled sequence of nuclear explosions to propel the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="paperclips"/&gt; He also worked on atomic-powered gas turbines.&lt;ref&gt;Colin F. McDonald, John C. Bass &amp; Hans H. Amtmann; ''Primary System Design Studies for Advanced Direct Cycle Nuclear Gas Turbine Plant'', AMSE, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to a small company working on [[nuclear fusion]] power in 1980, until the company closed in 1984.

==Retirement and death==
Amtmann retired in 1984, following closure of the nuclear fusion company.

During his time in California he had joined a small orchestra in which he once again played the violin.

He wrote up his memoirs which were published in 1988 as ''The Vanishing Paperclips: America's Aerospace Secret – a Personal Account''.

He appeared in the 1995 TV film documentary ''The Last Days of World War II''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0025453/ Hans Amtmann], IMDb (retrieved 18 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Amtmann died at the age of 100, on 20 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/hans-h-amtmann/87396800 Hans H Amtmann (1906 - 2007)], Ancientfaces. (retrieved 18 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Bischoff''' (30 November 1889 &amp;ndash; 18 March 1960) was a [[Germany|German]] [[entomologist]] from [[Berlin]].

He was Kustos or curator of [[Hymenoptera]] (and [[Neuroptera|Neuropterida]]) at [[Museum für Naturkunde|Museum für Naturkunde (Berlin)]] from 1921 until 1955.

He ventured to Italy to obtain ants in order to return them to Germany's museum.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}

A '''housing development''' is a structured [[real estate development]] of residential buildings.  Popular throughout the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], they are often areas of high-density, low-impact residences of [[single-family detached home]]s, and often allow for separate ownership of each [[housing unit]], for example through [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]. A housing development is "often erected on a tract of land by one builder and controlled by one management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=dictionary.com|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/housing-development|title=housing development|accessdate=Sep 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different housing types. All of which housing developers can choose to develop. They can range from Single Detached, Duplex, Triplex, Multiplex/Big House, Side Attached, Stacked Rowhouse, Small Apartment, Low-rise Apartment, Mid-rise Apartment, Apartment over Commercial, High-Rise Apartment.&lt;ref name=corridor&gt;http://www.corridordevelopment.org/pdfs/Housing%20Types/Housing_Types_Sheets.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the different housing types will have their distinctive characteristics, density ranges, number of units, and floors.&lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

==  Housing Types ==
=== Single Detached ===
This type of housing will be detached from other housing types. This type of unit houses lower densities. Lawns are an option for this kind of design, with distinctive public and private spaces. A single detached can have up to three floors. Some of the common names for a singled detached housing type is "House, Cottage, Villa, Bungalow"&lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

=== Duplex, Triplex ===
This type of housing can have two or three dwelling units in a detached building. The units could be together or separate depending on the location of the duplex. A duplex will also have an option for a yard in order to keep their private space. This type of housing will allow for higher density housing compared to the single detached units. Duplex, and Triplex can account for 2-3 units, and have up to 3 floors. Some of the common names for Duplex, Triplex are "Semi-detached, Double House, Accessory unity, Ancillary unit, Carriage unit, Twin Home." &lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

=== Big house, Multiplex ===
Big house, Multiplex can come in many forms, it can have a single or muli-level unit. Just like the duplex, it can have multiple floors, up to 3 floors. It can account for up to 5 units as well. This type of housing will have a higher density than single detached housing. Some of the common names for the big house, multiplex are Quadruplex, Mansion townhomes, back to back semi-detached, Grand house &lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

Weart]], the Center's director, who notably wrote
:"the conference proceedings would be a fine addition to the collections of our Niels Bohr Library."&lt;/ref&gt; Its location has since rotated between Russia, US, Europe, and Asia. It was held in India for the first time in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Our dream is a small fusion power generator in each house |author= |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-04/interviews/28358904_1_cold-fusion-hydrogen-and-nickel-scientists |newspaper=Times of India |date=4 February 2011 |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conferences have been criticized as events which attract "crackpots" and "pseudo-scientists".&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt; However, preserving the conference documents has been said, in 2004, to be a task worth supporting, because the documents "reflect evolution of a unique scientific controversy," especially for [[historians of science]].&lt;ref name="Kowalski"/&gt;

==Reception==

The First Annual Conference on Cold Fusion was held in March 1990 in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], [[United States]]. [[Robert L. Park]] of the [[American Physical Society]] derisively referred to it as a "seance of true believers."&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the "true believers" quote, see also a 1990 interview of [[Robert L. Park]]: {{cite AV media |year=1990 |title=Media Coverage of ICCF1 1/6 (Local Salt Lake City, Utah news stations covered the First International Conference on Cold Fusion (ICCF1) from March 26-31, 1990.) |medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y6kfXmV1k8 |accessdate=June 22, 2013 |time=6:45 |location=Salt Lake City, Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was attended by more than 200 researchers from the United States, Italy, Japan, India and Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Cold-Fusion Faithful Still Fan the Flames of Research |author=Thomas H.

The Third International Conference on Cold Fusion was held in 1992 in [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]]. It was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', "depending on one's point of view" as "either a turning point in which evidence was presented that will convince the skeptics that cold fusion exists or a religious revival where claims of miracles were lapped up by ardent believers."&lt;ref name="nyt-10-06-13"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cold Fusion, Derided in U.S., Is Hot In Japan |author=Andrew J. Pollack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/17/science/cold-fusion-derided-in-us-is-hot-in-japan.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |newspaper=New York Times |date=17 November 1992 |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was sponsored by seven Japanese scientific societies, it was attended by 200 Japanese scientists and more than 100 from abroad. Tomohiro Taniguchi, then director of the Electric Power Technology Division at Japan's [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]], reportedly said that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry was willing to finance research in the field in view of "encouraging evidence, especially after the conference."&lt;ref name="nyt-10-06-13"/&gt; The conference was also covered by the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At International Conference, Debate Continues Over Cold Fusion Claims |first=Seth |last=Sutel |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1992/At-International-Conference-Debate-Continues-Over-Cold-Fusion-Claims/id-c744ca026bd4d0b22a18a1a215f3a21d |newspaper=Associated Press |date=October 26, 1992 |accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A journalist for the ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine attended the 1998 conference in Vancouver—apparently the only mainstream journalist who attended—and reported that he found there "about 200 extremely conventional-looking scientists, almost all of them male and over 50" with some apparently over 70. He then inferred that "[the] younger ones had bailed years ago, fearing career damage from the cold fusion stigma." He reported seeing "highly technical presentations" and "was amazed by the quantity of the work, its quality, and the credentials of the people pursuing it", whereas "[a] few obvious pseudoscientists, promoting their ideas in an adjoining room used for poster sessions, were politely ignored."&lt;ref name="wired1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Platt |first1=Charles |date=November 1998 |title=What If Cold Fusion Is Real? |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |volume= |issue=6.11 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.11/coldfusion.html |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1999, attendance by researchers at the ICCF meetings drew comment from the field of [[science studies]]. Although scientific debate over cold fusion had effectively ended in 1990, attendance at the ICCF meetings for the next 8 years had been relatively stable at between 100 and 300. Sociologist Bart Simon of [[Concordia University]] described the state of the field as "undead", and considered that the conference evidenced that "as far as normal science is concerned, [cold fusion] is of interest to crackpots, pseudo-scientists, frauds and a few sociologists of science".&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt;

[[David Goodstein]] has written that although an ICCF event had "all the trappings of a normal scientific meeting", it was in fact "no normal scientific conference" since "cold fusion was a pariah field, cast out by the scientific establishment". It was an environment, he added, "...in which crackpots flourished, and this made matters worse for those who were at least willing to entertain the notion that there might have been some serious science going on."&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=78EEJoEaXuwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA69 |title=On Fact and Fraud: Cautionary Tales from the Front Lines of Science |first=David |last=Goodstein |chapter=Chapter 5: The Cold Fusion Chronicles |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |pages=69–96 |ISBN=1400834570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==

The conference is organized by The International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science.  Conference attendees include "a mix of professional scientists, along with retired, semi-retired and amateur scientists, engineers and technicians, and a number of entrepreneurs, inventors, and interested lay people."&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt;

==Preservation of the conference proceedings==

The conference proceedings have been said to be worth preserving because they "reflect evolution of a unique scientific controversy," as "[cold fusion] will be part of the history of physics, no matter what conclusions are reached about the validity of its claims."&lt;ref name="Kowalski"/&gt;

As of 2004, the conference proceedings from 1990 to 2003 were said to be unavailable in most research libraries, "probably because [cold fusion research] is not recognized as scientific." No library could be located that had the proceedings for all ten conferences, although "many university libraries [had] proceedings for one or a few of the conferences."&lt;ref name="Kowalski"/&gt;

'''''Isthmura naucampatepetl''''' (until recently, ''Pseudoeurycea naucampatepetl''; common name: '''Cofre de Perote salamander''') is a species of [[salamander]]s in the family [[Plethodontidae]]. It is [[endemic]] to the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] in central [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]], where it is known from between [[Cofre de Perote]] and Cerro Volcancillo,&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt; a satellite peak of Cofre de Perote.&lt;ref name="Parra-Olea et al. 2001"/&gt; Despite thorough surveys, it has not been observed for a long period and is feared [[extinct]]. Its demise is attributed to [[habitat loss]] and degradation.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''naucampatepetl'' is [[Nahuatl]] name for Cofre de Perote.&lt;ref name="Parra-Olea et al. 2001"/&gt;

==Description==
Adult males measure {{convert|68|-|82|mm|abbr=on}} and females up to {{convert|83|mm|abbr=on}} in snout–vent length (SVL). The tail is slender and shorter than SVL; it tapers gradually but has a blunt tip. The body is moderately robust. The head is prominent and the eyes are large and relatively protuberant. The snout is large and broadly rounded. The limbs are long and robust. The digits are well developed, and there is no appreciable webbing. The coloration is striking, with solid black background color and with bright pink to pinkish-cream dorsal spots: there is a pair of rounded spots on the back of the head, about the size of the eyeball in diameter, a small mid-dorsal spot in the neck, and a pair of large spots at the level of the forelimbs. These larger spots are followed by 11 pairs of small spots. Finally,there is a conspicuous U-shaped mark behind the hips, pointing backward. The venter is pale gray to dark gray.&lt;ref name="Parra-Olea et al. 2001"/&gt;

==Habitat and conservation==
Its natural [[habitat]] is pine-oak forest at elevations of {{convert|2500|–|3000|m|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]], with plenty of [[Tussock (grass)|bunch grass]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; All specimens in the [[type series]] were found on roadside banks, under a surface layer of moist soil with a somewhat dry outer crust.&lt;ref name="Parra-Olea et al. 2001"/&gt;

This species is known from only six specimens. As of 2016, more than 30 years had passed since it was last seen, despite several surveys, the latest one in 2014. Extensive logging, farming, and expanding human settlements have led to loss of much of the original habitat, and what remains is very degraded. The [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|IUCN SSC]] Amphibian Specialist Group considers ''Isthmura naucampatepetl'' possibly extinct.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

'''Legrand G. Capers''' (April 16, 1834 – December 2, 1877) was an American physician, best known for his 1874 spurious [[case report]] of bullet-mediated [[pregnancy|impregnation]] of a young woman.

==Biography==
Legrand Guerry Capers, Jr. was born on April 16, 1834 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], as the son of the merchant LeGrand G. Capers (1808–1868) and his first wife, Abigail Swift (1810–1846).&lt;ref&gt;Pedigree of the Capers family p. 287 (1908) [https://archive.org/stream/pedigreeofcapers00cape#page/286/mode/2up link]&lt;/ref&gt; LeGrand G. Capers, Sr. served on Gen. [[William J. Worth|Worth's]] staff during the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sc.edu/library/socar/uscs/2000/visual.html&lt;/ref&gt;

LeGrand G. Capers, Jr. studied medicine as the assistant to his brother-in-law, [[Ebenezer Swift]],&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Crimmons: Experiences of an Army Surgeon at Fort Chadbourne. ''The Cyclone'' IX, 1, pp.3-5 (2002) [http://swco.ttu.edu/WestTexas/indexes/CycloneFebruary%2002.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from [[Jefferson Medical College]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson University - A chronological history and alumni directory, 1824-1990 [http://jdc.jefferson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=wagner1 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Later he practised as ship physician on [[Cornelius Vanderbilt|Vanderbilt's]] steamers.

When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Capers participated in the foundation of the Confederate Medical Department in Alabama. On July 19, 1861 he became assistant surgeon in the [[4th Georgia Volunteer Infantry]].&lt;ref&gt;ROSTER OF FIELD STAFF AND BAND *21st REGIMENT GEORGIA VOLUNTEER INFANTRY {{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/scar_civilwar/21stGARoster007.pdf |title=PDF |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028043930/http://www.geocities.com/scar_civilwar/21stGARoster007.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 1863 he was promoted to chief surgeon in [[Wilfred E. Cutshaw|Cutshaw's]] battalion.&lt;ref name=breeden&gt;James O. Breeden. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1987353 "The Case of the Miraculous Bullet" Revisited]. ''Military Affairs'' 45, 1, ss. 23-26 (1981) {{PMID|11614961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After armistice, Capers moved to [[New Orleans]] and became demonstrator of anatomy in [[New Orleans School of Medicine]]. He fell ill in October 1877 and died shortly after from [[tuberculosis]] on December 2. He is buried in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].&lt;ref name=breeden/&gt; Obituaries appeared in the ''Transactions of the Mississippi State Medical Association''&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the Mississippi State Medical Association (1879) pp. 164-165&lt;/ref&gt; and ''American Medical Weekly''.&lt;ref&gt;Death of Dr. L. G. Capers. ''American Medical Weekly'' 8-9, p. 13 (1878)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Bullet pregnancy"==
The infamous case of "bullet pregnancy" was published in 1874 in The American Medical Weekly. Capers claimed that he witnessed this case eleven years before, while serving in the Confederate army:&lt;ref&gt;Capers LG. Attention Gynaecologists! — Notes from the Diary of a Field and Hospital Surgeon, C. S. A. American Medical Weekly 1, pp. 233-34 (1874)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the 12th day of May, 1863, the battle of R. was fought. [...] Our men were fighting nobly, but pressed by superior numbers, had gradually fallen back to within one hundred and fifty yards of the house. My position being near my regiment, suddenly I beheld a noble, gallant young friend staggering closer, and then fall to the earth. In the same moment a piercing scream from the house reached my ear! I was soon by the side of the young man, and, upon examination, found a compound fracture, with extensive comminution of the left tibia; the ball having ricochetted from these parts, and, in its onward flight, passed through the scrotum, carrying away the left testicle. Scarcely had I finished dressing the wounds of this poor fellow, when the estimable matron came running to me in the greatest distress, begging me to go to one of her daughters, who, she informed me, had been badly wounded a few minutes before. Hastening to the house, I found that the eldest of the young ladies had indeed received a most serious wound. A [[minnie ball]] had penetrated the left abdominal parietes, about midway between the umbilicus and anterior spinal process of the ilium, and was lost in the abdominal cavity, leaving a ragged wound behind. Believing there was little or no hope of her recovery, I had only time to prescribe an [[anodyne]], when our army fell back, leaving both field and village in the hands of the enemy. [...] About six months after her recovery, the movements of our army brought me again to the village of R., and I was again sent for to see the young lady. She appeared in excellent health and spirits, but her abdomen had become enormously enlarged, so much so as to resemble pregnancy at the seventh or eighth month. Indeed, had I not known the family and the facts of the abdominal wound, I should have so pronounced the case. Under the above circumstances, I failed to give a positive diagnosis, determining to keep the case under surveillance. [...] Just two hundred and seventy-eight days from the date of the receipt of the wound by the minnie ball, I delivered this same young lady of a fine boy, weighing eight pounds. [...] About three weeks from the date of this remarkable birth, I was called to see the child, the grandmother insisting there was "something wrong about the genitals." Examination revealed an enlarged, swollen, sensitive scrotum, containing on the right side a hard, roughened substance, evidently foreign. I decided upon operating for its removal at once, and in so doing, extracted from the scrotum a minnie ball, mashed and battered as if it had met in its flight some hard, unyielding substance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An editor's note in a subsequent issue of the journal revealed the case to be a joke:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bullet Pregnancy |url = http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/bullet.asp |publisher = Snopes.com |accessdate = 27 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
DR. L.G. CAPERS, of Vicksburg, Miss., disclaims responsibility for the truth of that remarkable case of impregnation by a minnie ball, as reported in No. 19 of this Journal. He tells the story as it was told to him. He does not say it is untrue, but is disposed to appositely remember the truth of the old adage, that "accidents may happen in the best regulated families." The joke is, that the Doctor reported the case without any signature, but as the editor is indisposed to be made the victim of canards, and recognized the writing sent, he was unwilling to deprive the author of the contemplated fun, and allowed him to enjoy even more of this than was anticipated. The readers have enjoyed the story much, but not enough "to cut capers" after reading it.

[[File:California-condor.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[California condor]] is one of North America's most endangered birds.]]

This '''list of birds of the United States''' is a comprehensive listing of all the bird species confirmed in the [[United States]] as of July, 2018. It includes species from all 50 states.

The birds of the continental United States most closely resemble those of [[Eurasia]], which was connected to the continent as part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Laurasia]] until around 60 million years ago. Many groups occur throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and worldwide. However some groups unique to the [[New World]] have also arisen; those represented in this list are the [[hummingbird]]s, the [[New World vulture]]s, the [[New World quail]], the [[tyrant flycatcher]]s, the [[vireo]]s, the [[mimid]]s, the [[New World warbler]]s, the [[tanager]]s, the [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]]s, and the [[icterid]]s.

Several common birds in the United States, such as the [[house sparrow]], the [[rock pigeon]], the [[European starling]], and the [[mute swan]] are [[introduced species]], meaning that they are not native to this continent but were brought here by humans. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). In addition, many non-native species which have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America are not on this list. This is especially true of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as [[parrot]]s and [[finch]]es.

The status of one bird on this list, the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]], is controversial. Until 2005 this bird was widely considered to be extinct. In April of that year it was reported that at least one adult male bird had been sighted in the [[Cache River National Wildlife Refuge]] in [[Arkansas]]. This report, however, has not been universally accepted and the American Birding Association still lists the ivory-billed woodpecker as extinct.

&lt;br/&gt;{{horizontal TOC|nonum=YES}}

==Sources and geographic coverage==

This list is derived from the ''Check-list of North American Birds'', 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the [[American Ornithological Society]] (AOS).&lt;ref&gt;American Ornithologists' Union. 1998. ''Check-list of North American Birds''. 7th edition. American Ornithologists' Union, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=59Supp&gt;R. Terry Chesser, Kevin J. Burns, Carla Cicero, Jon L. Dunn, Andrew W. Kratter, Irby J. Lovette, Pamela C. Rasmussen, J. V. Remsen, Jr., Douglas F. Stotz, Benjamin M. Winger, and Kevin Winker. "Fifty-ninth supplement to the American Ornithological Society’s ''Check-list of North American Birds''". ''The Auk'' 2018, vol. 135:798-813 retrieved 16 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The list's geographic territory is the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and the adjacent islands under the jurisdiction of those states.  It does not include the United States' other Pacific Ocean and Caribbean territories or possessions.

==Taxonomy and status==

The taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) used in this list are those of the AOS, the recognized scientific authority on the taxonomy and nomenclature of North American birds. The AOS's Committee on Classification and Nomenclature, the body responsible for maintaining and updating the ''Check-list'', "strongly and unanimously continues to endorse the [[Species problem|biological species concept]] (BSC), in which species are considered to be genetically cohesive groups of populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups".&lt;ref&gt;AOU 1998, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless otherwise noted, the species listed here are considered to occur regularly in the United States as permanent residents, summer or winter residents or visitors, or annual migrants. The following tags are used to designate some species:

*(A) '''[[Vagrancy (biology)|Accidental]]''' - occurrence based on one or two (rarely more) records and unlikely to occur regularly
*(C) '''Casual''' - occurrence based on two or a few records, with subsequent records not improbable
*(E) '''[[Extinction|Extinct]]''' - a recent species that no longer exists
*(Ex) '''[[Local extinction|Extirpated]]''' - a species which no longer occurs in the United States, but other populations still exist elsewhere
*(I) '''[[Introduced species|Introduced]]''' - a species established solely as result of direct or indirect human intervention; synonymous with non-native and non-indigenous
*(EH) '''[[Endemism|Endemic]] to Hawaii''' - a native species found only in Hawaii
*(EM) '''Endemic to the mainland''' - a native species found only in the 48 contiguous states and their adjacent islands (There are no birds endemic to Alaska)

The (A) and (C) tags correspond to the codes 5 and 4 respectively of the [[American Birding Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''The ABA Checklist'' Version 8.0.1 (11/23/17)
http://listing.aba.org/aba-checklist/ retrieved 28 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The (E), (Ex), and (I) tags describe species' status according to the AOS. The (EH) tags follow the AOS list and the (EM) tags are based on the [[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World|Clements taxonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Clements, J. F., T. S. Schulenberg, M. J. Iliff, D. Roberson, T. A. Fredericks, B. L. Sullivan, and C. L. Wood. 2017. The eBird/Clements checklist of birds of the world: v2017. Downloaded from http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/ retrieved 18 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==By the numbers==

This list contains 1114 species. Of them, 140 are tagged as accidental, 101 as casual, and 57 as introduced. Thirty-three are known to be extinct and one, the thick-billed parrot, has been extirpated though a population remains in Mexico. Thirty-three living species are endemic to Hawaii; an additional 28 former Hawaiian endemics are known to be extinct and a few others are thought to be. Fifteen species are endemic to the 48 contiguous states.

==Chachalacas, curassows, and guans==
'''Order''': [[Galliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Cracidae]]

The chachalacas, guans, and curassows are birds in the family Cracidae. These are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas are found in more open scrubby habitats. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colorful facial ornaments.

==Flamingos==
[[File:Caribbean flamingo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|American flamingo]]
'''Order''': [[Phoenicopteriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phoenicopteridae]]

Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|1}} tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.

*[[American flamingo]], ''Phoenicopterus ruber''

==Grebes==
[[File:ClarksGrebe23.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Clark's grebe]]
'''Order''': [[Podicipediformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Podicipedidae]]

Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.

==Sandgrouse==
'''Order''': [[Pteroclidiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Pteroclididae]]

Sandgrouse have small pigeon-like heads and necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and sometimes tails and a fast direct flight. Their legs are feathered down to the toes.

*[[Chestnut-bellied sandgrouse]], ''Pterocles exustus'' (I)

==Pigeons and doves==
[[File:Zenaida macroura -California-8-2c.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Mourning dove]]
'''Order''': [[Columbiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Columbidae]]

Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. They feed on [[seed]]s, [[fruit]], and plants. Unlike most other birds, the doves and pigeons produce "[[crop milk]]," which is secreted by a sloughing of fluid-filled cells from the lining of the [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]. Both sexes produce this highly nutritious substance to feed to the young.

==Swifts==
[[File:ChimneySwift23.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chimney swift]]
'''Order''': [[Apodiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Apodidae]]

The swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.

==Rails, gallinules, and coots==
[[File:KingRail23.jpg|thumb|200px|right|King rail]]
'''Order''': [[Gruiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Rallidae]]

Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.

==Pratincoles==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Glareolidae]]

The pratincoles have short legs, very long pointed wings, and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as [[wader]]s is that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like [[hirundinidae|swallows]], although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding. Their flight is fast and graceful like that of a swallow or a [[tern]], with many twists and turns to pursue their prey.

'''Order''': [[Passeriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Monarchidae]]

The Monarchinae are a relatively recent grouping of a number of seemingly very different birds, mostly from the Southern Hemisphere, which are more closely related than they at first appear. Many of the approximately 140 species making up the family were previously assigned to other groups, largely on the basis of general morphology or behavior. With the new insights generated by the DNA-DNA hybridisation studies of Sibley and his co-workers toward the end of the 20th century, however, it became clear that these apparently unrelated birds were all descended from a common ancestor. The Monarchinae are small to medium-sized insectivorous passerines, many of which hunt by flycatching. These three species endemic to Hawaii represent the group.

The magnetic flux, represented by the symbol {{math|'''Φ'''}}, threading some contour or loop is defined as the magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}} multiplied by the loop area {{math|'''S'''}}, i.e. {{math|1='''Φ''' = '''B''' ⋅ '''S'''}}. Both {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''S'''}} can be arbitrary and so is {{math|'''Φ'''}}. However, if one deals with the superconducting loop or a hole in a bulk [[superconductor]], it turns out that the magnetic flux threading such a hole/loop is quantized.
The (superconducting) '''magnetic flux quantum''' {{math|1=Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''/(2''e'') ≈ {{physconst|Phi0|ref=no}}}}{{physconst|Phi0|ref=only}} is a combination of fundamental physical constants: the [[Planck constant]] {{math|''h''}} and the [[electron charge]] {{math|''e''}}. Its value is, therefore, the same for any [[superconductor]].
The phenomenon of flux quantization was discovered experimentally by B. S. Deaver and W. M. Fairbank&lt;ref name=Deaver:1961:FluxQuantum /&gt; and, independently, by R. Doll and M. Näbauer,&lt;ref name=Doll:1961:FluxQuantum /&gt; in 1961. The quantization of magnetic flux is closely related to the [[Little–Parks effect]], but was predicted earlier by [[Fritz London]] in 1948 using a [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological model]].

The inverse of the flux quantum, {{math|1/Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is called the '''Josephson constant''', and is denoted {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It is the constant of proportionality of the [[Josephson effect]], relating the [[potential difference]] across a Josephson junction to the [[frequency]] of the irradiation. {{anchor|KJ-1990}}The Josephson effect is very widely used to provide a standard for high-precision measurements of potential difference, which (since 1990) have been related to a fixed, [[conventional electrical unit|conventional value]] of the Josephson constant, denoted {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;J-90&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

==Introduction==
The superconducting properties in each point of the [[superconductor]] are described by the ''complex'' quantum mechanical wave function {{math|Ψ('''r''',''t'')}} — the superconducting order parameter. As any complex function {{math|Ψ}} can be written as {{math|1=Ψ = Ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the amplitude and {{math|''θ''}} is the phase. Changing the phase {{math|''θ''}} by {{math|2π''n''}} will not change {{math|Ψ}} and, correspondingly, will not change any physical properties. However, in the superconductor of non-trivial topology, e.g. superconductor with the hole or superconducting loop/cylinder, the phase {{math|''θ''}} may continuously change from some value {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to the value {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + 2π''n''}} as one goes around the hole/loop and comes to the same starting point. If this is so, then one has {{math|''n''}} magnetic flux quanta trapped in the hole/loop.

Due to [[Meissner effect]], the magnetic induction {{math|'''B'''}} inside the superconductor is zero. More exactly, magnetic field {{math|'''H'''}} penetrates into a superconductor over a small distance called [[London penetration depth|London's magnetic field penetration depth]] (denoted {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} and usually {{math|≈ 100 nm}}). The screening currents also flow in this {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}-layer near the surface, creating magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} inside the superconductor, which perfectly compensates the applied field {{math|'''H'''}}, thus resulting in {{math|1='''B''' = 0}} inside the superconductor.

It is important to note that the magnetic flux frozen in a loop/hole (plus its {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}-layer) will always be quantized. However, the value of the flux quantum is equal to {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} only when the path/trajectory around the hole described above can be chosen so that it lays in the superconducting region without screening currents, i.e. several {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} away from the surface. There are geometries where this condition cannot be satisfied, e.g. a loop made of very thin ({{math|≤ ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}) superconducting wire or the cylinder with the similar wall thickness. In the latter case, the flux has a quantum different from {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The flux quantization is a key idea behind a [[SQUID]], which is one of the most sensitive [[magnetometer]]s available.

Flux quantization also plays an important role in the physics of [[type II superconductor]]s. When such a superconductor (now without any holes) is placed in a magnetic field with the strength between the first critical field {{math|'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;c1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the second critical field {{math|'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;c2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the field partially penetrates into the superconductor in a form of [[Abrikosov vortex|Abrikosov vortices]]. The [[Abrikosov vortex]] consists of a normal core—a cylinder of the normal (non-superconducting) phase with a diameter on the order of the {{math|''ξ''}}, the [[superconducting coherence length]]. The normal core plays a role of a hole in the superconducting phase. The magnetic field lines pass along this normal core through the whole sample. The screening currents circulate in the  {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}-vicinity of the core and screen the rest of the superconductor from the magnetic field in the core. In total, each such [[Abrikosov vortex]] carries one quantum of magnetic flux {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Although theoretically, it is possible to have more than one flux quantum per hole, the Abrikosov vortices with {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} are unstable&lt;ref name=EG:AV@MesoSC /&gt; and split into several vortices with {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Monopoles and fractional vortices in chiral superconductors|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2000-03-14|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 15946|pmid = 10716980|pages = 2431–2436|volume = 97|issue = 6|first = G. E.|last = Volovik|arxiv = cond-mat/9911486 |bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.2431V |doi = 10.1073/pnas.97.6.2431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a real hole the states with {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} are stable as the real hole cannot split itself into several smaller holes.

==Measuring the magnetic flux==
The magnetic flux quantum may be measured with great precision by exploiting the [[Josephson effect]]. When coupled with the measurement of the [[von Klitzing constant]] {{math|1=''R''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''/''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, this provides the most precise values of [[Planck's constant]] {{math|''h''}} obtained to date. This is remarkable since {{math|''h''}} is generally associated with the behavior of microscopically small systems, whereas the quantization of magnetic flux in a superconductor and the quantum Hall effect are both [[collective phenomenon|collective phenomena]] associated with [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] large numbers of particles.

Professor '''Maria Forsyth''' is an Alfred Deakin Fellow at the Australian [[Deakin University]] where she holds the Chair in [[Electromaterials]] and [[Corrosion Science]]s. She is a research Professor at the University of the Basque Country. Her research work has applications in both energy storage and in understanding the mechanisms of corrosion.

==Life==
Forsyth gained a first class degree and her doctorate at [[Monash University]].&lt;ref name="basque" /&gt; In 1985 she was the top Australian student chemist and she was awarded the Masson medal. This led to a three year commonwealth scholarship.&lt;ref name="mf"&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://www.electromaterials.edu.au/people-directory/professor-maria-forsyth/|title=Professor Maria Forsyth - Our People - ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science|website=www.electromaterials.edu.au|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1990 [[Fulbright]] funded her postdoctoral Fellowship. The [[Australian Research Council]] funded her fellowship from 2003 for four years and during this time she won the Dean’s Award for Excellence in Research from her university's Engineering department.&lt;ref name=mf/&gt; 

In 2012 she became the Alfred Deakin Professor at Deakin University. She then became  a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2015,&lt;ref name="aas"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.science.org.au/fellowship/fellows/professor-maria-forsyth|title=Professor Maria Forsyth {{!}} Australian Academy of Science|website=www.science.org.au|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; an associate Director of ACES as well as being an Australian Laureate Fellow and the Chair of electromaterials and Corrosion science.&lt;ref name=mf/&gt; Forsyth is a research Professor at the [[University of the Basque Country]] in Spain.&lt;ref name="basque"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ikerbasque.net/en/maria-forsyth|title=Maria Forsyth|date=2018-08-31|work=Ikerbasque Basque Foundation for Science|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2018 her research group was looking at novel metal-air batteries where the electrolytes are unusual. They are able to look at electrochemical processes using [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macro18.org/speakers/invited-speakers/energyoptics-optoelectronics/professor-maria-forsyth/&lt;/ref&gt; She focuses on studying materials which are use for transporting electrical charge both within the electrolyte and at the interface between the electrolyte and the metal. This has applications in both energy storage and in understanding the mechanisms of corrosion.&lt;ref name=mf/&gt; 

The battery systems include combinations which include either sodium or lithium battery systems. The ion transportation has included systems using ionic liquids, polymer electrolytes and plastic crystals. Her group has created a new large rage of organic plastics that have ionic applications.&lt;ref name=aas/&gt;

'''Material flow''' is the description of the transportation of raw materials, pre-fabricates, parts, components, integrated objects and final products as a flow of entities. The term applies mainly to advanced modeling of [[supply chain management]].

As industrial material flow can easily become very complex, several different specialized simulation tools have been developed for complex systems. Typical tools are:
* [[AnyLogic]]
* AutoMod for logistics systems
* [[Plant Simulation]] for production system

They focus on the areas of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as ensuring quality services and prevention of risks to the patients, and members of the public in general. A medical physicist plays a fundamental role in applying physics to medicine, but particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The scientific and technological progress in [[medical physics]] has led to a variety of skills that must be integrated into the role of a medical physicist in order for them to perform their job.

The [[Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine]] (ACPSEM) is the professional body that oversees the education and certification of medical physicists in Australia and New Zealand and has a mission to advance services and professional standards in medical physics and biomedical engineering.

===Europe===

The presence of Medical Physicists at Expert level ('Medical Physics Experts') in healthcare in Europe is required by EC Directive 2013/59/EURATOM. The European Federation of Organizations for Medical Physics (EFOMP) has defined a detailed inventory of learning outcomes for Medical Physics Experts in terms of Knowledge, Skills and Competences (the latter in Europe means 'responsibilities'). In Europe the professional preparation for Medical Physicists consists of a first degree in Physics or equivalent (e.g., biophysics, electrical or mechanical engineering), a Masters in Medical Physics and a 2-year training Residency. For the latest EFOMP policy statement on the role and education and training requirements of the Medical Physicist and Medical Physics Expert go to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.physicamedica.com/article/S1120-1797(14)00103-3/fulltext |title=European Federation of Organisations for Medical Physics (EFOMP) Policy Statement 12.1: Recommendations on Medical Physics Education and Training in Europe 2014|date=1 September 2014|publisher=|journal=Physica Medica|volume=30|issue=6|pages=598–603|doi=10.1016/j.ejmp.2014.06.001|pmid=24954923|vauthors=Caruana CJ, Christofides S, Hartmann GH}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the final version of the EC funded document 'European Guidelines on the Medical Physics Expert' download Report 174 and its annexes from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/publications-medical-exposure|title=Publications on medical exposure - Energy - European Commission|website=Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
From October 2011 as part of the [[Modernising Scientific Careers]] scheme, the route to accreditation as a medical physicist in England and Wales is provided by the Scientist Training Programme (STP). This scheme is a three-year graduate program provided by the [[National School of Healthcare Science]]. Entrants are required to have an undergraduate degree (1:1 or 2:1) in an appropriate physical science prior to this three-year graduate program.

The STP involves a part-time MSc in Medical Physics (provided by either [[King's College London]], [[University of Liverpool]] or [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]]) in addition to practical training within the [[National Health Service]]. Assessment is provided by the completion of competencies and by a final assessment similar to the [[Objective Structured Clinical Examination|OSCE]] undertaken by other clinical staff. Completion of the STP leads to accreditation with the [[Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine]] (IPEM) and registration as a [[Clinical Laboratory Scientist|Clinical Scientist]].

Prior to 2011 the training route in the United Kingdom was administered in two parts, and this scheme is still used in Scotland and Northern Ireland&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/healthcare-science/training/nhs-scientist-training-programme-(stp)/]. NHS Careers Website. Retrieved 2014-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt;). Part I involved limited clinical experience and a full-time MSc in medical physics. Part II involved exclusively clinical experience in which the candidate would produce a portfolio of experience and submitted to the [[Academy for Healthcare Science (United Kingdom)|Academy for Healthcare Science]] which (in addition to a viva) would lead to professional accreditation with IPEM.

===North America===
In [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapm.org/medical_physicist/education.asp How does someone become a Medical Physicist?]. AAPM. Retrieved on 2011-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; medical physics training is offered at the master's, doctorate, post-doctorate and/or residency levels. A [[professional doctorate]] has also been recently introduced as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAMPEP Accredited Professional Doctorate Programs in Medical Physics|url=http://www.campep.org/campeplstdoctorate.asp#VU|website=CAMPEP|publisher=CAMPEP|accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several universities offer these degrees in Canada and the United States as well.

As of October 2013, over 70 universities in North America have medical physics graduate programs or residencies that are accredited by ''The Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs'' (CAMPEP).&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.campep.org/campeplstgrad.asp CAMPEP Accredited Graduate Programs in Medical Physics]. Campep.org (2011-06-01). Retrieved on 2011-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of residencies are therapy, but diagnostic and nuclear have also been on the rise in the past several years.

In the United States, professional certification is obtained from the [[American Board of Radiology]] (for all 4 areas) the American Board of Medical Physics (for MRI), the [[American Board of Science in Nuclear Medicine]] (for Nuc Med and PET).  As of 2012, enrollment in a CAMPEP-accredited residency or graduate program is required to start the ABR certification process.  As of 2013, completion of a CAMPEP-accredited residency is required to advance to part 2 of the ABR certification process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theabr.org/ic/ic_rp/ic_rp_newcampep.html IC RP CAMPEP addendum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128075112/http://theabr.org/ic/ic_rp/ic_rp_newcampep.html |date=2010-11-28 }}. Theabr.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, professional certification is obtained from the [https://www.ccpm.ca Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine]. Since 2016, eligibility requirements for Radiation Oncology Physics certification includes graduation and post-graduate training from a CAMPEP accredited institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccpm.ca/ccpm-english/main/certification/eligibility.html|title=The Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine|website=www.ccpm.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
There are regular regional and international educational medical physics activities. The oldest of these is the International College on Medical Physics at the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP), Trieste, Italy. This College has educated more than 1000 medical physicists from developing countries.

'''Minik Wallace''' (also called '''Minik''' or '''Mene''') (ca. 1890 &amp;ndash; October 29, 1918) was an [[Inuit|Inuk]] brought as a child in 1897 from [[Greenland]] to [[New York City]] with his father and others by the explorer [[Robert Peary]]. The six Inuit were studied by staff of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], which had custody. The adults and one child died soon of [[tuberculosis]] (TB), and one young man was returned to Greenland. After deceiving Minik by a staged burial, the museum put the skeleton of his father on exhibit. Adopted by the museum's building superintendent, William Wallace, Minik did not return to Greenland until after 1910. A few years later, he came back to the United States, where he lived and worked until dying of [[influenza]] in the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 pandemic]].

==Early years==
Minik spent his early childhood in northern Greenland among his people, the [[Inughuit]], the northernmost band of [[Greenlandic Inuit]] ([[Eskimo]]s, as formerly called). He met Robert Peary when the explorer employed men of Minik's band during several [[Arctic]] expeditions.

==The move to the US==
In 1897, Robert Peary brought Qisuk, his son Minik, and four other members of the Northern Greenland band to the American Museum of Natural History in New York.  Although Peary had invited the adults on the trip, it is unlikely they were clearly informed as to its purpose.  Some agreed to travel to see new places; others did not want to be parted from relatives.  Peary had promised that they would be able to return to Greenland.  Soon after their arrival, the group became the objects of study, together with the [[Cape York meteorite]] which Peary had brought.  The museum staff had not made plans for their care, nor for their return.&lt;ref name="harper"&gt;Harper, Kenn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wK2-ONmUk0YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Give Me My Father's Body: The Life of Minik, the New York Eskimo''], New York: Washington Square Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minik's father==
The adult Inuit soon contracted [[tuberculosis]] (TB), a widespread [[Infection|infectious disease]] in those years, which also occurred among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. Three adults and one child died. (Another young adult, the sixth member of the group, survived and was returned to Greenland.) One of the first to die was Minik's father, and the boy suffered. William Wallace, chief curator and superintendent of buildings, adopted the boy and cared for him.  Minik pleaded for a proper burial for his father, with the traditional rites which only he as an Inuk could give. The curatorial staff wanted to preserve Qisuk's body for study, research that would be impossible if his remains were buried. They staged a fake burial for Minik's benefit: filling a coffin with stones for weight, and placing a stuffed "body" covered with a cloth on top. They performed the burial by lantern light, with Minik attending.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt;

The staff sent Qisuk's body to Wallace's estate, which had a workshop for processing the skeletons of specimens.  Qisuk's remains were de-fleshed, and the skeleton was mounted on an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] and returned to the museum for display. Wallace did not tell Minik about this nor of his own part in it. But, about 1906, New York papers published a story that stated Qisuk's skeleton was displayed in the museum. Minik learned through classmates' comments as the story circulated.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt;

Wallace supported Minik in requesting that Qisuk's remains be returned to the son for traditional burial. The museum director, [[Hermon Carey Bumpus]], evaded their requests, as well as other questions about the Inuit exhibits.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt; Bumpus refused to admit the museum had Qisuk's skeleton. In the past, he had accused Wallace of financial irregularities and impropriety, and the curator resigned in 1901. Wallace continued to ask the museum for aid in financially supporting Minik, which Bumpus refused.  The director tried to avoid investigation of the Inuit case.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt; Minik was never able to reclaim his father's bones.

==Return to Greenland==
Minik tried to get Peary to return him to Greenland, and finally Peary and his supporters made the arrangements. Although they told the press they had sent Minik back "laden with gifts", the Canadian author [[Kenn Harper]] found documentation that the Inuit was returned to Greenland with little more than "the clothes on his back."

By that time, Minik had forgotten [[Inuktun]], his first language, and much of [[Inuit culture]] and skills; his life in Greenland was difficult. The Inuit took him back, and taught him the adult skills he needed.  He became a fine hunter. He acted as a guide and translator for visitors, playing a key role in the [[Crocker Land Expedition]] of 1913-1917.  At that time, Minik decided to return to the [[United States]], and did so in 1916.

==Return to the USA==
After his return to the US, Minik worked at a variety of jobs; eventually he found work in a lumber camp in [[North Stratford, New Hampshire]].  His employer, Afton Hall, invited him to live with the Hall family, who treated him much like a son. Along with many of Hall's family and workers, Minik died during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], on 29 October 1918.  He was buried in the [[Indian Stream]] Cemetery in [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]].

==Inuit burial==
In 1986, [[Kenn Harper]] wrote a book about Minik, entitled ''Give Me My Father's Body''.  Convinced that the remains of Qisuk and the three adult Inuit should be returned to Greenland, Harper tried to persuade the Museum of Natural History to do this, as well as working through the "red tape" of the US and Canadian governments.  In 1993, Harper succeeded in having the Inuit remains returned.  In [[Qaanaaq]], he witnessed the Inuit funeral ceremony for the remains of Qisuk and the three tribesmen taken to New York so long ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">The '''National Association of Women Pharmacists''' was founded in [[London]] on 15 June 1905, following discussions between [[Margaret Elizabeth Buchanan]] and [[Isabella Skinner Clarke]], both of whom had joined the [[Register of Chemists and Druggists and Pharmaceutical Chemists]] after passing the requisite examinations but had been prevented from joining the Register of Chemists and Druggists and Pharmaceutical Chemists. Early meetings were held at Clarke's home.  Membership was restricted to those who had passed the major or minor examination and 50 women joined immediately. By 1912 Buchanan claimed that practically all women practicing [[pharmacy]] were members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rayner-Canham|first1=Marlene|last2=Rayner-Canham|first2=Geoffrey|title=Chemistry Was Their Life: Pioneering British Women Chemists, 1880-1949|date=2008|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1860949878|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elsie Hooper (1879-1969) was the first [[secretary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">A '''plastic magnet''' is a non-metallic [[magnet]] made from an [[organic compound|organic]] polymer.  One example is PANiCNQ, which is a combination of emeraldine-based [[polyaniline]] (PANi) and [[tetracyanoquinodimethane]] (TCNQ).  When it was created by [[Pakistan]] born scientist Naveed A. Zaidi and colleagues at the [[University of Durham]] in 2004, it was the first [[magnetic]] [[polymer]] to function at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author1 = Naveed A. Zaidi | author2 = S.R. Giblin | author3 = I. Terry | author4 = A.P. Monkman | year = 2004 | title = Room temperature magnetic order in an organic magnet derived from polyaniline | journal = Polymer | volume = 45 | number= 16 | pages = 5683–5689 | url = https://www.dur.ac.uk/ian.terry/teaching/Level4Projects/Polymer_45_5683.pdf | accessdate = 2012-04-02 | doi=10.1016/j.polymer.2004.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PANi is a [[conductive polymer]] that is stable in air. When combined with the [[free radical]]-forming TCNQ as an acceptor molecule, it can mimic the mechanism of metallic magnets. The magnetic properties arise from the fully [[conjugated system|pi-conjugated]] [[nitrogen]]-containing backbone combined with molecular charge transfer side groups. These properties cause the molecule to have a high density of localized [[spin (physics)|spins]] that can give rise to [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] of their [[magnetic field]]s. When this polymer magnet is synthesized, the polymer chains need 3 months to line up before displaying any notable magnetism.

Plastic magnets could have uses in [[computer hardware]], for example as [[disk storage|disc drives]] and in medical devices such as [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[cochlear implant]]s  where the organic material is more likely to be [[biocompatible]] than its metallic counterpart.

In February 2002, researchers from [[Ohio State University]] &amp; [[University of Utah]] developed the world's first light-tunable plastic magnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author = Pam Frost Gorder | date = Feb 1, 2002 | url = http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/magnetun.htm | publisher = [[Ohio State University]] | title = Researchers Develop World's First Light-tunable 'Plastic' Magnet | accessdate = 2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plastic material became 1.5 times more magnetic when blue light shines on it. Green laser light reversed the effect somewhat, by decreasing the material's magnetism to 60 percent of its normal level. The plastic magnet was made from a polymer made of [[tetracyanoethylene]] (TCNE) combined with [[manganese]] (Mn) [[ion]]s -- atoms of the metal manganese with electrons removed. The magnet functioned up to a temperature of 75 [[Kelvin|K]] (about -200ºC, or -325ºF).

'''REX''' or '''Radio Science Experiment''' is an experiment on the ''[[New Horizons]]'' space probe to determine various aspects of the [[atmosphere of Pluto]] during the 2015 flyby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tyler|first=G.

REX can also take other measurements, and is planned for use with the [[Kuiper belt]] object, [[(486958) 2014 MU69]] flyby on New Year's Day 2019.

==Overview==
To accomplish the objectives, as the spacecraft passes by Pluto, it is targeted on a path that takes it behind the dwarf planet in relation to where Earth is, and at that time radio signals from the flyby spacecraft pass through atmosphere of body, and from this various aspects can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tyler|first=G.

REX hardware weights 160 g (0.16 kg) and consumes 1.6 watts of spacecraft electrical power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tyler|first=G. L.|last2=Linscott|first2=I. R.|last3=Bird|first3=M.

==Extended mission==
REX is also planned for use in the ''New Horizons'' post Pluto extended mission, including the [[(486958) 2014 MU69|MU69]] flyby.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1806/1806.08393.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; REX will be used to take thermal measurements of the Kuiper belt body during the planned flyby.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1806/1806.08393.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; REX is also used to study the amount of electrons in outer space in the [[Kuiper belt]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1806/1806.08393.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; The Kuiper belt is a ring of orbiting bodies between approximately 30 to 55 AU (Earth-Sun distances), home to Pluto and short-period comets it is estimated to consist of hundreds of thousand if not millions of small icy objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/overview/|title=Kuiper Belt|work=Solar System Exploration: NASA Science|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belt was discovered starting in 1992, and can be studied more closely by the ''New Horizons'' mission which is passing through it starting in the late 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/pluto/2018/02/28/the-pis-perspective-why-didnt-voyager-explore-the-kuiper-belt/|title=The PI’s Perspective: Why Didn’t Voyager Explore the Kuiper Belt? – Pluto New Horizons|website=blogs.nasa.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the post Pluto cruise,Rex is usually turned on monthly to measure the electron density of the Solar Wind between Earth and the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/overview/]&lt;/reF&gt; When New Horizons flewby pluto in 2015, it was at about  32.9 AU from the Sun, and about 43.6 AU for the New Year's Day 2019 flyby of Ultima Thule (2014 MU69). &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1509/1509.04660.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Where-is-New-Horizons/index.php|title=New Horizons|website=pluto.jhuapl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing of the 2014 MU69 flyby was adjusted in part to aid the use of the REX experiment, in particular time it so more radar dishes on Earth could be used for this experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2018/0124-new-horizons-prepares-for-2014mu69.html|title=New Horizons prepares for encounter with 2014 MU69|website=www.planetary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data from REX==
Using REX radio occultation data the diameter of Pluto was found to be {{val|2376.6|3.2|u=km}} in a 2017 paper.&lt;ref name="Nimmo2017" /&gt;

The information is provided as a free public service by the DOE [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]] (OSTI), within the [[Office of Science]]. The Science Accelerator uses [[federated search]] technology to search DOE-generated and DOE-related science information databases and collections. Federated search technology allows the information customer to search multiple data sources with a single query in real time. It provides simultaneous access to "[[Deep Web (search indexing)|deep web]]" scientific databases, which are typically not searchable by commercial search engines.

==Content==

Science Accelerator returns results from 12 DOE databases of science information and research results. Users can find:

*Electronic full-text research reports (including DOE scientific and technical information)
*Energy citations (going back to the Manhattan Project era)
*Patents
*Ongoing research project summaries
*DOE accomplishments including Nobel Laureates
*Collections of DOE non-text data
*E-prints (journal article pre-publication drafts and scholarly papers)
*Proceedings and papers from science conferences

See [[Academic databases and search engines]].

==Features and Capabilities==

A basic search and an advanced search are provided. The advanced search allows searching by author, title, and/or date, and/or selecting any of the resources or subsets of those resources. Science Accelerator provides a variety of features and capabilities, including:

*Clustering of results by subtopics or dates to help users target their search
*Wikipedia results related to user search terms
*Eureka Science News results related to user search terms
*RSS service
*Email option for sending results to friends and colleagues
*Enhanced information related to the user's real-time search
*Alerts service
*XML service
*Tag cloud information
*Widget

==History==

Science Accelerator was developed by the Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) and launched in April 2007. Through this initiative, OSTI introduced scalability in federated government search technology. Science Accelerator is the DOE contribution to Science.gov and WorldWideScience.org, and searches 12 DOE databases.

The '''Setzer's mouse-tailed dormouse''' (''Myomimus setzeri'') is a species of [[rodent]] in the family [[Gliridae]]. It is [[endemic]] to [[Iran]]. Very little amounts of information is known about this [[Myomimus]] Family Member, with just only 10 specimens known. It is found mainly in the pellets of the [[Eurasian eagle owl]].&lt;ref name=Aulagnier&gt;Aulagnier S.; P. Haffner, A. J. Mitchell-Jones, F. Moutou &amp; J.

Aldrin]]  standing next to the deployed Solar Wind Composition Experiment during the [[Apollo 11]] mission. The SWC was nicknamed the '[[Flag of Switzerland|Swiss flag]]' experiment.&lt;ref name=Harland&gt;David Harland (2011). ''Apollo 12: On the Ocean of Storms'' (pp. 251-253)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Solar Wind Composition Experiment''' (SWC) was an experiment deployed on the [[moon]] during the [[Apollo program]] ([[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 14|14]], [[Apollo 15|15]] and [[Apollo 16|16]]). The aim was to measure and sample the [[solar wind]] outside the Earth's [[magnetosphere]]. It was the first definitive isotopic measurements of solar material.&lt;ref name = Steiger&gt;R. von Steiger, G. Gloeckler, G.M. Mason (2007). ''The Composition of Matter: Symposium honouring Johannes Geiss on the occasion of his 80th birthday'' (p. 162)&lt;/ref&gt;

The SWC was proposed and designed by a Swiss team headed by Johannes Geiss and Peter Eberhardt of the [[University of Bern]] and Peter Signer of the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=Harland/&gt; It was manufactured by the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] and the University of Bern. The experiment was partially funded by the Swiss Government.

The SWC experiment consisted of a 1 X 4.6-foot sheet of ultra-pure aluminum and platinum metal foils erected on the moon's surface with a telescopic pole. The sheet was to be exposed to the [[Sun]] as to measure the [[ion]] types and energies of the solar wind on the lunar surface. The time exposure was 77 minutes on Apollo 11, 18 h and 42 minutes on Apollo 12, 21 hours on Apollo 14, 41 hours and 8 minutes on Apollo 15, and 45 h and 5 minutes on Apollo 16. At the end of the exposure the foil was detached from the telescopic pole, placed in a [[PTFE|Teflon]] bag, and brought back to Earth for analysis. The experiment was successful and provided accurate He, Ne and Ar isotopic compositions of the solar wind.&lt;ref name = Steiger/&gt;

SpaceIL team was formed as a [[nonprofit organization]] wishing to promote scientific and technological education in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spaceil.com/|title=SpaceIL {{!}} מנחיתים חללית ישראלית ראשונה על הירח|website=www.spaceil.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its total budget is estimated at US$70 million, provided mainly by philanthropists and the [[Israel Space Agency]] (ISA). 

== History ==
[[File:Spacecraft 03.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of ''Sparrow'' on the lunar surface]]
SpaceIL began as part of the [[Google Lunar X Prize]], which offered $30m (£23m) in prizes to inspire people to develop low-cost methods of robotic space exploration. The entry was unique among GLXP contenders, in that instead of building a tracked or wheeled rover, SpaceIL planned to meet the requirement to travel 500 meters on the lunar surface by having the lander "hop" from its landing site to another site 500 meters away using rocket propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/2017/01/25/israel-slated-to-be-4th-country-to-land-vehicle-on-the-moon/|title=Israel slated to be 4th country to land vehicle on the moon – Israel Hayom|website=www.israelhayom.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/27704-israeli-lunar-xprize-craft-to-study-magnetism.html|title=Israeli XPrize Mission Science Twist: Map Lunar Magnetism (Op-Ed)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, American philanthropist [[Sheldon Adelson]] donated US$16.4 million to the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel space project gets $16 million boost from casino mogul Adelson|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-israel-space-adelson-idUKBREA381FH20140409|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2017, the [[Israeli Space Agency]] (ISA) announced a donation of additional 7.5 million NIS, after having donated 2 million NIS in previous years.&lt;ref name="June2017"/&gt;

In August 2017, Google Lunar Xprizes announced an extension of the deadline to 31 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lunar.xprize.org/about/guidelines|title=Guidelines|date=2015-10-07|work=Google Lunar XPRIZE|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2144314-google-sponsored-private-moon-race-delayed-for-the-fourth-time/?campaign_id=RSS%7CNSNS-news|title=Google-sponsored private moon race delayed for the fourth time|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest ended without a winner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/39467-google-lunar-xprize-moon-race-ends.html|title=Ex-Prize: Google's $30 Million Moon Race Ends with No Winner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but SpaceIL still plans on launching the mission.

In November 2017, SpaceIL announced they need $30M to finish the project. [[Morris Kahn]] resigned from chairing the board, and promised $10M if the organization can raise the additional $20M.&lt;ref name="Nov2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=SpaceIL: If we don't raise enough money by January 2018, we will have to close the project (in Hebrew)|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5047017,00.html |publisher=Ynet |author=Yaron Drokman|date=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current CEO is Ido Anteby, and the President of SpaceIL remains Morris Kahn.&lt;ref name=Shoshanna/&gt; As of July 2018, the project has cost approximately $95 million.&lt;ref name=Shoshanna/&gt; If successful, it would make Israel the fifth nation —after Russia, the United States, China, and India— to land a probe on the Moon.

=== Founders and supporters ===

The founders of the team are: Yariv Bash, former electronics and computer engineer in the [[Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya]], and currently [http://www.flytrex.com/ Flytrex] CEO; Kfir Damari, a [[Computer Networking]] lecturer; and Yonatan Winetraub, formerly a satellite systems engineer at [[Israel Aerospace Industries]], and currently a biophysics PhD Candidate at Stanford.

The team has technical support from the [[Israel Space Agency]] (ISA), [[Israel Aerospace Industries]], [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems|Rafael Systems]] and [[Elbit Systems]]. SpaceIL is also supported by educational institutions, including the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] and [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]].&lt;ref name="Oct15"/&gt; SpaceIL has over 200 members, 95% of them are volunteers. By 2017, SpaceIL volunteers reached over 250,000 pupils all around Israel.

The founders of the team stated that if they had won the competition, the money would have been donated to educational purposes.&lt;ref name="Oct15"&gt; SpaceIL still aims to launch [http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/science/.premium-1.2746550 עתידות: עד 2017 תנחת חללית ישראלית על הירח (By 2017, an Israeli spacecraft will land on the moon.)] ''[[Haaretz]]'', October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next''''' is a 2006 book by the theoretical [[physicist]] [[Lee Smolin]] about the problems with [[string theory]]. The book strongly criticizes [[string theory]] and its prominence in contemporary [[theoretical physics]], on the grounds that string theory has yet to come up with a single prediction that can be verified using any technology that is likely to be feasible within our lifetimes. Smolin also focuses on the difficulties faced by research in [[quantum gravity]], and by current efforts to come up with a theory explaining all four [[fundamental interaction]]s. The book is broadly concerned with the role of controversy and diversity of approaches in scientific processes and ethics.

Smolin suggests both that there appear to be serious deficiencies in string theory and that string theory has an unhealthy near-monopoly on fundamental physics in the United States, and that a diversity of approaches is needed. He argues that more attention should instead be paid to [[background independence|background independent]] theories of quantum gravity.

In the book, Smolin controversially claims that string theory makes no new testable predictions;&lt;ref&gt;''The Trouble with Physics'', p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; that it has no coherent mathematical formulation; and that it has not been mathematically proved finite.&lt;ref&gt;Finiteness is discussed at length in chpts. 9 and 16 of ''The Trouble with Physics'', especially pp. 278-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts in the theoretical physics community disagree with these statements.&lt;ref name="All Strung Out"&gt;[[Joseph Polchinski|Polchinski, Joseph]] (2007) "[http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/all-strung-out All Strung Out?]" a review of ''The Trouble with Physics'' and ''Not Even Wrong'', ''[[American Scientist]]'' 95(1):1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refframe&gt;Motl, Luboš. [http://motls.blogspot.com/2004/10/lee-smolin-trouble-with-physics-review.html "Lee Smolin: The Trouble with Physics: a review"] on ''The Reference Frame''&lt;/ref&gt;

Smolin states that to propose a [[string theory landscape]] having up to 10&lt;sup&gt;500&lt;/sup&gt; string vacuum solutions is tantamount to abandoning accepted science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The scenario of [[multiverse|many unobserved universes]] plays the same logical role as the scenario of an [[intelligent design]]er. Each provides an untestable hypothesis that, if true, makes something improbable seem quite probable.&lt;ref&gt;Smolin, quoted in [[Michael Riordan|Riordan, Michael]] [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/26951 "Stringing physics along"], ''[[Physics World]]'' (February 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reviews ==
{{Too few opinions|date=October 2013}}
The book generated much controversy and debate about the merits of string theory, and was criticised by some prominent physicists including [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean M. Carroll|Carroll, Sean M.]] [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/10/03/the-trouble-with-physics/ "The Trouble With Physics" (review)], ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' blog (October 3, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and string theorists [[Joseph Polchinski]]&lt;ref name="All Strung Out"/&gt; and [[Luboš Motl]].&lt;ref name=refframe /&gt; 

Polchinski's review states, "In the end, these [Smolin and others'] books fail to capture much of the spirit and logic of string theory."

Motl's review goes on to say "the concentration of irrational statements and anti-scientific sentiments has exceeded my expectations," and,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the context of string theory, he literally floods the pages of his book with undefendable speculations about some basic results of string theory. Because these statements are of mathematical nature, we are sure that Lee is wrong even in the absence of any experiments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sean Carroll's review expressed frustration because in his opinion, "''The Trouble with Physics'' is really two books, with intertwined but ultimately independent arguments." He suggested that the arguments in the book appear divided:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[one argument is] big and abstract and likely to be ignored by most of the book's audience; the other is narrow and specific and part of a wide-ranging and heated discussion carried out between scientists, in the popular press, and on the internet."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The abstract argument — about academic culture and the need to nurture speculative ideas — is, in my opinion, important and largely correct, while the specific one — about the best way to set about quantizing gravity — is overstated and undersupported.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carroll fears that excessive attention paid to the specific dispute is likely to disadvantage the more general abstract argument.

[[Sabine Hossenfelder]], in a review written a year later and titled "The Trouble With Physics: Aftermath" alludes to the book's polarising effect on the scientific community. She explores the author's views as a contrast in generations, while supporting his right to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hossenfelder, Sabine. [http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2007/09/trouble-with-physics-aftermath.html "The Trouble with Physics Aftermath"] on BackRe(Action) (September 19, 2007) "I belong to a different generation. But it seems the prevailing atmosphere I encountered 20 years later in theoretical physics wasn't all that different. And it still isn't all that different today."&lt;/ref&gt; Hossenfelder believes that Smolin's book attempts to restore the relation physics once had with philosophy, quoting him as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Philosophy used to be part of the natural sciences – for a long time. For long centuries during which our understanding of the world we live in has progressed tremendously. There is no doubt that times change, but not all changes are a priori good if left without further consideration. Here, change has resulted in a gap between the natural sciences where questioning the basis of our theories, and an embedding into the historical and sociological context used to be. Even though many new specifically designed interdisciplinary fields have been established, investigating the foundations of our current theories has basically been erased out of curricula and textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Hossenfelder, Sabine. [http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2007/09/trouble-with-physics-aftermath.html "The Trouble with Physics Aftermath"] on BackRe(Action) (September 19, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=="The String Wars"==

A discussion in 2006 took place between [[UCSB]] physicists at [[KITP]] and science journalist George Johnson regarding the controversy caused by Smolin's and [[Peter Woit]]'s books.&lt;ref&gt;http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/resident/johnson2/&lt;/ref&gt;  The meeting was titled "The String Wars" to reflect the impression the media has given people regarding the controversy in string theory caused by Smolin's and Woit's books.  A video of the proceedings is available at UCSB's website.&lt;ref&gt;http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/resident/johnson2/rm/qt.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/resident/johnson2/rm/suresmil.ram&lt;/ref&gt;

TTOs engage in a variety of commercial activities that are meant to facilitate the process of bringing research developments to market, often acting as a channel between academia and industry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothaermel|first=F.

While TTOs are commonplace, many studies have questioned their financial benefit to the university.

== History ==
The history of technology transfer is intimately linked with the history of the [[science policy of the United States]].  The foundation for modern American science policy laid way out in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s letter in response to President Roosevelt's query about whether the US should maintain the high level of research funding it had been pouring into the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], which had coordinated large [[private-public partnership]] research projects as part of the war effort, including the [[Manhattan Project]].  Bush's answer was ''Science - the Endless Frontier''.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehlers|first=Vernon|title=The Future of U.S. Science Policy|journal=Science|date=16 January 1998|volume=279|pages=302a–302|doi=10.1126/science.279.5349.302a|issue=5349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frontier&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Vannevar|title=Science the Endless Frontier|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|publisher=National Science Foundation|date=July 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that letter, Bush advocated that the US should continue to fund [[basic research]] at high levels, arguing that while the US no longer had a geographic frontier, extending the boundaries of science would allow the creation of new technologies, which in turn would spur new industries, create jobs, generate wealth, and maintain US power.&lt;ref name=Frontier/&gt;  As the US worked out its approach to funding science in the 1950s, Congress decided that the federal government should maintain ownership of patents on inventions funded by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Federal research funding drove the growth of the research university.  Many universities in the early 20th century did not engage in patenting and licensing, since the government owned most inventions, and out of fear of interfering with their missions of supporting the growth of knowledge and objective inquiry.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampat|first=Bhaven N.|date=2006-07-01|title=Patenting and US academic research in the 20th century: The world before and after Bayh-Dole|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=Property and the pursuit of knowledge: IPR issues affecting scientific research|volume=35|issue=6|pages=772–789|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2006.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Maryann|last2=Desrochers|first2=Pierre|date=2003-03-01|title=Research Universities and Local Economic Development: Lessons from the History of the Johns Hopkins University|journal=Industry and Innovation|volume=10|issue=1|pages=5–24|doi=10.1080/1366271032000068078|issn=1366-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the postwar period, universities relied mostly on external patent management organizations such as the [[Research Corporation]], while few set up their own research foundations that were independent from but affiliated to the university.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Some universities, such as [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Wisconsin]], had active licensing programs of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C|last2=Nelson|first2=Richard R|last3=Sampat|first3=Bhaven N|last4=Ziedonis|first4=Arvids A|date=2001-01-01|title=The growth of patenting and licensing by U.S. universities: an assessment of the effects of the Bayh–Dole act of 1980|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=30|issue=1|pages=99–119|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00100-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.334.3228}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There was a shift in universities' approaches to technology transfer between 1970-1980.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this period, universities began taking commercialization efforts into their own hands and setting up TTOs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Bayh–Dole Act]] of 1980 led many US universities to set up tech transfer offices.  The Act was created to try to spur the stagnant US economy of the 1970s, harking back to Vannevar Bush's vision of the role of federal research funding in the US economy.  The Act decentralized ownership of inventions funded with federal grants, allowing universities that received federal grant funding to maintain ownership of such inventions, obligating them to try to patent and license the inventions to US companies, and requiring universities to share license income with inventors.&lt;ref name=Mowery&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C.|last2=Sampat|first2=Bhaven N.|date=2004-12-01|title=The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and University–Industry Technology Transfer: A Model for Other OECD Governments?|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|language=en|volume=30|issue=1–2|pages=115–127|doi=10.1007/s10961-004-4361-z|issn=0892-9912|citeseerx=10.1.1.1025.6800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapin/files/shapin_lrbivorytrade.pdf|title=Ivory Trade|last=Shapin|first=Steven|date=11 September 2003|website=Harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
While the broad goal of TTOs is to commercialize university research, they engage in numerous activities that not only bring these developments to market but also encourage and support faculty and students in the entire technology transfer process. Such encouragement may increase the chances of faculty and students creating research developments that can be commercialized. Some of the major functions of TTOs include:

=== Industry partnerships ===
An important task of many TTOs is to create and maintain industry partnerships that may be crucial for collaboration and bringing technologies to market.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etzkowitz|first=Henry|date=1998-12-01|title=The norms of entrepreneurial science: cognitive effects of the new university–industry linkages|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=27|issue=8|pages=823–833|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(98)00093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities such as MIT and Northwestern have separate offices for industry and corporate relations which typically work in conjunction with the TTO of the institution. In this case, TTOs often exploit the relationships developed by the corporate relations office, focusing more specifically on the technology transfer process itself. TTOs often employ two methods when engaging with industry partners: 1) the "pull" method, in which TTOs ''receive'' interest from industry partners in bringing specific technologies at the university to market, and 2) the "push" method, in which TTOs actively ''seek'' industry partners for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4438&amp;context=flr|title=Interface: The Push and Pull of Patents|last=Lee|first=Peter|date=2009|website=Fordham Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual property ===
The Bayh-Dole Act obligated universities to seek [[patent]] protection, when appropriate, for inventions to which they elect title; after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act many US universities created intellectual property policies that obligated faculty to assign inventions to the university.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt; Universities typically [[License#Patent licensing|license]] the patent to a company that will invest money in developing the invention into a product, which it will then be able to sell at a premium, recouping its investment and making profit before the patent expires.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Donald S|last2=Waldman|first2=David|last3=Link|first3=Albert|date=2003-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of organizational practices on the relative productivity of university technology transfer offices: an exploratory study|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=27–48|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counseling and incubation for startups ===

TTOs at many universities often provide general business and legal counseling to foster entrepreneurship among faculty and students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Shea|first=Rory P.|last2=Allen|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Chevalier|first3=Arnaud|last4=Roche|first4=Frank|date=2005-09-01|title=Entrepreneurial orientation, technology transfer and spinoff performance of U.S. universities|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=The Creation of Spin-off Firms at Public Research Institutions: Managerial and Policy Implcations|volume=34|issue=7|pages=994–1009|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2005.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing resources, funding, and connections to [[University spin-off|university spin-off companies]], TTOs attempt to increase the chances of [[startup company|startup]] success, which may result in financial gain if the university owns the intellectual property of the invention or has an equity stake in the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, many TTOs establish [[business incubator]]s and programs for faculty and students in an attempt to enhance the entrepreneurial atmosphere among researchers at the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Rhonda G.|date=2002-08-01|title=Technology business incubators: how effective as technology transfer mechanisms?|url=|journal=Technology in Society|volume=24|issue=3|pages=299–316|doi=10.1016/S0160-791X(02)00010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of such incubators and programs include the [[Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator]] as well as the [[Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator]] at [[Harvard University]], and [[Fab Lab MSI]], affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. Research has suggested that incubators at TTOs have not had a high incidence of technology transfer, despite this being one of the reasons they were established, and may even negatively impact the success of TTOs and technology transfer at the university.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolympiris|first=Christos|last2=Klein|first2=Peter G.|date=2017-06-01|title=The Effects of Academic Incubators on University Innovation|journal=Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=145–170|doi=10.1002/sej.1242|issn=1932-443X|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/106979/1/WRAP-effects-academic-incubators-university-innovation-Kolympiris-2017.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and organization ==
The structure and organization of TTOs can affect its overall performance and can vary among universities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brescia|first=F.|last2=Colombo|first2=G.|last3=Landoni|first3=P.|title=Organizational structures of Knowledge Transfer Offices: an analysis of the world's top-ranked universities|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=41|issue=1|pages=132–151|doi=10.1007/s10961-014-9384-5|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since TTOs deal with both academic research and industry, they consist of a diverse set of individuals, including scientists, lawyers, analysts, licensing experts, and business managers. By having individuals (particularly different scientists, engineers, and analysts) with varying sets of expertise in research, TTOs attempt to more effectively assess, protect, and profit from the research developments taking place in  multiple disciplines throughout the university.

TTOs can by classified into three different types:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* ''internal:'' existing as an integrated part of the university and controlled by university administration
* ''external:'' existing as an independent company that does not operate under the control of university administration
* ''mixed:'' having components of both internal and external TTOs 
As of 2012 the "internal" type was most common in the US.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Strategies ==
TTOs attempt to capitalize on the research developments made at the university by employing strategies focused on providing the university with opportunities for financial gain and increased research impact. A common strategy that TTOs engage in is licensing their inventions, either to an industry partner or back to the university inventor if the inventor started a company (i.e. a university spin-off).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macho-Stadler|first=Inés|last2=Pérez-Castrillo|first2=David|last3=Veugelers|first3=Reinhilde|date=2007-06-01|title=Licensing of university inventions: The role of a technology transfer office|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=25|issue=3|pages=483–510|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2006.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this approach, TTOs can bring university technologies to market without having to engage in production and distribution themselves. TTOs can also take an equity stake in the spin-off company rather than licensing the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lockett|first=Andy|last2=Wright|first2=Mike|last3=Franklin|first3=Stephen|title=Technology Transfer and Universities' Spin-Out Strategies|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=185–200|doi=10.1023/a:1022220216972|via=|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has suggested that equity in spin-off companies may provide higher returns than licensing,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=Michael J|last2=Lee|first2=James N|date=2000-09-01|title=University revenues from technology transfer: Licensing fees vs. equity positions|url=|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=15|issue=5|pages=385–392|doi=10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this strategy seems to be more common with TTOs that are financially independent from the parent university (i.e. external TTO structure).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While these strategies vary greatly among TTOs at different universities, a majority of them employ some combination of licensing and equity stakes, with licensing being a more standard practice.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== International diffusion &amp; TTOs outside the US ==
As many major research universities across the US began to adopt TTOs, institutions outside the US became attracted to the idea of taking control of their commercialization activities as well. Prior to the 2000s, many German-speaking and Scandinavian countries had a policy of "professor's privilege", in which faculty retain the right to control the intellectual property of their inventions. In addition, in recent years many [[OECD]] and [[European Union|EU]] nations have created legislation that emulates Bayh-Dole, in an attempt to increase the commercialization activities and impact of their respective research universities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geuna|first=Aldo|last2=Rossi|first2=Federica|date=2011-10-01|title=Changes to university IPR regulations in Europe and the impact on academic patenting|url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/3753/1/3753.pdf|journal=Research Policy|series=Special Issue: 30 Years After Bayh-Dole: Reassessing Academic Entrepreneurship|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1068–1076|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2011.05.008|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/industry-and-services/benchmarking-industry-science-relationships_9789264175105-en|title=Benchmarking Industry-Science Relationships|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark was among the first to abolish professor's privilege, followed by Germany, Austria, Norway and Finland between 2000-2007.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Countries such as  France and the UK, which already had policies in place that grant intellectual property rights to universities during this period, began heavily encouraging and enforcing these institutional ownership rights.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As of 2011, most European countries grant universities the rights to the intellectual property of inventions developed by faculty researchers, yet a few countries such as Italy and Sweden still employ professor's privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnstrand Damsgaard|first=E.|last2=Thursby|first2=M.

Several Asian countries such as Japan, China, and India have also shifted towards a Bayh-Dole type legislation, although some countries such as Malaysia have a shared ownership model.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen|first=Tina|date=2010|title=Asian Initiatives on Bayh-Dole, with Special Reference to India: How Do We Make It More "Asian?"|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&amp;context=ckjip|journal=Chicago-Kent Journal of Intellectual Property|volume=10|pages=44–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mok|first=Ka Ho|title=The quest for an entrepreneurial university in East Asia: impact on academics and administrators in higher education|url=|journal=Asia Pacific Education Review|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–22|doi=10.1007/s12564-013-9249-x|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there has been a general shift towards increased commercialization and the establishment of TTOs across higher education institutions in Asian countries. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Although universities created TTOs with hopes of financial gain, many TTOs have retained losses in their commercialization activities and have not generated significant local economic development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trune|first=Dennis R|last2=Goslin|first2=Lewis N|date=1998-03-01|title=University Technology Transfer Programs: A Profit/Loss Analysis|url=|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=57|issue=3|pages=197–204|doi=10.1016/S0040-1625(97)00165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It has been argued that protecting intellectual property and patenting is a costly process, and of all the patents and licenses a university issues, there may be a limited number of inventions that actually yield enough revenue to cover or surpass these costs. Research has shown that larger, more established TTOs are sufficiently profitable, whereas many smaller, more recent TTOs are not, and that an estimated half of TTOs retain losses in their commercialization activities (of those that do not have losses, a majority do no better than to cover their costs).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Even the most profitable TTOs only produce revenue that amounts to 1-3% of the total research expenditures at the university.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, less than 1% of licensed technologies actually yield over $1M in revenue.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another criticism of TTOs is its role in the research atmosphere of the university, with many scholars arguing that its presence and purpose of engaging in commercialization activities conflicts with a university's mission of furthering knowledge and objective academic inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischut|first=Peter M.|last2=Haas|first2=Scott|date=2005|title=University Technology Transfer Offices: A Status Report|journal=Biotechnology Healthcare|volume=2|issue=2|pages=48–53|issn=1554-169X|pmc=3564362|pmid=23393451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca Eisenberg and [[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] have argued that the Bayh-Dole Act spurred university tech transfer offices to become too aggressive in patenting, creating [[patent thicket]]s and a [[tragedy of the anticommons]] especially in the field of [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller |first=M.

'''Walter Maioli ''' (born 1950 in [[Milan]]) is an Italian researcher, paleorganologist, poly-instrumentalist and composer.
Specialized in [[experimental archaeology]] and music, in particular that of [[Ancient civilizations|archaic civilization]]. He has been researching the music of [[ancient history|antiquity]] and [[prehistory]] for more than thirty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundcenter.it/ Sound Center]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanvirtualmuseum.net/virtual_museum/prototipo_route_en.asp?Type=5&amp;Number=15&amp;lingua=en Virtual Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Always interested in the music of the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], he has gone on journeys to discover the [[Folkloristics|folkloristic]] Italian and Mediterranean traditions learning the [[Arabic music|Arabic]], [[African music|African]], [[Music of Asia|Oriental]], and [[European music]] since the beginning of the seventies.

In 1972 he founded the pioneer [[world music]] group [[Aktuala]] group, dedicated to folkloristic African and [[Asian music]].

In the eighties Walter Maioli's researches focused on the field of prehistoric instruments, his work was presented at the Archaeological Symposium of Amsterdam for the opening of the [[Den Haag]] Museum. In 1987 he prepared the Natural Art Laboratory of Morimondo in the Ticino Park, working on the Art of the Nature, publishing books on the subject for the Jaca Book: “Origins, sounds and music”, and for Giorgio Mondadori: “Orchestra of the Nature”.

In 1991 he displayed the collection called “The Origins of Musical Instruments” to the History of Nature Museum in [[Milan]] and presented "Art of the Stars" sounds for the planetarium, at Ulrico Hoelpi Civic Planetarium in Milan in collaboration with [[Fiorella Terenzi]]. Starting in 1994, for one and a half years he was coordinating the musical part of the Archeon Archaeological Theme Park in [[Alphen aan den Rijn]] in the [[Netherlands]], producing the CD called "200.000 years in music".

In 1995 he founded [[Synaulia]], a team of musicians, [[archeologists]], paleorganologists, and choreographers dedicated to the application of their [[historical research]] to [[ancient music]] and dance, in particular to the [[Ancient Etruscans|ancient Etruscan]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, carrying out an intense activity of conferences, seminars, and concerts in Europe, in particular in the [[Netherlands]] and Germany. In Italy, some of his performances were presented on [[archaeological sites]] such as Mausoleo di Augusto, [[Mercati Traianei]], Terme di Diocleziano, [[Ostia Antica]], [[Villa Adriana]], [[Preneste]], [[Pompei]] and [[Stabia]], with the scope of recreating the sound atmosphere and executive context of the Roman age. When [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]], chose the Synaulia group to participate in the shooting of the movie [[A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream_(1999_film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']] in 1998, Walter Maioli took care of the reproduction of the musical instruments.

Among the collaborations of Walter Maioli and [[Synaulia]], there are performances with [[Giorgio Albertazzi]]: "Eros voglio cantare", "Intorno a Dante", and "Mammi, Pappi e Sirene in Magna Grecia, and the [[music composition]] for the first two episodes of the television program on TV RAI 2 "Albertazzi e Fo raccontato la storia del teatro italiano". Two songs of Synaulia were used in ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', directed by [[Ridley Scott]].

Walter Maioli and the Synaulia took care of the musical parts of ''Rome'' of BBC-HBO, ''[[Empire (2005 TV series)|Empire]]'' of ABC and the New Line Cinema's ''Nativity'' (2006), let alone other documentaries of the [[BBC]], [[CNN]], Japanese TV, [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Society]] and experimental archaeological videos for the [[RAI]], CNN, [[Museo Nazionale Etrusco]] of Villa Giulia in Rome and other museums in Germany. From November 2007 Walter Maioli with the [[Fondazione Ras]] has started the laboratory "Synaulia in Stabiae" in Castellamaare di Stabiae.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stabiae.com/fountation_site/usa/index.html Fondazione Ras]&lt;/ref&gt;
