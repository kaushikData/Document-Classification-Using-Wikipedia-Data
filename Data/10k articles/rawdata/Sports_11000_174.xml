The '''2007 [[Libyan SuperCup]]''' took place between [[Libyan Premier League 2006-07|2006-07]] [[Libyan Premier League]] champions [[Al Ittihad Tripoli|Al Ittihad]] and the 2007 [[Libyan Cup]] runners-up [[Al Akhdar]] (Al Ittihad won the Libyan Cup, so Al Akhdar took their place in the competition as cup runners-up). This was the 11th edition of the competition, and the match ended 3-1 to Al Ittihad after extra time. This was Al Ittihad's 6th consecutive win in the competition.

It is sometimes also encountered in other sports where 2-0 is a moderately large lead, such as [[ice hockey]].

==Concept==
The underlying concept is that, a team which is leading 2-0 will be [[complacency|complacent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kicker-conspiracy.blogspot.com/2007/06/most-dangerous-lead.html|title=Kicker Conspiracy: The most dangerous lead|last=M|first=Alex|date=2007-06-22|website=Kicker Conspiracy|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have a 'false sense of security' in their lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.impactmontreal.com/en/post/2015/04/03/2-0-clich%C3%A9-goes-most-dangerous-scoreline|title=2-0, the cliché goes, is the most dangerous scoreline|last=|first=|date=2016-12-09|website=Montreal Impact|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the trailing team then scores to make it 2-1, the leading team can panic and concede further, resulting in a [[Tie (draw)|draw]], or even a win for the other team. In contrast, a team which is leading 1-0 will tend to concentrate and play with intensity to protect or extend their narrow lead, whilst teams leading by three or more goals have a sufficiently large buffer that comebacks are unlikely.

The cliché may be invoked by coaches to encourage their players to maintain effort levels after obtaining a two-goal lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.soccerclassroom.com/coaching-blog/the-most-dangerous-lead-in-soccer-2-0/|title=The Most Dangerous Lead in Soccer: 2-0|date=2011-06-27|newspaper=Soccer Classroom|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used in broadcasting, such as by a [[sport commentator|commentator]] or studio [[pundit]], to suggest that the final result is still in doubt, thereby maintaining audience interest in a game.

There is little evidence that 2-0 is the worst lead in practice. In football, a team leading 2-0 at half-time only goes on to lose the game in about 2% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2764974/The-time-Manchester-United-suffered-defeat-two-goal-lead-Margaret-Thatcher-No-10.html|title=The last time United suffered defeat after a two-goal was in 1984|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/805422534023872512|title=OptaJoe on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ice hockey]], statistics show that if a team builds a two-goal advantage, they go on to win the game in the majority of instances, and that a one-goal lead is far more dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.puckscene.com/2011/08/the-most-dangerous-lead-in-hockey-fact-or-myth/|title="The Most Dangerous Lead in Hockey" – Fact or Myth?|date=2011-08-19|newspaper=PuckScene.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the cliché is often used in full knowledge that 2-0 is not in fact the worst possible lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepowerofgoals.blogspot.com/2016/03/martinez-blows-most-dangerous-of-leads.html|title=The Power of Goals.: "Martinez Blows Most Dangerous of Leads"!|last=Taylor|first=Mark|date=2016-03-06|website=The Power of Goals.|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/blog/2015/01/28/debunking-myth-dangerous-two-nil-lead|title=Debunking the myth of the 'dangerous two-nil lead'|newspaper=The World Game|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of usage==
The cliché was popularized by Czech football coach and television commentator [[Josef Csaplár]] in the Czech football community. His use of the term suggested that a 2–0 half-time lead could only end in a defeat and the cliché is known in the [[Czech Republic]] as ''Csaplár's trap'' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Csaplárova past'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.o2sport.cz/fotbal/csaplar-efekt-se-nastesti-nepotvrdil-fotbalova-francie-vola-narodni-tym/|title=Csaplár efekt se nepotvrdil, Francie volá národní tým!|last=o2sport.cz|date=2015-09-07|newspaper=O2 Sport|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sport.aktualne.cz/fotbal/bednar-a-lafata-si-prekazeli-plzen-skripla-csaplarova-past/r~2f013818132d11e3a431002590604f2e/|title=Bednář a Lafata si překáželi. Plzeň skřípla Csaplárova past|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte co se právě děje|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Serbia]], the cliché is known for being used by manager and former player [[Milan Živadinović]].&lt;ref name="Kako ono reče Živa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mozzartsport.com/fudbal/vesti/kako-ono-rece-ziva-2-0-je-najopasniji-rezultat/129469 |author=''Mozzart Sport'' |title=Kako ono reče Živa – 2:0 je najopasniji rezultat |accessdate=2018-07-15 |date=2016-03-04 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cliché was also used by Australian former player and TV broadcaster [[Johnny Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=VtiNXrFEJ4kC&amp;pg=PA207|title=Offsider - a Memoir: How a Scrawny Pommy Kid Learned to Love the Socceroos|last=Mangan|first=Patrick|publisher=Melbourne University Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0522857214|location=Australia|pages=207|quote=At some stage in the previous twenty minutes, in the TV gantry not far of us, Johnny Warren no doubt uttered one of his favourite truisms: that a 2-0 is a dangerous lead. It breeds complacency, he liked to say. The Socceroos didn't needed reminding - now.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television pundit and former English footballer [[Gary Lineker]] raised the cliché when commenting on a 2016 match between [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], in which Liverpool led by 2–0 at half-time but ended up losing 4–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38121184|title=Bournemouth 4-3 Liverpool|date=2016-12-04|newspaper=BBC Sport|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Athens Olympic Velodrome''' is a [[Velodrome|velodrome stadium]] that is located in [[Marousi]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]], at the [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex]]. The stadium, which seats 5,250 - though only 3,300 seats were made publicly available for the [[2004 Summer Olympic Games]] - has distinctive twin roofs, covering the stands on each side.

==History==
The Olympic Velodrome was originally built in 1991, for the [[1991 Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]]. It was extensively refurbished in order to host the [[Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics|track cycling]] events at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Summer Olympics]]. It was redesigned for the 2004 Olympics by Spanish [[architect]] [[Santiago Calatrava]]. The track, made of [[Afzelia]] wood, is {{convert|250|m|ft}} long and {{convert|7.5|m|ft}} wide. Reconstruction of the stadium was completed on May 30, 2004, and it was officially re-opened on July 30, 2004.

{{USC CSKA Sofia}}

'''BC CSKA Sofia''' ({{lang-bg|БК „ЦСКА София"}}) is a [[Bulgaria]]n professional [[basketball]] club based in the capital [[Sofia]] and part of the [[CSKA Sofia (sports club)|CSKA Sofia]] [[sports club]].

CSKA Sofia men's team have been champions of Bulgaria 12 times and Bulgarian cup winners 18 times. They play their home games at [[Rumen Peychev Hall]] in Sofia. In [[2006–07 FIBA EuroCup|2006-07]], they took part in the [[EuroChallenge|FIBA EuroCup]] tournament.

==History==
The CSKA Basketball team took over the AC-23, a team which finished in the second place in the national championship in 1942. In 1946, BC "Chavdar" was formed and finished third in the championship. In 1948, the team was renamed as "Septemvri" under authority of the Central Military Club and finished in the second place. In 1949, the club won the golden medal at the national championship. In 1950, the team (again renamed as "Narodna voiska") was national champion and repeated the success in 1951. Altogether, the team has won 12 first places, 14 second places and 3 third places in the National Championship. The founders of the club are Kosyo Totev, Iliya Angelov, and Tonko Rainov. Within 1948–1974 period, 26 players of the club became Masters of Sports – an honorable title for the most skilled and distinguished sportsmen in Bulgaria. The most successful period of the club was 1990–1992, when the team became the national champion for three years in a row.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1922">'''Belay glasses''' are [[eyeglasses]] with [[Porro prism|prismatic lenses]] that are used by [[belaying|belayers]] in [[rock climbing]] to avoid the neck strain commonly associated with belaying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.thebmc.co.uk/video/how-to-use-belay-glasses|title=How to Use Belay Glasses|publisher=The British Mountaineering Council|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Belay glasses lens.svg|thumb|right|Principle of operation of belay glasses. Light from above is reflected into the observer's eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belayspecs.com/index.php/details/how-belay-specs-work|title=How belay specs work|publisher=Belay Specs|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Belaying involves a person standing on a stable platform below a rock climber controlling the tension and friction of the climber's rope. Since this activity requires craning one's neck to look up at the climber, a common malady named "belayer's neck" can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climbing.com/skill/belayers-neck/|title=Belayer's Neck|work=Climbing|first=Carla|last=Cupido|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prismatic lenses of the belay glasses are arranged so as to bend light from above through [[total internal reflection]] into the observer's eye, allowing the belayer to observe the climber while maintaining a comfortable head/neck position.

The design based on the eyeglasses frame provides for a split field of vision:
* the central field through the lenses, providing a vertical view to the climber;
* the peripheral field around the sides of the lenses, allowing the belayer to remain aware of their surroundings.

The first belay glasses were invented 2007 by climber Albi Schneider from Germany

'''Carrara Stadium''' (known commercially as '''Metricon Stadium''') is a sporting venue on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], located in the suburb of [[Carrara, Queensland|Carrara]].

The venue is primarily used for [[Australian rules football]] and [[Cricket]]. It serves as the home ground of the [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]], who compete in the [[Australian Football League]], while also regularly hosting [[Big Bash League]] matches. Carrara Stadium received substantial redevelopment work prior to the entry of the [[Brisbane Bears]] to the [[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]] in 1987, but following the Bears relocation to the [[the Gabba|Brisbane Cricket Ground]] in 1993, it was used for other sports including [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]] and even [[baseball]]. The stadium has hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] as well as the [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] competitions.

==History==
{{see also|Gold Coast Sports Precinct}}

===Early history===
In 1983 the [[Nerang Bulls RUC|Nerang Bulls Rugby Union Club]] was formed and were located at Carrara Oval. During 1983 the Bulls would field one senior team. In 1984 the Bulls would field two senior teams. The Bulls would spend two seasons at Carrara before moving to Glennon Park in Nerang in 1985.

On 7 October 1986 it was announced that [[Australian rules football]] club the [[Brisbane Bears]] were granted a licence to enter the [[Victorian Football League]] for the [[1987 VFL season]].&lt;ref name="No longer a white elephant"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smart|first=Nick|title=No longer a white elephant|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bears President [[Paul Cronin]] announced on 23 December 1986 that the club would use Carrara Oval as their home ground. The financial backer of the Bears, [[Christopher Skase]], spent $1 million redeveloping Carrara Oval over a 10-week period at the beginning of 1987 which included upgraded player facilities, seating for 6000 spectators and new electronic scoreboard. The [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy Lions]] defeated the Brisbane Bears in the first VFL game played at Carrara Oval before a crowd of 17,795 on 19 April 1987.&lt;ref name="No longer a white elephant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rleague AFL stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=AFL Tables – Crowds – Carrara|url=http://afltables.com/afl/crowds/vn_carrara.html|publisher=rleague|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Brisbane Lions]] website records this crowd as unofficially 22,684).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lions.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/5085/newsid/23736/default.aspx 1965–1996: The Spirit Burns Brightly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605110412/http://www.lions.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/5085/newsid/23736/default.aspx |date=5 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the Brisbane Bears and the Albert Shire Council signed off on a 30-year lease for the ground with an option for a further 10 years. Following this announcement Christpher Skase orchestrated the installment of $6 million flood lights which were never paid for;&lt;ref name="Breaking the curse of Carrara"&gt;{{cite news|last=Houghton|first=Des|title=Breaking the curse of Carrara|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/spike/columnists/breaking-the-curse-of-carrara/story-e6frereo-1225899937592|accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=The Courier Mail|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon the collapse of Skase's company [[Qintex]], he would flee the country to Spain and the flood lights would continue to be unpaid. Liquidators would attempt to extract money from the [[Gold Coast City Council]] for the lights, but after an unsuccessful trial it was found cheaper to leave the flood lights at Carrara Stadium. On 15 July 1989 the Bears hosted the first ever night match at Carrara against the [[Geelong Cats]] in front of a then record crowd of 18,198.

Insufficient public transport to and from the stadium and the poor on-field performance of the Bears resulted in poor crowds at the Bears games and prompted the local media to refer to it as the Curse of Carrara.&lt;ref name="Breaking the curse of Carrara"/&gt; The new owner of the Bears, Reuben Pelerman, would lose a further $10 million between the 1990–1992 AFL seasons, and the Bears would move permanently to the [[the Gabba|Brisbane Cricket Ground]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="No longer a white elephant" /&gt; staving off media rumours of a merger with fellow cellar-dwellers Sydney to form a combined Queensland/New South Wales team, the Northern Swans, or relocation to either Tasmania or Port Adelaide.

In 1988, Carrara Stadium played host to the very first [[Touch Football World Cup]]&lt;ref name="No longer a white elephant" /&gt; in which teams from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the USA competed in the Men's, Women's and Mixed Opens as well as Men's Over 35's divisions. Australia won all four division finals which were all played against New Zealand. The [[Gold Coast Clippers]]&lt;ref name="No longer a white elephant" /&gt; played their 1989–1990 [[Australian Baseball League (1989-1999)]] season at Carrara before changing their name to the [[Daikyo Dolphins]] and moving to [[Palm Meadows]]. For the 1992–93 season they moved back to Carrara as the [[Gold Coast Cougars]].&lt;ref name="No longer a white elephant" /&gt; The Cougars stayed at Carrara until the abolition of the Australian Baseball League in 1999. The [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazilian football team]] set up camp at Carrara Stadium for pre-tournament training before the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keen interest in Japan &amp; Brazil|url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2000/08/28/keen-interest-japan-brazil|publisher=AAP|date=28 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilians later commented that the surface at Carrara was one of the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talks fail to quell sniping in Gold Coast turf war|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/talks-fail-to-quell-sniping-in-gold-coast-turf-war/2006/08/06/1154802755426.html?page=2|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carrara stadium.jpg|thumb|The stadium prior to redevelopment]]
The ground was owned by the Albert Shire Council and transferred to the [[Gold Coast City Council]] when the two local authorities amalgamated in 1995. The field is officially known as Laver Oval after long time Albert Shire Chairman Councillor Bill Laver.

===Growth===
Following the folding of the [[Gold Coast Seagulls]] in 1995&lt;ref name="No longer a white elephant" /&gt; a newly formed Gold Coast rugby league team named the [[Gold Coast Chargers]] were created and began competing out of Carrara Stadium in 1996. They continued to use the ground until the end of the [[National Rugby League season 1998|1998 NRL]] season when they were excluded from the competition as a part of the rationalisation of the [[National Rugby League]]. Rugby league matches continued to be played at the stadium, with pre-season trials being played there annually from 2002 to 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titans.com.au/pages/page.php?page=28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104030436/http://www.titans.com.au/pages/page.php?page=28|title=From Chargers to Titans, the story since 1998|archivedate=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NRL premiership matches played in 2001 and 2005. The ground's capacity was increased slightly during this time.

In 2005 the NRL announced that a licence would be awarded to the [[Gold Coast Titans]], and that the stadium would be their home ground in 2007&lt;ref name="No longer a white elephant" /&gt;  until the completion of the [[Robina Stadium]], which was opened in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titans.com.au/pages/page.php?page=36|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310204731/http://www.titans.com.au/pages/page.php?page=36|archivedate=10 March 2007|title=Carrara, Gold Coast Stadium}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the NRL move, the AFL scheduled three AFL 'home games' for the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] and a [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|NAB Cup]] match for Carrara in 2007, and the [[Queensland State League (Australian rules football)|Queensland State League]] began hosting grand finals there. The Titans would play ten games at Carrara in 2007 and miss the finals. Following the conclusion of the [[2007 NRL season]], Titans managing director [[Michael Searle]] warned the AFL that if a team were to be started on the Gold Coast it would disappear into the Carrara 'black hole' within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2007/11/17/5006_gold-coast-sport.html|title=Carrara a `black hole', says Searle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 it was announced the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] would play nine home games at Carrara between the 2007–2009 seasons. Following the [[2007 AFL season]] the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] offered the Kangaroos a $100 million package to relocate from Melbourne to the Gold Coast and be based out of Carrara. On 7 December 2007 the newly appointed Kangaroos chairman [[James Brayshaw]] announced the club would not be moving to the Gold Coast permanently and would continue to be based out of Melbourne. Subsequently, the Kangaroos games played at Carrara after the announcement suffered poor crowds. The AFL released North Melbourne from the final year of a three-year contract after they drew just 6,354 spectators to their first home match at Carrara for the 2008 season.&lt;ref name="Empty seats force AFL to pull plug"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrett|first=Damian|title=Empty seats force AFL to pull plug|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/teams/empty-seats-force-afl-to-pull-plug/story-e6frf9m6-1111116397227|accessdate=28 May 2009|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] subsequently hosted the remaining home games during the 2009 season.

==Stadium uses==
Carrara is the home ground for [[Australian rules football]] club the [[Gold Coast Suns]], who compete in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), and also hosts events such as junior representative championships and [[Queensland Australian Football League|QAFL]] games.

===Gold Coast Suns===
[[File:Adelaide v Gold Coast - Carrara media facilities.jpg|thumb|Media facilities at Carrara Stadium.]]
The [[Gold Coast Football Club]] (nicknamed the '''Suns''') have played their home games at Carrara since mid-2011. The [[Queensland Government]] contributed $60 million towards the redevelopment of the stadium, increasing the capacity to around 25,000 of which 23,500 is seated.&lt;ref name="SUNS official website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold Coast SUNS {{!}} AFL – Home|url=http://goldcoastfc.com.au/|publisher=Gold Coast Suns|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold Coast City Council also contributed $20 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoastbusinessnews.com.au/process/myviews/gcbn_article.html?articleId=1411 GCCC to commit $20M to Carrara stadium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230042618/http://www.goldcoastbusinessnews.com.au/process/myviews/gcbn_article.html?articleId=1411 |date=30 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the AFL $10 million.&lt;ref name="Green light for Gold Coast"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh |first=Gary |title=Green light for Gold Coast |url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/74077/default.aspx |publisher=AFL |accessdate=28 May 2011 |date=31 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006110513/http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/74077/default.aspx |archivedate=6 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cricket===
The [[Gold Coast District Cricket Club]] was formed in 1990 and shared tenancy of Carrara Stadium with the Brisbane Bears.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoastdolphins.com.au/content.aspx?file=13710|37130q GCDCC: History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They would continue to be based at Carrara until 1993 when they moved to [[Robina, Queensland|Robina]]. The stadium hosted an international [[cricket]] match between [[Queensland cricket team|Queensland]] and [[England cricket team|England]] in January 1991. Controversy fell over the ground when touring English players [[David Gower]] and [[John Morris (cricketer)|John Morris]] chose to go for a joy-ride in two [[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger moth biplanes]] without telling the England team management and buzzed the stadium in the middle of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/232946.html|title=When Gower's tour took off|last=Williamson|first=Martin|date=14 January 2006|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gower and Morris also posed for press photographs with the plane later that afternoon. Both players were subsequently fined £1000 for the prank, a penalty that could have been steeper had Gower elected to release the water bombs he had prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/remembering-david-gowers-famous-1991-tiger-moth-flight/news-story/92fc39d5ec5646554de93d0992ae2c8e|title=Remembering David Gower’s famous 1991 Tiger Moth flight|last=Williamson|first=Martin|date=16 November 2018|publisher=Courier Mail|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical acts===
Carrara hosted a triple header of entertainment events on the Easter long weekend in 2001. The first night saw [[KISS (band)|KISS]] perform and become the first international act to play at the Stadium. Former KISS lead guitarist and foundation band member [[Ace Frehley]] revealed in his 2011 autobiography that he punched then-tour manager [[Tommy Thayer]] in the jaw while in the dressing room at the conclusion of the Gold Coast concert in 2001.&lt;ref name="Ace went down swinging with Kiss"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swansick|first=Tristan|title=Ace went down swinging with Kiss|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/ace-went-down-swinging-with-kiss/story-fn6cc53j-1226187095040|accessdate=20 November 2011|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium served as the venue for the last leg of the [[Kiss Farewell Tour]] and Thayer would later replace Frehley as the lead guitarist in the band. The next night saw rock legend [[Alice Cooper]] perform at the stadium. The third and final night of the long weekend saw the [[Anthony Mundine]]-Timo Masua boxing match take place at Carrara.

On 10 December 2011 the [[Foo Fighters]] performed at Carrara and set the all-time attendance record for any event ever held at Carrara Stadium, 37,000 people attended the concert. The stadium is also featured in the Foo Fighters film clip of "These Days". Filming took place during the concert on 10 December 2011. On 19 January 2014, the venue hosted the Gold Coast leg of [[Big Day Out]] for the first, and last,  time.

===Commonwealth Games===

Carrara Stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] as well as hosting the [[Athletics at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|athletics events]]. The athlete's village was originally going to be located next to Carrara Stadium but instead was constructed in [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]].

==Naming rights==
The stadium lacked a naming rights sponsor in its formative decades, bearing the names Carrara Stadium and Gold Coast Stadium between its opening in 1987 and 2011. On 15 March 2011, the Gold Coast Football Club announced that nationally active home builder group [[Metricon|Metricon Homes]] had signed a $3 million, 5-year deal for naming rights of Carrara Stadium, to be known henceforth as '''Metricon Stadium'''.&lt;ref name="Metricon lands Suns stadium naming rights"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smart|first=Nick|title=Metricon lands Suns stadium naming rights|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2011/03/15/299455_gold-coast-afl.html|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 Metricon Homes signed a 5-year extension deal with the Suns until 25 March 2020 for the naming rights of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastfc.com.au/news/2016-03-26/metricon-signs-fiveyear-extension|title=Metricon signs five-year extension|website=goldcoastfc.com.au|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denver Coliseum''' is an indoor [[arena]], owned by the City and County of [[Denver]], operated by its Arts and Venues division and located in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. The arena holds 10,200 people and was built from 1949-51. The coliseum is located in Denver's [[Elyria-Swansea, Denver|Elyria-Swansea]] neighborhood.  It sits where the [[Denver Pacific Railway]] broke ground on its Cheyenne line in 1868.

Opening on November 8, 1951 with a six day run of Shipstads &amp; Johnson Ice Follies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/08/denver-coliseum-history/|title=Denver Coliseum’s glorious history spans music, rodeos, sports and much, much more|date=2017-03-09|work=The Denver Post|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, today the Denver Coliseum is an integral venue of the [[National Western Stock Show]] and hosts a multitude of other events including: commencement ceremonies, rodeos, ice shows, motor shows, circuses, concerts, motivational seminars, dances, exhibits and trade shows.  Notables include: [[Colorado High School Activities Association|CHSAA]] high school volleyball, spirit and basketball playoffs &amp; championships, [[Disney on Ice]], The Denver March [[Pow wow|Pow Wow]], The Denver [[Coliseum Mineral, Fossil, Gem, and Jewelry Show]], [[Christian]] events, [[cheerleading]] competitions, and [[roller derby]].

When [[McNichols Sports Arena]] (MSA) opened in 1975, the coliseum continued as an alternate venue to the larger arena for events requiring less seating or overall space. This continues today after the opening of [[Pepsi Center]] in 1999 and the subsequent demolition of MSA in 2000.

==History==
On January 10, 1952 [[June Haver]] &amp; [[Walter O'Keefe]] hosted the official dedication of the Coliseum on the eve of the first stock show in the arena and over the years the Coliseum hosted many celebrities and artists including: [[Elvis Presley]] (April 8, 1956 - 2 shows, November 17, 1970, April 30, 1973); [[The Grateful Dead]] (November 20 &amp; 21, 1973); [[The Who]] (December 4&amp;5, 1971); [[Frank Sinatra]] (May 1, 1975); [[The Rolling Stones]] (November 29, 1965; June 16, 1972); [[Led Zeppelin]] (March 25, 1970, June 21, 1972, May 25, 1973); [[Stevie Wonder]] (opening for the Rolling Stones on June 16, 1972, November 3, 1974); [[The Lovin' Spoonful|The Lovin’ Spoonful]]; [[The Monkees]]; [[Cream (band)|Cream]]; [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] (November 26, 1969, May 12, 1970); [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]]; [[The Jackson 5]] (August 20, 1971); [[Black Sabbath]] (February 27 &amp; October 18, 1971); [[The Moody Blues]]; [[Pink Floyd]] (April 17, 1975); [[Neil Diamond]] (May 8, 1971); [[Santana (band)|Santana]]; [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]; [[Yes (band)|Yes]]; [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] (August 2, 1972); [[Bob Dylan]]; [[Eric Clapton]]; [[Rammstein]] (May 20, 2012) and many more.  

The arena has been home ice to several hockey teams from various leagues including the [[Denver Cutthroats]] (2012-14), the Denver/Colorado Rangers (1987-89), the [[Denver Spurs]] (1968-75), the [[Denver Invaders]] (1963-64) and the [[Denver Mavericks]] (1959).  The coliseum was also an annual stop for the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]], the host of [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]'s [[Spring Stampede (1998)|Spring Stampede]] (1998) and the [[Colorado Wildcats]], of the [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|Professional Indoor Football League]].

Incidents of note in the coliseum's history have taken place. Former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] stopped in Denver on his tour of western states in support of Republican candidates on October 8, 1962.  In 1976, a planned [[Marvin Gaye]] concert was canceled after learning that Gaye was at his home in Los Angeles sleeping, led to rioting at the coliseum, a series of lawsuits for fraud and deceiving ticket buyers, and giving the media a field day as the top story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://denverradio.tripod.com/kdko.html "The KDKO Story"]&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 5, 2005, after a [[women's boxing]] fight held at the coliseum, boxer [[Becky Zerlentes]] died of her injuries following a third-round knockout loss to Heather Schmitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/06/sports/othersports/female-boxer-injured-in-fight-dies-afterward.html|title=Female Boxer Injured in Fight Dies Afterward|last=Sink|first=Mindy|date=2005-04-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Santana (band)|Santana]] played the Denver Coliseum six times, securing the title of House Band.

'''The Double''', in [[association football]], is the achievement of winning a country's top tier division and its primary cup competition in the same season. The lists in this article examine this definition of a double, while derivative sections examine much less frequent, continental instances. ''The Double'' can also mean beating a team both home and away in the same league season, a feat often noted as ''doing the double'' over a particular opponent.

The first club to achieve a double was [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1889, winning the [[FA Cup]] and [[The Football League]] in the [[1888–89 Football League|inaugural season]] of the league.

The team who holds the record for the most doubles is [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] of [[Northern Ireland]], with a total of 24.

==[[Asian Football Confederation|Asia]]==

==={{flagicon|Afghanistan}} Afghanistan===
In [[Afghanistan]], there are no national cups. The [[Afghan Premier League]] is the only national football competition in the country since 2012.

==={{flagicon|Australia}} Australia===
From 1977 to 1997, the double could be achieved in Australia by winning the [[National Soccer League]] and the [[NSL Cup]].

Between 1997 and 2014, Australia had no national cup competition so the traditional league and cup double could not be achieved.  Since the formation of the [[A-League]] in 2004, a double could be accomplished by winning the Premiership in the regular league season and the Championship in the finals series.  The feat of winning the [[minor premiership]] and the [[playoffs|finals]] during the NSL era was not officially recognised as a 'double'.

From [[2014–15 in Australian soccer|2014–15]], the [[FFA Cup]] will take place on an annual basis.

==={{flagicon|Philippines}} Philippines===
Due to the sporadic nature of football competitions in the country, with a league not in place until the 21st century, and only the [[United Football League (Philippines)|United Football League]] (UFL) to last more than a season, and a national cup competition not being consistently held annually, achieving a double has been mostly impossible until recently. The establishment of the UFL in 2009 led to annual league and cup tournaments. The institution of the [[PFF National Men's Club Championship]] (the national cup) in 2011 (next held in 2013) after years of dormancy meant that a domestic treble could now be contested. In 2013, a [[super cup]] is expected to be played, paving the way for a UFL treble.

Since the establishment of the UFL in 2009, a league double has been achieved twice. A domestic double (a title each from the UFL and the PFF) or a domestic treble (a UFL double and a PFF title) has yet to be won.

No team based in the United States has achieved the Treble of both MLS honours and a domestic cup in the same season although [[Toronto FC]], who play in MLS but are based in Canada, won a Treble in 2017.

The following is a list of doubles in the United States in the MLS era:

====Women====
There is no currently sanctioned National Cup in the United States for women, so the only way to achieve the Double in the United States is through a league double (winning the Shield or its equivalent for the best regular-season record).

The [[Women's United Soccer Association]] did not have formal recognition of the team with the best regular season record, but during the [[2002 WUSA season]], the [[Carolina Courage]] had the best regular season record and won the [[Founder's Cup]], the WUSA Championship Trophy.

[[Women's Professional Soccer]], which operated from 2009-2011, had one club win both the regular season championship and the WPS Championship (the latter through the playoffs): During the [[2011 Women's Professional Soccer season]], the [[Western New York Flash]] had the best regular season record, and won in the Championship match on August 27, 2011 to win the WPS Championship and the double.

The [[National Women's Soccer League]] has not seen a double in its first three seasons (2013-2015).

==={{flagicon|Brazil}} Brazil===
Due to the large size of the country and the late development of the transportion and communication infrastructure needed to support it, a nationwide competition did not emerge until 1959. For 30 years, a domestic double was not possible since there existed only one national tournament. An exception was the 1967 season, when [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] won the double consisting of the inaugural [[Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa]] and the final edition of the [[Taça Brasil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Miguel Angel |last=Hemzo |first2=Ricardo |last2=Pontes |title=Brazil Cup History |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=26 May 2016 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/brazcuphist.html |accessdate=22 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230210136/http://rsssf.com/tablesb/brazcuphist.html |archivedate=30 December 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ricardo |last=Pontes |title=List of Winners Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa (Taça de Prata) |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=25 August 1999 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/brazcuphist.html |accessdate=22 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230210136/http://rsssf.com/tablesb/brazcuphist.html |archivedate=30 December 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1970 and 2003, five New Zealand teams have won the double of the national championship ([[New Zealand National Soccer League]] (1970–92 and 2000–04), [[Superclub competition]] (1993–95), [[National Summer Soccer League]] (1996–98) or the [[1999 New Zealand island soccer leagues#National Final|New Zealand island soccer leagues National Final]] (1999)) and the [[Chatham Cup]]. From 1993 to 2003, the league champions were determined by a knockout tournament between the top-finishing teams at the end of the season, the team that finished in first place during the league phase of the season were not officially awarded a title.

From 2003, the league system in the country was drastically structured and saw the National Soccer League disband, with its teams now competing on a regional basis. The [[New Zealand Football Championship]] was formed and became the country's national league, exclusively ran for franchised teams as opposed to the traditional clubs that competed in the National Soccer League.

As with most franchise leagues, the Football Championship is split into two phases; the Premiership during the regular season and the Championship during the finals phase, which is contested between the top four-placed teams of the Premiership phase. The franchises are ineligible to participate in the Chatham Cup so the teams in the Football Championship don't have a cup competition to compete in.

===={{flagicon|Germany|Nazi}} Inter-war period====
A national cup competition was introduced in Germany in 1935, and was known as the [[DFB-Pokal#Tschammer-Pokal|Tschammer-Pokal]] for the country's then [[Hans von Tschammer und Osten|minister of sport]]. Between 1935 and the suspension of cup play in 1944 because of World War II, the Double was won only once.

* [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] – 1937

===={{flagicon|Germany}} Bundesliga era====
Play for what had become the [[DFB-Pokal]] was resumed following the war in 1953, and up until well after the formation of the [[Bundesliga]] in 1963, no club was able to complete the double. A new cup trophy was introduced as it was felt the previous one was associated with the Nazi period.

In the modern-day Bundesliga era, the double has been won by only four clubs. Bayern Munich holds the record, with 11.

===={{flagicon|GDR}} East Germany (defunct)====
Following World War II, a separate football competition emerged in the [[Allied occupation of Germany|Russian-occupied]] eastern area of Germany.
The first division [[DDR-Oberliga]] was active from 1947–48 to 1990–91 (not held 1960–61) and saw the introduction of the [[FDGB-Pokal]] in 1949. The cup competition was not staged in 1950–51, 1952–53 and 1960–61. Five doubles were won in East German competition:

* [[Dynamo Dresden]] (3) – 1971, 1977, 1990
* [[Berliner FC Dynamo|Dynamo Berlin]] – 1988
* [[F.C. Hansa Rostock|Hansa Rostock]] – 1991

Since [[German reunification|the reunification of Germany]], no former East German club has won either the Bundesliga title nor the DFB-Pokal, and as of 2014, none of these former double winners are competing in the top tier.

==={{flagicon|Sweden}} Sweden===
In Sweden, six teams have won the Double of the [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish championship]] and the [[Svenska Cupen]].

It should be noted, however, that the Svenska Cupen was not introduced until the 1941 season, while Allsvenskan started for the 1923–24 season. Svenska Cupen was also not played between 1954 and 1966. It should also be considered that winning Allsvenskan did not grant the title of [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish champions]] until 1931 and between 1982 and 1992 when the title was given to the winner of other cup tournaments that were organized at the end of the league season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/historik/ | title=Svenska mästare 1896–1925, 1931– |trans-title=Swedish champions 1896–1925, 1931– | publisher=The Swedish Football Association | work=svenskfotboll.se | accessdate=22 August 2012 | language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of doubles for [[IFK Göteborg]] and [[Malmö FF]] are affected by this. IFK Göteborg won the Swedish Championship together with Svenska Cupen in one additional season to the table below, they won the two titles in 1983, a year when they did not win Allsvenskan. Additionally while Malmö won Allsvenskan in 1989, they were not Swedish Championships for that season as they did not win the play-off following the ordinary league play. All other teams in the table below won the Swedish Championship in their double-winning seasons. The latest club to win a double is [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] who completed the feat in 2009. In 1982, IFK Göteborg also managed to combine its double with winning the UEFA Cup.

==League &amp; League Cup Double==
A rarer (though less coveted) domestic double is that of winning the league championship and the [[League Cup]]. In many leagues, this cannot be done as there is no second domestic cup competition (such as in Italy and the Netherlands) or it has been disbanded (such as in Spain and Denmark). The format of league cups and the number of participating teams can vary enormously from one country to another. In the case of Germany, it should be noted that the [[DFB-Ligapokal]] was played in the summer months prior to the [[Bundesliga]] and therefore was won in the preceding calendar year to the title win.

==Doubles in lower divisions==

In many countries, knock-out competitions exclusive to clubs outside the top division(s) also exist. This gives lower ranked clubs a chance to win a double. Examples include:

==Trans-State Double==
A very rare event. A Trans-State double occurs when a club wins a league and a cup which technically belong to two different countries and different associations. This usually happens as a result of a change in the political situation in the club's home country, or if the club has expatriated and is eligible to participate in the competitions of its native country and its adopted one.

==Continental Double==
===European Double===
In the same spirit as the European Treble, the European Double consists of winning the top tier European tournament (currently the [[UEFA Champions League]]) and domestic league title in a single season or calendar year. This has been achieved on 27 occasions by 15 clubs from 56 European competitions. [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] has achieved this on the most number of occasions (5). [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] are the only teams that have successfully defended a European Double. [[José Mourinho]] has the unique distinction of being the only manager to achieve this double with two different clubs, having done so with [[FC Porto|Porto]] (2004) and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] (2010).

====The Unbeaten Double====
In 1994–95, [[Louis van Gaal]]'s [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] with players such as [[Jari Litmanen]], [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Finidi George]], [[Nwankwo Kanu]], [[Frank de Boer]], [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Winston Bogarde]], [[Michael Reiziger]] and [[Edwin van der Sar]] succeeded an unbeaten double, winning the Dutch [[Eredivisie]] with a 27–7–0 record, and the [[UEFA Champions League]] with a 7–4–0 record. Van Gaal's dream team was the only club to achieve a European Double with no defeat.

===League &amp; Europa League Double===
The [[UEFA Europa League]] (formerly the UEFA Cup), with a domestic league title win, offers the chance for a club to win a lesser European double; but arguably a more prestigious achievement than a domestic double. This has been completed on fourteen occasions.

Similarly, there were six occasions of clubs winning their League and the now defunct [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] (CWC). No club ever won the CWC as part of a recognised treble. In the case of [[1. FC Magdeburg]] and [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], it is also worth noting that the domestic Championships they won are also now disbanded, due to [[German reunification]] and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|disintegration of the Soviet Union]] respectively.

===Continental Cup Double Outside of Europe===
{{Empty section|date=April 2018}}

==Other==
A combination of domestic league or cup and a lesser domestic or continental trophy may be won in the same season. Examples include (this list does not include doubles achieved as part of a treble):

* [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s 1960 team won both [[La Liga]] and the [[Fairs Cup]].
* [[Real Zaragoza]] won a [[Fairs Cup]] and [[Copa del Rey]] double in the 1963–64 season.
* [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] were the first English team to win a double involving European and domestic trophies. It was in 1968 when Leeds won the [[1968 Football League Cup Final|Football League Cup]] and [[1967–68 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]].&lt;ref name=Kry1&gt;Chelsea also won the League Cup and the FA cup in 2007. [http://www.krysstal.com/league1968.html "Football : Season Details: 1968"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031105911/http://www.krysstal.com/league1968.html |date=31 October 2006 }} krysstal.com (accessed 17 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] won the [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] and [[US Open Cup]] in 2003.
* [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] won the [[Georgian Cup]] and [[CIS Cup]] in 2004.
* [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] won the [[Copa del Rey]] and [[Copa Catalunya]] in 2006. This would not normally be counted as a domestic cup double comparable to those mentioned above, as the latter competition is not nationwide or league-wide.
* [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC Copenhagen]] won the [[Danish Superliga]] and the pan-Scandinavian [[Royal League]] in [[2005–06 F.C. Copenhagen season|2006]].
* [[FBK Kaunas]] won the [[Lithuanian Football Cup]] and [[Baltic League]] in 2008.
* [[Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya]] won the [[Iraq FA Cup]] and [[AFC Cup]] in 2016.
* [[Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya]] won the [[Iraqi Premier League]] and [[AFC Cup]] in 2017.

==International Double==
A national team cannot usually win a [[FIFA World Cup]] and their continental championship in the same year because they are usually not held in the same year (except for the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] until 2010), but one which wins both titles consecutively could be said to have "done the double".

Events:
* 18&amp;nbsp;km cross-country skiing
* normal hill ski jumping

The cross-country skiing part of this event was combined with the [[Cross-country skiing at the 1936 Winter Olympics|main medal event]] of cross-country skiing. Those results can be found above in this article in the cross-country skiing section. Some athletes (but not all) entered in both the cross-country skiing and Nordic combined event, their time on the 18&amp;nbsp;km was used for both events.

The ski jumping (normal hill) event was held separate from the main medal event of ski jumping, results can be found in the table below.

'''The Gene Polisseni Center''' is an ice arena on the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] campus in [[Henrietta, New York]]. Ground was broken for the project on October 19, 2012,&lt;ref name=D&amp;C_Oct19 /&gt; and the arena was officially dedicated on September 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=50983&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena is the home of the varsity [[ice hockey]] teams at RIT, replacing the [[Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena]]. Ritter Arena continues to be used as an ice arena.&lt;ref name="ritfaq"&gt;Ice Hockey Arena FAQs http://www.rit.edu/development/giving/powerplay/about-power-play.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Polisseni Center serves primarily as a hockey arena (for RIT varsity hockey and local youth programs), and it will also be a multi-purpose venue.&lt;ref name="ritfaq" /&gt; The Polisseni Center is built not far from Ritter Arena on the RIT campus, south of the Student Alumni Union, replacing portions of parking lot U.&lt;ref name="location_picked"&gt;RIT Selects Official Site for New Arena http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=49217&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising efforts==
Fundraising was started with a $1 million [[United States Dollar|USD]] donation from Stephen and Vicki Schultz.&lt;ref&gt;From out of the 'Corner' and into the spotlight http://www.rit.edu/news/athenaeum_story.php?id=48003&lt;/ref&gt; Naming rights were given based on a $4.5 million [[United States Dollar|USD]] donation from the Polisseni Foundation (with backing from [[Tom Golisano|B. Thomas Golisano]])&lt;ref name="namingpress"&gt;Future RIT Hockey Arena to become the Gene Polisseni Center http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=48695&lt;/ref&gt; and were announced on November 11, 2011 during the men's hockey game against [[Air Force Falcons men's ice hockey|Air Force]].&lt;ref name="naming_announce_ceremony"&gt;Naming Announcement Ceremony https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izxXK-QVBxs&lt;/ref&gt;

With arena construction being an estimated $30 million, the funding of the project has been divided into two components. The first half will be borrowed against RIT's endowment fund (worth $544 million),&lt;ref name=endow&gt;As of June 30, 2009.{{Cite web| title = U.S. and Canadian Institutions Listed by Fiscal Year 2009 Endowment Market Value and Percentage Change in Endowment Market Value from FY 2008 to FY 2009| work = 2009 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments | publisher = National Association of College and University Business Officers | url = http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2009_NCSE_Public_Tables_Endowment_Market_Values.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate = March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and paid back with sponsorship and ticket sales. The second half of the cost is a [[grassroots fundraising]] effort called the '''Tiger Power Play'''. The Tiger Power Play is an effort to bring in both big name donations (like [[Tom Golisano]]) as well as garner support from students and alumni. Small donations could be made by cell phone text message. Larger donations have been working directly with school administration. Sales of nameplates for seats is also available, initially costing $1,000 per nameplate, and later reduced to $500.&lt;ref name="TakeSeat"&gt;Take a Seat in the Gene Polisseni Center https://www.rit.edu/development/giving/home_makeagift_buyaseat.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.M. Allain]], CEO of [[Trans-Lux]] and an RIT graduate, donated $1 million for a new video scoreboard.&lt;ref name=D&amp;C_Oct19 /&gt;

'''Gjemselund Stadion''' is a football [[stadium]] in [[Kongsvinger]], [[Norway]] and the home ground of [[Kongsvinger Idrettslag]].

Until 2008, it was also used for track and field meets, having got rubber track in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kilfriidrett.no/index.php?vindu=om About Kongsvinger IL athletics] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.friidrett.no/stevner/statistikk/nm/Documents/amnm.htm |title=Main Championships Men |publisher=[[Norwegian Athletics Association]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=25 November 2011 |archivedate=25 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63SxANU6u?url=http://www.friidrett.no/stevner/statistikk/nm/Documents/amnm.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium received [[artificial turf]] for the 2009 season.

The record attendance is 6,794 from 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nifs.no/stadionprofil.php?stadion_id=8290 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacity has since been reduced by new regulations.

A '''Go professional''' is a professional player of the [[Go (game)|game of Go]].  The minimum standard to acquire a [[professional diploma]] through one of the major [[Go organisations]] is very high. The competition is tremendous, and prize incentives for champion players are very large. For example, the [[Honinbo (competition)|Honinbo]] Tournament has a [[grand prize]] of about $350,000.

Almost all professional players are from China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This is because until recently, only China ([[China Qiyuan]]), Japan ([[Nihon Ki-in]], [[Kansai Ki-in]]), South Korea ([[Korea Baduk Association]] (Hanguk Gi-Won)), and Taiwan ([[Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation]]) had professional Go organizations. In 2012, the [[American Go Association|AGA]] Professional System was established in the United States. In 2014, the EGF professional System was established in Europe.

Professional rankings are separate from the amateur ratings (usually ''30 kyu'' through ''7 dan''). Professional rankings are ''1 dan'' through ''9 dan'' (sometimes written ''1p'' through ''9p''). In the past, a '' 1 dan'' professional was roughly equal to a (European) ''7 dan'' amateur. However, since the competition to become a professional has increased since the late-1990s (particularly in China and Korea), it has become the case that new '' 1 dan'' professionals are much stronger than they usually were in the past.

There have also been professional Go players from the West competing in East Asian professional associations, specifically Romania, Austria, Germany, Russia, Hungary, Australia, Finland and the United States of America.

==Reaching professional level==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Professional dan rankings are normally awarded in Japan, China, South Korea or Taiwan, through one of the professional Go associations. The attainment of professional qualification differs in different countries:
* In China, a few amateurs are given the 1p grade as probationers, on the basis of success in amateur tournaments.
* In Japan, student professionals are called ''insei'', and have to play in internal insei competitions to qualify; mostly they are adolescents, and must decide whether to continue based on their chances of a career in Go, or go to university. Insei rarely take part in amateur events, but some of the top amateurs are ex-insei.
* In South Korea, four amateurs become professional every year, at the top of a ferocious league system of 80 aspiring pros. Once within the professional system, promotion is based on game results.

Most professional players begin studying Go seriously when they are children, commonly reaching professional status in their mid to late teens. Some rare students achieve professional status at a much earlier age, such as [[Cho Chikun]].

In order to qualify as a first dan professional (1p), one must have deep resources of game experience and study. In local positions, professionals are often on close ground with each other, understanding good [[Shape (Go)|shape]], [[tesuji]], [[life and death]], [[fuseki]] and [[joseki]] patterns. However, in global positions they often differ in ''positional judgement''—the global impact and interaction of josekis and differing importance of various parts of the board during the opening and middle game.

==Discrepancies among professionals==
The strength differences between professional levels is usually considered to be no more than 2-3 handicap stones. Therefore, the difference between professional dan levels corresponds to about one-third to one-fourth of a handicap stone.

Each country has different rules for promotion. Ranks may, therefore, differ somewhat from country to country.

Professionals may also differ in actual strength for a number of reasons, such as promotion not keeping up with actual gains in strength, or the fact that professional ranks (unlike kyu or amateur dan) may rise, but never fall (even if the player grows weaker). This has posed some problems, esp. with regards to international rank discernment. There are currently over one hundred people who have the rank of 9p (the highest professional rank), though many of them no longer play competitively.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} A further distinction is that some 9p players regularly hold titles, others won some titles, some entered the title leagues, and many 9p never had the fortune to achieve any of the above.

Traditionally it has been uncommon for a low professional dan to beat some of the highest pro dans. But since the late-1990s it has slowly become more common. This trend has been primarily credited to the result of increased competition to become a professional player in China and Korea. The result, that new ''1 dan'' professionals are generally stronger than other ''1 dans'' in the past.

In Japan, the ''[[Oteai]]'' system was reformed in 2004. The goal was to help alleviate some of the rank inflation that had crept in over the years. Today's Japanese system uses various benchmarks; for example, winning certain tournaments or a certain number of games, to be promoted by a rank. The Korean and Chinese systems have also been similarly changed in the past several years. These systems have increased the importance of international tournaments by incentivising rank promotion through international placement. Recent criticism has been given to this aspect, arguing that an individual may increase many professional ranks at once through the virtue of a single competition result (such as [[Piao Wenyao]]).

==Pro and amateur dan==
In theory, professional dans should beat all levels of amateur dans. In reality, the very top amateurs have proven very able. The conventional wisdom is that such players may achieve some of the insight of a pro, though perhaps not the detailed knowledge.

In China, Korea, and Japan, there are two distinct ranking sets, one for amateur players and one for professional players (who receive a fee for each game they play, bonuses for winning, and fees for other related activities such as teaching).

In the Japanese professional ranking system, distinction between ranks was traditionally considered to be roughly one third of a handicap stone (making the difference 3 pro dan equal to one amateur dan). The strength of new professionals (1 dan) was usually comparable to that of the highest ranked amateurs. Currently the professional ranks are assumed to be more bunched together, covering not much more than two amateur dans; so that pro 1 dans win some games against 9 dans. There are also a number of amateur players acknowledged as having pro 6 dan understanding of the game.

In South Korea, there are several amateur systems in use, with the recent introduction of official 7, 6 and 5 dan amateur ranks, each of which is somewhat stronger than the corresponding European grade. A 7 dan amateur will have won three national events, and will be effectively of lower-ranked pro standard. The older gup system does not easily match others. In practice, in Korean clubs, grades may be worked out against the resident strongest amateur.

The Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation also employs a dan system similar to that in Japan. It ranks its professional players from beginner dan (初段) up to 9 dan, being the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the amateur ranking system is established by another organization which certifies amateur player through competitions, ranking player from beginner dan (初段) to 6 dan with 7 dan being honorary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany and the Netherlands a "classes"-system (German: "Klassen") was established by Go pioneer Bruno Rüger in 1920. It comprised a further subdivision into Kyu/Dan half-grades with classes 18 and 17 = amateur 1 dan with the 17 being on the stronger side. It was replaced by the Japanese amateur ranking system in the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4611">In the sports of [[American football]] or [[Canadian football]], the act of '''icing the kicker''' or '''freezing the kicker''' is a tactic employed by defending teams to disrupt the process of kicking a [[field goal]] just prior to the [[Snap (American and Canadian football)|snap]]. Typically, either a player or a coach on the defending team will call a [[time-out (sport)|timeout]] just as the kicker is about to attempt a game-tying or game-winning field goal. This is intended to either stop the kick immediately as the kicker is mentally prepared, or allow for the kicker to kick immediately after the timeout so that the initial kick does not count, in an attempt to [[gamesmanship|mentally disrupt the kicker for the actual kick.]] If the tactic is successful, the kicker will miss the kick due to [[Choke (sports)|choking]]. Should the kicker make the subsequent kick, then the attempt to ice the kicker is considered unsuccessful.

This tactic is also common in basketball, known as '''icing the shooter'''.  A team may call a time out just before the opposing team's free-throw shooter is given the ball on the final free throw, in an attempt to disrupt the shooter, typically if a missed free throw allows for the calling team to either have a chance to win the game with a successful field goal, or allows the calling team to preserve a lead.

One variant of this tactic, attributed to former [[Denver Broncos]] coach [[Mike Shanahan]],&lt;ref name="nyt102107"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/sports/football/21icing.html?_r=1 "Icing Kicker: New Tactic Has Drawn Double Take"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is to call time out from the sidelines just before the ball is snapped. This prevents the kicking team from realizing the kick will not count until after the play is over. However, this has the potential to backfire: the invalid first kick could miss or be blocked, only to be followed by a successful second kick.

==Effectiveness==
In their book ''Scorecasting'', [[Tobias J. Moskowitz]] and [[L. Jon Wertheim]] analyzed “pressure” kicks from 2001 through 2009 while controlling for the distance of the field-goal attempt. They found that icing the kicker certainly does not produce the desired effect, and in some cases might even backfire. Moskowitz found that when an opposing coach iced the kicker with 15 seconds or fewer left to go in the game, those kickers tended to be more accurate.

A study was also undertaken by Scott Berry, a statistician and the former chairman of the Statistics in Sports section of the [[American Statistical Association]], and Craig Wood, a biostatistician, life-long Pittsburgh Steeler fan, who won the Inaugural Henry Hood Center for Health Research Pillar Award, was published in 2004 in the journal ''Chance''.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, S., and C. Wood. 2004. The cold-foot effect. ''Chance'' 17(No. 4):47-51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Berry and Wood looked at every field-goal attempt made in the 2002 and 2003 NFL seasons, including playoffs, and concluded that, for "pressure kicks" &amp;ndash; those made with 3 minutes or less remaining in the game or overtime period which would tie the game or put the kicking team in the lead &amp;ndash; in the 40-55 yard range, icing the kicker caused the percentage of successful attempts to drop by about ten percent for an average kicker on a sunny day. On shorter kicks, the effect was found to be negligible.&lt;ref name="nyt102107" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Ivars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20005">[[File:John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset by Sir Joshua Reynolds.png|thumb|200px|The Duke of Dorset]]
'''John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]] (24 March 1745 – 19 July 1799) was the only son of [[Lord John Philip Sackville]], second son of [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset]].  He succeeded to the dukedom in 1769 on the death of his uncle, [[Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset]]. He was the [[British Ambassador to France]] between 1783 and 1789 in the lead up to the [[French Revolution]].

He is best remembered for his love of [[cricket]].  He was both a good player and an important patron, but his interest was sharpened by gambling, cricket being a major attraction for gamblers throughout the 18th century.  His other sporting interests included [[billiards]] and [[tennis]], he also acquired a reputation as a womaniser.

==Politics==
He was returned unopposed as the [[Member of Parliament]] for the county of [[Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|Kent]] in 1768, sitting until he became the 3rd Duke of Dorset on the death of his uncle in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/sackville-john-frederick-1745-99|title=SACKVILLE, John Frederick (1745-99).|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate= 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Kent]] in 1769, a position he held until 1797. He was [[Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard]] from 1789 until his death.

==Cricket==
The young John Sackville was schooled at [[Westminster School|Westminster]], where he first became a noted proponent of cricket. He went on to join [[Hambledon Cricket Club]], based in [[Hambledon, Hampshire]], which was the leading cricket club of the day. He was joined there by [[Sir Horatio Mann]], a [[Charterhouse School|Carthusian]], and [[Charles Bennet, 4th Earl of Tankerville|Lord Tankerville]] of [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], who was his keenest rival.

Dorset gained a reputation as a keen competitor. The ''[[Morning Post]]'' in 1773 wrote: "The Duke...having run a considerable number of notches from off strokes, the opposing fielders very unpolitely swarmed round his bat so close as to impede his making a full stroke; his Grace gently expostulated with them on this unfair mode, and pointed out their danger, which having no effect, he, with proper spirit made full play at a ball and in so doing brought one of the gentlemen to the ground".&lt;ref name=GB18&gt;[[G. B. Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', Cotterell, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, Dorset presented the [[Vine Cricket Ground]], [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]], to the town, at a peppercorn rent, literally. It is one of the oldest cricket grounds in England. The first nationally reported cricket match had taken place here in the [[1734 English cricket season|1734 season]] when "The Gentlemen of Kent" beat "The Gentlemen of Sussex". Sevenoaks Town Council still has the Vine Cricket Club, though the rent doubled to two peppercorns after the pavilion was built in the 19th century. They must also pay the [[Baron Sackville|Lord Sackville]] (if asked) one cricket ball on 21 July each year.

In 1775, a full-scale riot broke out at the [[Artillery Ground]] when Dorset's side was not performing too well. In 1782 the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' noted that "His Grace is one of the few noblemen who endeavour to combine the elegance of modern luxury with the more manly sports of the old English times".

Dorset's patronage of cricket was expensive &amp;mdash; the ''[[Whitehall Evening Post]]'' in 1783 noted that the cost to Dorset of maintaining his team, before bets, was £1,000 a year. This was a lot, but less than the amounts some of his contemporaries were spending on racing.  The report went to say that Dorset was unrivalled (among noblemen) "at cricket, tennis and billiards".&lt;ref name=PVC&gt;[[G. B. Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on Pre-Victorian Cricket'', Cotterell, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador to France==
In 1784 Dorset moved to [[Paris]], surprising his critics with newfound public dedication, to serve as ambassador to [[France]]. On 16 July 1789, two days after the [[Storming of the Bastille]] he reported to [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]]  [[Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds]],  "Thus, my Lord, the greatest revolution that we know anything of has been effected with, comparatively speaking—if the magnitude of the event is considered—the loss of very few lives. From this moment we may consider France as a free country, the King a very limited monarch, and the nobility as reduced to a level with the rest of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Wikisource, https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Englishmen_in_the_French_Revolution/Chapter_II&lt;/ref&gt;"

He continued to promote cricket amongst the locals and British expatriates. In 1786 ''[[The Times]]'' reported on a cricket match played by some English gentlemen in the [[Champs-Elysées]]:

:''His Grace of Dorset was, as usual, the most distinguished for skill and activity. The French, however, cannot imitate us in such vigorous exertions of the body, so that we seldom see them enter the lists''.

The following year ''The Times'' noted that horse-racing was losing popularity in France, with cricket, on Dorset's recommendation, taking its place. In 1789 Dorset planned what might have become the first international cricket tour. His touring side, which included [[William Yalden]], [[William Bedster]] and [[Lumpy Stevens]], got as far as congregating on 10 August at [[Dover]]. But the [[French Revolution]] meant that they never got to France, thereby making his tour the first international cricket tour to be cancelled for political reasons. Just as the [[American Civil War]] 80 or so years later destroyed the prospect of cricket becoming popular there, so the [[French Revolution]] destroyed any footholds the game had in France.

Back in England, Dorset became one of the first members of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]; his public life continued in the post of Steward of the Royal Household &amp;mdash; in which capacity his main role was to keep an eye on the dissolute Prince of Wales, the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]].

==Personal life==

Dorset was a notorious womanizer. [[Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton]] became [[Prime Minister]] and his mistress [[Anne Parsons]] had the influence, if not the position, of a [[First Lady]] in her country. The Duke divorced his wife on the 23 March 1769.&lt;ref name=odnbfitz&gt;Peter Durrant, ‘FitzRoy, Augustus Henry, third duke of Grafton (1735–1811)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9628, accessed 14 Feb 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons may have become the First Minister's wife had he not discovered that Parsons was having an affair with Sackville.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;A. A. Hanham, ‘Parsons, Anne [Nancy] married name Anne Maynard, Viscountess Maynard] (c.1735–1814/15)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/75617, accessed 14 Feb 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[file:Mrs. Horton, Later Viscountess Maynard by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|left|Anne Parsons was about to be the First Minister's wife until she met Sackville]]

Sackville's best-known and most enduring mistress was the Venetian ballerina [[Giovanna Baccelli|Giovanna Zanerini]], who was the principal ballerina at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre, Haymarket]], and used the stage name [[Giovanna Baccelli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalfavourites.blogspot.in/2012/08/gabriel-to-guyonne.html Giovanna Baccelli (1753-1801)]: Born Giovanna Francesca Antonia Giuseppe Zanerini. a.k.a. La Baccelli, Jannette.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorset commissioned a painting of her in 1780–81 from [[Thomas Gainsborough]], which is reckoned to be one of Gainsborough's later masterpieces.  He also commissioned a painting by [[Joshua Reynolds]] and a sculpture showing her nude and prone on a divan and cushions; this is still to be found at [[Knole House|Knole]]. When made Ambassador to France, Dorset even took her to Paris with him, and she danced at the Opera by invitation. (When he was made [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] (KG), she wore the blue ribbon of the Garter while dancing)&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=gkplT_eNMabKiALx8f2iDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=_anug566SpAC&amp;dq=Giovanna+Zanerini%2C+Venetian+ballerina&amp;q=mistress#v=snippet&amp;q=mistress&amp;f=false ''British Diplomats and Diplomacy: 1688-1800''] University of Exeter Press, 2001 - 244 pages p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Dorset and Giovanna had a son together: John Frederick Sackville (1778–1796), who was raised by his father at Paris and Knole after the couple parted in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West, Robert (2010) Inheritance: The Story of Knole and the Sackvilles. Walker &amp; Co., New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This illegitimate son himself fathered an illegitimate son Sackville Sackville who died without issue. Giovanna herself had a relationship with [[Henry Herbert, 10th Earl of Pembroke]] (d. 1794) until his death,  and finally with a Mr. James Carey, with whom she remained until her death in 1801.  This [http://albumvenitien.blogspot.ca/2011/09/giovanna-baccelli.html French blog] claims that she married Carey, and that Dorset made her an annuity of 400 pounds.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke was also known for his affair (ca. 1777–1779) with the [[Elizabeth Smith-Stanley, Countess of Derby|Countess of Derby]], and briefly (ca. 1784) with [[Lady Elizabeth Foster]], daughter of [[Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol]] and mistress of [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]]. The first affair was notable because it did not lead to a divorce. The Countess of Derby was born Lady Elizabeth Hamilton, the only daughter of the [[James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton|6th Duke of Hamilton]] and the beauty [[Elizabeth Campbell, 1st Baroness Hamilton|Elizabeth Gunning]].&lt;ref&gt;The young Duke of Dorset, who had just inherited his title, had courted her in 1770 but failed to follow through to a betrothal. In fact, he left for France with his then-mistress Mrs [[Nancy Horton]] (Nancy Maynard), formerly mistress of [[Augustus Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|the newly re-married Duke of Grafton]].  Her mother, now Duchess of Argyll, persuaded her to choose another suitor [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby]] who would make a better husband.  The couple  who married in 1774 produced two children,  [[Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|a son and heir]] (b. 1775) and a daughter Charlotte (ca 1776-1805).  By 1777, Dorset had returned from the Continent and the relationship was revived via Lady Derby's participation in the first women's cricket match.

At this time, the Earl of Derby began courting the beautiful actress [[Elizabeth Farren|Eliza Farren]] (later his second wife in 1798), and perhaps this combined with Dorset's personal attractions convinced Lady Betty to succumb to Dorset.  Her [http://www.thepeerage.com/p1391.htm#i13907 second daughter Elizabeth Henrietta] (born ca 1778–1857) was popularly supposed to be fathered by Dorset; the Earl acknowledged the child, but Lady Derby slipped off to the up-and-coming resort [[Brighton|Brighthelmstone]] which was conveniently near [[Knole House|Knole]]. By 1779, Dorset and the pregnant Lady Derby eloped.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Earl of Derby refused to divorce his errant wife. This meant that Lady Derby was ostracized for the remainder of her life,&lt;ref&gt;Georgian (18th century) social mores were less rigid than Regency or Victorian social mores. Only the Court and the most rigid families refused to receive women who had been divorced and had subsequently married respectably. By 1804, this was beginning to change, when the new [[Elizabeth Fox, Lady Holland|Lady Holland]] was not received after she was divorced and remarried to her lover [[Henry Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]].  However, fashionable men and a few ladies still visited Holland House.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dorset soon lost interest and abandoned his lover. He was received back into society, and even received by his former mistress's betrayed husband Lord Derby.

==Marriage and descendants==
[[File:Knole, Sevenoaks in Kent - March 2009.jpg|thumb|Knole House, near Sevenoaks, Kent]]
In 1790, after returning from France, Dorset married twenty-three-year-old Arabella Diana Cope (1767-1825), daughter and co-heiress of [[Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet]], and stepdaughter of [[Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt; By his first marriage in 1769 to the Anglo-Indian heiress Amelia Watts, he was father of the Prime Minister [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]].  Her half-brother [[Charles Jenkinson, 3rd Earl of Liverpool]] (1784-1851) is the ancestor via his daughter Lady Selina Foljambe and [[Cecil Foljambe, 1st Earl of Liverpool|her eldest son]] of the present [[Earl of Liverpool]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dorset and Arabella had one son together, [[George Sackville, 4th Duke of Dorset|George John Frederick]], who was born on 15 November 1793, and two daughters, Lady Mary Sackville, born on 30 July 1792, and Lady Elizabeth Sackville, born on 11 August 1795. The Duke died in 1799, aged 54, and left a life interest in his estates and free disposition thereof (in case of the death of their young son) to his wife.  At his death, Arabella, Duchess of Dorset was thus a very wealthy heiress and from 1799 until her own death in 1825, Arabella, Duchess of Dorset (as she preferred to be known) controlled the Sackville estates and wealth in trust for their son. She remarried 1801 Charles Whitworth, who became 1st Earl of Whitworth, but had no further issue.

George '''John''' Frederick became the 4th Duke of Dorset on his father's death at the family seat, [[Knole House]], near [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]] at the age of only 6 but spent the rest of his life under the legal and financial control of his mother and stepfather. He died in a riding accident in Ireland, aged 21 having just become engaged to Lady Elizabeth Thynne (b. 1795), elder daughter of [[Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath]]. (She went on to marry October 1816 [[John Campbell, 1st Earl Cawdor|Lord Cawdor]] and have many children). Although the dukedom passed to his cousin [[Charles Sackville-Germain, 5th Duke of Dorset|Charles, Viscount Sackville]], the estates remained at the disposition of Arabella until her own death in 1825, when Knole went to her elder daughter Mary, Countess of Plymouth, and [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Buckhurst]] and the Middlesex lands (of the Cranfield family) to her younger daughter Elizabeth, Countess De La Warr.
[[File:Stoneland lodge.jpg|thumb|Buckhurst House, Sussex (originally named Stoneland)]]
Lady Mary Sackville had married firstly [[Other Windsor, 6th Earl of Plymouth]] (1789-1833) on 5 August 1811 and secondly her first husband's stepfather [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst]] on 25 May 1839. She died childless on 20 July 1864, leaving her estates to her sister [[Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr|Countess De La Warr]] and her heirs male. 

The Countess De La Ware was created Baroness Buckhurst in her own right (a title later inherited by a younger son Reginald who is ancestor of the present Earl De La Warr).  Another line stemming from this lady is that of the [[Baron Sackville|Barons Sackville]], a title created in compensation for losing the Buckhurst title.  The 1st Baron Sackville inherited Knole, according to the will of Mary, Countess of Plymouth.  (He died unmarried, as did his brother the 2nd Baron).  Their nephew, the 3rd Baron Sackville, was father of the writer [[Vita Sackville-West]] who created a garden at [[Sissinghurst]]. Knole House, still lived in by the Sackville-West family, and Sissinghurst, the family home of [[Adam Nicolson, 5th Baron Carnock|Lord Carnock]] have both been given to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

'''Racism in martial arts''' has been a common allegation.

==Media portrayal==
Some of this can be attributed to media portrayal of minority groups while giving the majority a primary role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilson | first=C.C. | last2=Gutierrez | first2=F. | last3=Chao | first3=L. | title=Racism, Sexism, and the Media: The Rise of Class Communication in Multicultural America | publisher=SAGE Publications | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-7619-2516-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlmtnbRVz6oC&amp;pg=PA96 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television shows such as ''[[The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'' have been called racist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/06/most-racist-tv-shows/the-mighty-morphin-power-rangers |title=The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers - The 50 Most Racist TV Shows of All Time |publisher=Complex.com |date=2013-06-03 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in the case of the Rangers show, a minority actor on the show attributes it to coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puga |first=Romina |url=http://fusion.net/story/6230/the-black-power-ranger-explains-why-their-colors-were-coincidental-not-racist/ |title=The black Power Ranger explains why their colors were coincidental, not racist |publisher=Fusion.net |date=2015-05-03 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite often the media would portray Asians as being proficient in martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kowner | first=R. | last2=Demel | first2=W. | title=Race and Racism in Modern East Asia: Western and Eastern Constructions | publisher=Brill | series=Brill's Series on Modern East Asia in a Global Historical Perspective | year=2012 | isbn=978-90-04-23741-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTMyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic groups and ethnic martial arts would be merged into one although they might be quite distinct.

==Alleged instances==
Bruce Lee stated that racism was widely practiced in martial arts in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wong | first=T. | title=Bruce Lee Martial Arts Training Revealed: | year=2009 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf9-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Duncan (an Afro-Panamanian), a founder of ninjitsu in America, discussed in detail the problems of racism in martial arts as he saw them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Bacor |url=http://www.sportintense.com/posts/professor-ronald-duncan-discusses-racism-in-martial-arts-and-black-men-in-martial-arts/ |title=Professor Ronald Duncan discusses racism in martial arts and Black men in martial arts &amp;#124; Sport Intensity |publisher=Sportintense.com |date=2015-02-13 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan explained how he believes he was denied recognition by [[Black Belt Magazine]] in favor of [[Steven K Hayes]] (who was white).  The Black Karate Federation was formed by Steve Sanders and others seeking to have equal treatment of black fighters in Karate tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22steve+muhammad%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c8MrVev7LIa2yQSpmICoAQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22steve%20muhammad%22&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt April 1989|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included allegations of biased officiating in martial arts tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Green | first=T.A. | last2=Svinth | first2=J.R. | title=Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation | publisher=ABC-CLIO | series=Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation | issue=v. 2 | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-59884-243-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaTfuuIlmqcC&amp;pg=PA627 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current times==
Fighters such as [[Maurice Smith (kickboxer)|Maurice Smith]] and [[Kevin Randleman]] were amongst the first black champions in MMA, but neither have received the media attention that fighters of other races have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/news/story?id=4908823|title=Mixed martial arts has its own race issues to address|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Rogan]] of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], has suggested that [[Jon Jones]], a UFC light heavyweight champion, isn't as popular as he could be due in large part to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2014/9/9/6125107/morning-report-ufc-joe-rogan-jon-jones-racism-chael-sonnen-dana-white-tuf-20-mma-news |title=Morning Report: Joe Rogan attributes Jon Jones' lack of popularity to racism, believes Jones would be embraced if he were white |publisher=Mmmfighting.com |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spectrum Stadium''' (formerly known as '''Bright House Networks Stadium''') is an [[American football]] stadium located in [[Orlando, Florida]], United States, on the main campus of the [[University of Central Florida]]. It is the home field of the [[UCF Knights football|UCF Knights]] of [[NCAA Division I FBS]] [[college football]].

The stadium opened in [[2007 UCF Knights football team|2007]] as a replacement for [[Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium|Camping World Stadium]] (then known as the Citrus Bowl) in Downtown Orlando, where the Knights had played since their inaugural season in 1979.&lt;ref name="gameday"/&gt; The steel and brick-clad stadium was designed by [[360 Architecture]] and constructed in 18 months. The stadium underwent an $8 million renovation following the [[2014 UCF Knights football team|2014 season]]. The Wayne Densch Center for Student-Athlete Leadership was built on the east facade of the stadium, and a party deck was added to the east stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UCF exploring open-air bar in Bright House Networks Stadium |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/blogs/knights-notepad/os-ucf-exploring-openair-bar-in-bright-house-networks-stadium,0,6449143.post |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=November 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202752/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/blogs/knights-notepad/os-ucf-exploring-openair-bar-in-bright-house-networks-stadium,0,6449143.post|first=Paul|last=Tenorio |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UCF President John Hitt eager to open Wayne Densch Student Athlete Leadership Center |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/ucf-knights/knights-notepad/os-ucf-john-hitt-student-athlete-leadership-center-20141121-post.html |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=November 21, 2014 |accessdate=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the renovations, its seating capacity is 44,206.&lt;ref name="capacity"/&gt; The attendance record as of the [[2017 UCF Knights football team|2017 season]] was 48,453 for an October 18, 2009 match-up against the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]].&lt;ref name="largest"/&gt; 

The stadium is known as '''The Bounce House''', as it was found to be susceptible to considerable shaking when its crowd jumps in unison. Although it was stated that the stadium was structurally sound and that this effect would not cause long-term damage to the facility, measures were undertaken following the stadium's inaugural season to reduce these effects.

==History==
&lt;!--spacing--&gt;
[[File:Bright House Stadium opening panorama.jpg|center|thumb|900px|Panoramic view of Spectrum Stadium during its inaugural game in September 2007]]

On March 31, 2005, UCF received the results of a feasibility study it commissioned on whether it should build an on-campus football stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2005/03/28/daily43.html|title=UCF gets stadium feasibility study|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 2005, the UCF Board of Trustees approved the construction of an on-campus stadium. The stadium, initially known as "UCF Stadium," was scheduled to be completed in time for the 2006 football season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://stadium.ucf.edu/PDF%20Files/CHJC_UCF_Football_FinalReport_032905.pdf|title=Market and Financial Feasibility Analysis for the Development of a New Football Stadium|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Board of Trustees delayed construction until March 2006 due to the concerns from local residents regarding potentially falling property values and noise levels from the stadium.

Construction on the new stadium began on March 22, 2006. The stadium was originally built without water fountains. The university argued that the building code used when the stadium was approved did not require water fountains. However, this claim turned out to be incorrect because the 2004 Florida building code (in effect in 2005, when the UCF Board of Trustees approved the stadium design) mandated that stadiums and other public arenas must have one water fountain for every 1,000 seats, or half that number of fountains if water was also available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zequeira |first1=Claudia |last2=Zaragoza |first2=Luis |date=September 22, 2007 |title=Code group: UCF didn't adhere to water rules |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-09-22/news/FOUNTAINS22_1_bottled-water-coolers-drinking-fountains-water-fountains |newspaper=The Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2006, it was announced that the [[2007 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas Longhorns]] would be the first opponent for the UCF Knights in the new stadium. The game, the first of three scheduled meetings between the schools,&lt;ref name="Texas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050906aaa.html|title=UCF Football to Face Texas in New On-Campus Stadium in 2007 - 2005 national champs will be first opponent in new stadium|work=UCF Athletic Association|date=May 9, 2006|accessdate=May 9, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318200616/http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050906aaa.html|archivedate=March 18, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held September 15, 2007. A sellout crowd of 45,622 saw the Knights put a scare into the Longhorns before falling 35–32.&lt;ref name="Full up: UCF sells out 1st on-campus game"&gt;{{cite news

During the opening game, vendors ran out of water at halftime, leading to the hospitalization of 18 people for heat exhaustion. In order to correct the issue, UCF provided a free bottle of water to each person at the next game and immediately began work to install at least 50 water fountains throughout the stadium in order to comply with the 2004 building code requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/14143574/detail.html?rss=orl&amp;psp=news|title=UCF To Install Water Fountains in New Stadium|work=WESH|accessdate=September 18, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114074311/http://www.wesh.com/news/14143574/detail.html?rss=orl&amp;psp=news|archivedate=January 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's naming rights were sold to cable provider [[Bright House Networks]], naming the facility Bright House Networks Stadium. In 2016, Bright House Networks was acquired by [[Charter Communications]]; in accordance with Charter's trade name for its cable services, the facility was renamed Spectrum Stadium in April 2017.&lt;ref name="yahoo-bestday"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frost: Offense had their 'best day' in Wednesday scrimmage|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/frost-offense-had-apos-best-203842611.html|website=Yahoo! Sports|accessdate=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2018, the [[Alliance of American Football| Alliance of American Football (AAF)]] announced that Orlando would host one of the AAF's first franchises, the [[Orlando Apollos]], and that the team would play at Spectrum Stadium beginning in 2019, the league's inaugural season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kevin Steimle|first1=John Breech and|title=Steve Spurrier announced as first coach and Orlando first host city for Alliance of American Football|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/steve-spurrier-announced-as-first-coach-and-orlando-first-host-city-for-alliance-of-american-football/|website=cbssports.com|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCF unveiled banners on Roth Tower honoring the team's conference championships, New Year's Six/BCS bowl wins, and their self-declared National Championship at the football team's 2018 spring game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adelson|first1=Andrea|title=UCF AD sees promise fulfilled as Knights unveil championship banner|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/23279767/ucf-knights-unveil-2017-national-champions-banner-spectrum-stadium|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Renovations ===
The stadium was designed for a planned expansion to 65,000 seats. UCF plans to begin the expansion by expanding the Roth Tower with more suites and club seating, and also adding an additional 10,000 seats in a third level on the east side of the stadium, increasing the stadium's capacity to 56,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.ucf.edu/staying-on-offense-70m-sports-projects/|title=Staying on Offense: $70M Sports Projects|work=UCF|date=May 4, 2010|accessdate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity for the 2015 season dropped by 1,117 seats when UCF removed seats on the east sidelines to construct the "Carl Black and Gold Cabana," which includes a bar, catered barbecue, and padded seats above the bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/12231943/ucf-knights-build-beach-club-football-stadium |title=Football, with touch of beach, at UCF |first=Darren |last=Rovell |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=January 26, 2015 |accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/ucf-knights/knights-notepad/os-ucf-east-side-club-post.html |title=UCF's East Side Club gets a new name, new six-figure title sponsor |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=August 10, 2015 |accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, private field-level [[Cabana (structure)|cabanas]] were erected in the south endzone, adjacent to the new J. &amp; J. Rosengren Lounge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ucfknights.com/news/2017/8/31/football-rosengren-lounge-field-cabanas-open.aspx |title=Rosengren Lounge, Field Cabanas Open|publisher=UCFKnights.com|date=August 31, 2017|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, additional field-level cabanas were added to the north endzone, as well as Loge cabana tables along the top rim of the grandstands.

In 2016, UCF removed its original scoreboard, located at the north end of the stadium, and replaced it with a full LED scoreboard measuring 114&amp;nbsp;ft x 36&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCF Athletics bringing in larger, brighter LED screens for fall|url=http://www.news965.com/news/news/local/ucf-athletics-bringing-larger-brighter-led-screens/nrPr3/|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, UCF replaced the stadium's original auxiliary scoreboard, located at the south end of the stadium, and replaced it with a ribbon board that measures approximately {{convert|7|x|199|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bigger Boards|url=http://ucfknights.com/news/2016/5/17/Bigger_Boards.aspx?path=general|website=ucfknights.com|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the university sued the architects and contractors that designed and constructed the stadium. Cited in the lawsuit were claims of "defects and deficiencies" which ostensibly led to "premature wear of the steel," as well as visible rust issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/classified/realestate/os-ucf-stadium-lawsuit-20170929-story.html|title=UCF sues over defects to football stadium|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|first=Mary|last=Sanklin|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Bounce House"==
The stadium is also known as "The Bounce House"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UCF continues to study why its football stadium bounces |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2008-03-08/news/stadium08_1_zombie-stadium-ucf |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |date=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bright House Networks Stadium |url=http://www.stadiumjourney.com/stadiums/bright-house-networks-stadium-s388/ |publisher=Stadium Journey |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCF Stadium Bounce House |url=http://www.wctv.tv/news/APNews/headlines/26205499.html |publisher=WCTV |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |date=August 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233128/http://www.wctv.tv/news/APNews/headlines/26205499.html |archivedate=December 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Miami Hurricanes Will Beat UCF If...|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/272813-the-miami-hurricanes-will-beat-ucf-if|work=Bleacher Report|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=December 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017084342/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/272813-the-miami-hurricanes-will-beat-ucf-if|archivedate=October 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the stadium vibrates and shakes when fans jump in unison, most notably when [[Zombie Nation (artist)|Zombie Nation]]'s song "[[Kernkraft 400]]" is played.&lt;ref name="shake"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-11-30/news/stadium30_1_stadium-ucf-louie |title=Jumpy Fans Worry UCF |work=Orlando Sentinel|date=November 30, 2007 |accessdate=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many fans like this feature, some are uneasy with the bouncing. Stadium officials claimed the stadium was structurally sound, and an independent contractor confirmed that the bouncing will not damage the stadium and shorten its expected 50–year useful life. Still, a project was begun prior to the 2008 season to reinforce the stadium superstructure and mitigate the bouncing effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UCF to Take Bounce Out of Stadium|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2008-08-02/news/bounce02_1_stadium-fans-williams-brice|first=Luis|last=Zaragoza|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the bouncing has been greatly reduced by the stadium reinforcements, it is still noticeable - sometimes enough to shake TV cameras during televised games. For the [[2010 Conference USA Football Championship Game]], [[ESPN College Football|ESPN]] set up a camera position outside of the stadium to eliminate camera bounce caused by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=C-USA Football Championship Blog|url=http://conferenceusa.cstv.com/ot/10-m-footbl-blog.html|work=Conference USA|date=December 2008|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Stadium''' was a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Bucharest]]. It was the home ground of [[Venus Bucharest]]. It held 15,000 people.

Venus arena was inaugurated in 1931 as a field dedicated only to football. One of the oldest and most truthful leaders of the club, Alexandru Eladescu, sold a forest, private property, to obtain the necessary money to build the stadium. It held five [[Romanian Cup]] finals and one [[Romania national football team|Romania]] match on May 18, 1939, against [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] finished 4-0. After the communist authorities came to power in Romania the club was dissolved and the arena demolished. It was situated where ''Parcul Operei'' is today.

[[File:Helmut Haller - 1960s - Juventus FC.jpg|thumb|[[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] first popularised the star in 1958.&lt;ref name=FIFA/&gt;]]

In [[football]], some national and club sides include one or more [[Star (polygon)|stars]] as part of (or beside) the [[badge]] (often referred to as a "[[crest (sports)|crest]]") appearing on their shirt, to represent important trophies the team has previously won.  Often this is a unilateral decision by a team itself,  rather than a specific privilege earned or sanctioned by any governing body and as such, the relevance of these stars on a club's shirt is somewhat tenuous.

==Standardised significance==

===Club===
[[File:Scudetto.svg|thumb|upright|left|The ''scudetto'' (Italian for "little shield") was the source of inspiration for the adding of stars.]]

The first team in association football history to adopt a star was [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and [[Serie A]] title, at the time, the new national record.&lt;ref name=FIFA&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/news/newsid=687173/index.html|title=FIFA awards special 'Club World Champion' badge to AC Milan|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an extension of the existing convention by which the reigning champions are entitled to display the [[scudetto]] on their shirts for the following season. The star was later formally adopted by some organisations as a symbol for ten titles, and the ratio of one star for ten titles has become the "most common" arrangement.&lt;ref name = "Talksport FC Bayern"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Bayern Munich have only four stars on their shirt|work=talkSPORT|publisher=UTV Media|date=11 March 2014|accessdate=17 June 2016|url=http://talksport.com/football/why-bayern-munich-have-only-four-stars-their-shirt-14031183047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juventus unofficially won their 30th league title in [[2011–12 Serie A|2011–12]], but a dispute with the [[Italian Football Federation]], who stripped Juventus of their 2004–05 and 2005–06 titles due to their involvement in a [[2006 Italian football scandal]], left their official total at 28. However, they elected to wear no stars at all the [[2012–13 Serie A|following season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=11 July 2012|title=Juventus reveal star-less shirts|work=football-italia.net|publisher=Football Italia|accessdate=16 June 2016|url=http://www.football-italia.net/21026/juventus-reveal-star-less-shirts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juventus won their 30th title in [[2013–14 Serie A|2013–14]] and thus earned the right to wear their third star, however, club president [[Andrea Agnelli]] stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, thus having the right to wear two stars, "to emphasise Juventus' superiority".&lt;ref name="Gladwell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/italian-serie-a/story/1811729/juventus-wont-add-star-to-badge-for-30th-title |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate=18 October 2014 |title=Juventus won't add 3rd star to badge |first=Ben |last=Gladwell |publisher=[[ESPN FC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the [[2015–16 Serie A|2015–16 season]], Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers [[Adidas]].&lt;ref name=reintroduced&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwhitereadallover.com/2015/7/1/8875999/juventus-2015-16-kits-adidas|title=Juventus' new 2015-16 adidas jerseys have officially arrived|publisher=SBNation|author=Danny Penza|date=1 July 2015|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] displayed five stars above the badge on their shirts in 2003 to symbolise their 50 league titles. [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] have one star above their badge to represent their triumph in the 1967 European Cup. Aberdeen displayed two stars to commemorate their 1980s wins in the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[European Super Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://talksport.com/stars-and-gripes-clubs-ridiculous-symbols-their-shirts-including-man-united-liverpool-ipswich-and#DDCGzt4MkjTPM23d.99| title=Stars and gripes: clubs with ridiculous symbols on their shirts, including Man United, Liverpool, Ipswich and Huddersfield| first=Craig| last=Bloomfield| website=talksport.com| date=14 June 2011| access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Barrie McKay 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] wear 5 stars to represent the 50 league championships they have amassed.]]

[[Football in Germany]] has two official star systems operating in parallel. In 2004, the DFL, which governs the [[Bundesliga]] (the top two divisions), introduced ''[[Bundesliga#Verdiente Meistervereine|Verdiente Meistervereine]]'' (roughly "distinguished champion clubs").  This has a sliding scale of 1, 2, 3, and 4 stars for 3, 5, 10, and 20 titles.&lt;ref name="stuttgart-bundesliga"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/news/2006/index.php?f=61620.php |language=German |date=19 May 2007 |accessdate=6 May 2008 |title=Stuttgart holt ersten Stern |trans-title=Stuttgart gets first star |publisher=[[Bundesliga]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521042147/http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/news/2006/index.php?f=61620.php |archivedate =21 May 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes only Bundesliga titles, excluding titles from before the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963, and from the [[DDR-Oberliga|former East German League]]. [[Berliner FC Dynamo|Dynamo Berlin]] (playing in [[NOFV-Oberliga Nord|the fourth level]]) unilaterally began wearing three unapproved stars for its East German titles.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1581269,00.html |title=East Germany's Star Quality in Question |date=13 May 2005 |accessdate=6 May 2008 |publisher=dw-world.de |first=John |last=Kluempers}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, the [[German Football Association|DFB]], which governs non-Bundesliga football, allowed former champions playing outside the Bundesliga to display a single star inscribed with the number of titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dfb.de/fileadmin/Assets/pdf/durchfuehrungsbestimmung.pdf|title=Durchführungsbestimmungen|trans-title=Clothing instructions|page=54|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408212148/https://www.dfb.de/fileadmin/Assets/pdf/durchfuehrungsbestimmung.pdf|archivedate=8 April 2008|deadurl=yes|work=dfb.de|publisher=German Football Association|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, Dynamo Berlin switched to a single approved star inscribed with the number 10. [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth|Greuther Fürth]] retains three silver stars on its club badge, but not on its shirts.

[[Major League Soccer]]'s previously informal system, one star per [[MLS Cup]] title, was standardised in 2006, with the defending champions wearing the [[MLS Cup#Scudetto|MLS Scudetto]], like the [[Serie A]] system, for one season before adding a new star.  Starting in 2012, the Scudetto was replaced with a single gold star worn by reigning champions above any other silver championship stars. In 2016, this system changed again in recognition of the [[LA Galaxy]]'s fifth championship title: champion clubs during their title defence will wear a large gold star (featuring the year of the league win) above other smaller stars set in silver; clubs with five championships (presently only the Galaxy) will wear one gold star; and teams with one-to-four MLS Cup wins will wear one silver star for each victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here's what's changing about championship stars on MLS jerseys this year|date=4 February 2016|first=Arielle|last=Castillo|work=mlssoccer.com|publisher=Major League Soccer|accessdate=16 June 2016|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/02/04/here-s-what-s-changing-about-championship-stars-mls-jerseys-year}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, they also use a system based around different coloured stars for different trophy wins: Australian winners of the [[AFC Champions League]] will wear a gold star inscribed with the number of wins, while [[A-League]] and [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] victory is recognised with a silver star similarly embossed; reigning league or [[FFA Cup]] champions will also wear a gold competition emblem in the season following the championship.&lt;ref name = "Australia"&gt;{{Cite news|work=fourfourtwo.com/au|publisher=FourFourTwo Australia|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/au/news/ffa-approves-strip-stars-champion-clubs#|accessdate=16 June 2016|title=FFA approves strip stars for champion clubs|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway a team will display a star for every 10 titles in [[Tippeligaen]]. [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] is the only team with more than 10 titles. Since 2006, all Swedish football clubs that have won ten or more [[Swedish football champions|Swedish championships]] have added a star above their badge. [[Malmö FF]] added a second star following its 20th championship title win in 2017. The same system has applied in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Eredivisie]] from the [[Eredivisie 2007–08|2007–08 season]] onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eredivisie.nl/subpage.aspx?l1=1637&amp;subaction=details&amp;newsid=186&amp;type=0|publisher=[[Eredivisie]]|title=Kampioenssterren wijzen op historische roem|trans-title=Champions' stars show past glories|date=11 May 2007|accessdate=16 May 2007|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024161254/http://www.eredivisie.nl/subpage.aspx?l1=1637&amp;subaction=details&amp;newsid=186&amp;type=0|archivedate=24 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation was suggested by [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], after the club won its twentieth title in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.psv.nl/web/show/id=58980/contentid=20826 |title=Reigning champions PSV display two stars on their shirts |quote="We have conceived a plan to not only introduce these two stars on the championship badge, but on the shirts as well", explained PSV Manager Match Organisation Ron Verkerk. "We have made a proposal to the KNVB, the Royal Dutch Football Association and the ECV, the Association of Eredivisie clubs, and they have both independently responded enthusiastically." |publisher=[[PSV Eindhoven]] |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=16 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504183523/http://english.psv.nl/web/show/id%3D58980/contentid%3D20826 |archivedate=4 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] currently have the right to wear three stars since they have won the league more than 30 times. PSV have the right to wear two stars with their 21 league titles, while [[Feyenoord]] and [[HVV Den Haag]] can add one for their 15 and 10 titles, respectively. HVV won all titles before 1915 and is currently playing in the fourth level of the Dutch league system. In Malta, [[Floriana F.C.|Floriana]], [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]] and [[Sliema Wanderers F.C.|Sliema Wanderers]] boast 2 Golden Stars on their badges having won 25, 20 and 26 titles, respectively, while [[Hibernians F.C.|Hibernians]] have one star thanks to their 10 titles. No other team in the Maltese League has the golden star on their badge.
{{double image|left|Tampa Bay Rowdies logo (one gold star).svg|100|Tampa Bay Rowdies logo (two green stars).svg|100|The [[Tampa Bay Rowdies]] added a star in recognition of a title won by a [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–93)|former club with the same name]]. They have since added another star after the new club won a league championship of its own.||Rowdies logo used from 2011-2013|Rowdies logo used since 2013|}}

Occasionally, stars are added to badges of successor or phoenix clubs for the achievements of defunct predecessors. An example of this is the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies]]. They added a star to represent the [[Soccer Bowl]], the championship of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|original NASL]], won by the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–93)|original Tampa Bay Rowdies]] in [[Soccer Bowl '75|1975]]. The club has since added a second star, after the new club won the [[Soccer Bowl 2012|2012]] edition of the resurrected Soccer Bowl in the [[North American Soccer League|new NASL]].&lt;ref name="Rowdies" /&gt; This approach is atypical: neither the [[Montreal Impact]] nor the [[Seattle Sounders FC]] franchises retained the stars worn by the old clubs when they joined the MLS.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The [[Seattle Sounders (1994–2008)|Seattle Sounders]] that played from 1994 to 2008 wore four stars, while the former [[Montreal Impact (1992–2011)|Montreal Impact]] team wore three stars at the time of their move.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Impact, the new team paid tribute to the former team's first title through the stripes on their badge.&lt;ref name = "Impact MLS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Montreal Impact Logo|work=sportslogos.net|publisher=Chris Creamer's Sports Logos Page|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/ugsnhv0oteegw8sjs3e4wivvg/Montreal_Impact/2012/Primary_Logo|accessdate=1 September 2014|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as predecessor clubs, victories in the national leagues of defunct countries have also been represented by stars. [[FC Dynamo Kyiv]] have two stars, commemorating championships won in the [[Soviet Union football league system|Soviet]] and [[Ukrainian football league system]]s. The same is true of [[Belgrade]] clubs [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] and [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] who have won titles in [[Yugoslav First League|Yugoslavia]], [[First League of Serbia and Montenegro|Serbia and Montenegro]] and present-day [[Serbian SuperLiga|Serbia]], while [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]'s stars refer to their [[Soviet Top League]] and [[Russian Football Premier League]] achievements.

The star has given rise to a byword to winning trophies. Examples of this include when [[Fawaz Al-Hasawi]], owner of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], was quoted as saying "maybe [Nottingham Forest] will have a third star",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fawaz Al Hasawi aiming to guide Nottingham Forest back to Europe|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11727/8557582/fawaz-al-hasawi-aiming-to-guide-nottingham-forest-back-to-europe|work=Sky Sports|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|date=11 March 2013|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[France national football team|France]] international [[Paul Pogba]]'s comments in the days before the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final]]: "[[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] do not have stars – they want one. They have done very well and they want the victory, like us. But I do not have a star. It’s on the shirt, but I did not win it. We want to go looking for it like all players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Pogba eager to earn his own World Cup star on France shirt|date=12 July 2018|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Belfast Telegraph|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/paul-pogba-eager-to-earn-his-own-world-cup-star-on-france-shirt-37110100.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
[[File:Nike Brazil national football team home jersey.JPG|thumb|upright|The first international team to add stars was [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. Their badge now features five stars.]]

[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] had two stars above their badge in 1968. It was used briefly (friendly matches only) and then removed. After winning their third [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in [[Football World Cup 1970|1970]], three stars was officially added and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] did likewise in [[Football World Cup 1982|1982]]. [[Germany national football team|Germany]] added three in 1996, one in each of the [[Flag of Germany|German flag]]'s colours. All world champions have since followed suit. Brazil, Italy, and Germany have since added more stars, after they won later tournaments (cf. [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]), while France are the most recent nation to add a star, commemorating their [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] triumph less than an hour after victory in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second star added to France's World Cup kit after Russia 2018 triumph over Croatia|work=CBS Sports|url=https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/world-cup/news/second-star-added-to-frances-world-cup-kit-after-russia-2018-triumph-over-croatia/|date=15 July 2018|first1=Roger|last1=Gonzalez|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] display four stars, regarding their triumphs in the [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympics]] as equivalent to their later World Cup wins, as there was no World Cup at the time. ''[[Eurosport]]'' claim that FIFA only recognises the two World Cup wins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 10 most infamous kits in World Cup history|work=uk.eurosport.yahoo.com|publisher=Eurosport|date=4 June 2014|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/the-rio-report/world-cup-kits-10-interesting-anecdotes-074914947.html|accessdate=3 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103032341/https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/the-rio-report/world-cup-kits-10-interesting-anecdotes-074914947.html|archivedate=3 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' state that "when FIFA revised its constitution in 1950, they formally recognised that Uruguay were four-time world champions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2664274/Luis-Suarezs-Uruguay-won-World-Cup-twice-four-gold-stars-crest.html|title=Luis Suarez's Uruguay have won the World Cup twice, so why do they have four gold stars above their crest?|first=Adam|last=Shergold|date=21 June 2014|accessdate=3 November 2014|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the equipment regulations for FIFA competitions, section 16.1 states " Those Member Associations that have won one or more of the previous 
editions of the FIFA World Cup™ or the FIFA Women’s World Cup™ may display on the Playing Equipment used by their first men’s or women’s representative teams a five-pointed star, or other symbol as instructed by FIFA, per edition of the FIFA World Cup™ (men’s shirt) or FIFA Women’s World Cup™ (women’s shirt) won by the Member Association"&lt;ref name="fifa-equipment-regs"&gt;

==Ad hoc adoptions==
More recently, club teams have added stars either upon winning a landmark trophy, or in response to a [[Major football rivalries|rival team]]'s having added stars. In the [[Liga I|Romanian first league]], [[FC Steaua Bucureşti|Steaua]] uses 2 stars above their badge since they won their 20th title. Since then [[FC Dinamo Bucureşti|Dinamo]] added a star for the 18 championships they won. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] sported a star in their [[UEFA Champions League]] matches on their special European home kit between [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League|1997]] and [[1998–99 UEFA Champions League|1999]].&lt;ref name = "Talksport"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stars and gripes: clubs with ridiculous symbols on their shirts, including Man United, Liverpool, Ipswich and Huddersfield|first=Craig|last=Bloomfield|date=14 June 2011|url=http://talksport.com/stars-and-gripes-clubs-ridiculous-symbols-their-shirts-including-man-united-liverpool-ipswich-and|accessdate=2 November 2014|work=Talksport|publisher=UTV Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate their second victory [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|that year]], they added an extra star to that kit for the [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League|1999–00]] season.&lt;ref name="Talksport" /&gt; [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] likewise wore four stars in [[2001–02 UEFA Champions League|2001–02]], their first campaign in the competition since the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="Talksport" /&gt; They wore five stars in the competition in [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|2005–06]] after their fifth victory. Instead of stars, UEFA introduced a ''[[European Champion Clubs' Cup#Multiple-winner badge|multiple winner badge]]'' in 2000–01 season, currently worn by five teams who have won the Champions League either five times or more in total, or three times in a row.
[[File:Jonny Wilkinson September 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Using stars to represent trophy wins has spread to other sports: [[rugby union]] club [[RC Toulonnais|Toulon]] are an example of this.]]

Occasionally, stars are temporarily added for one season, usually to commemorative kits to celebrate the anniversary of a particular event in the club's history. [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] sported two stars on their 2006–07 shirt, for the club's 125th anniversary, to celebrate their two league titles in 1921 and 1960.&lt;ref name="Talksport" /&gt;  Likewise [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] in 2009–10, also for their 125th anniversary, commemorating their 1900 and 1903 FA Cup triumphs; Bury have since revived the stars, from 2011–12, after a season's absence.&lt;ref name = "Bury"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Bury/Bury.htm|title=Bury|work=historicalkits.co.uk|publisher=Historical Football Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commemorating anniversaries in this way is not confined to English clubs: Peruvian side [[Club Universitario de Deportes|Universitario]] celebrated their 90th anniversary by adding 26 stars to their kits worn home&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Universitario 90th Anniversary Umbro Special Edition Home Shirt|date=14 September 2014|work=footballshirtculture.com|url=http://www.footballshirtculture.com/14/15-Kits/universitario-90th-anniversary-umbro-special-edition-home-shirt.html|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Universitario 90th Anniversary Umbro Special Edition Away Shirt|date=14 September 2014|work=footballshirtculture.com|url=http://www.footballshirtculture.com/14/15-Kits/universitario-90th-anniversary-umbro-special-edition-away-shirt.html|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a practice limited to clubs, as in 2004, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] wore a star on their shirts specially for [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], to commemorate their victory in the [[UEFA European Football Championship|competition]] in [[UEFA Euro 1992|1992]].

In [[women's football (soccer)|women's football]], the emerging ad hoc standard is to wear stars on the sleeve instead of above the badge. Two of the four teams that have won the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] to date — [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] — use this practice, as did three-time Women's World Cup winners, the [[United States women's national soccer team|USA]], until moving the stars to the back collar in 2007. The United States has returned its two stars to above the badge on their new uniforms for the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011 Women's World Cup]],&lt;ref name = "USWNT"&gt;{{cite news|title=NIKE US WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM (USWNT) 2011 KIT|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/performance/football-apparel/2011/04/nike-us-women-s-national-team-uswnt-2011-kit/|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=soccerbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have added a third since their [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] championship.&lt;ref name = "USWNT 3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Star Jerseys Unveiled During FOX Special|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2015/07/07/09/34/150707-wnt-fox-three-star-special|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2016|work=ussoccer.com|publisher=United States Soccer Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The practice of using stars to signify major titles has spread to other football codes, and to unrelated sports. For example, in 2009, [[Meath GAA|Meath senior Gaelic football team]] began wearing seven stars on their jerseys, signifying their seven [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pressreader.com/ireland/drogheda-independent/20090211/283527971711079&lt;/ref&gt; In [[rugby union]], [[RC Toulonnais|Toulon]] added a star above its badge after winning the [[Heineken Cup]] in [[2013 Heineken Cup Final|2013]], added a second star immediately after winning the same competition in [[2014 Heineken Cup Final|2014]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france-top-14-2013-14/rugby/story/227527.html |title=Wilkinson's name stitched into Toulon shirts |publisher=''ESPN Scrum'' |date=31 May 2014 |accessdate=31 May 2014 |quote=Toulon's shirts [for the 2014 [[Top 14]] final] will also feature a second silver star above the club's crest, marking their back-to-back Heineken Cup titles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a third after winning the inaugural [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] in [[2015 European Rugby Champions Cup Final|2015]]; English rugby union side [[Sale Sharks]] wear a gold star in tribute to their sole [[Premiership Rugby|Premiership]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sale Sharks Samurai 2015/16 Home &amp; Alternate Shirts|date=28 September 2015|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=rugbyshirtwatch.com|url=https://rugbyshirtwatch.com/2015/09/28/sale-sharks-samurai-201516-home-alternate-shirts/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[basketball]], the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|men's team]] of [[Indiana University Bloomington]] added five stars to its shorts, representing its five [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championships]], for the [[2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2015 NCAA tournament]], and made the stars at that location a permanent fixture for the [[2015–16 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|2015–16 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/14067435/uni-watch-2015-16-college-basketball-season-preview-november-madness |title=Uni Watch 2015-16 college basketball season preview: November madness |first=Paul |last=Lukas |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=10 November 2015 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stars that do not signify particular titles==
American club [[Philadelphia Union]] has 13 stars that represent the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 original colonies]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CLUB HISTORY|url=http://www.philadelphiaunion.com/club/history|publisher=Philadelphia Union|work=philadelphiaunion.com|accessdate=2014-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow [[Major League Soccer]] franchise [[Montreal Impact]] have four stars on their badge, which are symbolic of the nationalities of the peoples who founded the city of [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="Impact MLS" /&gt; The four nations are regularly used in Montreal imagery, as the city [[flag of Montreal|flag]] and [[coat of arms of Montreal|coat of arms]] both reference them.

The badge of [[Club Atlético Peñarol|Peñarol]] of [[Uruguay]] has 11 stars for the 11 players.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Manchester City F.C.#Club badge and colours|badge introduced by Manchester City]] in 1997 had three stars to give it a "more [[Continental Europe|continental]] feel".&lt;ref&gt;From the official 1997 press release at the badge's introduction; quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.uit.no/mancity/club/history.html |title=Manchester City: OFFICIALS AND HISTORY |first=Svenn |last=Hanssen |accessdate=2007-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130223003841/http://www.uit.no/mancity/club/history.html |archivedate=23 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3 stars do not represent titles or trophies. City brought in a new club badge in 2016 with no stars on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Manchester City|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Manchester_City/Manchester_City.htm|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=historicalkits.co.uk|publisher=Historical Football Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sivasspor]] of [[Turkey]] also has three stars on their badge. They do not represent any championships either.

[[Portsmouth F.C.]] has featured a star (of various designs) in its badge since 1913.  The star does not represent trophies or titles won, instead, the Portsmouth badge was based upon symbols found in the official coat of arms owned by [[Portsmouth City Council]].

For the 2002–03 season, the badge of Greek club [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] had 3 stars.  One gold representing the team's partaking in the [[1971 European Cup Final]], and 2 white stars representing the team's participation at the 1985 European Cup semi-finals and the 1996 [[UEFA Champions League]] semi-finals respectively. Because none of these stars represent titles or trophies, opposition fans in Greece mocked this.

[[Johor Darul Takzim F.C.]] has 3 stars above its badge, for each time the club changed its name; from PKENJ to Johor and finally Johor Darul Takzim.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Following the crash of [[LaMia Flight 2933]], Brazilian club [[Associação Chapecoense de Futebol|Chapecoense]] incorporated a star into its badge as a tribute to those who perished in the incident.&lt;ref name="chape" /&gt;

Noakes was born in  [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] (today Harare, Zimbabwe) in 1949 and moved to South Africa at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health24.com/fitness/Specific_Sports/16-2175-2181-2277,50688.asp|title=How Tim Noakes wants you to train|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614091149/http://www.health24.com/fitness/Specific_Sports/16-2175-2181-2277,50688.asp|archivedate=14 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had arrived in what was then Southern Rhodesia in 1946, establishing a successful tobacco exporting company that he sold in 1954.&lt;ref name="NoseWeek2001"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dear Editor: Tim Noakes replies | url = http://www.noseweek.co.za/article/186/Dear-Editor| publisher= Noseweek| volume = 31 | accessdate = 6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young boy his main sporting interest was cricket. Noakes attended Monterey Preparatory School in [[Constantia, Cape Town]]. One year was spent as a foreign exchange student at [[Huntington Park High School]] in [[Huntington Park, California]].   Prep school was followed by [[Diocesan College]]. He has earned an [[MBChB]] (1974), [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] (1981), and [[DSc|DSc (Med)]] (2002).

==Research==
In 1980 Noakes was tasked to start a sports science course at the [[University of Cape Town]].  Noakes went on to head the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]-funded Bioenergetics of Exercise Research Unit, which was later changed to the MRC/UCT Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine.&lt;ref name="ESSM"&gt;[http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/essm/ MRC/UCT Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121224222317/http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/essm/ |date=24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s Noakes co-founded the Sports Science Institute of South Africa,&lt;ref name="SSISA"&gt;[http://www.ssisa.com/ Sports Science Institute of South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; with former South African rugby player [[Morne du Plessis]]. His unit's physiological research has produced over 370 scientific articles since 1996.

He is a leading researcher on the condition now known as [[Exercise-associated hyponatremia]] (EAH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Speedy|first=DB|author2=Noakes TD |author3=Schneider C |title=Exercise-associated Hyponatremia: A review.|journal=Emerg Med (Fremantle)|year=2001|volume=13|pages=17–27|url=http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/2/1/151.full|accessdate=6 January 2014|doi=10.1046/j.1442-2026.2001.00173.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first recognized this condition in a female runner during the 1984 [[Comrades Marathon]], and published his findings in 1985 in the journal ''Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise''. Noakes hosted the 1st International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference in [[Cape Town]] in May 2005.

Noakes is also known for renewing and elaborating the idea first proposed by the 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] winner [[Archibald Hill]] that a [[central governor]] regulates exercise to protect body [[Human homeostasis|homeostasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2005 he undertook a series of pioneering experiments in the Arctic and Antarctic on South African (British-born) swimmer [[Lewis Gordon Pugh]] to understand the full range of human capability in extreme cold.  He discovered that Pugh had the ability to raise his core body temperature before entering the water in anticipation of the cold and coined the phrase 'anticipatory thermo-genesis' to describe it.  

In 2007, Noakes was the expedition doctor for Pugh’s one kilometer swim at the [[Geographic North Pole]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Controversy==

The [[low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet]], often referred to as the "Tim Noakes", "[[William Banting|Banting]]" or LCHF diet in South Africa, has gained considerable popularity in the country since 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.health24.com/Diet-and-nutrition/Healthy-foods/Tim-Noakes-Diet-The-Paleo-Diet-is-it-worth-the-switch-20140218|title=Paleo diet - is it worth the switch?|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=19 February 2014 |website=health24.com |publisher= |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has also drawn a significant amount of criticism. Noakes has claimed, among others{{clarification needed|date=April 2018}}, that high blood cholesterol is not a contributing factor to heart disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.health24.com/Medical/Heart/Foods-diet-and-your-heart/Experts-warn-against-Noakes-diet-20130212|title=Experts warn against Noakes diet|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=25 February 2014 |website=health24.com |publisher= |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been criticized for publishing a series of case reports as a scientific paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Tim-Noakes-weight-loss-paper-sparks-row-20150429|title=Tim Noakes’ weight-loss paper sparks row|author=&lt;!--City Press; no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 October 2013 |website=news24.com |publisher=CityPress |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter&lt;ref name="UCT Open Letter to Cape Times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=De Villiers|first1=W.|last2=Mayosi|first2=B.|last3=Opie|first3=L.|last4=Senekal|first4=M.|title=Noakes diet and health implications: an open letter to the Cape Times|url=http://www.health.uct.ac.za/news/noakes-diet-and-health-implications-open-letter-cape-times|website=Faculty of Health Sciences|publisher=University of Cape Town|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (dated 22 August 2014) to the [[Cape Times]], fellow [[University of Cape Town|University of Cape Town (UCT)]] academics argued against Noakes's dietary ideas. The letter was signed by Wim de Villiers (Dean, Faculty of Health Sciences), [[Bongani Mayosi]] (Head, Department of Medicine), Lionel Opie (Hatter Institute of Cardiology, Department of Medicine) and Marjanne Senekal (Head, Division of Human Nutrition). The letter was copied to Noakes and several others. In the letter the academics expressed, among others, "...serious concern that Professor Timothy Noakes, a colleague respected for his research in sports science, is aggressively promoting this diet as a ‘revolution’, making outrageous unproven claims about disease prevention, and maligning the integrity and credibility of peers who criticise his diet for being evidence-deficient and not conforming to the tenets of good and responsible science. This goes against the University of Cape Town’s commitment to academic freedom as the prerequisite to fostering responsible and respectful intellectual debate and free enquiry."

Noakes, also in the form of an open letter to the [[Cape Times]], responded to the criticism by his colleagues.&lt;ref name="BizNews Report: Open Letters De Villiers et al. &amp; Noakes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sboros|first1=M.|title=Tim Noakes – backlash as UCT academics say he’s a danger to the public|url=http://www.biznews.com/health/2014/08/25/tim-noakes-backlash-uct-academics-say-hes-danger-public/|accessdate=17 February 2016|publisher=BizNews.com|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accused the [[University of Cape Town|UCT]] Faculty of Health Sciences of consistently misrepresenting his public message "...which is simply the following: a high carbohydrate diet is detrimental to the health of persons with [[insulin resistance]] whereas [[Low-carbohydrate diet|carbohydrate restriction]] in this group can be profoundly beneficial as it can reverse [[obesity]] and in some cases [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]], the two conditions that will ultimately bankrupt South African medical services unless we take appropriate preventive actions." He described the denial by the [[University of Cape Town|UCT]] Faculty of Health Sciences of peer-reviewed evidence in support of his views as "a classic example of [[cognitive dissonance]].”

In February 2014 Claire Julsing-Strydom, President of the Association for Dietetics in South Africa (ADSA), reported Noakes to the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) for advising a mother on Twitter that she should wean her child onto low-carbohydrate high-fat foods, which he described as real foods. "By implication I was saying that the child should not be weaned onto the traditional high sugar, high carbohydrate processed cereals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health24.com/Diet-and-nutrition/Healthy-foods/Tim-Noakes-to-face-inquiry-over-Banting-tweet-20150421|title=Tim Noakes to face inquiry over 'Banting' tweet|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=6 May 2015 |website=health24.com |publisher=Health24 |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the complaint, the Professional Conduct Committee of the HPCSA, chaired by Advocate Joan Adams, set up a hearing into the allegation of unprofessional conduct against Noakes. The hearing was scheduled for 4 June 2015, but following complaints from Noakes's legal team that the Committee was not properly constituted in accordance with the applicable regulations and the provisions of the Health Professions Act,  its commencement was delayed until November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sboros|first1=M.|title=Tim Noakes and the peculiar hearing that didn’t happen|url=http://www.biznews.com/low-carb-healthy-fat-science/2015/06/05/tim-noakes-and-the-peculiar-hearing-that-didnt-happen/|accessdate=19 February 2016|agency=BizNews.com|date=5 June 2015|ref=Sboros_Tim Noakes and the peculiar hearing that didn’t happen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first session of the hearing took place from 23 to 30 November 2015, after which proceedings were postponed to February 2016.

The HPSCA filed an appeal on 2nd day of August 2017. &lt;ref&gt; http://foodmed.net/2017/appeal.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; 8 June 2018 the appeal was dismissed in a unanimous ruling.&lt;ref&gt;http://foodmed.net/2018/06/noakes-free-hpcsa-licks-wounds-lchf/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and Achievements==

Noakes has challenged some common and old paradigms in the discipline of [[exercise physiology]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}  In 1996 he was honored by the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] when he was asked to present the J.B. Wolfe Memorial Lecture, the college's keynote address at its annual meeting. In 2002 he was awarded a Doctorate in Science (DSc). In 2002 Noakes was awarded the International Cannes Grand Prix Award for Research in Medicine and Water, for his work on [[Exercise-associated hyponatremia|Exercise-associated Hyponatremia (EAH)]]. In 2004 Runner’s World (USA) included this work as one of the 40 most important “persons or events” in the sport of running in the past 40 years. In 2008 he was elected an honorary fellow of the Faculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine (UK), the first foreigner to be so recognised. In that year he also received the [[Order of Mapungubwe|Order of Mapungubwe (Silver)]], from the President of South Africa for his “excellent contribution in the field of sports and the science of physical exercise”. In 2011 Noakes was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam|Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Vrije Universiteit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary doctorates|url=https://www.vu.nl/en/research/topresearchers-at-vu/honorary-doctorates/index.aspx|website=VU University: Research|publisher=Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from [[National Research Foundation of South Africa|South Africa's National Research Foundation]] for his contribution to sports science research. In 2014 the [[Southern Africa Association for the Advancement of Science|Southern Africa Association for the Advancement of Science (S2A3)]] awarded  Noakes their prestigious South Africa Medal (gold) for his outstanding contributions to sport physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Plug, C.
