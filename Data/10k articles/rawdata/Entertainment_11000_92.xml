'''Applause Inc.''' was a company that produced [[stuffed toy]]s and collectible figurines. The company produced licensed toys from [[Warner Bros.]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], and [[The Muppets|Jim Henson's Muppets]]. Its principal subsidiaries included Dakin Inc. and International Tropic-Cal Inc. The Applause brand survives as part of [[Russ Berrie]].

==History==
The company was founded as The Wallace Berrie Company in 1966 by Wallace Berrie. In 1979 the company obtained worldwide rights to [[The Smurfs]] and released figurines in 1979 at $1.50 each. The figurines became one of the best-selling toys of 1982. That year, the company acquired the Applause division from Knickerbocker Toys, which came with the licenses to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Sesame Street]], and [[Raggedy Ann|Raggedy Ann and Andy]]. In 1986, the company changed its name to Applause Inc. and released [[California Raisins]] merchandise. It would also produce various [[Batman]] merchandise, focusing largely on small figures and dolls, from the late 1980s into the early 1990s. In 1992, Applause released the Magic Trolls Babies toy line.

===Dakin merger===
From 1991 to 1995, the company built a strong retail business by focusing on its classic entertainment licensed brands with in-store merchandising displays as a platform for entertainment event properties, e.g. [[The Lion King]], [[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]], [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]], [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]], [[Star Trek]], and [[Star Wars]]. Also during this period, one of the most significant events was the company's acquisition of the licensed rights to the very popular Looney Tunes characters.

In late 1995 the company acquired [[Woodland Hills, California]] company, Dakin Inc., the most widely recognized brand name in stuffed animals. Dakin was founded in 1955 by Richard Dakin as an import business. This acquisition strengthened Applause's generic stuffed animal business to balance out its already strong entertainment license portfolio.

Applause created a Strategic Alliances Group to oversee products for food-related and premium-based programs such as from [[Taco Bell]], [[KFC]], [[Kellogg's]], [[General Mills]], and [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]]. In 1998 the company produced fast food toys for ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Pok√©mon]]'' (KFC) and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''.

===Bankruptcy and acquisition===
In 2004 CEO Bob Solomon shot himself after it was apparent that the company was not going to survive. The company filed for bankruptcy shortly after his death. The Applause name was acquired by [[Russ Berrie]] in a bankruptcy auction. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=APPLAUSE TO SELL NAME - Bankrupt Toy Company's Label to be Shed for $4 Million |author=Brent Hopkins |date=September 30, 2004 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/APPLAUSE+TO+SELL+NAME+BANKRUPT+TOY+COMPANY%27S+LABEL+TO+BE+SHED+FOR+$4...-a0122676910 |access-date=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader''''' is a [[3D film|3D]] comedy horror television film directed by Kevin O'Neill&lt;ref name=DC1/&gt; and produced by [[Roger Corman]]&lt;ref name="CBS News"/&gt; as his first 3D production&lt;ref name="Variety 2"/&gt; and an update of the 1995 film ''[[Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold]]'' which was also produced by Corman.&lt;ref name="Toronto"/&gt; The film stars [[Treat Williams]], [[Sean Young]], and [[Jena Sims]].&lt;ref name="behw111107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fangoria"/&gt; The film was released on 25 August 2012 on [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]].&lt;ref name="Variety 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wosc120426"/&gt;

==Plot==
Cassie Stratford is a plain science nerd, whose mother was captain of the cheersquad at Iron Coast University and president of Zeta Mu Sorority, so she is pressured to join both cheerleading and the sorority. However, Brittany Andrews, Zeta President and Cheer Captain (who has a [[Napoleon complex]]), rejects her.

Cassie works in the Biology Building of the University, where she and her friend Kyle are working on a drug that turns things beautiful. In the night, Cassie steals the drug and injects herself with it. While she does become beautiful and makes the cheer squad when one of the cheerleaders is injured, she then discovers the drug has a side effect when she starts to grow taller and taller until she is a 50-foot tall giant.

When Brittany discovers this, she tries to seduce Kyle into telling her the secret, which leads to her being accidentally injected with more of the drug than Cassie and growing bigger too (also, Cassie's [[breasts]] grow larger as well, and with that her shirt pops due to their growing rate). Brittany goes through the town on her way to the stadium, being careful not to hurt anyone on the way. She begins to cheer, but is confronted by Cassie. This all leads to a large [[cat fight]] during the big [[homecoming game]]. Cassie wins by injecting the antidote into Brittany, making her shrink into a dwarf. Cassie then injects herself with a smaller portion and returns to her normal size. She and Kyle then kiss.

'''Bourr√©''' (also commonly known as '''Bour√©''' and '''Boo-Ray''') is a [[trick-taking game|trick-taking]] [[gambling]] [[card game]] primarily played in the [[Acadiana]] region of [[Louisiana]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] and by the Somerset Men's Tennis team on county week, as well as at the tennis tournament in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. Crossgates, in Leeds, UK, was also once a hotbed of the game but has suffered a decline in recent years as many former players have moved away from the area. It is also played in the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Psara]], with the name '''Boureki''' ('''ŒúœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≠Œ∫Œπ''' in [[Greek language|Greek]]). The game's closest relatives are probably [[Spades (game)|Spades]] and [[Euchre]]; like many regional games, Bourr√© sports a large number of variant rules for both gameplay and betting considerations.

==Object==
The object of Bourr√© is to take a majority of the ''tricks'' in each ''hand'' and thereby claim the money in the ''pot''.  If a player cannot take a majority of tricks, the secondary goal is to keep from ''bourr√©ing'', or taking no tricks at all.  A bourr√© usually comes at a high penalty, including matching the amount of money in the pot.

==Rules==
The game is played with a standard 52-card deck, aces high and two to seven players. With seven players, only three cards may be dissed (so as to not use the dead cards). After every player [[ante (poker)|antes]], the dealer passes out five cards to each player, one at a time. In a traditional game, the dealer flips his own fifth card‚Äîthe last dealt‚Äîand that card's suit is considered. (Should the dealer make an error whilst dealing the cards, any of the players may yell out "shitter" and if judged to have been a bum deal, the deal moves to the player left of the original dealer). [[trump (cards)|trump]]s'' (in Boureki ''kozia'' or ''atoy''); however, house rules may allow a dealer to flip any card (without first seeing the other cards). As in Spades, the chosen suit beats all others; a two of trumps is "higher" in rank than an ace of any other suit.

After the deal, each player (starting to the dealer's left and continuing clockwise) states an intent to play.  Many variants require an additional ante at this point.  Those who are not playing in the hand ''fold''; those cards are collected by the dealer.

Once every player has stated intent, the dealer asks those still in the game (in the same order as before) how many new cards they desire.  They can take any number from zero to five; their discards go in a separate pile and the dealer hands them as many new cards as they discarded.  If the main stock is depleted before all players have been serviced, the dealer shuffles the "folded" hands and deals those; if that stock is depleted as well, the discards are shuffled and used.

Once everyone, including the dealer, has either folded or completed their redraw, the trick-taking phase begins.  The first player to the dealer's left who is still in the game starts by playing any card (with few exceptions); rules of play are as follows (a lower-numbered rule overrides any higher-numbered one).

#You must play to win.  This goes beyond simply "playing a higher card"; if you know that no one else has trumps and it is your turn to lead, you must play trumps if you have them.
#You must play on-suit if possible, even if your highest on-suit card will not beat the highest card in play.  Even if a trump has been played on a non-trump lead, if you have a card of the suit led, you must play on that suit.
#You must play a trump if you have no on-suit cards, and can "play to win".  If the only trump played is a three and you hold the two and ace of trumps but no cards of the lead suit, you must play the ace of trumps.  If you cannot "play to win" then it is not required to play a trump card that cannot possibly win the trick.  Some variants override the "play to win" rule and require a trump card to be played regardless.
#If you have neither cards of the lead suit nor trumps, you may play any card.  This is an ''off'' card and is effectively lower than a two of the lead suit.

The winner of a given ''round'' or ''trick'' collects the cards and places them face-up in front of him, then leads with another card.  Play proceeds until all five tricks have been completed.

*If a single player has taken more tricks than any other player, that player has won the hand and may take all of the winnings in the pot.
*If more than one player ties for the most tricks, this is a ''split pot.''  With five tricks, the only possible splits are 2-2-1 and 1-1-1-1-1.  On a split pot, the winnings stay on the table.
*Any player who took no tricks or ''[[revoke|reneged]]'' during play‚Äî that is, did not follow the rules properly‚Äîhas ''bourr√©d'' and must match the pot for the next round instead of adding the usual ante.  For example, if there are five red chips in the pot at the end of a hand and someone has bourr√©d, they must put five red chips (or their equivalent) into the pot for the next round.

Deal then passes to the left.

There are complex rules about forced plays; a simple example is when someone who has just taken their second trick holds the ace of trumps.  Since the ace of trumps is unbeatable, they ''must'' play it as their next card.  Similar occurrences are when a player has taken one trick and has both ace and king or (more complex) ace, queen and jack.  This is sometimes called the "cinch win" rule.  If it is a "cinch" that you will win, you must win immediately by laying down the winning cards all at once.  While the rules themselves are simple in theory, details about forced plays can make Bourr√© challenging for even a skilled player.

The "must play to win" rule can have contentious results if a player is playing "nice", trying to keep others from bourr√©ing.  Most games disallow such "nice" plays; players must attempt to bourr√© as many other players as possible.  As Bourr√© is a game with imperfect information and gamesmanship should (hopefully) trump rules-lawyering, care should be applied to any analysis of rounds when looking for such "nice" plays.

==Variations==
Variations in rules of Bourr√© abound, possibly due to its nature as a regional game.  Perhaps most common is the introduction of a ''pot limit'', which caps the total amount a single bourr√© or renege can cost a given player.  In some games, it is common for the dealer to ante for all of the players; this simplifies trying to determine whether individuals have anteed.  In a sense, the dealer is paying for his face-up trump.  In this variation, for a five-person, one-dollar-ante game, the dealer of each hand would ante five dollars.  A common point of dissent is whether a player who holds trumps but not the lead suit should be forced to play a trump if he cannot beat a higher trump already on the table; while consensus seems to be that the "play to win" rule applies, groups of players are known to require a player to play trump even though the player cannot possibly win the trick.  Punishments for misplay range from simple retraction (good for new players), retraction-and-renege, or just a renege, which can lead to the misplaying individual attempting to bourr√© one or more other players.  The default ante amount is understandably variable and the second ante is fairly common.

==In the news==
A game of Bourr√© apparently sparked the dispute which led to [[NBA]] star [[Gilbert Arenas]]'s suspension.  During an overnight flight from Phoenix to Washington, DC, on December 19, 2009, Arenas needled teammate [[Javaris Crittenton]] for losing over $1,000 in a game of Bourr√©.  The two exchanged words, with Arenas joking that he would blow up Crittenton's car and Crittenton saying he would shoot Arenas in his surgically repaired knee.  Two days later Arenas brought four guns to the Washington Wizards' locker room and left them, with a sign saying "Pick One," at Crittenton's locker.  The incident, combined with Arenas's trivialization of it in the media, led to his indefinite suspension from the NBA on January 6, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/06/AR2010010605167_pf.html Washington Post, A01, January 7, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He has since been restored as an active NBA player.

A game of Bourr√© also sparked a feud on the Memphis Grizzlies' team plane between NBA teammates OJ Mayo and Tony Allen in January, 2011. "Mayo owed Allen money from a card game, ‚ÄòBourr√©,' and sources said Mayo became increasingly belligerent and antagonistic toward Allen when asked to settle the debt," Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski reports.
Allen walked away from Mayo, the sources told Wojnarowski, only to return later and find Mayo still berating him. Then Mayo "inched close to Allen" and "Allen hit Mayo."
Other players separated the two, according to Wojnarowski's sources, and the pair was called in to talk to coach Lionel Hollins about it.
Mayo missed the following game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, on January 5. The team says it was due to bronchitis, but Wojnarowski's sources say it was "connected to the fight."&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/rumors/post/Grizzlies-fight-on-plane?urn=nba-303643 Grizzlies Fight on Plane]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Talbot began his comics work in the [[underground comix]] scene of the late 1960s. In 1969 his first work appeared as illustrations in ''Mallorn'', the British [[Reception of J. R. R. Tolkien#United Kingdom|Tolkien Society]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/talbot_bryan.htm|title= Bryan Talbot|year= 2012|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121014175637/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/talbot_bryan.htm|archivedate= 14 October 2012|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed in 1972 by a weekly strip in his [[Student newspaper|college newspaper]]. He continued in the scene after leaving college, producing Brainstorm Comix, the first three of which formed ''The Chester P. Hackenbush Trilogy'', a character reworked by [[Alan Moore]] as Chester Williams for ''[[Swamp Thing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v3_2/talbot/|title= Engraving the Void and Sketching Parallel Worlds: An Interview with Bryan Talbot|first= Roger|last= Whitson|date= Winter 2007|publisher= [[ImageTexT]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121215072037/http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v3_2/talbot/|archivedate= 15 December 2012|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talbot started ''[[The Adventures of Luther Arkwright]]'' in 1978. It was originally published in ''[[Near Myths]]'' and continued on over the years in other publications. It was eventually collected into one volume by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. Along with ''[[When the Wind Blows (graphic novel)|When the Wind Blows]]'' it is one of the first British [[graphic novel]]s. In the early to mid-eighties he provided art for some of ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'''s flagship serials, producing three series of ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]'', as well as occasional strips for ''[[Judge Dredd]]''. His ''[[The Tale of One Bad Rat]]'' deals with recovery from childhood [[sexual abuse]].

Talbot moved to the U.S. market in the 1990s, principally for [[DC Comics]], on titles such as ''[[Hellblazer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Irvine|first= Alex|author-link= Alexander C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25598">'''Concept musicals''' were first introduced in the 1940s, though two shows compete for the title of 'first concept musical:' ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'' and ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]''. The form began to flourish in the late 1960s, with the advent and subsequent popularity of ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]], the most prolific author of concept musicals, created ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' in 1970, bringing the genre to the forefront of the commercial realm. Director-choreographer [[Bob Fosse]] and producer-director [[Harold Prince]] were equally instrumental in making defining contributions to the concept musical. Modern examples of the concept musical include ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'' and ''[[Avenue Q]]''. Shows ranging from ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' to ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' have been argued as being concept musicals, though there is little critical agreement.

The concept musical has direct ties to the [[megamusical]], which has similar roots in the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] work ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', and the similarly plotless [[revue]]. Mirroring the social upheaval of the 1960s and beyond, the concept musical as a form provided a means of expression and experimentation for musical theatre writers and audiences alike.

==Definition==
‚ÄúThe term 'concept musical' did not appear in theatrical scholarship until after 1970, when the phrase ‚Äúconceived by‚Äù preceded [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]]‚Äôs name in the ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' billing.&lt;ref name=Young-Gerber&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young-Gerber|first=Christine|title='Attention must be paid', cried the balladeer: The concept musical defined|journal=Studies in Musical Theatre|date=2010|volume=4|issue=3|pages=331‚Äì342|doi=10.1386/smt.4.3.331_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most theater historians agree that the terms 'concept' and 'musical' were not linked until 1968, in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of ''[[Zorba (musical)|Zorba]]'' by critic Martin Gottfried. Referring to [[Harold Prince]]'s direction rather than the show itself, Gottfried wrote: "Conception is the big word here - it is what is coming to replace the idea of a 'book'... there is even less room than in the usual musical [for story] because Prince's concept... apparently won out on every question about cutting."&lt;ref name=Swayne&gt;{{cite book|last=Swayne|first=Steve|title=How Sondheim Found His Sound|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2007|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later review of [[Stephen Sondheim|Sondheim's]] ''[[Follies]]'', Gottfried defined it as "a show whose music, lyrics, dance, stage movement and dialogue are woven through each other in the creation of a tapestry-like theme (rather than in support of a plot)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gottfried|first=Martin|author-link=Martin Gottfried|title=Flipping Over 'Follies'|journal=The New York Times|date =April 25, 1971|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/07/19/specials/sondheim-flipping.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern critics disagree as to the exact definition of the concept musical. It is generally agreed upon that in a concept musical, emphasis is placed upon style, message, and thematic metaphor rather than on the plot itself.&lt;ref name=McMillin&gt;{{cite book|last=McMillin|first=Scott|title=The Musical as Drama|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the show's structure is rarely cohesive or linear.  Critics agree that the most defining aspect of a concept musical is its use of theme. This holistic approach to each show, which focuses on the truthful representation of the theme in every aspect of the final production, sets it apart from other musical theatre forms. Young-Gerber states: ‚ÄúIn [[musical comedy]] there is ''no'' theme. The [[revue]] ''uses'' a theme to unify disparate musical numbers and specialty acts. The integrated musical ''contains'' a theme. In contrast, the concept musical ''embodies'' a theme [that is] developed as the musical is written.‚Äù&lt;ref name=Young-Gerber/&gt;

Thus, the concept musical can also be defined by its structural characteristics and common staging techniques. Its songs "punctuate rather than flow out from the story," serving as a means of self-reflection for the character and acting as commentary upon the theme.&lt;ref name=Young-Gerber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edney|first=Kathryn|title=Resurrecting the American Musical|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=December 2007|volume=40|issue=6|pages=936‚Äì952|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2007.00479.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message of the show often spurs within its director a "renewed emphasis on the visual aspects of the performance... [leading] to a more abstract, unrealistic, non-representational staging, as the director has to free himself/herself from the confines of scenic verisimilitude in order to explore the visual dynamics of the stage." &lt;ref name=Young-Gerber/&gt; The attention paid to visual presentation has led many critics to recognize the concept musical as the most expressive and imagistic form of musical theatre. Theatre historian Vagelis Siropoulos writes: "A sense of aesthetic totality is provided not by the linear unfolding of a narrative but by the overarching staging concept, which turns the spectator's attention to the overall principle of organization in the same way that an abstract painting does."&lt;ref name=Siropoulos&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siropoulos|first=Vagelis|title=Evita, the Society of the Spectacle and the Advent of the Megamusical|journal=Image &amp; Narrative|date=2010|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/index.php/imagenarrative/article/viewFile/84/60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin of the concept musical===

The concept musical can be recognized as an extension of the growing concern for the cohesiveness of a particular production: "Unlike [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] or [[Lerner and Loewe]], who simply found a good story and musicalized it, now it was considered appropriate (and artistically more satisfying) to have a vision of the whole show."&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Tom|title=Making Musicals: An Informal Introduction to the World of Musical Theater|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2004|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Bernstein]] was a key figure in this movement, with his shows ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' and ''[[West Side Story]]'' representing a "radical experiment in book writing" in which the book is controlled by theme and metaphor.&lt;ref name=McMillin/&gt;

The concept musical's non-linear structure and focus on theme are suggestive of the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]].&lt;ref name=Hischak&gt;{{cite book|last=Hischak|first=Thomas|title=The Oxford Companion to the American Musical: Theatre, Film, and Television|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar connection can be made to the [[Living Newspaper]]s of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Edney/&gt; The Broadway production of ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'', written by [[Kurt Weill]], [[Ira Gershwin]], and [[Moss Hart]], is considered by some to be a predecessor of the modern concept musical. Its attention to characters and their psychological makeup, rather than the plot and its through-line, foreshadow the concept musical's priority of personal expression. Following ''Lady in the Dark'' and throughout the course of his career, Weill favored ideas over a linear narrative.&lt;ref name=Edney/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hischak/&gt; Whatever the exact origin, the growing maturation of musical theatre allowed the genre to become "a vehicle for social commentary and experimentation in form," with the concept musical at the forefront of this movement.&lt;ref name=Young-Gerber/&gt;

====First concept musical====

There are two major contenders for the title of first concept musical, although the term itself had yet to be invented: ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'' (1947) by Rodgers and Hammerstein, and ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'' (1948) by Weill and Lerner.&lt;ref name=Hischak/&gt;

''Allegro'', which concerns a son following in his father's footsteps, represents a "musical experiment" conducted by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Defying "virtually all musical theatre conventions" of the time, its [[Greek chorus]] frequently interrupts the narrative, and the show focuses on a larger theme of personal struggle in the face of success.&lt;ref name=Degen&gt;{{cite book|last=Degen|first=John|title=The Cambridge History of American Theater|date=2006|location=Cambridge, UK|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalistic in its staging, patterns of light were used to represent both spaces and emotions. However, many critics disagree as to ''Allegro'''s status as a concept musical, stating that the linear nature of the plot continues regardless of the choral interludes.&lt;ref name=Young-Gerber/&gt; The show was a critical failure, which many theatre historians blame on the inexperience of director-choreographer [[Agnes de Mille]]. Disheartened, Rodgers and Hammerstein returned to a more traditional format.&lt;ref name=Degen/&gt; Whether or not it was indeed a concept musical or merely a predecessor of things to come, ''Allegro'' "opened the door to a splendid new way of writing for musical theatre."&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;{{cite book|last=Citron|first=Stephen|title=Sondheim &amp; Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allegro'' also provides a connection between the concept musical and [[Stephen Sondheim]], who was mentored by Hammerstein and worked as a production assistant on ''Allegro''.&lt;ref name=Young-Gerber/&gt;

''Love Life'', the story of a marriage lasting over a century, "disregarded the traditional use of time, interrupted its action with jolting vaudeville numbers that commented on the story, and... tried to illustrate sociological ideas by paralleling them to a long-term personal relationship."&lt;ref name=Hischak/&gt; Freed from his usual partnership with Loewe, Lerner's growing experimentation with the genre is represented in ''Love Life''. Like ''Allegro'', ''Love Life'''s narrative is not explicitly linear, exploring the theme of marriage through a variety of lenses. Sondheim has stated that ''Love Life'' was "a useful influence on my own work, but it failed because it started out with an idea rather than a character."&lt;ref name=Degen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirsch|first=Foster|title=Harold Prince and the American Musical Theatre|date=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===

====1960s====

Concept musicals began to emerge as a significant form in the early 1960s. Their fragmented approach to storytelling helped to revitalize musical theatre as a genre, which was becoming formulaic. 1961 saw the premiere of ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' and ''[[Stop the World ‚Äì I Want to Get Off]]''. In 1965, ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' premiered at the [[Goodspeed Opera House]], eventually transferring to Broadway. The "antithesis of what people expected musicals to be," it was nonetheless incredibly popular, and marked the growing undercurrent of rebellion against the traditional musical theatre model.&lt;ref name=Gold&gt;{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Sylviane|title='Man' of the Hour|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/11CTarts.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, in 1966, Broadway saw the premiere of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', by [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]]. Directed by [[Harold Prince]], the show centers on the Kit Kat Klub, a seedy nightclub that thrives despite the war raging outside. "Prince‚Äôs impact‚Ä¶ on the concept musical is significant, and he can be considered the primary director who contributed to its creation."&lt;ref name=Young-Gerber/&gt; The show features songs that comment on the action within the narrative frame of the Kit Kat Klub. Removed from the story, these songs serve as commentary in the style of Brecht and Weill‚Äôs ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]''.

One of the first [[rock musical]]s, ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' opened Off-Broadway at [[The Public Theater]] in 1967 and then on Broadway in 1968. Representative of a communal 1960s "happening," it effectively "provided ‚Äòsafe‚Äô exposure to the counterculture for middle-class audiences."&lt;ref name=Everett&gt;{{cite book|last=Everett|first=William|title=The A to Z of the Broadway Musical|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1970s====

"The concept musical truly arrived with ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'', a musical that managed to be palatable to audiences even as it broke just about every rule of musical comedy."&lt;ref name=Hischak/&gt; The 1970 show, with music and lyrics by Sondheim and a book by [[George Furth]], focuses on Bobby, a single man living in [[New York City]] on the eve of his thirty-fifth birthday. It examines his romantic and personal relationships with several girlfriends and a variety of his married friends. The success of ''Company'' paved the way for more adventurous concept musicals by Sondheim and others.&lt;ref name=Hischak/&gt;

Director-choreographer [[Bob Fosse]] was a key figure in the further development of the concept musical. After directing the film version of ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'', Fosse helped to shape the 1972 Broadway musical ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', written by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] and Roger Hirson.&lt;ref name=Degen/&gt; Fosse‚Äôs conceptual vision for ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', which opened on Broadway in 1975, featured vaudeville routines that ‚Äúcomment[ed] on the system of justice and imprisonment in Chicago in the 1920s... Kander and Ebb and Fosse and Prince were advancing upon the convention by which characters have two modes of existence in musicals. They were taking the convention literally, putting show business settings next to ‚Äúreal‚Äù settings‚Ä¶ and letting the two overlap.‚Äù&lt;ref name=McMillin/&gt;

''[[A Chorus Line]]'' marked the first use of the word "conception" in connection with musical theatre. The show, based on interviews with actual dancers, uses the premise of an [[audition]] to expose the complex lives of previously-faceless chorus members.&lt;ref name=Degen/&gt; Considered by many to be the quintessential concept musical, the popularity of the 1975 [[New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater|New York Shakespeare Festival/Public Theater]] production and its subsequent Broadway transfer kicked the growing concept musical phenomenon into high gear.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Alvin|title=At Paper Mill, One More 'Chorus Line'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/16/nyregion/theater-review-at-paper-mill-one-more-chorus-line.html|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 16, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1980s and beyond====
[[File:Koty musical.jpg|thumbnail|''Cats'' cast, Roma Musical Theatre in Warsaw.]]

''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', first brought to the stage in 1981, "heralded the dawning of a new postmodern musical era, encapsulating the major difference between the concept musical and the megamusical." Though critics agree that the show is based around a concept rather than a linear plot, author [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] had intended to create a show that was not meant to "reflect [or] comment on the world, even in an oblique, metaphorical way."&lt;ref name=Siropoulos/&gt; This was a drastic difference from the metaphors that defined the concept musical. Thus, the concept musical branched out into the megamusical, which utilizes spectacle and increased technology to "radicalize the imagistic potential of musical theatre."&lt;ref name=Siropoulos/&gt;

''[[Starlight Express]]'', an "experiment" by Lloyd Webber, debuted on the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1984 and on Broadway in 1987.&lt;ref name=Citron/&gt; Like ''Cats'', the show focuses on a central theme rather than a linear plot, with the entire cast on [[roller skates]] playing trains.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Millie|title=Musical Theatre, Realism and Entertainment|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original concept was to be an "entertainment 'event' for children who love trains." Lloyd Webber has been quoted as saying that the end result was "not quite what we intended," given that the "joy and sense of pure fun that was the original intention seemed to get lost."&lt;ref name=Citron/&gt;

''[[Avenue Q]]'', which premiered on Broadway at the [[John Golden Theatre]] in 2003, can also be considered a concept musical. Authors [[Jeff Whitty]], [[Jeff Marx]], and [[Bobby Lopez]] have spoken of their difficulty categorizing the show: they wanted something that "didn't move like a story," but was not a true revue. Lopez calls it the "hybrid king of revue-slash-show. Using kind of Internet logic. A hyperlink type of logic to go from one subject to another."&lt;ref name=Pincus&gt;{{cite book|last=Pincus-Roth|first=Zachary|title=Avenue Q: The Book|date=2006|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its structure is circular, utilizing a series of vignettes and isolated situations to comment on the central idea. The show's theme, like ''Pippin'', focuses on the central character's coming of age search for his purpose. Young-Gerber finds that none of the scenes "bring him closer to discovering his purpose, indicating that the events of the musical will continue after the section shared with the audience is completed."&lt;ref name=Young-Gerber/&gt;

==Stephen Sondheim==
[[File:Stephen Sondheim - smoking.JPG|thumb|Stephen Sondheim, who has authored numerous concept musicals, including ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]''.]]

Sondheim is considered by a number of critics to be the leading musical theatre composer of his time. His contributions to the concept musical as a genre are undisputed.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Joanne|title=Stephen Sondheim: A Casebook|date=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sondheim believes that every show, concept musical or not, should contain "a secret metaphor that nobody knows except the authors."&lt;ref name=Swayne/&gt; Theatre historian Foster Hirsch writes that, like Prince, Sondheim has "instincts in [his] approach... that echo Brecht and Weill," an opinion that is echoed by many others.&lt;ref name=McMillin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; The themes and issues presented in his concept musicals are intended to confront the audience rather than provide them with a means of escape.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; Sondheim has stated that his primary principle when writing is that "content dictates form," meaning that the true heart of any issue must be presented in a similar fashion. This approach has often led him to embrace the concept musical.&lt;ref name=Sondheim&gt;{{cite book|last=Sondheim|first=Stephen|title=Finishing the Hat: Collected Lyrics (1954-1981) with Attendant Comments, Principles, Heresies, Grudges, Whines and Anecdotes|date=2010|publisher=Random House LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of ''Company'', Sondheim continued to experiment with the concept musical form. ''Follies'' opened in 1971 on Broadway at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]], winning the [[Tony Award]] for Best Music and Lyrics and the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] award for Best Musical. It was directed by Prince and Bennett, with choreography by Bennett. A number of critics have argued that ''Follies'' can be taken for a commentary on America under the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] presidency.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; In true Sondheim fashion, its content defines its form: the parallelisms of the young versions of the four leads, mirrored against their older selves, create multiple structural permutations and confrontations. These combinations thereby break down a linear sense of narrative. Set against a backdrop of aging glamour and the roads not taken, the show "belies Sondheim's preoccupation with choice and its consequences, or rather subverts it into an understanding that making a mess of choices or being unable to choose at all is a constant."&lt;ref name=Banfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Banfield|first=Stephen|title=Sondheim's Broadway Musicals|date=1993|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pacific Overtures'' "is often seen as the most obscure of Sondheim's scores," though a theme of naive illusion maturing to acceptance can be delineated.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The show, directed by Prince, opened in 1976 on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre, winning the Drama Critics Circle award for Best Musical. Sondheim explained the "naive linear approach" of his writing process for ''Pacific Overtures'': "What we actually did was to create a mythical Japanese playwright in our heads, who has come to New York, seen a couple of Broadway shows, and then goes back home and writes a musical about [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry's]] visit to Japan. It's this premise that helped to give us tone and style for the show."&lt;ref name=Banfield/&gt; The traditional forms of [[kabuki]] and [[vaudeville]] were mixed to present a unique viewpoint. ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'', which was directed by [[Jerry Zaks]] and opened in 1991 Off-Broadway at [[Playwrights Horizons]], has no protagonist or linear plot. The show, shifting back and forth chronologically, explores the motives and efforts of the successful and would-be assassins of various United States [[President of the United States|presidents]]. Its number of short scenes, many of which are crude and slapstick, echo the structure of ''Company''.&lt;ref name=Banfield/&gt;

Several other Sondheim musicals, including ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', and ''[[Sunday in the Park With George]]'' have also been argued by some critics as meeting the definition of a concept musical, though this status is debated.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; ''Merrily We Roll Along'', which follows a trio of friends backwards from retirement to young adulthood, can be compared to ''Allegro'' in structure and theme, though the former has a narrative, while the latter does not.

==Criticism==

Much has been written about the importance and impact of the concept musical. Drama theorist and critic Kathryn Edney believes that the concept musical "is rarely popular or particularly profitable, although it often garners critical praise, scholarly attention, and a cult following among the musical theater cognoscenti." She postulates that the discrepancies between the concept musical and megamusical are a direct result of the efforts of Sondheim and Lloyd Webber, whose "competing musical and personal styles... polarized fans of this genre. One is not supposed to enjoy both ''Cats'' and ''Company''."&lt;ref name=Edney/&gt; Likewise considering the relationship between the concept musical and megamusical, Siropoulos finds that the concept musical "is the product of a culture permeated by spectacle... The concept musical's disproportional concentration on the visual aspects of performance goes hand in hand with representational ends, an obligation to represent, however obliquely, the external world."&lt;ref name=Siropoulos/&gt;

Siropoulos also argues that Prince, over any of his peers, is the true link between the concept musical and megamusical. Prince's work on ''Company'' and ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', in particular, showcase his abilities in directing two distinct styles. {{quote|Like the megamusical, [''Company''] undermines the narrative organization of the musical and foregrounds the visual aspects of the performance. For the staging of ''Evita'', Prince employed and further developed the directorial vocabulary he cultivated in his concept musicals, creating, in the process, the first international megamusical blockbuster. In a sense, Prince can be considered the father of both the concept musical and the megamusical, linking, in this way, two forms of musical theatre: one of the most critically acclaimed with the one that has generally been considered as an anomaly and aberration in the history of the twentieth-century musical theatre.|Vagelis Siropoulos|Evita, the Society of the Spectacle and the Advent of the Megamusical}}

Dramaturg Scott McMillin argues that the concept musical built upon the theories of Rodgers and Hammerstein to bring the genre into the modern era, allowing the musical to become "arguably the major form of drama produced so far in America."&lt;ref name=McMillin/&gt; {{quote|The age of the concept musical carried this advance in book-and-number formatting to the point that there is virtually nothing that cannot be imagined an effective topic for a musical. The ferment of ideas behind the concept show combines innovation with a strict sense of the musical‚Äôs history (the revue as called to life in ''Follies''), the musical‚Äôs procedures (the audition and rehearsals of ''A Chorus Line''), and the musical‚Äôs relationships to other forms of theatre (the kabuki methods in ''Pacific Overtures''). The past and the future of the theatre are at issue in the best of them.|Scott McMillin|The Musical as Drama}}

Theatre historian John Bush Jones argues that the concept musical undermines the role of the traditional musical as a narrative medium, proposing that the term 'concept musical' is "too broad to be of much value," suggesting instead the term 'fragmented musical.'&lt;ref name="Bush Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=John Bush|title=Our Musicals, Ourselves: A Social History of the American Musical Theatre|date=2004|publisher=Brandeis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Deep Rising''''' is a 1998 American [[Action film|action]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Stephen Sommers]] and starring [[Treat Williams]], [[Famke Janssen]] and [[Anthony Heald]]. It was distributed by [[Hollywood Pictures]] and [[Cinergi Pictures]] and released on January 30, 1998.

== Plot ==
Amidst a storm, Captain John Finnegan and his crew, Joey Panuchi and Leila, are hired by [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] Hanover, Mulligan, Mason, Billy, T-Ray, Mamooli, and Vivo to pilot their boat across the [[South China Sea]] to an undisclosed location in the middle of the ocean. Meanwhile, the ''Argonautica'', a luxury [[cruise ship]] built and owned by Simon Canton, is undertaking its [[maiden voyage]] when a saboteur disables the ship's navigation and communication systems. A large object rises from beneath and collides with the vessel, leaving it dead in the water, while the panicking passengers are attacked by unseen creatures.

Finnegan's boat collides with a [[speedboat]] shaken loose during the collision, at which point the mercenaries take over and reveal they intend to rob the ''Argonautica'''s passengers and vault, before sinking the ship with [[torpedo]]s. The group boards the ship, leaving Leila and Billy behind to repair the boat, where they are both killed by the same creature. The group reaches the ballroom only to find blood and no sign of the passengers. Finnegan and Joey go to the engine room to scavenge parts to repair the boat, under the guard of T-Ray and Mamooli. T-Ray goes off to investigate strange noises and is torn to shreds by the creature. Mamooli contacts Hanover, but is dragged off by the creature; as Joey and Finnegan are escaping they run into Trillian, a passenger who was imprisoned for stealing. Meanwhile Hanover's group reaches the vault and Vivo opens it only to be accidentally killed by Canton, who was hiding inside the vault along with Captain Atherton and three other passengers, who are shot dead by Mason and Mulligan. Canton and Captain Atherton explain that the ship was attacked by unknown creatures that killed everyone else on board.

Under questioning, Canton is found to be responsible for the ship's sabotage, having hired the mercenaries to sink the unprofitable ship so that he could [[insurance fraud|collect on the insurance]]. The group is attacked by the creatures, consisting of giant spike-covered tentacles, which eat Captain Atherton. Canton theorizes that the creatures are an extreme evolution of the [[Ottoia]], which liquefy their victims and then eject the carcasses. The creatures attack and the survivors flee; Mason is grabbed by the creature but kills himself by detonating a grenade. Mulligan elects to stay behind and try to kill the creatures in a last stand. Mulligan kills a creature, but is ambushed and devoured by another one. The survivors are herded towards the bow of ship, where they find a "feeding room" full of bloody skeletal remains. The creatures break through the hull, flooding the lower decks and separating the survivors. Hanover tries to sacrifice Joey to save himself, but instead gets grabbed by the creature and devoured.

Finnegan and Joey spot an island from a distance and make it back to Finnegan's boat, but they have lost their engine parts, rendering it useless as a means of escape. They instead set the boat's [[autopilot]] to crash into the ''Argonautica'' and detonate the torpedoes. As Finnegan and Trillian find [[jet ski]]s they can use to reach the island, the tentacles smash through the main deck, revealed to be part of a single giant creature. Finnegan discovers Joey has gone missing, leaving him and Trillian to escape while being pursued by the creature. Canton jumps onto Finnegan's boat, but is unable to disable the autopilot. The boat crashes into the ''Argonautica'', destroying both ships and killing Canton and the creature. 

Finnegan and Trillian reach the island and are reunited with Joey, who survived the ordeal and paddled ashore using Finnegan's [[personal watercraft]]. As the three relax, a loud roar echoes from the forest and something huge crashes toward them through the trees. As the camera pulls back, the island is revealed to be [[wikt:primordial|primordial]]. Finnegan is heard saying his movie catchphrase, "Now what?", as the film ends.

== Production ==
[[Stephen Sommers]] began writing the script to ''Deep Rising'', then called ''Tentacle'', when he worked at [[Hollywood Pictures]] in the mid-1990s. [[Claire Forlani]] was originally cast as Trillian St. James, but dropped out after just three days, due to creative differences with Sommers, and [[Famke Janssen]] was subsequently cast. Janssen almost did not get the part because the producers felt she was too recognizable{{fact|date=October 2014}} from ''[[GoldenEye]]'', but they relented. [[Harrison Ford]] turned down the role of John Finnegan, which later went to [[Treat Williams]], and the film's budget was later downsized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118956/trivia |title=Deep Rising (1998) |website=IMDb |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming for ''Deep Rising'' began on June 12, 1996 and lasted until October 18 of that year. The film was originally set for release in the fall of 1997, but was delayed until the following January. [[Industrial Light and Magic]] was responsible for the film's special effects while [[Rob Bottin]] who had previously worked on [[John Carpenter's The Thing|''The Thing'']] and on [[Paul Verhoven]]'s ''[[RoboCop]]'' was hired as the special makeup effects designer.

The exterior shots of the cruise ship ''Argonautica'' was created by CGI, and is an original design not based on any existing vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matsunefx.com/index.php?p=3_3 |title="Argonautica" Cruise ship  CAD Drafting Deep Rising |website=Matsune FX |access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two models of the cruise ship were created, a 38ft. model for shots of the ''Argonautica'' on the ocean, and a 110-ft. model for the sinking of ''Argonautica''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=76&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
On its opening weekend the film made $4,737,793 (42% of its total gross), ranking #8. It ended with a total intake of $11.2 million.&lt;ref name=BOM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=deeprising.htm |title=Deep Rising |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''Deep Rising'' received mostly negative reviews. At [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a "Rotten" rating of 29%, based on 31 reviews. It also made its way to the [[Roger Ebert]]'s most hated films list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-most-hated |title=Ebert's Most Hated |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=August 11, 2005 |website=Roger Ebert.com |access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words, "Deep Rising is essentially an ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' clone with a fresh paint job".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980130/REVIEWS/801300303/1023 |title=Deep Rising Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1998) |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=January 30, 1998 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that "'Deep Rising' is an old-fashioned B-movie with A-budget effects, but the quality sheen can't disguise the cheap-thrills hokum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/deep-rising-1200452473/ |first=Leonard |last=Klady |title=Deep Rising |date=January 29, 1998 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave ''Deep Rising'' a positive review awarding it a B- and stating that it is "a tightly written, often howlingly funny Aliens knockoff that, in its portrayal of tough men and tougher women under pressure, favorably recalls the work of Howard Hawks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://ew.com/article/1998/02/06/deep-rising-3/ |title=Deep Rising |last=Burr |first=Ty |date=February 6, 1998 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Bloody Disgusting]] stated that "Excellent cast, State-of-art special effects, and terrific acting, this is a movie that should not be missed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/108476/deep-rising-2/ |title=Deep Rising |date=October 22, 2004 |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=May 23, 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526052943/http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/108476/deep-rising-2/ |archive-date=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |title=Deep Rising |website=[[CinemaScore]] |access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KATSU 5Bottle1Head.jpg|thumb|Flair bartending - Exhibition flair]]
'''Flair bartending''' is the practice of [[bartender]]s entertaining guests, clientele or audiences with the [[object manipulation|manipulation]] of [[Bar (counter)|bar]] tools (e.g. [[cocktail shaker]]s) and [[liquor]] bottles in tricky, dazzling ways. Used occasionally in [[cocktail]] bars, the action requires skills commonly associated with jugglers. It has become a sought-after talent among venue owners and marketers to help advertise a liquor product or the opening of a bar establishment. Competitions have been sponsored by liquor brands to attract flair bartenders, and some hospitality training companies hold courses to teach flair techniques.

Flair bartending is sometimes referred to as "extreme bartending" or contracted to "flairtending". The word ''flair'' became popular among practitioners in the mid-1990s. "Flair" is also used as a verb (e.g. "to flair"), referring to any [[trickery]] used by a bartender in order to [[entertain]] guests while mixing a drink. Flair can include [[juggling]], flipping (bottles, shakers), manipulating flaming [[liquors]] or even performing close-up [[magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks (also referred to as "bar-magic").

Flair is showmanship added to bartending that enhances the overall guest experience.  The ideas behind [[mixology]] and drink-oriented or service-minded bartending can still be upheld with the correct application of '''working flair'''. Recently, there is a noticeable rise in bartenders combining prominent mixology knowledge and working flair skills all over the world. Working flair and Exhibition flair are very similar on the grounds that they both require precision and practice, however the use of '''exhibition flair''' has become a competition oriented style where significantly greater risks are being taken. Working flair, which is much more common, focuses more on delivering drinks to customers while still ensuring visual entertainment.

==History==
The earliest record of a flair bartender is barman [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry "The Professor" Thomas]], who poured fiery streams of boiling water and flaming [[whisky]] and mixed an original cocktail called the [[Blue Blazer]] in the late nineteenth century.

Flairing was also prominently featured in the 1988 film ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'' starring [[Tom Cruise]].

==Flair competitions==
Both working flair and exhibition flair can be seen in competitions, depending on the rules and regulations of each event. The important distinction between working flair and exhibition flair is not so much the level of liquid in the bottles (though that is a criterion) but the speed in which the bottle is thrown and/or the drink is made.  Working flair usually incorporates a "flat" throw, which is when the bottle is released into the air without flipping. This gives an illusion of the bottle floating, but reduces the chances of liquid spilling.  This also opens the bartender to be able to use similar routines, regardless of what bottle they grab, as the level of liquid is not a factor.  The accepted definition of working flair is "flair that does not noticeably slow service", usually involving bottles filled to various levels (as in a real work situation) that are quickly manipulated and then poured.  Exhibition flair almost always involves bottles that are often pre-set with less than 2 ounces (60ml) specifically for flipping. Exhibition flair often involves longer sequences and routines, multiple objects, and performances choreographed to music.

The first open competition to have an exhibition round was the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907125351/http://www.questcompetition.com/ Quest for the Best Bartender] in 1995.

The first open competition to have a working flair round was the Quest for the Best Bartender in the World in 1999.

The first all working flair bartending competition was the Flair Bartenders Shakedown in 2006 organized by BarWars LLC.

There are different styles of flair bartending competitions.  ''Legends of Bartending'' World Bartender Championships test the bartender on four disciplines of bartending, accuracy, speed, working flair and exhibition flair. The ''Blue Blazer'' and Independent Flair League (IFL) in Poland rewards flair and mixology together; competitors gain points for both flair and creative mixology. '''NATIONS''' International Flair Challenge and other competitions like Roadhouse World Flair, MBA, Athens Flair Open feature pure exhibition flair where the biggest and best moves are shown.

==Competition history==
In 1986, [[T.G.I. Friday's]] management encouraged their bartenders to show their personalities behind the bar and this resulted in several bartenders (a few being John JB Bandy, John Mescall, and Magic Mike) being sent to the corporate T.G.I. Friday's office in Texas to shoot a bartending video. At the end of 1986, T.G.I. Friday's hosted the first national flair bartending competition called "Bar Olympics" in [[Woodland Hills, California]]. John JB Bandy was the winner of this competition. In 1987, after interviewing 34 bartenders, John JB Bandy was approached across the bar by [[Touchstone Pictures]] to assist in training Tom Cruise and [[Bryan Brown]] for the 1988 film, ''Cocktail''. Later that year after filming, John JB Bandy produced the very first flair bartending training video called "Olympic Bartending". T.G.I. Friday's is credited for modernizing and popularizing flair bartending in the United States beginning in the mid-1980s because they allowed artistic personality freedom behind the bar. London (Roadhouse) and Orlando (Quest for the Best at Pleasure Island's Manniquins) were the hotbeds of flair bartending in the early and mid-1990s. In 1991, T.G.I. Friday's started its global competition called ''World Bartender Championship''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbtc.com/index.php?s=18 Past Champions], ''T.G.I. Friday's World Bartender Championship - accessed January 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The global competition has continued to today with divisional champions from across the US, [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]]an Divisions coming to compete in [[Carrollton, Texas|Carrollton]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbtc.com/index.php?year=2009&amp;s=37 World BTC News 2009 Archives], ''T.G.I.

Friday's World Bartender Championship Mixologist Profiles], ''T.G.I. Friday's World Bartender Championship - accessed January 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current competitions==
There are hundreds of flair bartending competitions around the world each year, most of which are local and not well publicized.  In 2005 the [[Flair Bartenders Association]] (FBA) launched the ''FBA Pro Tour'', a linked series of events where competitors earn points toward the title Pro Tour Champion at the end of the year.  In 2007 there were 14 events on the Pro Tour with 7 of them located in the US.

In 2008 the World Flair Association launched the Grand Slam.  A worldwide tournament the includes the best competitions from all over the world.  It is seen today as the biggest competition/tournament to win in the world of flair.  Bartenders travel far and wide for the Grand Slam events to try and earn the title of Grand Slam World Champion.  The Grand Slam events vary each year, being located in Europe, Asia, and America.

Five-Time World Champion Ken Hall and Jim Allison, president of the FBA, organized six of those seven events.  The flagship flair bartending event is ''Legends of Bartending'', which celebrated its twelfth year in 2010.

Some the biggest flair bartending events all over the World includes
* Roadhouse World Flair in (Covent Garden) London, UK &lt;sub&gt;''After TGI Fridays, the longest running flair competition''&lt;/sub&gt;
* Legends of Bartending (Las Vegas, US) - discontinued
* Quest (Orlando - the oldest major flair competition in the world) - discontinued
* Skyy Global Flair Challenge in 14 different countries including China, UK, Canada, Israel, Czech Republic, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, etc. - discontinued
* [[Hard Rock Cafe]] has conducted a global [http://www.hardrock.com/barocker BARocker] working flair competition since 2013.

The [[International Bartenders Association]] was founded in 1951. In 2000, the IBA initiated a World Flair Competition. This event is held at the IBA's annual congress of members, together with the organization's World Classic Cocktail Competition (inaugurated in 1955).

The newest major events to gain credibility among top competitors include:
* Crazy Beach World Flair Competition (Cosenza - Italy)
* Flairmania (Riga, Latvia)
* Stars War Championship (Bali, Indonesia)
* Titans World Open (Moscow, Russia)
* Ultimate Flair (Tokyo, Japan)
* Flair Battle Rome (Rome, Italy)
* Old Skool Rules (London, UK)
* Prepare to Flair - Beginner Competition @ the Roadhouse (London, UK)
* Flair Fearless Championship (Los Angeles, US)
* Bols Barmen Cup (Umag, Croatia)
* Warsaw Flair Challenge (Warsaw, Poland)
* Masters Of Flair (Birmingham, UK)

Major events are mostly Grand Slam Events.  Prize money has reduced significantly since the recession a few years ago.  However, there are a lot more competitions worldwide.  With the help of the Internet there have also been some online competitions.

A '''funeral oration''' or '''''epitaphios logos''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|·ºêœÄŒπœÑŒ¨œÜŒπŒøœÇ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ}}) is a formal speech delivered on the ceremonial occasion of a [[funeral]]. Funerary customs comprise the practices used by a culture to remember the dead, from the funeral itself, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honour. In [[ancient Greece]] and, in particular, in  [[ancient Athens]], the funeral oration was deemed an indispensable component of the funeral ritual.

The ''epitaphios logos'' is regarded as an almost exclusive Athenian creation, although some early elements of such speeches exist in the [[epic poetry|epos]] of Homer and in the [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] of [[Pindar]]. [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] is the earlier extant of the genre.&lt;ref name="Colaiaco"&gt;J.A. Colaiaco, ''Socrates Against Athens'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians are those who set the standard and, therefore, [[Demosthenes]] praises them, saying that "you alone of all mankind publicly pronounce over your dead funeral orations, in which you extol the deeds of the brave".&lt;ref name="Leptines"&gt;Demosthenes, ''Against Leptines'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072&amp;layout=&amp;loc=20.141 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homer and Pindar==
In Homer very few elements of ''epitaphios logos'' or laudation are found. At the funeral of [[Patroclus]] chief in all the mourning is [[Achilles]]; the son of [[Peleus]] laid his bloodstained hand on the breast of his friend and cried, "Fare well Patroklos, even in the house of [[Hades]]. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will drag [[Hector]] hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you."&lt;ref name="HomerIl19"&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'', 23, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0217&amp;query=book%3D%2323 19 etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; As he spoke he treated the body of Hector with contumely, laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroklos.&lt;ref name="HomerIl19" /&gt; At the funeral of Hector the women, [[Andromache]], his mother and Helen, deliver the final public statements over the dead body.&lt;ref name="Foley40"&gt;H. P. Foley, ''Female Acts in Greek Tragedy'', 40&lt;/ref&gt; Andromache laments the loss of her husband with these emotional words:&lt;ref name="HomerIl477"&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'', 22, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0217&amp;layout=&amp;loc=22.477 477 etc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded mountain of Plakos in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was a child - ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter - would that he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the secret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.}}

In the ''Sixth Olympian For Hagesias of Syracuse'', the poet mentions a characteristic example of an [[epitaph]] high praise: "Hagesias, that praise is ready for you, which once Adrastus' tongue rightly spoke for the seer Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, when the earth swallowed up him and his shining horses.  In Thebes, when the seven pyres of corpses had been consumed, the son of Talaus spoke in this way: ‚ÄúI long for the eye of my army, a man who was good both as a prophet and at fighting with the spear.‚Äù"&lt;ref name="Pindar"&gt;Pindar, ''Sixth Olympian'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162&amp;layout=&amp;loc=O.+6.1  15]&lt;/ref&gt; Nicole Loraux observes that the ''epitaphios'' was "born of lyric poetry and in competition with it", since the funeral oratory "uses poetic themes but reinterprets them from a resolutely political perspective".&lt;ref name="Loraux231"&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Invention of Athens'', 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athens==
The orator [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] claimed that the funeral oration had been originated in the 6th-century BC in Athens by [[Solon]],&lt;ref&gt;Anaximenes, ''Frag.'' 44&lt;/ref&gt; but this is widely doubted by historians.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Sickinger, 1999, ''Public records and archives in classical Athens'', page 30. UNC Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usher"&gt;Stephen Usher, 1999, ''Greek oratory: tradition and originality'', page 349. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; More plausible, but not beyond doubt,&lt;ref name="usher"/&gt; is the statement by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] that the Athenians instituted the funeral oration "in honour or those who fought at [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and died for their country, or to the glory of their exploits at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Ant. Rom.'' v. 17. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides describes in detail the funeral rituals and points out that "the dead are laid in the public sepulchre in the most beautiful suburb of the city, in which those who fall in war are always buried".&lt;ref name="Th2.34"&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', 2.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=2.34.1 34]&lt;/ref&gt; This suburb was [[Kerameikos]], where there was a monument for all the Athenians fell in battle, except such of them as fought at Marathon.&lt;ref name="Pausanias"&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', 29.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.29.1 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians now believe that the ''demosion sema'' (a collective burial site for the war dead) and the ''epitaphios logos'' were first established around 470 BC, customs that continued during the Periclean period.&lt;ref name="N95-96"&gt;A.W. Nightingale, ''Genres in Dialogues'', 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest preserved casualty list, giving the names of those who died fighting for their city in a given year, dates to 490-480 BC and it is associated with the [[battle of Marathon]],&lt;ref&gt;Keesling, C., The Marathon Casualty List from Eua-Loukou and the Plinthedon Style in Attic Inscriptions, Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, vol. 180 (2012), pp. 139-148&lt;/ref&gt; and white-ground [[lekythos|lekythoi]] depicting funerary scenes started around 470 BC.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Oakley, ''Bail Oinochoai'', 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|funeral oration]] of [[Pericles]], as reported by [[Thucydides]], is the earliest ''epitaphios'' presented in full.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, II, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0199;query=chapter%3D%23181;layout=;loc=2.36.1/ 35-46]&lt;/ref&gt; The burial of the war dead in the first year of the [[Peloponnesian War]] is regarded as reflecting the fifth-century dominance of the public co-memorial.&lt;ref&gt;K. Derderian, ''Leaving Words to Remember'', 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheme and structure==

Though [[Plato]] is consistently suspicious of the ability of oratory to teach, in the ''[[Menexenus (dialogue)|Menexenus]]'' he demonstrates a theoretical interest in the project of funeral oratory.&lt;ref name="Monoson202"&gt;S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 202&lt;/ref&gt; He actually describes the scheme of the traditional Athenian funeral oration with the following succinct phrase:&lt;ref name="Menexenus236e"&gt;Plato, ''Menexenus'', 236 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Menex.+236e e]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And the speech required is one which will adequately eulogize the dead and give kindly exhortation to the living, appealing to their children and their brethren to copy the virtues of these heroes, and to their fathers and mothers and any still surviving ancestors offering consolation.}}

Thereby, the traditional ''epitaphios'' must contain: a ''[[eulogy]]'' of the war dead and the city, an ''exhortation'' to the relatives to copy the virtues of the war dead and a ''consolation'' for the living members of their families.&lt;ref name="Helios"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Funeral Oration|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia The Helios]]|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the ''epitaphios'' consists of the following parts:
* ''Preamble'', which treats the performance expectations of the audience.&lt;ref name="Derderian181"&gt;K. Derderian, ''Leaving Words to Remember'', 181&lt;/ref&gt; The orator usually asserts that it is almost impossible for him to find words worthy of the glorious achievements of the war dead.&lt;ref name="Helios" /&gt; Such a preamble reveals the position of the ''epitaphios'' as an oral genre within a ritually and socially bounded society.&lt;ref name="Derderian181" /&gt;
*''Origin and ancestors''.
*''The war dead, their self-sacrifice and their devotion to the Athenian Polity''.
*''Epilogue'', which constitutes a consolation and an encouragement for the families of the war dead.&lt;ref name="Helios" /&gt; The epilogue employs a traditional dismissal of the mourners for further private lament, at which point the city's promise of education for the surviving orphans signals the resumption of life in the ''polis''.&lt;ref name="Derderian181" /&gt;

== Function and critics ==

The primary function of the funeral oration was to give public expression to the conception of the potential excellence of [[polis]]. It was an occasion on which Athens "invented" and "reinvented" itself in narrative form.&lt;ref name="Loraux312"&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Invention of Athens'', 312&lt;/ref&gt; The city displayed its achievements, as well as the civic and personal virtues to which the citizens could aspire.&lt;ref name="Monoson202" /&gt; The secular prose of the funeral oration dedicates itself to celebrating the ideal of the democratic Athenian city.&lt;ref&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Children of Athena'', 45&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ''epitaphios'', a civic discourse, the city recognizes itself as it wishes to be.&lt;ref name="Loraux312" /&gt;

It is for this reason that Plato has chosen the funeral oration as a main target of him. In ''Menexenus'' he engages the concerns of funeral oratory and appropriates for philosophy part of the intellectual mission that the Athenians associated with the most celebrated and democratic form of [[epideictic]], the funeral oratory.&lt;ref name="Monoson205"&gt;S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extant speeches==

Whereas the ''epitaphios'' originated itself as a public speech composed for a specific occasion, a number of specimens of this genre were not composed for delivery at the public burial. They would have been read to small audiences at the intellectual gatherings that met at so many venues. Gorgias' funeral oration, maybe that of [[Lysias]] and clearly Plato's parodic ''epitaphios'' in ''Menexenus'' were not designed to be delivered before the Athenian people.&lt;ref name="N95-96" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">The '''Gay Gordons''' is a popular dance at [[c√®ilidh]]s and other kinds of informal and [[social dancing|social dance]] in [[Scotland]]. It is an "old-time" dance, of a type popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in which every couple dances the same steps, usually in a circle around the room.

The name alludes to a Scottish regiment, the [[Gordon Highlanders]].

In " Old Time Dancing" published in 1949 Englishman Victor Silvester states that "The Gay Gordons" was created between WWI and WWII and was part of a wider craze for march-style dances (such as the Dinkey One Step)&lt;ref&gt; Victor Silvester. Old Time Dancing London: Herbert Jenkins  1950(1951) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;. In an article published in the Folk Dance Problem Solver historian Ron Houston failed to trace an earlier reference to this dance &lt;ref&gt; Houston, Ron. Gay Gordons in The Folk Dance Problem Solver 1995 pp 14-16 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Dance instructions==
A standard ceilidh instruction:
:Formation: couples in a circle around the room facing anti-clockwise, ladies on the right. 
:Music: 2/4 or 4/4 march. E.g. "Scotland the Brave", "The Gay Gordons".

|-
| 1-2
| Right hands joined over lady's shoulder (man's arm behind her back) and left hands joined in front, walk forward for four steps, starting on the right foot.
|-
| 3-4
| Still moving in the same direction, and without letting go, pivot on the spot (so left hand is behind lady and right hand is in front) and take four steps backwards.
|-

| Repeat in the opposite direction. 
|-

|-
| 13-16
|Joining hands in [[ballroom hold]], [[polka (dance step)]] round the room. 
|}

Repeat ad lib. In order to make the dance [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Travelling (progressive) dance|progressive]], the ladies may leave their partners between bars 12-13 and move to the partner before them in the circle. 

For Scottish country dancers, the grip in the first eight bars is [[allemande]] hold.

'''''Get to Know Your Rabbit''''' is a 1972 [[United States|American]] [[comedy film]] written by Jordan Crittenden and directed by [[Brian De Palma]].

==Plot==
Corporate [[Senior management|executive]] Donald Beeman, fed up with the [[rat race]], impulsively quits his job and takes to the road as a traveling [[tap dance|tap dancing]] [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] under the tutelage of Mr. Delasandro. His former boss Mr. Turnbull, determined to convince him to return to his [[Working time#9 to 5|nine-to-five]] existence, chases after him as he performs his routine in seedy [[nightclub]]s and [[honky tonk]]s, but instead the two create Tap Dancing Magicians, a course for pressured businessmen. When their little venture becomes one of the most successful corporations in the world, Donald ironically finds himself feeling the same way he did when he originally quit his job.

==Production==
[[Brian De Palma]] had become successful with his 1968 underground comedy, ''[[Greetings (1968 film)|Greetings]]'', and was hired by [[Warner Bros.]] to direct ''Get to Know Your Rabbit'' in 1970, right after he had directed a follow-up to ''[[Greetings (1968 film)|Greetings]]'' called ''[[Hi, Mom!]]''. While very much a studio picture, ''Rabbit'' was in line with his films up to that time, which were mainly comedies. Much of the comedy has its roots in the traditional [[Great Britain|British]] absurdist sense of humor associated with the likes of [[Monty Python]] and ''[[The Goon Show]]''. Crittenden's [[screenplay]] is filled with oddball characters and bizarre situations, such as a [[bomb]]er who is put on hold when he calls to announce his device will explode in six minutes, or a beautiful young woman who confesses to Donald her crush on the paper boy prompted her to [[prostitution|prostitute]] herself so she could afford a [[newspaper]] [[subscription]].

[[Warner Bros.]] and star [[Tommy Smothers]] felt uneasy about De Palma's direction, as he was at that time an up-and-coming filmmaker with only a couple of films. He was fired from the production due to creative differences, mostly surrounding the ending of the film. ''Get to Know Your Rabbit'' was completed by the studio in 1970 but they didn't release it until two years later. Uncertain how to market it, the studio did little to promote it and the movie quickly disappeared from theaters. The experience gave the director a distaste for the studio system, and he would not work for a major studio again for several years.

In 1973, the year after the release of ''Get to Know Your Rabbit'', De Palma would put his focus on [[suspense]] and [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]] with a horror film called ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]''.  These themes would recur in much of his output in years since.

The '''history of American comics''' began in the 19th century in the realm of [[mass print media]] and [[yellow journalism]], where they served as a boon to mass readership.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Paul and James Lyons (eds.), ''The Rise of the American Comics Artist: Creators and Contexts'', University Press of Mississippi, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, comics became an autonomous [[art medium]]&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; and an integral part of [[American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Coulton Waugh|Waugh, Coulton]], ''The Comics'', University Press of Mississippi, 1991, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of American comics started in 1842 with the publication of [[Rodolphe T√∂pffer]]'s work ''[[The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Duncan, p.25"&gt;{{harv|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platinum Age"&gt;Jamie Coville, [http://www.thecomicbooks.com/old/Platinum.html "History of Comics: Platinum Age"] ‚Äì TheComicBooks.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Local artists took over this new [[Media (communication)|medium]] and created the first [[American comic book|American comics]]. But it is not until the development of [[daily newspaper]]s that an important readership is reached through [[comic strips]]. The first years corresponded to the establishment of canonical codes (recurring character, [[speech balloon]]s, etc.) and first genres (family strips, adventure tales). Characters acquired national celebrity and were subject to cross-media adaptation while newspapers were locked in a fierce battle for the most popular authors.

The second major evolution came in 1934 with the [[comic book]], which allowed the dissemination of comics (first reprints of comic strips) in dedicated media. In 1938, when [[Superman]] appeared in one of those comic books, began what is commonly called the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. During [[World War II]], [[superhero]]es and [[funny animal]]s were the most popular genres. Following the decline of the superheroes, new genres developed (i.e., western, romance, and science fiction) and reached an increasingly important readership. At the beginning of the 1950s, with the emergence of [[television]], comic books sales began to decline. Meanwhile, they suffered many attacks on their alleged harm to youth. For instance, the introduction of the [[Comics Code Authority]] (CCA) removed the [[Crime comics|crime]]/[[Horror comics|horror]] series; though neither comic strips nor [[magazine]]s were affected by these attacks.

In 1956 began the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] with the return of the preference for superheroes, such as [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]] by [[DC Comics]]. If [[Dell Comics]] and its comics for children remained the leading publisher of comic books, genres other than superheroes started to decline and many publishers closed. Very popular superheroes, mainly created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]. This turned into the leading publisher of comics in the next period known as the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]] (from the early 1970s to 1985) during which the stories became less [[Manichaeism|manichean]] while superhero comics maintained their hegemony. The distinction between these two periods is often associated by historians to an event but it is rather a series of changes that affected many aspects of the comics world. At the same time, [[underground comics]] appeared, which, aesthetically, addressed new themes, and economically, were based on a new distribution model. Comic strips continue to be distributed throughout the country and even some of them gained international dissemination, such as ''[[Peanuts]]''.

The [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] initially seemed to be a new golden age when writers and artists recreated classic characters or launched new series that attracted millions of readers. However, it was then marked by a series of crises that threaten the financial stability of many agents. [[Alternative comics]], successors of [[underground comics]], develop in line with [[Art Spiegelman]] and his ''[[Maus]]''. On the other hand, the [[comic strip]] experienced a crisis more pronounced in the 2000s and linked to that of the press as a whole, while at the same time a new American product, the [[webcomics]], appeared.

American [[comics historian]]s generally divide 20th-century American comics history chronologically into ages. The first period, called [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]], extends from 1938 (first appearance of [[Superman]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' [[Action Comics 1|#1]] by [[National Allied Publications]], a corporate predecessor of [[DC Comics]]) to 1954 (introduction of the [[Comics Code]]). The following period, the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], goes from 1956 to early 1970s. The [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]] follows immediately and spans until 1986. Finally the last period, from 1986 until today, is the [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]].&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.4"&gt;{{harv|Rhoades|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This division is standard but not all the critics apply it, since some of them propose their own periods.&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duncan, p.22"&gt;{{harv|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the dates selected may vary depending on the authors (there are at least four dates to mark the end of the Bronze Age).

In ''A Complete History of American Comic Books'', [[Shirrel Rhoades]] resumes the canonical division but cites fan historian Ken Quattro,&lt;ref name="Quattro"&gt;Ken Quattro, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160314042452/http://www.comicartville.com/newages.htm "The New Ages: Rethinking Comic Book History"] (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; who proposes three heroic periods (from 1938 to 1955, from 1956 to 1986 and from 1986 until today).&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.5"&gt;{{harv|Rhoades|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhoades also cites [[Steve Geppi]] (the publisher of the ''[[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]'') who, taking into account comic strips, divides the history of comics in ages:&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.5"/&gt; [[Victorian era|Victorian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Victorian era was the period of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign from 1837 to 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''[[#Victorian Age|Victorian Age]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, from 1828 ‚Äî the year when [[sequential storytelling]] appeared in the British press (specifically in the ''[[Political Register]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb issue|id=1689396|title=Bell's Life in London #330}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äî to 1882 ‚Äî the debut of ''[[Grit (newspaper)|Grit]]''), of platinum ('''[[#Platinum Age|Platinum Age]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, from 1882 to 1938), of gold ([[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]], from 1938 to 1945, the end of [[World War II]] ‚Äî after WWII many marginal superheroes disappeared), [[Atomic Age|atomic]] ('''[[#Atom Age|Atom Age]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, from 1946 to 1956), of silver ([[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], from 1956 to 1971), of bronze ([[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]], from 1971 ‚Äî the year when [[Marvel Comics]] published a comic-book story about the dangers of drugs in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96‚Äì98&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rhoades|2008|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äî to 1985 ‚Äî the year when DC's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' appeared), of copper ('''Copper Age'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, from 1986 to 1992; the era began with the publication of ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rhoades|2008|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Chromium|chrome]] ('''Chrome Age'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, from 1992 ‚Äî the debut of [[Image Comics]]&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.6"&gt;{{harv|Rhoades|2008|p=6}}&lt;!--"1999 was a milestone year in which Marvel was freed from [[Bankruptcy|Chapter 11]]."--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äî to 1999 ‚Äî the year when Marvel Comics emerged from bankruptcy),&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rhoades|2008|p=163}}&lt;!--"1999 was a milestone year in which Marvel was freed from [[Bankruptcy|Chapter 11]]."--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and modern ([[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]], since 2000, the year when Marvel's [[Ultimate Marvel|''Ultimate'']] line appeared).&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.6"/&gt; Consideration of [[comic strip]]s in the general history of comics has led Geppito add two periods before the Golden Age: the Victorian Age (from 1828 to 1882) and the Platinum Age (the period of comic strips).&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.5"/&gt; Alternative definitions of the latter two periods exist: the Victorian Age has also been defined by fan historian Jamie Coville as beginning in 1842 (with the publication of ''[[The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' by [[Rodolphe T√∂pffer]] in the U.S.) and ending in 1897;&lt;ref name="Platinum Age"/&gt; the Platinum Age has also been defined as beginning in 1897 (with the publication of the ''[[Yellow Kid]]'' magazine) and ending in 1938.&lt;ref name="Platinum Age"/&gt; Quattro sets the ending of the Golden Age in 1949, the year that most of the remaining superheroes (i.e., the heroes that did not disappear after WWII) lost their eponymous series.&lt;ref name="Quattro"/&gt; Comics historian William W. Savage sets the ending of the Atom Age (the period in which there was a prevalence of [[Atomic bomb|atomic-bomb]] narratives and [[Horror comics|horror stories]]) in 1954, the year that CCA prohibited most of what had appeared prior to 1954.&lt;ref name=Savage&gt;William W. Savage, ''Commies, Cowboys, and Jungle Queens: Comic Books and America, 1945‚Äì1954'', Wesleyan University Press, 1998, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative name for the period after the mid-1980s is [[Dark Age of Comic Books]], due to the popularity and artistic influence of titles with serious content, such as ''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'' and ''Watchmen.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Voger, Mark| authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The Dark Age: Grim, Great &amp; Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics | year=2006 | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | location= | isbn=1-893905-53-5 | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pop culture]] writer Matthew J. Theriault proposed an alternative periodization scheme in which the recent history of comics is divided in ages: dark (Dark Age, from c. 1985 to 2004), modern (Modern Age, from c. 2004 to 2011; the era began with the publication of "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" and "[[Infinite Crisis]]"), and [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] ('''Postmodern Age'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, since 2011; the era began with the publication of ''[[Ultimate Fallout]]'' #4, the first appearance of [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J.

Originally only the Golden Age and the Silver Age had a right of citizenship since the terms "Golden Age" and "Silver Age" had appeared in a [[Comic book letter column|letter from a reader]] published in the n¬∫ 42 of ''[[Justice League of America]]'' in February 1966 that stated: "If you guys keep bringing back the heroes from the Golden Age, people 20 years from now will be calling this decade the Silver Sixties!"&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.71"&gt;{{harv|Rhoades|2008|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randy Duncan (scholar)|Randy Duncan]] and [[Matthew J. Smith (scholar)|Matthew J.

Comics in the United States originated in the early European works. In fact, in 1842, the work ''Les amours de Mr. Vieux Bois'' by [[Rodolphe T√∂pffer]] was published under the title ''[[The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Duncan, p.25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Platinum Age"/&gt; This edition (a [[newspaper]] supplement titled ''[[Brother Jonathan (newspaper)|Brother Jonathan Extra]]'' No. IX, September 14, 1842)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/oldbuck.htm ''The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/668dF90TD Archived] from the original on March 13, 2012. "On September 14, 1842, a New York paper, ''Brother Jonathan'', ran an English-language version of ''Oldbuck'' (published in Britain a year earlier) as a supplement."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb issue|id=1267368|title=Brother Jonathan Extra #v2#9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an unlicensed copy of the original work as it was done without T√∂pffer's authorization. This first publication was followed by other works of this author, always under types of unlicensed editions.&lt;ref name="Rubis, p.39"&gt;{{harv|Rubis|2012|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; T√∂pffer comics were reprinted regularly until the late 1870s,&lt;ref name=coville&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecomicbooks.com/old/Platinum.html |title=See you in the Funny Pages... |last1=Coville |first1=Jamie |year=2001 |work=The Comic Books |publisher= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave American artists the idea to produce similar works. In 1849, ''[[Journey to the Gold Diggins by Jeremiah Saddlebags]]'' by James A. and Donald F. Read was the first American comic.&lt;ref name="Rhoades, p.3"&gt;{{harv|Rhoades|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet, p.4"&gt;{{harv|Gabilliet|2010|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic production remained limited until the emergence of satirical magazines that, on the model of British ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', published drawings and humorous short stories, but also stories in pictures&lt;ref name=coville /&gt; and silent comics. The three main titles were ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Harvey, p.4"&gt;{{harv|Harvey|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Arthur Burdett Frost]] created stories as innovative as those produced in the same period by Europeans. However, these magazines only reach an audience educated and rich enough to afford them. Just the arrival of technological progress allowed easy and cheap reproduction of images for the American comic to take off. Some media moguls like [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]] engaged in a fierce competition to attract readers and decided to publish cartoons in their newspapers.&lt;ref name="Rubis, p.45"&gt;{{harv|Rubis|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1896-11-08 Yellow Kid.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' published in the ''[[New York Journal]]'' from 8 November 1896.]]
The period of the late nineteenth century (the so-called "Platinum Age") was characterized by a gradual introduction of the key elements of the American mass comics. Then, the [[Sunday funnies|funnies]] were found in the humor pages of newspapers: they were published in the Sunday edition to retain readership. Indeed, it was not the information given that distinguished the newspapers but the [[editorial]]s and the pages which were not informative, whose illustrations were an important component.&lt;ref name="Harvey, p.38"&gt;{{harv|Harvey|2009|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pages were then called comic supplement. In 1892, [[William Randolph Hearst]] published cartoons in his first newspaper, ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]''. [[James Swinnerton]] created on this occasion the first drawings of [[humanized animals]] in the series ''[[Little Bears and Tykes]]''.&lt;ref name="Baron-Carvais, p.12"&gt;{{harv|Baron-Carvais|1994|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, drawings published in the press were rather a series of humorous independent cartoons occupying a full page. The purpose of the cartoon itself, as expressed through narrative sequence expressed through images which follow one another, was only imposed slowly.

In 1894, Joseph Pulitzer published in the ''[[New York World]]'' the first color strip, designed by [[Walt McDougall]], showing that the technique already enabled this kind of publications.&lt;ref name="Dupuis, p.16"&gt;{{harv|Dupuis|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors began to create recurring characters. Thus, in 1894 and still in the ''New York World'', [[Richard F. Outcault]] presented ''[[The Yellow Kid|Hogan's Alley]]'', created shortly before in the magazine ''[[Truth Magazine]]''. In this series of full-page large drawings teeming with humorous details, he staged street urchins, one of whom was wearing a blue nightgown (which turned yellow in 1895). Soon, the little character became the darling of readers who called him ''Yellow Kid''.&lt;ref name="Baron-Carvais, p.13"&gt;{{harv|Baron-Carvais|1994|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 1896, [[The Yellow Kid|the ''Yellow Kid'']] pronounced his first words in a [[speech balloon]] (they were previously written on his shirt). Outcault had already used this method but this date is often considered as the birth of comics in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lord |first1=Denis |date=March 2004 |title=Bandes dessin√©es: le phylact√®re francophone c√©l√®bre ses 100 ans |journal=[[Le Devoir]] |volume=|issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/actualites-culturelles/45950/bandes-dessinees-le-phylactere-francophone-celebre-ses-100-ans |accessdate=14 January 2013|issn= |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yellow Kid'' success boosted sales of the ''New York World'', fueling the greed of Hearst. Fierce competition between Hearst and Pulitzer in 1896 led to enticing away of Outcault by Hearst to work in the ''[[New York Journal]]''. A bitter legal battle allowed Pulitzer to keep publishing ''Hogan's Alley'' (which he entrusted to [[Georges B. Luks]]) and Hearst to publish the series under another name. [[Richard Outcault]] chose the title ''The Yellow Kid''. Published in 1897, the ''[[Yellow Kid]]'' magazine consisting of sheets previously appeared in newspapers and it was the first magazine of its kind.&lt;ref name="Duncan, p.26"&gt;{{harv|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/06017640/ ''The Yellow kid''].

Comics historian Ken Quattro sets the ending of the Golden Age in 1949, the year that most of the remaining superheroes (i.e., the heroes that did not disappear after [[WWII]]) lost their eponymous series.&lt;ref name="Quattro"/&gt; Comics historian William W. Savage describes the period 1945‚Äì1954 as the period in which there was a prevalence of [[Atomic bomb|atomic-bomb]] narratives and [[Horror comics|horror stories]].&lt;ref name=Savage/&gt; Even the few superhero titles that survived the era featured stories reflecting atomic anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Atkinson, "Lights, Camera, Action 101: A Brief Lesson on How to See an Atomic Bomb" in: Chris York, Rafiel York (eds.), ''Comic Books and the Cold War, 1946‚Äì1962: Essays on Graphic Treatment of Communism, the Code and Social Concerns'', McFarland, 2012, pp. 19‚Äì29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage sets the ending of the period in 1954 because this was the year that the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited most of what had appeared prior to 1954.&lt;ref name=Savage/&gt; The crackdown on [[EC Comics]]'s horror line and its imitators in order for them to comply with the 1954 Code altered the comics industry.&lt;ref name="Quattro"/&gt; The era between the end of the Golden Age and the Silver Age nearly caused the end of the industry.&lt;ref name="Quattro"/&gt; As a result of the Code's restrictions, the mid-1950s saw the rise of [[Dell Comics]], whose [[family-friendly]] flagship title ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' often sold over two million copies a month.&lt;ref name="Quattro"/&gt;

The invention of the [[television]] was the work of many individuals in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Individuals and corporations competed in various parts of the world to deliver a device that superseded previous technology. Many were compelled to capitalize on the invention and make profit, while some wanted to change the world through visual and audio communication technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/History%20of%20Television%20page.htm|title = History of Television|date = February 6, 2015|accessdate = February 6, 2015|website = www.nyu.edu|publisher = New York University |last = Stephens|first = Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a 23-year-old German university student, [[Paul Nipkow|Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow]] proposed and patented the [[Nipkow disk]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers, George and May (1997), ''Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940''. Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 13, 22. {{ISBN|978-0-8240-7782-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk "[[rasterizer|image rasterizer]]" became exceedingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers &amp; Shiers, p. 13, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Perskyi]] had coined the word ''television'' in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in [[Paris]] on August 24, 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.histv.net/perskyi-1900 T√©l√©vision au moyen de l'√©lectricit√©]", ''Congr√®s Inographs by Telegraph", ''The New York Times'', Sunday Magazine, September 20, 1907, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology, by [[Lee de Forest]] and [[Arthur Korn]] among others, made the design practical.&lt;ref name="Sending Photographs by Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1907/02/24/archives/sending-photographs-by-telegraph-professor-korn-has-triumphantly.html "Sending Photographs by Telegraph"], ''The New York Times'', Sunday Magazine, September 20, 1907, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first demonstration of the ''instantaneous'' transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 [[selenium]] cells, individually wired to a mechanical [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], served as an electronic [[retina]]. In the receiver, a type of [[Kerr effect|Kerr cell]] modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 [[pixel]] resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted "several times" each second.&lt;ref&gt;Henry de Varigny, "[http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm La vision √† distance]", ''L'Illustration'', Paris, December 11, 1909, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, [[Boris Rosing]] and his student [[Vladimir Zworykin]] created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, "very crude images" over wires to the "[[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube" ([[cathode ray tube]] or "CRT") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner, "the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZcwhVyiMqsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Burns+%27%27Television:+An+International+History+of+the+Formative+Years%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=zworykin%20rosing%20selenium&amp;f=false R.

[[File:John Logie Baird and Stooky Bill.png|thumb|left|200px|[[John Logie Baird|Baird]] in 1925 with his televisor equipment and dummies "James" and "Stooky Bill" ''(right)''.]]
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John Logie Baird, 1st Image.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The first known photograph of a moving image produced by Baird's "televisor", circa 1926 (The subject is Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson)]] --&gt;

By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] employed the [[Nipkow disk]] in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype in a little village called Santa Cruz on the island of Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He had also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v115/n2892/pdf/115504a0.pdf "Current Topics and Events"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 115, April 4, 1925, p. 505‚Äì506, {{doi|10.1038/115504a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926 he demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.

In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]]. In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Path√©]] established France's first television company, T√©l√©vision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Baird, "[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead, a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.

An American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on "Motion Pictures by Wireless" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses. On June 13, 1925, Jenkins publicly demonstrated the synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925, Jenkins used a [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles (from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C.), using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion", ''The New York Times'', June 14, 1925, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glinsky"&gt;{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = 41‚Äì45| isbn = 0-252-02582-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted U.S. patent 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed March 13, 1922).

On December 25, 1925, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum at [[Shizuoka University]], Hamamatsu Campus.&lt;ref name="nhk.or.jp"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160101180643/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ ''Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television''], NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), 2002, retrieved 2009-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, Takayanagi improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wQhlFaxDwrsC&amp;pg=PA220 ''High Above: The untold story of Astra, Europe's leading satellite company'', page 220], [[Springer Science+Business Media]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928, he was the first to transmit human faces in halftones. His work had an influence on the later work of [[Vladimir K. Zworykin]].&lt;ref name="abramson"&gt;Albert Abramson, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 231. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1935, Takayanagi had invented the first all-electronic television.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Popular Photography]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJsbJq2_djkC&amp;pg=PA5 November 1990, page 5]&lt;/ref&gt; His research toward creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="nhk.or.jp" /&gt;

[[Herbert E. Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on April 7, 1927. The reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a two-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&amp;nbsp;inches wide by 30&amp;nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets also received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: "It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality."&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland &amp; Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-89950-284-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[WRGB]] (then W2XB''')''' was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the [[General Electric]] facility in [[Schenectady, NY]]. It was popularly known as "[[WGY (AM)|WGY]] Television".

Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[L√©on Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16-line resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[interlacing]] in 1926. As part of his thesis on May 7, 1926, Theremin electrically transmitted and then projected near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen.&lt;ref name="glinsky"/&gt; By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until 1931 by RCA, with 120 lines.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution in mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to about 120. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. McLean, ''Restoring Baird's Image'' (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in [[Paris]] in 1935, and the 180-line system that [[Peck Television Corp.]] started in 1935 at station VE9AK in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/ve9ak.html |title=VE9AK entry at |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peck Television Corporation Console Receiver and Camera|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/peck.html|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anton Codelli (22nd. March, 1875 - ‚Ä† 28. April 1954), a [[Slovenia]]n nobleman, was a passionate inventor. Among other things, he had devised a miniature refrigerator for cars and a new rotary engine design. Intrigued by television, he decided to apply his technical skills to the new medium. At the time, the biggest challenge in television technology was to transmit images with sufficient resolution to reproduce recognizable figures. As recounted by media historian Melita Zajc, most inventors were determined to increase the number of lines used by their systems ‚Äì some were approaching what was then the magic number of 100 lines. But Baron Codelli had a different idea. In 1929, he developed a [[television device with a single line]] ‚Äì but one that formed a continuous spiral on the screen. Codelli based his ingenious design on his understanding of the human eye. He knew that objects seen in peripheral vision don‚Äôt need to be as sharp as those in the center. The baron‚Äôs mechanical television system, whose image was sharpest in the middle, worked well, and he was soon able to transmit images of his wife, Ilona von Drasche-Lazar, over the air.
Despite the backing of the German electronics giant Telefunken, however, Codelli‚Äôs television system never became a commercial reality. Electronic television ultimately emerged as the dominant system, and Codelli moved on to other projects. His invention was largely forgotten.

The advancement of all-electronic television (including [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissector]]s and other camera tubes and [[cathode ray tube]]s for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical TV usually only produced small images. It was the main type of TV until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.

In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]], an English [[physicist]], in his three famous experiments was able to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern Cathode Ray Tube (CRT).  The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897 and is also known as the ''Braun tube''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Braun (1897) [https://archive.is/20141217172841/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 "Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Str√∂me"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''' :  552-559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|work=Medical Discoveries|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]] with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.

&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams succeeded in transmitting "very faint" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first cathode ray tube to use a [[hot cathode]] was developed by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B.

In 1926, Hungarian engineer [[K√°lm√°n Tihanyi]] designed a television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing the principle of "charge storage" within the scanning (or "camera") tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hungary ‚Äì K√°lm√°n Tihanyi's 1926 Patent Application 'Radioskop' | work = Memory of the World | publisher = [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] | url = http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23240&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html| accessdate =22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US2133123 /&gt;&lt;ref name=US2158259 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/zworykin.html |title=Vladimir Kosma Zworykin, 1889‚Äì1982 |publisher=Bairdtelevision.com |accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or "camera" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by K√°lm√°n Tihanyi beginning in 1924.&lt;ref name="IEC_Tihanyi"&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/about/history/techline/swf/temp.xml] "K√°lm√°n Tihanyi (1897‚Äì1947)", ''IEC Techline'', International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 2009-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges ("photoelectrons") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle.

This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration.&lt;ref name="sfmuseum"/&gt; In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).&lt;ref&gt;[http://db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu/lucene/Manuscripts/null/Ms0648.xml/complete The Philo T. and Elma G.

[[Image:Zworykin kinescope 1929.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Zworykin]] demonstrates electronic television (1929)]]
Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 51. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a [[patent interference]] suit against Farnsworth. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application,&lt;ref name=US1691324&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=mZ9KAAAAEBAJ Zworykin, Vladimir K., Television System].

Retrieved 2010-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.&lt;ref&gt;Stashower, Daniel, ''The Boy Genius and the Mogul: The Untold Story of Television'', Broadway Books, 2002, p. 243‚Äì244. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-0759-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everson"&gt;Everson, George (1949), ''The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T.

In 1978, James P Mitchell described, prototyped and demonstrated what was perhaps the earliest monochromatic flat panel LED television display [[LED Display]] targeted at replacing the CRT.

==Color television==

{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2012}}
The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built.
Among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning, although he gave no practical details.&lt;ref&gt;M. Le Blanc, "Etude sur la transmission √©lectrique des impressions lumineuses", ''La Lumi√®re Electrique'', vol. 11, December 1, 1880, p. 477‚Äì481.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish inventor [[Jan Szczepanik]] patented a color television system in 1897, using a [[selenium]] photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 1998, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another inventor, [[Hovannes Adamian]], also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him,&lt;ref&gt;Western technology and Soviet economic development: 1945 to 1965, by Antony C. Sutton, Business &amp; Economics - 1973, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; and was patented in [[Germany]] on March 31, 1908, patent ‚Ññ 197183, then in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], on April 1, 1908, patent ‚Ññ 7219,&lt;ref&gt;The History of Television, 1880-1941, by Albert Abramson, 1987, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; in [[France]] (patent ‚Ññ 390326) and in [[Russia]] in 1910 (patent ‚Ññ 17912).&lt;ref name="tvmuseum.ru"&gt;[http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=1018 A.

[[Scotland|Scottish]] inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission on July 3, 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;John Logie Baird, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ Television Apparatus and the Like], U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on February 4, 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] studios to a projection screen at [[London]]'s [[Dominion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Crystal Palace Television Studios]. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green and blue images into one full color image.

The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disc. This device was very "deep", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|publisher=|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baird was not happy with the design, and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

Mexican inventor [[Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena]] also played an important role in early TV. His experiments with TV (known as telectroescop√≠a at first) began in 1931 and led to a patent for the "trichromatic field sequential system" [[color television]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=sQBkAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2296019|title=Patent US2296019 - Chromoscopic adapter for television equipment|publisher=|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Goldmark, assignor to Columbia Broadcasting System, "Color Television", [http://www.google.com/patents?id=7pNDAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=color+television&amp;as_drrb_ap=b&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=1936&amp;as_maxm_ap=12&amp;as_maxy_ap=1941&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007 U.S. Patent 2,480,571], filed Sept. 7, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was first demonstrated to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 4.&lt;ref&gt;Current Broadcasting 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Success in Test", ''The New York Times'', August 30, 1940, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Achieves Realism", ''The New York Times'', Sept. 5, 1940, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=JScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 New Television System Transmits Images in Full Color]", ''Popular Science'', December 1940, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as August 28, 1940, and live cameras by November 12.&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Success in Test," ''The New York Times'', Aug. 30, 1940, p. 21.

"Television Hearing Set," ''The New York Times'', Nov. 13, 1940, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC]] (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on February 20, 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on June 1, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Color Firsts in Television (commented)].&lt;/ref&gt; These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 22, 1942, to August 20, 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22," ''The New York Times'', March 8, 1942, p. 1.

As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the "[[Telechrome]]". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called "stereoscopic" at the time). A demonstration on August 16, 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. This used a patterned version of the phosphor plate, with the guns aimed at ridges on one side of the plate. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2003, pp. 13‚Äì14. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

One of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee&lt;ref name=name&gt;National Television System Committee (1951‚Äì1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12‚Äì19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; approved an all-electronic [[Compatible color]] system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The [[NTSC]] standard represented a major technical achievement.

[[File:SMPTE Color Bars.svg|thumb|left|Color bars used in a [[test pattern]], sometimes used when no program material is available.]]
Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=color+television+December+17+1953&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XpTGUdq5JO_A4APivoCoDA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on January 1, 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE's]] relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets.

Color broadcasting in Europe was also not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s.

By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color, and by the early 1980s black-and-white sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.

==Digital television==
{{main|Digital television}}
{{see also|Digital television transition}}

Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signal, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]]. Digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/digital-hdtv.shtml | title=HDTV Set Top Boxes and Digital TV Broadcast Information | accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high-performance computers. It wasn't until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|publisher=|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s Japanese consumer electronics firms developed HDTV technology, and the MUSE analog format proposed by NHK, a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard‚Äîbased on an analog system‚Äîwas the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.

In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being "simulcast" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.

The final standard adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes‚Äîinterlaced or progressive‚Äîis superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not "flicker" in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then feasible, that is, 1080 lines per picture and 1920 pixels per line. William F. Schreiber, who was a director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital television transition]] started in the late 2000s. All the governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by the 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low. But soon, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.

Advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs. A smart television, sometimes referred to as ''connected TV'' or ''hybrid television'', is a television set with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features, and is an example of [[technological convergence]] between computers and television sets and set-top boxes.  Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional [[Broadcasting|broadcasting media]], these devices can also provide Internet TV, online [[interactive media]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and [[home network]]ing access.

Smart TV should not to be confused with [[Internet TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Internet television]] refers to the receiving television content over internet instead of traditional systems (terrestrial, cable and satellite) (although internet itself is received by these methods). [[IPTV|Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

==3D television==
{{main|3D television}}

Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on August 10, 1928, by [[John Logie Baird]] in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html |title=How Stereoscopic Television is Shown |publisher=Baird Television website|accessdate=18 September 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electro-mechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs.

Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads among the public. Many 3D television channels that started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Overview ===
Programming is [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] by [[television station]]s, sometimes called "channels", as stations are [[Frequency allocation|licensed]] by their governments to broadcast only over assigned [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]] in the television [[band (radio)|band]]. At first, [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting]] was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of [[Television channel|channels]] available, government regulation was the norm.

=== United States ===
In the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].

[[WRGB]] claims to be the world's oldest [[television station]], tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on January 13, 1928, broadcasting from the [[General Electric]] factory in [[Schenectady, NY]], under the call letters '''W2XB'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The First Television Show" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, pp. 177-179]&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularly known as "WGY Television" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers.

On November 2, 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|publisher=|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.

With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 "CEA Study Says Seven Percent of TV Households Use Antennas"], '"TVTechnology'', 30 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 "Nielsen: Broadcast Reliance Grew in 2012"], ''TVTechnology'', 14 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to a switchover to [[digital terrestrial television]] broadcasts, which offer pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to CATV for [[cord cutters]].

=== Canada ===
The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) adopted the American NTSC 525-line B/W 60 field per second system as its broadcast standard. It began television broadcasting in Canada in September 1952. The first broadcast was on September 6, 1952 from its [[Montreal]] station [[CBFT]]. The premiere broadcast was bilingual, spoken in English and French. Two days later, on September 8, 1952, the [[Toronto]] station [[CBLT (TV)|CBLT]] went on the air. This became the English-speaking flagship station for the country, while CBFT became the French-language flagship after a second English-language station was licensed to CBC in Montreal later in the decade. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, [[CICI-TV|CKSO]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]], launched in October 1953 (at the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that was relaxed in 1960‚Äì61 when CTV, Canada's second national English-language network, was formed).

=== Czechoslovakia ===
[[File:H√∂ritz Museum - Fernseher Tesla 40001A.jpg|thumb|The first mass-produced Czechoslovak TV-set Tesla 4001A (1953-57).]]
In former [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]]) the first experimental [[television set]]s were produced in 1948. In the same year the first TV- transmission was performed. The first regular TV public transmission started on May 1, 1953. The state-owned TV-centers were in [[Prague]], [[Bratislava]], [[Brno]] and [[Ostrava]]. In 1961 more than a million citizens had a television set. In 1970, Czechoslovak television had three channels: Czech, Slovak and a bilingual Federal Channel. In 1973, color broadcasting started.

=== France ===
The first experiments in television broadcasting began in France in the 1930s, although the French did not immediately employ the new technology.

In November 1929, Bernard Natan established France's first television company, T√©l√©vision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. On April 14, 1931, there took place the first transmission with a thirty-line standard by Ren√© Barth√©lemy. On December 6, 1931, [[Henri de France]] created the Compagnie G√©n√©rale de T√©l√©vision (CGT). In December 1932, Barth√©lemy carried out an experimental program in black and white (definition: 60 lines) one hour per week, "Paris T√©l√©vision", which gradually became daily from early 1933.

The first official channel of French television appeared on February 13, 1935, the date of the official inauguration of television in France, which was broadcast in 60 lines from 8:15 to 8:30 pm. The program showed the actress B√©atrice Bretty in the studio of Radio-PTT Vision at 103 rue de Grenelle in Paris. The broadcast had a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}. On November 10, [[George Mandel]], Minister of Posts, inaugurated the first broadcast in 180 lines from the transmitter of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. On the 18th, Susy Wincker, the first announcer since the previous June, carried out a demonstration for the press from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Broadcasts became regular from January 4, 1937 from 11:00 to 11:30 am and 8:00 to 8:30 pm during the week, and from 5:30 to 7:30 pm on Sundays. In July 1938, a decree defined for three years a standard of 455 lines VHF (whereas three standards were used for the experiments: 441 lines for Gramont, 450 lines for the Compagnie des Compteurs and 455 for Thomson). In 1939, there were about only 200 to 300 individual television sets, some of which were also available in a few public places.

With the entry of France into World War II the same year, broadcasts ceased and the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was sabotaged. On September 3, 1940, French television was seized by the German occupation forces. A technical agreement was signed by the Compagnie des Compteurs and [[Telefunken]], and a financing agreement for the resuming of the service is signed by German Ministry of Post and Radiodiffusion Nationale ([[Vichy France|Vichy]]'s radio). On May 7, 1943 at 3:00 evening broadcasts. The first broadcast of [[Fernsehsender Paris]] (Paris T√©l√©vision) was transmitted from rue Cognac-Jay. These regular broadcasts (5{{fraction|1|4}} hours a day) lasted until August 16, 1944. One thousand 441-line sets, most of which were installed in soldiers' hospitals, picked up the broadcasts. These Nazi-controlled television broadcasts from the Eiffel Tower in Paris were able to be received on the south coast of England by R.A.F. and BBC engineers,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlytelevision.org/raf.html ''R.A.F. Reception of German TV from Paris'', retrieved 2013 April 23&lt;/ref&gt; who photographed the station identification image direct from the screen.

In 1944, Ren√© Barth√©lemy developed an [[819-line]] television standard. During the years of occupation, Barth√©lemy reached 1015 and even 1042 lines. On October 1, 1944, television service resumed after the [[liberation of Paris]]. The broadcasts were transmitted from the Cognacq-Jay studios. In October 1945, after repairs, the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was back in service. On November 20, 1948, [[Fran√ßois Mitterrand]] decreed a broadcast standard of 819 lines; broadcasting began at the end of 1949 in this definition. Besides France, this standard was later adopted by Algeria, Monaco, and Morocco. Belgium and Luxembourg used a modified version of this standard with bandwidth narrowed to 7&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="britbroadcasttrans"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jKjoU8bokw0C&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=819+lines+television+france+belgium+denmark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=90q2zZ9zlK&amp;sig=TA_4mLYyhwwRqS2JvKF2lnzsgnM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtr8O815nQAhWDtpQKHasxDygQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=819%20lines%20television%20france%20belgium%20denmark&amp;f=false|title = British Broadcasting in Transition|author = Burton Paulu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
Electromechanical broadcasts began in Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on [[180 lines]] using [[telecine]] transmission of film, [[intermediate film system]], or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras based on the [[iconoscope]] began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin [[1936 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and [[Hamburg]] in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened for anybody who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system on the air in February 1937, and during [[World War II]] brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.

After the end of World War II, the victorious Allies imposed a general ban on all radio and television broadcasting in Germany. Radio broadcasts for information purposes were soon permitted again, but television broadcasting was allowed to resume only in 1948.

In East Germany, the head of broadcasting in the Soviet occupation zone, Hans Mahler, predicted in 1948 that in the near future ‚Äòa new and important technical step forward in the field of broadcasting in Germany will begin its triumphant march: television.‚Äô  In 1950, the plans for a nationwide television service got off the ground, and a Television Centre in Berlin was approved. Transmissions began on December 21, 1952 using the 625-line standard developed in the Soviet Union in 1944, although at that time there were probably no more than 75 television receivers capable of receiving the programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/socialsciences/screening-socialism/television-histories/tvinthegdr/ "TV in the GDR"], ''Loughborough University''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dra.de/online/hinweisdienste/kurzinformationen/70jahre-fs.pdf "Fernsehen aus Adlershof"], ''Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv Babelsberg''&lt;/ref&gt;

In West Germany, the British occupation forces as well as [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk|NWDR]] (Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk), which had started work in the British zone straight after the war, agreed to the launch of a television station. Even before this, German television specialists had agreed on 625 lines as the future standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/dossiers_1_04_eurovision50_ve_tcm6-13890.pdf "50 years of Eurovision"], ''EBU'', January, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This standard had narrower channel bandwidth (7&amp;nbsp;MHz) compared to the Soviet specification (8&amp;nbsp;MHz), allowing three television channels to fit into the [[Band I|VHF I]] band.

When color was introduced, West Germany chose a variant of the [[NTSC]] color system, modified by [[Walter Bruch]] and called [[PAL]]. East Germany accepted the French [[SECAM]] system, which was used in Eastern European countries. With the reunification of Germany, it was decided to switch to the PAL color system. The system was changed in December 1990.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, the first experimental tests on television broadcasts were made in [[Turin]] since 1934. The city already hosted the Center for Management of the [[Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche|EIAR]] (lately renamed as [[RAI]]) at the premises of the Theatre of Turin. Subsequently, the EAIR established offices in [[Rome]] and [[Milan]].
On July 22, 1939 comes into operation in Rome the first television transmitter at the EIAR station, which performed a regular broadcast for about a year using a 441-line system that was developed in Germany. In September of the same year, a second television transmitter was installed in Milan, making experimental broadcasts during major events in the city.

The broadcasts were suddenly ended on May 31, 1940, by order of the government, allegedly because of interferences encountered in the first air navigation systems. Also, the imminent participation in the war is believed to have played a role in this decision. EIAR transmitting equipment was relocated to Germany by the German troops. Lately, it was returned to Italy.

The first official television broadcast began on January 3, 1954 by the RAI.

=== Japan ===
Television broadcasting in Japan started in August 28, 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p07/column/index1.html |title="Can you see me clearly?"

The first television tests were conducted as early as 1926 using a combined mechanical [[Nipkow disk]] and electronic [[Braun tube]] system, later switching to an all-electronic system in 1935 using a domestically developed [[iconoscope]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/index.html Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604084708/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/index.html |date=June 4, 2002 }}. Retrieved 2012-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of that, because of the beginning of [[World War II in the Pacific]] region, this first full-fledged TV broadcast experimentation lasted only a few months. Regular television broadcasts would eventually start in 1953.

In 1979, NHK first developed a consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,132289-c,hdtv/article.html|title=Researchers Craft HDTV's Successor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding]] for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1080i/1125 lines). Satellite test broadcasts started in 1989, with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of [[Broadcasting Satellite (Japanese)|BS]]-9ch commenced on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK [[television program]]ming.

[[Sony]] first demonstrated a wideband [[analog high-definition television system]] [[HDTV]] capable video camera, monitor and [[video tape recorder]] (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in [[Algiers]]. The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 [[video switcher]] all working in the 1125-line [[component video]] format with [[interlaced video]] and a 5:3 aspect ratio.

=== Mexico ===
The first testing television station in Mexico signed on in 1935. When [[KFMB-TV]] in [[San Diego]] signed on in 1949, [[Baja California]] became the first state to receive a commercial television station over the air. Within a year, the Mexican government would adopt the U.S. NTSC 525-line B/W 60-field-per-second system as the country's broadcast standard. In 1950, the first commercial television station within Mexico, [[XHTV]] in Mexico City, signed on the air, followed by [[XEW-TV]] in 1951 and [[XHGC]] in 1952. Those three were not only the first television stations in the country, but also the flagship stations of [[Telesistema Mexicano]], which was formed in 1955. That year, [[Emilio Azc√°rraga Vidaurreta]], who had signed on XEW-TV, entered into a partnership with [[R√≥mulo O'Farrill]] who had signed on XHTV, and [[Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena]], who had signed on XHGC. The earliest [[3D television]] broadcasts in the world were broadcast over XHGC in 1954. Color television was introduced in 1962, also over XHGC-TV. One of Telesistema Mexicano's earliest broadcasts as a network, over XEW-TV, on June 25, 1955, was the first international North American broadcast in the medium's history, and was jointly aired with NBC in the United States, where it aired as the premiere episode of ''[[Wide Wide World]],'' and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Except for a brief period between 1969‚Äì1973, nearly every commercial television station in Mexico, with exceptions in the border cities, was expected to affiliate with a subnetwork of Telesistema Mexicano or its successor, [[Televisa]] (formed by the 1973 merger of Telesistema Mexicano and [[Television Independiente de Mexico]]). This condition would not be relaxed for good until 1993, when Imevision was privatized to become [[TV Azteca]].

=== Soviet Union (USSR) ===
The Soviet Union began offering 30-line electromechanical test broadcasts in Moscow on October 31, 1931, and a commercially manufactured television set in 1932.

First electronic television system on 180 lines at 25 fps was created in the beginning of 1935 in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). In September 1937 the experimental Leningrad TV Center (OLTC) was put in action. OLTC worked with 240 lines at 25 fps progressive scan.&lt;ref name="Raspletin_100years_RussianTV"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=5850|title = Participation of A.Raspletin in developing and realization of black-and-white television standards }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Moscow, experimental transmissions of electronic television took place on March 9, 1937, using equipment manufactured by [[RCA]]. Regular broadcasting began on December 31, 1938. It was quickly realized that 343 lines of resolution offered by this format would have become insufficient in the long run, thus a specification for 441-line format at 25 fps interlaced was developed in 1940.&lt;ref name="Raspletin_100years_RussianTV"/&gt;

Television broadcasts were suspended during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]. In 1944, while the war was still raging, a new standard, offering 625 lines of vertical resolution was prepared. This format was ultimately accepted as a national standard.&lt;ref name="Raspletin_100years_RussianTV"/&gt;

The transmissions in 625-line format started in Moscow on November 4, 1948. Regular broadcasting began on June 16, 1949. Details for this standard were formalized in 1955 specification called ''GOST 7845-55, basic parameters for black-and-white television broadcast''. In particular, frame size was set to 625 lines, frame rate to 25 frames/s interlaced, and video bandwidth to 6&amp;nbsp;MHz. These basic parameters were accepted by most countries having 50&amp;nbsp;Hz mains frequency and became the foundation of television systems presently known as PAL and SECAM.

Starting in 1951, broadcasting in the 625-line standard was introduced in other major cities of the Soviet Union.

Color television broadcast started in 1967, using SECAM color system.&lt;ref name="60TH_ANNIVERSARY_OF_625"/&gt;

=== Turkey ===
The first Turkish [[television]] channel, [[ITU TV]], was launched in 1952. The first national television is [[TRT 1]] and was launched in 1964. [[Color television]] was introduced in 1981. Before 1989 there was the only channel, the state broadcasting company TRT, and it broadcast in several times of the dateline. [[Turkey]]'s first private television channel [[Star TV (Turkey)|Star]] started it broadcast on 26 May 1989. Until then there was only one television channel controlled by the state, but with the wave of liberalization, privately owned broadcasting began. Turkey's television market is defined by a handful of big channels, led by [[Kanal D]], [[ATV (Turkey)|ATV]] and [[Show TV|Show]], with 14%, 10% and 9.6% market share, respectively. The most important reception platforms are terrestrial and satellite, with almost 50% of homes using satellite (of these 15% were pay services) at the end of 2009. Three services dominate the multi-channel market: the satellite platforms [[Digit√ºrk]] and [[D-Smart]] and the cable TV service [[Turksat (company)|T√ºrksat]].

=== United Kingdom ===
The first British television broadcast was made by Baird Television's electromechanical system over the BBC radio transmitter in September 1929. Baird provided a limited amount of programming five days a week by 1930. During this time, Southampton earned the distinction of broadcasting the first-ever live television interview, which featured Peggy O'Neil, an actress and singer from [[Buffalo, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehydraulics.com/the_hydraulics/2009/01/peggy-oneil-sang-her-way-from-the-hydraulics-to-stardom.html Hawley, Chris, "Peggy O'Neil sang her way from the Hydraulics to stardom"], ''The Hydraulics'' [blog], January 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 1932, BBC launched its own regular service using Baird's 30-line electromechanical system, continuing until September 11, 1935. On November 2, 1936 the BBC began broadcasting a dual-system service, alternating between Marconi-EMI's [[405-line]] standard and Baird's improved 240-line standard, from [[Alexandra Palace]] in London, making the BBC Television Service (now [[BBC One]]) the UK's first regular high-definition television service. The government, on advice from a special advisory committee, decided that Marconi-EMI's electronic system gave the superior picture, and the Baird system was dropped in February 1937. TV broadcasts in London were on the air an average of four hours daily from 1936 to 1939. There were 12,000 to 15,000 receivers. Some sets in restaurants or bars might have 100 viewers for sport events (Dunlap, p56). The outbreak of the Second World War caused the BBC service to be abruptly suspended on September 1, 1939, at 12:35 pm, after a Mickey Mouse cartoon and test signals were broadcast,&lt;ref name=MickeyMouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff/index.htm |title=The edit that rewrote history ‚Äì Baird |accessdate=28 May 2007 |publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System |date=31 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125014953/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff/index.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that transmissions could not be used as a beacon to guide enemy aircraft to London.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It resumed, again from Alexandra Palace on June 7, 1946 after the end of the war, began with a live programme that opened with the line "Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?¬î" and was followed by the same Mickey Mouse cartoon broadcast on the last day before the war.&lt;ref name=MickeyMouse /&gt; At the end of 1947 there were 54,000 licensed television receivers, compared with 44,000 television sets in the United States at that time.&lt;ref name=Shagawat /&gt;

The first transatlantic television signal was sent in 1928 from London to New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Faces Sent By Radio 3000 Miles Across The Sea|newspaper=[[Evening Independent]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 9, 1928|accessdate=July 15, 2011|page=1|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ss5PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=x1QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4703,3386956}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television, although this signal was not broadcast to the public. The first live satellite signal to Britain from the United States was broadcast via the [[Telstar]] satellite on July 23, 1962.

The first live broadcast from the European continent was made on August 27, 1950.

The first regularly scheduled television service in the United States began on July 2, 1928, fifteen months before the United Kingdom. The [[Federal Radio Commission]] authorized [[Charles Francis Jenkins|C. F. Jenkins]] to broadcast from experimental station W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. For at least the first eighteen months, 48-line silhouette images from motion picture film were broadcast, although beginning in the summer of 1929 he occasionally broadcast in halftones.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=wd4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA820 What Television Offers You]", ''Popular Mechanics'', November 1928, p. 823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=xt4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA472 The Latest in Television]", ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1929, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugo Gernsback]]'s New York City radio station began a regular, if limited, schedule of [[live television]] broadcasts on August 14, 1928, using 48-line images. Working with only one transmitter, the station alternated radio broadcasts with silent television images of the station's [[call sign]], faces in motion, and wind-up toys in motion.&lt;ref&gt;"WRNY to Start Daily Television Broadcasts; Radio Audience Will See Studio Artist", ''The New York Times'', August 13, 1928, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"WRNY Has Extended Television Schedule", ''The New York Times'', September 30, 1928, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking later that month, Gernsback downplayed the broadcasts, intended for amateur experimenters. "In six months we may have television for the public, but so far we have not got it."&lt;ref&gt;"Television Drama Shown With Music", ''The New York Times'', August 22, 1928, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Gernsback also published ''Television'', the world's first magazine about the medium.

[[General Electric]]'s experimental station in [[Schenectady, New York]], on the air sporadically since January 13, 1928, was able to broadcast reflected-light, 48-line images via [[shortwave]] as far as [[Los Angeles]], and by September was making four television broadcasts weekly. It is considered to be the direct predecessor of current television station [[WRGB]]. ''The Queen's Messenger'', a one-act play broadcast on September 11, 1928, was the world's first live drama on television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/queens_messenger.html The Queen's Messenger], Early Television Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio giant [[RCA]] began daily experimental television broadcasts in New York City in March 1929 over station [[W2XBS]], the predecessor of current television station [[WNBC]]. The 60-line transmissions consisted of pictures, signs, and views of persons and objects.&lt;ref&gt;"Television Placed on Daily Schedule", ''The New York Times'', March 22, 1929, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental broadcasts continued to 1931.&lt;ref&gt;"Six Visual Stations on the New York Air", ''The New York Times'', July 19, 1931, p.

[[General Broadcasting System]]'s [[WINS (AM)|WGBS]] radio and [[W2XCR]] television aired their regular broadcasting debut in New York City on April 26, 1931, with a special demonstration set up in Aeolian Hall at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-fourth Street. Thousands waited to catch a glimpse of the Broadway stars who appeared on the six-inch (15&amp;nbsp;cm) square image, in an evening event to publicize a weekday programming schedule offering films and live entertainers during the four-hour daily broadcasts. Appearing were boxer [[Primo Carnera]], actors [[Gertrude Lawrence]], [[Louis Calhern]], [[Frances Upton]] and [[Lionel Atwill]], WHN announcer [[Nils Granlund]], the [[Forman Sisters]], and a host of others.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Talkies Put On Program Basis", ''The New York Times'', April 27, 1931, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBS]]'s New York City station W2XAB began broadcasting their first regular seven-day-a-week television schedule on July 21, 1931, with a 60-line electromechanical system. The first broadcast included Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]], the [[Boswell Sisters]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]]. The service ended in February 1933.&lt;ref&gt;CBS considers it to be an ancestor of [[WCBS-TV]], which first went on the air on July 1, 1941 as one of the first two commercially licensed television stations in the country (the other being the National Broadcasting Company's WNBC).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Lee (broadcaster)|Don Lee Broadcasting]]'s station W6XAO in Los Angeles went on the air in December 1931. Using the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] spectrum, it broadcast a regular schedule of filmed images every day except Sundays and holidays for several years.&lt;ref&gt;W6XAO later moved to VHF Channel 1 before World War II, and to Channel 2 in the post-war television realignment. It was commercially licensed in 1947 as KTSL and is the direct ancestor of current station [[KCBS-TV]].&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1935, low-definition electromechanical television broadcasting had ceased in the United States except for a handful of stations run by public universities that continued to 1939. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) saw television in the continual flux of development with no consistent technical standards, hence all such stations in the U.S. were granted only experimental and [[non-commercial]] licenses, hampering television's economic development. Just as importantly, Philo Farnsworth's August 1934 demonstration of an all-electronic system at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia pointed out the direction of television's future.

On June 15, 1936, Don Lee Broadcasting began a one-month-long demonstration of high definition (240+ line) television in Los Angeles on W6XAO (later KTSL, now [[KCBS-TV]]) with a 300-line image from motion picture film. By October, W6XAO was making daily television broadcasts of films. By 1934 [[RCA]] increased the definition to 343 interlaced lines and the frame rate to 30 per second.&lt;ref name="Magoun_65"&gt;Alexander B. Magoun, ''Television: The Life Story of a Technology''. Greenwood, p. 65. {{ISBN|978-0313331282}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7, 1936 RCA and its subsidiary [[NBC]] demonstrated in New York City a 343-line electronic television broadcast with live and film segments to its licensees, and made its first public demonstration to the press on November 6. Irregularly scheduled broadcasts continued through 1937 and 1938.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.earlytelevision.org/where_is_television.html Where Is Television Now?]", ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1938, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Regularly scheduled electronic broadcasts began in April 1938 in New York (to the second week of June, and resuming in August) and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;"Telecasts Here and Abroad", ''The New York Times'', Drama-Screen-Radio section, April 24, 1938, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849042,00.html "Early Birds"], ''Time'', June 13, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Telecasts to Be Resumed", ''The New York Times'', Drama-Screen-Radio section, Aug. 21, 1938, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Pickering, [http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist5/donlee.html "Eight Years of Television in California"], ''California ‚Äî Magazine of the Pacific'', June 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; NBC officially began regularly scheduled television broadcasts in New York on April 30, 1939, with a broadcast of the opening of the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].

In 1937 RCA raised the frame definition to 441 lines, and its executives petitioned the FCC for approval of the standard.&lt;ref name="Magoun_65"/&gt; By June 1939, regularly scheduled 441-line electronic television broadcasts were available in New York City and Los Angeles, and by November on General Electric's station in Schenectady. From May through December 1939, the New York City NBC station (W2XBS) of RCA broadcast twenty to fifty-eight hours of programming per month, Wednesday through Sunday of each week. The programming was 33% news, 29% drama, and 17% educational programming, with an estimated 2,000 receiving sets by the end of the year, and an estimated audience of five to eight thousand. A remote truck could cover outdoor events from up to {{convert|10|mi|km}} away from the transmitter, which was located atop the [[Empire State Building]]. Coaxial cable was used to cover events at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The coverage area for reliable reception was a radius of 40 to {{convert|50|mi|km}} from the Empire State Building, an area populated by more than 10,000,000 people (Lohr, 1940).

The FCC adopted [[NTSC]] television engineering standards on May 2, 1941, calling for 525 lines of vertical resolution, 30 frames per second with [[interlaced video|interlaced scanning]], 60 fields per second, and sound carried by [[frequency modulation]]. Sets sold since 1939 that were built for slightly lower resolution could still be adjusted to receive the new standard. (Dunlap, p31). The FCC saw television ready for commercial licensing, and the first such licenses were issued to NBC- and CBS-owned stations in New York on July 1, 1941, followed by [[Philco]]'s station [[KYW-TV|WPTZ]] in [[Philadelphia]].

The first official, paid advertising to appear on American commercial television occurred on the afternoon of July 1, 1941, over New York 
station WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase "Bulova Watch Time", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.&lt;ref&gt;"Imagery For Profit" R. W. Stewart, The New York Times, July 6, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/images/rca_bulova_ad-1.jpg] WNBT/Bulova test pattern&lt;/ref&gt;

After the U.S. entry into World War II, the FCC reduced the required minimum air time for commercial television stations from 15 hours per week to 4 hours. Most TV stations suspended broadcasting; of the ten original television stations only six continued through the war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;p.78 ''Perspectives on Radio and Television: Telecommunication in the United States'' Routledge, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; On the few that remained, programs included entertainment such as boxing and plays, events at Madison Square Garden, and illustrated war news as well as training for air raid wardens and first aid providers. In 1942, there were 5,000 sets in operation, but production of new TVs, radios, and other broadcasting equipment for civilian purposes was suspended from April 1942 to August 1945 (Dunlap).

By 1947, when there were 40 million radios in the U.S., there were about 44,000 television sets (with probably 30,000 in the New York area).&lt;ref name=Shagawat&gt;{{cite web|last=Shagawat|first=Robert|title=Television recording ‚Äì The origins and earliest surviving live TV broadcast recordings|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/tv_recordings_the_origins.html|work=Early Electronic Television|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular [[Television network|network television]] broadcasts began on [[NBC]] on a three-station network linking New York with the Capital District and Philadelphia in 1944; on the [[DuMont Television Network]] in 1946, and on [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1948.

Following the rapid rise of television after the war, the Federal Communications Commission was flooded with applications for television station licenses. With more applications than available television channels, the FCC ordered a freeze on processing station applications in 1948 that remained in effect until April 14, 1952.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

By 1949, the networks stretched from New York to the [[Mississippi River]], and by 1951 to the West Coast. Commercial [[color television]] broadcasts began on CBS in 1951 with a [[field-sequential color system]] that was suspended four months later for technical and economic reasons. The television industry's [[NTSC|National Television System Committee]] (NTSC) developed a color television system based on RCA technology that was compatible with existing black and white receivers, and commercial color broadcasts reappeared in 1953.

Cable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.

The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large "community antennas" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924.

Early cable television was analog, but since the 2000s all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.

===Overview===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Satellite television system Ekran - a post stamp.jpg|thumb|right|The Ekran satellite television broadcast system (post stamp, 1981)]] --&gt;
'''Satellite television''' is a system of supplying [[television programming]] using [[broadcast]] signals relayed from [[communication satellite]]s. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired [[television programme]] for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without [[terrestrial television]] or [[cable television]].

The most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as "direct to home" (DTH).&lt;ref name="tr101198"&gt;{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1‚Äì7|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] wavelength and are completely digital.&lt;ref name=m101&gt;{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|journal=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]]. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] spectrum from [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]] type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.&lt;ref name=fcc&gt;{{cite web|title=Installing Consumer-Owned Antennas and Satellite Dishes|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/consumerdish.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|Digital signals]] may include [[high-definition television]] (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are [[free-to-air]] or [[free-to-view]], while many other channels are [[pay television]] requiring a subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|last2=Cotter|first2=Susan|year=1998|title=Copyright Infringement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRJCwqzE3iwC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=satellite+tv+free+to+air+free+to+view+must+pay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4lkbVObmJsvLggTq8IEY&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20tv%20free%20to%20air%20free%20to%20view%20must%20pay&amp;f=false|location=|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-247-3002-3|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the satellite TV industry===
In the United States, the satellite television industry developed from the [[cable television]] industry as communication satellites were being used to distribute television programming to remote [[cable television headend]]s. [[HBO|Home Box Office]] (HBO), [[Turner Broadcasting System]] (TBS), and [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN, later [[The Family Channel (US TV network)|The Family Channel]]) were among the first to use satellite television to deliver programming.

===TVRO/C-band satellite era===
{{further|Television receive-only}}
By 1980, satellite television was well established in the [[Satellite television in the United States|USA]] and Europe. On April 26, 1982, the first satellite channel in the UK, Satellite Television Ltd. (later [[Sky1]]), was launched.&lt;ref name=bbcable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2eedi1l&amp;s=6 |title=Broadband Cable 10th Anniversary |publisher=TinyPic |date= |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its signals were transmitted from the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Orbital Test Satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=bbcable/&gt; Between 1981 and 1985, TVRO systems' sales rates increased as prices fell. Advances in receiver technology and the use of Gallium Arsenide [[FET]] technology enabled the use of smaller dishes. 500,000 systems, some costing as little as $2000, were sold in the US in 1984.&lt;ref name=Stecklow/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbca"/&gt; Dishes pointing to one satellite were even cheaper.&lt;ref name="wichita"&gt;{{cite news|title=Research Needed in Buying Dish: High Cost Is Important Consideration for Consumer|last=Stecklow|first=Steve|work=[[Wichita Eagle]]|agency=Knight-Ridder News Service|date=1984-10-25|page=6C}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in areas without local broadcast stations or cable television service could obtain good-quality reception with no monthly fees.&lt;ref name=Stecklow&gt;{{cite news|title=America's Favorite Dish|last=Stecklow|first=Steve|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|agency=[[Knight-Ridder News Service]]|date=1984-07-07|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Akron/&gt; The large dishes were a subject of much consternation, as many people considered them [[eyesore]]s, and in the US most condominiums, neighborhoods, and other homeowner associations tightly restricted their use, except in areas where such restrictions were illegal.&lt;ref name="fcc"/&gt; These restrictions were altered in 1986 when the Federal Communications Commission ruled all of them illegal.&lt;ref name="baltsun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Andree|date=10 October 1993|title=Old satellite dish restrictions under fire New laws urged for smaller models|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-10/business/1993283244_1_community-association-satellite-dish-associations-institute|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|location=[[Baltimore, MD]]|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A municipality could require a property owner to relocate the dish if it violated other zoning restrictions, such as a setback requirement, but could not outlaw their use.&lt;ref name="baltsun"/&gt; The necessity of these restrictions would slowly decline as the dishes got smaller.&lt;ref name="baltsun"/&gt;

Originally, all channels were broadcast [[in the clear]] (ITC) because the equipment necessary to receive the programming was too expensive for consumers. With the growing number of TVRO systems, the program providers and broadcasters had to [[television encryption|scramble]] their signal and develop subscription systems.

In October 1984, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984]], which gave those using TVRO systems the right to receive signals for free unless they were scrambled, and required those who did scramble to make their signals available for a reasonable fee.&lt;ref name=Akron/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-05-22/entertainment/8702080056_1_satellite-dish-satellite-tv-week-dish-owners|title=Satellite TV Skies Brighten As War With Programmers Ends|last=Takiff|first=Jonathan|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|agency=[[Knight-Ridder Newspapers]]|date=1987-05-22|accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since cable channels could prevent reception by big dishes, other companies had an incentive to offer competition.&lt;ref name=Turned&gt;{{cite news|title=Direct-Broadcast TV Is Still Not Turned On|last=Wolf|first=Ron|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1985-01-20|page=C01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1986, [[HBO]] began using the now-obsolete [[VideoCipher]] II system to [[television encryption|encrypt their channels]].&lt;ref name="deseret"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nye|first=Doug|date=14 January 1990|title=SATELLITE DISHES SURVIVE GREAT SCRAMBLE OF 1980S|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/81378/SATELLITE-DISHES-SURVIVE-GREAT-SCRAMBLE-OF-1980S.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other channels uses less secure [[television encryption]] systems.

Videocipher II used analog scrambling on its video signal and [[Data Encryption Standard]] based encryption on its audio signal.

=== Late 1980s and 1990s to present ===
[[File:Dishing out the truth.JPG|thumbnail|right|DBS satellite dishes.]]
By 1987, nine channels were scrambled, but 99 others were available free-to-air.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; While HBO initially charged a monthly fee of $19.95, soon it became possible to unscramble all channels for $200 a year.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; Dish sales went down from 600,000 in 1985 to 350,000 in 1986, but pay television services were seeing dishes as something positive since some people would never have cable service, and the industry was starting to recover as a result.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; Scrambling also led to the development of [[pay-per-view]] events.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; On November 1, 1988, [[NBC]] began scrambling its C-band signal but left its [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] signal unencrypted in order for affiliates to not lose viewers who could not see their advertising.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; Most of the two million satellite dish users in the United States still used C-band.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]] were considering scrambling, though CBS was reluctant due to the number of people unable to receive local [[network affiliate]]s.&lt;ref name=sfc&gt;{{cite news|title=Scrambled NBC Bad News for Satellite Pirates|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|agency=United Press International|date=1988-11-03|page=E3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piracy on satellite television networks in the US led to the introduction of the [[Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992]].

Satellite television had also developed in [[Satellite television by region#Europe|Europe]] but it initially used low power communication satellites and it required dish sizes of over {{convert|1.7|m|abbr=on}}. On December 11, 1988 [[Luxembourg]] launched [[Astra 1A]], the first satellite to provide medium power satellite coverage to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="n2yo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=19688|title=ASTRA 1A Satellite details 1988-109B NORAD 19688|publisher=N2YO|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first medium-powered satellites, transmitting signals in K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band and allowing reception with small dishes (90&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="n2yo"/&gt; The launch of Astra beat the winner of the UK's state Direct Broadcast Satellite licence holder, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], to the market.

In the US in the early 1990s, four large cable companies launched [[PrimeStar]], a direct broadcasting company using medium power satellite. The relatively strong transissions allowed the use of smaller (90&amp;nbsp;cm) dishes. Its popularity declined with the 1994 launch of the [[Hughes Communications|Hughes]] [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] satellite television systems.

On March 4, 1996 EchoStar introduced Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network) using the EchoStar 1 satellite.&lt;ref name="ctu10e"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=August E.|date=|title=Communication Technology Update|edition=10th|url=|location=|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|page=87|isbn=978-0-240-81475-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; EchoStar launched a second satellite in September 1996 to increase the number of channels available on Dish Network to 170.&lt;ref name="ctu10e"/&gt; These systems provided better pictures and stereo sound on 150-200 video and audio channels, and allowed small dishes to be used. This greatly reduced the popularity of TVRO systems. In the mid-1990s, channels began moving their broadcasts to [[digital television]] transmission using the [[DigiCipher]] [[conditional access]] system.&lt;ref name="insead"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell-Jones |first1=Robin |last2=Berbner |first2=Jochen |last3=Chai |first3=Jianfeng |last4=Farstad |first4=Thomas |last5=Pham |first5=Minh |date=June 2001 |title=High Technology Strategy and Entrepreneurship |url=http://faculty.insead.edu/adner/projects/Set%20Top%20Boxes.pdf |journal=INSEAD journal |location=[[Fontainebleau]] |publisher=INSEAD |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724233622/http://faculty.insead.edu/adner/projects/Set%20Top%20Boxes.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to encryption, the widespread availability, in the US, of [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] services such as [[PrimeStar]] and [[DirecTV]] had been reducing the popularity of TVRO systems since the early 1990s.  Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the [[solar panel]]s and [[energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the [[digital modulation]] methods now used require less [[signal strength]] at the receiver than analog modulation methods.&lt;ref name="nctfe"&gt;Mirabito, M.,&amp; Morgenstern, B.

{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}

Internet television (Internet TV), (online television) or IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is the [[digital distribution]] of [[television]] content via the [[Internet]] as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable and satellite, although internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows and other video content over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters.

Internet television should not to be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set that has an inbuilt operating system. [[IPTV|Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

==Television sets==
{{main|Television set}}

A television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and speakers for the purpose of viewing [[television]]. Introduced in the late 1920s in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]]s. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[VHS]] and later [[DVD]]. In the late 2000s [[Flat panel display|flat panel]] television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced [[cathode ray tube]]s. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a [[USB]] device.

[[File:RCA 630-TS Television.jpg|thumb|right|RCA 630-TS, the first mass-produced television set, which sold in 1946‚Äì1947]]
[[Mechanical television]]s were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/Baird%20TV-Early%20Years.htm Early British Television: Baird], Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; United States, and Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/pre-1935.htm Pre-1935], Television History: The First 75 Years. The French model shown does not appear to have entered production.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commercially made televisions sold by Baird called Televisors in the UK in 1928 were radios with the addition of a television device consisting of a [[neon]] tube behind a [[Nipkow disk|mechanically spinning disk]] (patented by German engineer [[Paul Nipkow]] in 1884) with a spiral of apertures first mass-produced television set, selling about a thousand units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/PRE-1935-BAIRD.htm Pre-1935 Baird Sets: UK], that produced a red postage-stamp size image, enlarged to twice that size by a magnifying glass. The Televisor sold in 1930‚Äì1933 is considered the Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially made electronic televisions with [[cathode ray tube]]s were manufactured by [[Telefunken]] in Germany in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/telefunken.html Telefunken], Early Electronic TV Gallery, Early Television Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/1934-35-Telefunken-FEIII.JPG 1934‚Äì35 Telefunken], Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by other makers in France (1936),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/1936%20French%20TV.htm 1936 French Television], Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain (1936),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/1936-Baird-T5.JPG 1936 Baird T5], Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States (1938).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/communicating_systems.html Communicating Systems, Inc.], Early Electronic TV Gallery, Early Television Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/1939%20Du%20Mont%20Brochure.htm America's First Electronic Television Set], Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; The cheapest model with a 12-inch (30&amp;nbsp;cm) screen was $445 ({{Inflation|US|445|1938|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/tv-prices.htm American TV Prices], Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 19,000 electronic televisions were manufactured in Britain, and about 1,600 in Germany, before World War II.

Television usage in the western world skyrocketed after [[World War II]] with the lifting of the manufacturing freeze, war-related technological advances, the drop in television prices caused by mass production, increased leisure time, and additional disposable income. While only 0.5% of U.S. households had a television in 1946, 55.7% had one in 1954, and 90% by 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/Annual_TV_Households_50-78.JPG Number of TV Households in America], Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, there were 15,000 television households in 1947, 1.4 million in 1952, and 15.1 million by 1968.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} By the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[color television]] had come into wide use. In Britain, [[BBC One|BBC1]], [[BBC Two|BBC2]] and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] were regularly broadcasting in color by 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1328760/Britains-oldest-colour-TV-going-strong-42-years-on.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Britain's oldest colour telly 'still going strong' 42 years on, says 69-year-old owner | date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Coast to Coast Television" (CBS advertisement), ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 4, 1951, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first live coast-to-coast commercial television broadcast in the U.S. took place on November 18, 1951 during the premiere of [[CBS]]'s ''[[See It Now]]'', which showed a split-screen view of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in New York City and the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in San Francisco.

In 1958, the [[CBC Television|CBC]] completed the longest television network in the world, from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]] to [[Victoria, British Columbia]].

Reportedly, the first continuous live broadcast of a "breaking" news story in the world was conducted by the CBC during the [[Springhill mining disaster]], which began on October 23 of that year.

The development of [[cable television]] and [[satellite television]] in the 1970s allowed for more channels and encouraged businessmen to target programming toward specific audiences. It also enabled the rise of [[subscription television]] channels, such as [[Home Box Office|Home Box Office (HBO)]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] in the U.S., and [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky Television]] in the U.K.

'''iNews''' (short for ''Indonesia News TV'') is an [[Indonesia]]n [[free-to-air]] television network founded by [[Media Nusantara Citra]]. 

== History ==
iNews (Indonesia News) was launched in 2007 as '''SUN TV''' as a pay television channel. It later 2009, obtained a television license from the government to start broadcasting as a free-to-air channel on terrestrial television in [[Jakarta]], [[Bogor]], [[Depok]], [[Tangerang]] and [[Bekasi]]. The channel was launched as TV3 in those cities and aired commercials.

In 2011, TV3 stopped carrying Sun TV and was acquired by [[CTV Banten]].

On September 26, 2011, SUN TV changed its name to '''SINDO TV''' which was part of the synergy of Sindo Media with Sindo Trijaya FM and SINDOnews.com.

3 years later, precisely on September 23, 2014, the Minister of Communication and Information Republic of Indonesia officially granted a network station permit for SINDO TV and broadcasting once again in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi with the different transmission. Then on December 15, 2014, SINDO TV was officially launched as national television in the "''Luar Biasa!'' (Extraordinary!)" Soft Launching event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nasional.sindonews.com/read/937813/149/sindotv-televisi-nasional-berjaringan-terbesar-1418696565|title=SindoTV, Televisi Nasional Berjaringan Terbesar|work=SINDOnews.com|access-date=2018-11-13|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economy.okezone.com/read/2015/01/13/278/1091536/ht-sindo-tv-telah-bertransformasi-menjadi-saluran-nasional|title=HT: Sindo TV Telah Bertransformasi Menjadi Saluran Nasional : Okezone Economy|last=Okezone|first=|date=|work=Okezone|access-date=2018-11-13|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINDO TV officially changed the name to iNews TV after the iNewsmaker Awards which was held on April 6, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://video.sindonews.com/play/16624/inews-tv-resmi-berkibar-gantikan-sindo-tv|title=iNews TV Resmi Berkibar Gantikan Sindo TV|work=SINDOnews.com|access-date=2018-11-13|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the local televisions under this television network also changed its name to iNews TV (except Kaltim TV in [[East Kalimantan]]).

In October 31 2017, the "TV" word was removed, so it changed the name to '''iNews''', coinciding with the launching of the new name for news programs that aired on [[RCTI]], [[MNCTV]], and [[GTV (Indonesia)|GTV]] at the Indonesia Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.okezone.com/read/2017/11/01/337/1806199/metamorfosa-inews-tayang-di-4-tv-nasional-menjadi-tv-berita-terbesar-di-indonesia|title=Metamorfosa iNews, Tayang di 4 TV Nasional Menjadi TV Berita Terbesar di Indonesia : Okezone News|last=Okezone|first=|date=|work=Okezone|access-date=2018-11-13|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6741">'''Kharbaga''' is a two-player [[abstract strategy game]] from [[Africa]]. In a way, it is a miniature version of [[Zamma]]; however, there are more diagonal lines per square on the board as compared to Zamma. The game is considered part of the Zamma family. The game is also similar to [[Alquerque]] and [[draughts]]. The board is essentially an Alquerque board with twice the number of diagonal lines or segments allowing for greater freedom of movement. The initial setup is also similar to Alquerque, where every space on the board is filled with each player's pieces except for the middle point of the board. Moreover, each player's pieces are also set up on each player's half of the board. The game specifically resembles draughts in that pieces must move in the forward directions until they are crowned "[[Mullah]]" (or "Sultan") which is the equivalent of the King in draughts. The Mullah can move in any direction.

It is unknown how old the game is; however, the idea that pieces must move forward until they are crowned Mullah is a feature thought to have been developed and borrowed from draughts which came into being only in the 17th century. This is, however, open to debate.

Two similar games are played by the Hopi native American Indians of Arizona, US, which may suggest a historical connection with Kharbaga, and Alquerque in general. One of the Hopi games is called [[tukvnanawopi]]. The board pattern, the number of pieces, and the initial setup are the same as in Kharbaga's. The only differences, and they are significant, is that in tukvnanawopi pieces can move in any direction at any time during the game (there is no need for promotion to Mullah or King as in Kharbaga), and also when a row of squares on one end of the board becomes empty during the game, pieces can no longer be played in that row of squares. As the game progresses, more rows of squares become empty and unplayable, and the playing board continues to shrink. The other Hopi game which is also played throughout Mexico is called [[tuknanavuhpi]]. In this case, when a row of points on one end of the board becomes empty, it is no longer playable, and again the playing board shrinks as the game progresses.

Lastly, another native American Indian tribe called the Keres of New Mexico, US plays a game most similar to Kharbaga. The only difference is that pieces can move in any direction at any time during the game and each player has 22 pieces. It is uncertain how the game can be played this way since both players would yield 44 pieces total and there are only 41 intersection points that make up the board. The game is called [[Aiyawatstani]] or "'''chuck away grains'''".

== Goal ==

The player who captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner.

== Equipment ==

The board is a 5 x 5 square grid, or a 4 x 4 square board with pieces played on the intersections with left and right diagonal lines running through each square of the board. Each player has 20 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other player plays the white pieces.

== Gameplay and rules ==
#Player decide which colors to play, and who starts first.
#The board is filled in the beginning with all the players pieces. The only point vacant on the board is the middle point. Each player's pieces are placed on their half of the board, and lined up on the right-hand side of the 5th. rank (the middle horizontal line of the grid board).
#Players alternate their turns. A non-Mullah piece moves forward only (straight forward or diagonally forward) one space per turn following the pattern on the board until they are crowned Mullah by reaching the last rank. Only one piece may be moved or used to capture enemy piece(s) per turn.
#A non-Mullah piece may capture an enemy piece by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerqe. The capture can be in any direction. Multiple captures are allowed, however, the line with the most captures must be taken. Captures are compulsory for non-Mullah and Mullah pieces.
#When a piece reaches the other player's rank, it is promoted to Mullah. The Mullah can move and capture in any direction. It can also move any number of spaces as in the King in [[international draughts]]. The Mullah can also capture an enemy piece from any distance, and land anywhere behind the captured piece provided there are no other pieces (friendly or not) within the spaces of the leap. If playing a variant where enemy pieces are not removed immediately when captured, the Mullah ''can not'' go back to any of them and leap them again. However, in a variant where captured pieces are removed immediately, the Mullah ''can'' leap over them again in order to leap another enemy piece(s).
#If a non-Mullah piece reaches the other player's rank as an intermediate step of a capturing sequence, the piece does not get promoted to Mullah.

'''''Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan''''' ([[1933 in film|1933]]), (English: '''''Land Without Bread''''' or '''''Unpromised Land''''') is a 27-minute-long [[documentary film]] ([[ethnofiction]]) directed by [[Luis Bu√±uel]] and co-produced by Bu√±uel and [[Ram√≥n Acin]]. The narration was written by Bu√±uel, [[Rafael Sanchez Ventura]], and [[Pierre Unik]], with cinematography by [[Eli Lotar]].   

==Cast==
*Abel Jacquin  (voice)
*[[Alexandre O'Neill]]  (voice, dubbed version)

==Production==
{{rewrite section|date=November 2018}}
The film focuses on the [[Las Hurdes]] region of Spain, the mountainous area around the town of La Alberca, and the intense poverty of its occupants, who were so backwards and isolated that bread was unknown. A main source of income for them was taking in orphan children, for whom they received a government subsidy. Bu√±uel, who made the film after reading the [[ethnography|ethnographic study]] ''Las Jurdes: √©tude de g√©ographie humaine'' (1927) by [[Maurice Legendre]], took a [[Surrealist]] approach to the notion of the [[anthropology|anthropological]] expedition. The result was a [[travel documentary|travelogue]] in which the narrator‚Äôs extreme (indeed, exaggerated) descriptions of human misery of Las Hurdes contrasts with his flat and uninterested manner.

Bu√±uel claimed:
"I was able to film Las Hurdes thanks to Ramon Acin, an [[anarchist]] from [[Huesca]],...who one day at a cafe in [[Zaragoza]] told me, 'Luis, if I ever won the lottery, I would put up the money for you to make a film.' He won a hundred thousand [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]]...and gave me twenty thousand to make the film. With four thousand I bought a [[Fiat]]; Pierre Unik came, under contract from ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' to write an article; and Eli Lotar arrived with a camera loaned by [[Marc All√©gret]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jose De La Colina, Tomas Perez Turrent.''Objects of Desire - Conversations with Luis Bu√±uel''.Trans. Paul Lenti.Marsilio Publishers, 1992. {{ISBN|0-941419-68-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The movie is a documentary, parodying the exaggerated documentaries of travelers across the Sahara being filmed at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Ruoff, Jeffrey. [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jruoff/Articles/EthnographicSurrealist.htm An Ethnographic Surrealist Film: Luis Bu√±uel's Land Without Bread.] Visual Anthropology Review 14, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 1998), 45-57&lt;/ref&gt; One of Bu√±uel's points is that there are plenty of terrible subjects for a documentary right in Spain.
      
The film was originally [[silent film|silent]], though Bu√±uel himself narrated when it was first shown. A French narration by actor [[Abel Jacquin]] was added in Paris in 1935. Bu√±uel used extracts of [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4]] for the music. 

Bu√±uel slaughtered at least two animals to make ''Las Hurdes''. One Hurdano claimed that he arranged for an ailing donkey to be covered with honey so he could film it being stung to death by [[bees]]. Similarly, his crew shot a [[mountain goat]] that subsequently fell from a cliff for another sequence.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | last = McNab | first = Geoffrey | title = Bunuel and the land that never was | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | date = 8 September 2000 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/sep/09/books.guardianreview | accessdate = 30 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film provoked such an uproar in Spain - Ruoff calls it a "revolutionary film"&lt;ref&gt;Ruoff, Jeffrey. [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jruoff/Articles/EthnographicSurrealist.htm An Ethnographic Surrealist Film: Luis Bu√±uel's Land Without Bread.] Visual Anthropology Review 14, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 1998), 45-57&lt;/ref&gt; - that it was banned&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; from 1933 to 1936.

"'''Louie, Go Home'''" is a song written by [[Paul Revere and the Raiders|Paul Revere]] and [[Mark Lindsay]] as a sequel to "[[Louie Louie]]" by [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]].  It was recorded by [[Paul Revere and the Raiders]] in 1963 and released in March 1964.

Two versions of "Louie, Go Home" were issued. The original (with sax opening) was only released as a single.&lt;ref&gt;Released on CD in 1990 (2 CD compilation "The Legend Of Paul Revere", Columbia C2K 45311).&lt;/ref&gt; A re-recorded version (with guitar opening) was featured on the ''[[Midnight Ride (album)|Midnight Ride]]'' album in 1966 as well as the group's first ''Greatest Hits'' compilation the following year.

In 1964 the young [[David Bowie]], then still called David Jones, recorded the song with his band Davie Jones and the King Bees. He titled it "'''Louie, Louie Go Home'''" and released it as the B-side of Bowie's first ever single "[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]". 

Bowie's version of the song also appeared on the compilations ''Another Face'' (1981) and ''[[Early On (1964-1966)]]'' (1991). Bowie borrowed the call-and-response refrain of 'Just a little bit louder now' for the track "[[Reality (David Bowie album)|She'll Drive the Big Car]]" in 2003.

===Other versions===
[[The Who]] also recorded the song as "Lubie (Come Back Home)" in 1965. It was first released on the 1985 compilation ''[[Who's Missing (album)|Who's Missing]]''.

A French version was released in 1964 as "Louie Reviens Chez Toi" by the Belgian group Ariane et Les 10/20.&lt;ref name="Discogs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com |title=Discogs.com|accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Spanish version was released in 1967 as "Lupe Vuelve A Casa" by the Peruvian group Los Shain's.&lt;ref name="Discogs"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cover versions include the [[A-Bones]] (1993), Chambermen (1966), [[The Chesterfield Kings|Chesterfield Kings]] with [[Mark Lindsay]] (1998), [[Jack Ely]] and the Courtmen (1966), [[The Fireballs|Fireballs]] (1966), Fugitives (1966), Hypstrz (1981), Images (Italy, 1970), Missing Lynx (1967), Mussies (1966), Shades of Grey (1966), Time Beings (1996), Transatlantics (UK, 1966), Vandells (1967), and Danny Zella and the Zell Rocks (1996). A 1966 single released with the same title by the Campus Kingsmen is a different song.&lt;ref name="Discogs"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Answer song versions include "Louie Come Home" by the Epics in 1965 and "Louie Louie's Comin' Back" by the Pantels in 1966.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3289">'''Magic Landing''' was a [[amusement park|theme park]] located in [[El Paso, Texas]], operating from 1984 to 1988. Magic Landing was one of two amusement parks operating in El Paso during the 1980s, the other being [[Western Playland]].

Magic Landing opened to the public on July 4, 1984.  It included the Old Galveston Railway, a {{RailGauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamlocomotive.com/lists/searchdb.php?str=Magic+Landing&amp;country=USA Surviving Steam Locomotive Search]&lt;/ref&gt; railroad within the park, among other attractions.

During Magic Landing's brief run, rumors of various incidents were circulated, but one confirmed incident caused the park's attendance numbers to fall over the next three years, and may have led to its closure. In the summer of 1985, Frank Guzman Jr, an 18-year-old male employee, was killed at the park.&lt;ref&gt;Las Cruces Sun-News, June 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was asked by a patron to retrieve his baseball hat for him from off the roller coaster track. The teenager climbed up the track and rested his arm on the active part of the track. Within a few minutes, the roller coaster went down the track and cut his arm off. After an hour on the track, the young man was rushed to William Beaumont Army Medical Center and died three hours later.

In 1988, Magic Landing closed to the public mid-season due to low attendance and problems obtaining the $1,000,000 insurance policy required by the state. (The high insurance rate stemmed from the above-mentioned roller coaster death.) Since its closing, Magic Landing's buildings stood out in the El Paso desert, many of them falling apart, for over 20 years. (The rides, though, only remained until the early to mid-1990s.) In 2009, by the county's request, the remaining buildings and rubble on the property were demolished due to multiple incidents of vandalism and arson over the previous few years. CFI Trucking now uses the land as a lot for their trailers. The frame for the sign and base for ticket booths are among the only remnants of the park. Western Playland, El Paso's only other amusement park, has since been relocated to [[Sunland Park, New Mexico]]. In 2013 the park mysteriously burned down.

==Gameplay==
It is an infinitely running game. The player controls a pixel who is falling down and has to avoid dangerous black pixels represented by various shapes. As he avoids these pixels, his own pixel is getting bigger by collecting white pixels. Furthermore, by brushing the shapes (falling next to them), ideally in a quick succession, player scores and the mega pixel bar is getting filled up. When its filled completely, pixel becomes the Mega Pixel and demoslishes everything in his way. Player can score by smashing shapes too, but that also reduces his size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/mega-dead-pixel-review/ |title=Mega Dead Pixel Review ¬ª 148Apps ¬ª iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch App Reviews and News |publisher=148Apps |date=2013-10-21 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also coins that player has to catch. He can buy for them some power-ups like pistols. Power-ups can also be bought for real money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/2068444/mega-dead-pixel-review-free-falling-game-a-smashing-good-time.html |title=Mega Dead Pixel review: Free-falling game a smashing good time |publisher=Macworld |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The game received positive and mixed reviews. It was praised for its concept, graphics and its soundtrack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12041">The '''National Dance Alliance''' ('''NDA'''), originally named the '''NCA Superstar''', was established in 1999 as a ‚Äúfull service provider in the dance spirit industry‚Äù. The NDA is the sister company of the National Cheer Association (NCA), which was founded by Lawrence Herkimer in 1948.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nda.varsity.com/AboutUs.aspx|title = About Us|date = |accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = National Dance Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006034425/http://nda.varsity.com/AboutUs.aspx|archivedate = October 6, 2014|df = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the NCA created the NCA Superstar to make a distinction between the dance and cheerleading aspects of the company. Eventually in 1999, the NCA Superstar changed its name to the National Dance Alliance.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-cheerleaders-association-and-national-dance-alliance-championships-to-be-televised-on-cbs-sports-network-140036673.html|title = National Cheerleaders Association and National Dance Alliance Championships to be Televised on CBS Sports Network|date = 2012-02-22|accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = PR Newswire|publisher = Regional Business News|last = |first = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Dance Alliance (NDA) is the sister company of the [[National Cheerleaders Association|National Cheer Association]] (NCA) founded by [[Lawrence Herkimer]] in 1948. The NDA is an organization that provides high quality training and teaching to middle school, high school, and college dance teams around the country. NDA hosts many camps, clinics, competitions, and various performance events throughout the year for dancers to attend.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Each year, the NCA/NDA hosts over 75,000 cheerleaders and dancers at their summer camps and over 1,500 teams from 45 states at their National Championships.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The National Dance Alliance's core goals are to inspire young dancers and to teach them about the importance of teamwork. The NDA emphasizes that the primary purpose of a dance team is to raise spirit for the school‚Äôs athletic teams as well as the overall community. The NDA instills strong leadership skills in all of its dancers and teaches dance teams how to be role models at the schools they attend.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

==History==
Lawrence Herkimer, a famous innovator in the world of cheerleading, founded the NCA in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/sports/ncaabasketball/15cheer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title = Pyramid Builder|date = 2009-03-14|accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = The New York Times|publisher = The New York Times|last = Branch|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The NCA was the first cheerleading company to hold camps and clinics that invited cheerleaders and dancers from around the country to learn new tricks and improve their technique under the supervision of trained and qualified instructors.  The NCA had always incorporated dance into its programs, by allowing dance, [[pom-pom]], or drill teams to learn alongside the cheerleaders.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;  In 1976, the company made a distinction between cheerleading and dance by creating the NCA Superstar as the dance section of the company.  The NCA Superstar eventually changed its name to the National Dance Alliance in 1999.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;  The National Dance Alliance brand was established and is now a ‚Äúfull service provider in the dance spirit industry‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;
	
The NCA and NDA are both a part of the [[Varsity Spirit|Varsity Spirit Corporation]], an organization that hosts competitions, offers camps and clinics to train dancers and cheerleaders, and sells cheer and dance apparel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/_stories/2002-04-26-cover-side-business.htm#more|title = USATODAY.com - From Megaphones to Mega-profits.|date = 2002-04-26|accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = USA Today|publisher = |last = Brady|first = Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camps==
The National Dance Association extends invitations to high school and college dance teams from all over the country to attend its summer or fall camps.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nda.varsity.com/allaboutcamp.aspx|title = Everything You Need To Know About Camp|date = |accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = National Dance Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006034435/http://nda.varsity.com/allaboutcamp.aspx|archivedate = October 6, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many of these camps are held at university campuses, hotels, and convention centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nda.varsity.com/college_camps.aspx|title = College Camps|date = |accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = National Dance Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006020040/http://nda.varsity.com/college_camps.aspx|archivedate = October 6, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Teams that attend NDA‚Äôs camps get evaluated and receive personalized feedback from members of the NDA staff.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These camps are intended to prepare teams for their upcoming season.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;  NDA offers three different types of camps that dance teams can choose from including overnight camps, day camps, and home camps.

The overnight camp is either a three- or four-day session that is available to teams at all different technical levels.  All NDA overnight camps offer classes that benefit all levels of training, including beginner, intermediate, advanced, and elite.  The overnight camp gives participants the opportunity to audition to become an All-American Dancer.  Participants selected to be All-American Dancers are given the opportunity to attend many special event performances hosted by the NCA and NDA all over the country.

The NDA day camps are two-, three-, or four-day sessions for teams that are not able to attend any of the overnight camps and instead would like to attend a camp where they do not spend the night.  The day camps consist of the same curriculum as the NDA overnight camps; however, classes are held from 9am-5pm after which, participants are required to go home.  Classes are offered in all styles of dance for all levels.  Dancers are also eligible to audition to become an All-American Dancer at the NDA day camps.

The home camps are available to teams that would prefer to work privately with a trained NDA instructor in the privacy of their own school.  This option allows teams to have a personalized teaching atmosphere that focuses on the specific needs of the team.  Home camps give coaches the opportunity to create their own camp schedule that best fits their team.  Coaches can choose from a wide variety of technique classes, choreography classes in many different styles, and team-building exercises for their team to participate in.  Dancers can also be selected to audition to be an All-American Team Member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nda.varsity.com/camptypes.aspx|title = Camp Types|date = |accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = National Dance Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006034648/http://nda.varsity.com/camptypes.aspx|archivedate = October 6, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions==
The National Dance Alliance gives dance teams the opportunity to compete against one another at the NDA Classic Championships or Nationals.  The invitation to compete at these competitions is extended to school and college dance teams, as well as All-Star dance teams.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nda.varsity.com/Championships.aspx|title = Championships|date = |accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = National Dance Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006020025/http://nda.varsity.com/Championships.aspx|archivedate = October 6, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competitions are split up based on whether the dance team is at the collegiate, school, or all-star level.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nda.varsity.com/rules.aspx|title = Rules and Divisions|date = |accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = National Dance Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006020113/http://nda.varsity.com/rules.aspx|archivedate = October 6, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the NCA/NDA administers about 40 local, regional and national competitions nationwide.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

===Nationals===
To compete at the National competitions, the NDA College Rule Book for College Teams states that teams must have qualified at the NDA Summer or Fall Camps, Regional or Classic competition, or by video submission.  At the collegiate level, teams can be offered bids to the National Competition based on the team‚Äôs participation, conduct, and achievements at camp.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Classical/Regional Championships ===
The NDA offers high school and middle school dance teams the opportunity to compete in their classical or regional championships. These competitions allow for teams to compete against other dance teams in their region. Compared to the national championships, the classical and regional competitions are less expensive and allow you to stay close to home.  Competing in either of these types of competition can also qualify teams to compete in the NDA National Championship.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Special events==

===Christmas extravaganza===
The NDA gives dancers the chance to perform in the [[Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade|Walt Disney World Christmas Parade]].  This event is televised and aired on Christmas Day on ABC network.  The trip is a four-day and three-night event that is held at [[Disney's Coronado Springs Resort|Disney‚Äôs Colorado Springs Resort]] in Florida. Dancers who participate in this event also get the privilege of visiting many of Disney World‚Äôs theme parks.  Dancers eligible to attend this trip must attend a NCA or NDA camp or be an All-American Team Member or an All-American Nominee of a Varsity, Junior Varsity, Freshman or Junior High team.  Also, all teams who won trophies or plaques in competitions, whether they are individuals or an entire team, may attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nda.varsity.com/christmas.aspx|title = NCA &amp; NDA Christmas Extravaganza|date = |accessdate = October 4, 2014|website = National Dance Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006034653/http://nda.varsity.com/christmas.aspx|archivedate = October 6, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nick Video''' (known as '''TurboNick''' in international markets) is an online [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]-branded [[broadband]] channel that launched in 2005 as TurboNick. It features up to 15 hours of new programming every week and includes advertising.

==History==

===As TurboNick===
In its soft launch phase that commenced July 1, 2005, TurboNick garnered more than 1.25 million streams and officially launched with a full advertising and promotional campaign on July 17.

Later on, Nickelodeon restricted the service to viewers only inside the United States and its territories. Shortly after Nickelodeon implemented these restrictions, ''TurboNick UK'' was launched, but unlike the original, the UK edition only features short clips of programs and is only available in the UK. An Australian version of TurboNick was launched in Early 2006 and still runs to this day (after re-brand) and a German version was launched in April 2007. A Latin American version of TurboNick exists under the name ''Nick Turbo''.

On April 1, 2009, Nickelodeon renamed TurboNick to Nick Video, though some older videos have the TurboNick logo showing at some point in the video, like the "Extra Scoop" videos.

'''''Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed''''' is a 1989 [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Arthur Penn]] starring the [[magic (illusion)|magicians]] [[Penn &amp; Teller]]. The duo play themselves in a satirical account of what the audience would perhaps imagine the pair doing in their daily lives. Most of the action involves [[Penn Jillette|Penn]] and [[Teller (magician)|Teller]] playing practical jokes on each other along with Penn's girlfriend, Carlotta ([[Caitlin Clarke]]). The final joke, as the title of the film implies, has serious consequences for all three. It was the last theatrical film to be directed by Arthur Penn, and received mostly negative reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="nat"&gt;Nat Segaloff, ''Final Cuts: The Last Films of 50 Great Directors'', Bear Manor Media 2013 p 219-221&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Penn &amp; Teller appear on a television show where Penn jokingly comments that he wishes someone were trying to kill him. Soon after, the magicians are off to a scheduled show in [[Atlantic City]]. At the airport, a religious zealot confronts Penn about his comments from the television show the night before. Teller and Carlotta play a prank on Penn while going through security and Penn gets back at Teller by planting a toy gun on him while at the airport.

After exposing fraudulent psychic surgery to Carlotta's wealthy Uncle Ernesto, Penn and Teller are kidnapped by angry Filipinos wishing revenge for damaging their reputation. Immediately before being brutally tortured, the situation is revealed to Penn as a birthday prank played by Teller, Carlotta and Uncle Ernesto.

Soon after, while leaving the theatre from their nightly performance, someone opens fire on Penn, shooting him in the arm. Teller is accused of hiring an assassin as a joke, but as time goes on it becomes clear that Teller is not part of the joke. Teller purchases a gun for self-defense and ''femme fatale'' Officer MacNamara vows to keep Penn safe from snipers.

Officer MacNamara announces that a nameless villain, a supposed vehement Penn &amp; Teller fan who dresses and acts like Penn, has been arrested. Penn and Teller get to tour his bizarre apartment turned Penn &amp; Teller shrine. Teller innocuously disposes of his gun in a trashcan of the apartment. Shortly after MacNamara departs, Penn is stabbed in the stomach by an assailant on the street. Penn rushes off to hospital where, once Teller is out of sight, he appears perfectly fine. Teller proceeds to pursue the would-be assassin in a peculiar chase scene back to the apartment.

The madman, dressed as Penn, forces Teller to enact a Penn &amp; Teller routine with him, hanging in [[gravity boots]] in front of a camera. He then uses duct tape to secure the hapless Teller to the gravity boot rig.  Officer MacNamara returns and the assassin leaves to finish off Penn. MacNamara confesses to Teller her contempt of Penn &amp; Teller.  The confused Teller is able to grab the gun from the wastebasket and threatens MacNamara with it.  He hears a voice behind him and as the individual grabs him, he shoots the individual only to realize it's Penn, who appears to fall over dead.

MacNamara laughs, thinking that it's a new joke. She then reveals herself as Carlotta. The implications of what has just happened suddenly catch up with them: The whole event had been a joke on Teller who turned everything around on the players. Teller, breaking silence for the first time, immediately thinks they switched the gun for a replica, but then realizes the gun he was holding is real and he just killed his partner. Teller turns the gun on himself.

Carlotta, stricken with grief, throws herself out the window. Upon returning to his apartment and finding everyone dead, the "hired assassin", realizing he'll certainly be implicated in the deaths, shoots himself. Others who come into the apartment and find the carnage shoot themselves. Gunshots are heard in the distance, while the [[Bee Gees]] song "[[I Started a Joke]]" plays in the background. In a voice over, Penn explains this is the definitive end of it all.

'''Philippine Wrestling Revolution''' ('''PWR''') is an [[independent circuit|independent]] [[professional wrestling]] promotion based in the [[Philippines]].  PWR was founded in December 2013.

==History==
Professional wrestling in the Philippines started in 1989 through the short-lived show called ''"Pinoy Wrestling"''. It aired on national television via [[People's Television Network|PTV-4]], with character actor Johnny Revilla as host and ringside reporter comedian Jimmy Fabregas.

Its roster consisted of locally trained wrestlers such as Joe Pogi, King Cobra, Macho Franco, Caloy Bakal, and Max Buwaya. There were also [[Tag team match|tag teams]] such as The Smoky Mountain Brothers, The Bakal Boys, and Dr. Q‚Äôs henchmen The Brusko Brothers, Kamikaze Kid and Roboto. Women wrestlers like Aerobica and Pinay Wonder and midgets such as The Mikrobyos and The Tureritos were also featured. Other wrestlers include Juan Duwag, Waway The Wild Man, Turko Turero, Pinoy Ranger, Sultan Bato, Iggy Igorot, Lawin and Zorro. The show was discontinued in the early part of 1990.&lt;ref name="rappler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/philippines/52526-pwr-reviving-pro-wrestling-philippines|title=PWR: Reviving pro wrestling in the Philippines|work=Rappler|author=Nissi Icasiano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the idea of forming PWR was born in a [[Facebook]] group. Wrestling fans from different parts of the country linked up and were added to the group to establish a wrestling company, discuss fantasy bookings, and conceptualize characters and gimmicks. This came about despite pro wrestling not being as popular in the Philippines since the end of the [[Attitude Era|WWE Attitude Era]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as the exposure of [[kayfabe]]. The upstart promotion got an assist from veteran American pro wrestler [[Joe E. Legend]], who helped them in the preparations.

Sometime between late 2013 and early 2014, the group was contacted by a Japanese promoter Ankei Tamashiro doing a show in the Philippines for [[Wrestling New Classic|WNC-Reina]], where two of the main attractions were former [[WWE]] and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] superstar [[Yoshihiro Tajiri|Tajiri]] and half-Filipina triple crown champion [[Shuri Kondo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/unblogged/articles/2014/01/28/1283972/ex-wwe-star-tajiri-wows-crowd-manil-wrestling-event|title=Ex-WWE star Tajiri wows crowd in Manila wrestling event|work=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese promoter's representative in Manila found PWR's Facebook page and asked the group to assist them in setting up and promoting the show in the country. These events further encouraged the group to pursue the idea of setting up the first-ever wrestling promotion in the country.&lt;ref name="rappler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnsontranscript.com/2014/08/26/30-in-30-reborn-philippine-wrestling-revolutions-channel/|title=30 in 30 Reborn: Philippine Wrestling Revolution‚Äôs Channel - The Johnson Transcript|work=The Johnson Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pioneer batch of aspiring professional wrestlers were officially trained by an American pro wrestler who goes by the name of Josh Bauserman, whom they met in Manila during the early stages of planning. The founders credit Bauserman for teaching them everything about pro wrestling, from in-ring maneuvers to backstage activities.

PWR has recently expanded its reach within the international community as international wrestlers such as [[Billy Suede]] and Koto Hiro have joined their roster. In 2017, WWE officials were also in attendance during PWR Live: Bagong Yugto.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/160545-pwr-live-bagong-yugto-wrestling-review-seizing-moment-wwe&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The promotion held its inaugural event called '''''Renaissance''''' on September 27, 2014, at the Makati Cinema Square Arena, [[Makati City]].&lt;ref name="renaissance-rappler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/71145-pwr-renaissance-revival-pinoy-wrestling|title=PWR Renaissance: Breaking down the revival of Pinoy wrestling|work=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekypinas.com/2014/09/philippine-wrestling-revolution-presents-renaissance-pro-wrestling-event.html#axzz3IXoOOHuy|title=Philippine Wrestling Revolution Presents "Renaissance" Pro-Wrestling Event (Raffle)|work=geekypinas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheninmanila.com/renaissance-philippine-wrestling-revolution-inaugural-event/|title=Renaissance: Philippine Wrestling Revolution Inaugural Event|work=When In Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PWR then held subsequent events to complete its calendar: '''''Terminus''''', '''''Vendetta''''', and '''''Wrevolution X''''', which is considered to be PWR's [[WrestleMania]] equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astig.ph/renaissance-philippine-wrestling-revolution-live-event/|title=Renaissance: Philippine Wrestling Revolution live event|work=ASTIG.PH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2015, PWR held an event called '''''PWR Live''''', still at the Makati Cinema Square Arena. Multiple events named PWR Live have been staged since.

To date, 2 PWR shows have been aired on television (on tape delay) via TV5: ''Terminus'' (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.tv5network.com/shows/195/pwr/33DB3C87DB/pwr-terminus-main-event-jdl-and-bombay-vs-royal-flush|title=PWR Terminus - Main Event: JDL and Bombay vs. Royal Flush|work=Sports5 Portal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307125310/http://sports.tv5network.com/shows/195/pwr/33DB3C87DB/pwr-terminus-main-event-jdl-and-bombay-vs-royal-flush|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''PWR Live'' (August 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.tv5network.com/shows/195/pwr/9A7C9D75A8/pwr-episode-1-1|title=PWR: Episode 1.1|work=Sports5 Portal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307124035/http://sports.tv5network.com/shows/195/pwr/9A7C9D75A8/pwr-episode-1-1|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its second Renaissance event in September, PWR held a second PWR Live event in November, but in a new venue, at the iAcademy Auditorium in Makati City. Since then, all PWR events have been hosted there.

Celebrity guests who have been attendance in previous events include Quark Henares, [[Stanley Chi]], Red Ollero, [[Darius Sema√±a]], radio DJs Poch and Tino, Mihk Vergara, King Palisoc, Miko Livelo, Brian Wilson of [[Juan Direction]], Ramon Bautista, and Ryan Rems Sarita.

On February 5, 2016, PWR held a house show at the LBD Sports Arena in Candelaria, Quezon, its first outside Metro Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PHWrestlingRevo/photos/a.1518572128404300.1073741828.1517681678493345/1651307705130741/?type=3|title=PWR invades Quezon|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15131">'''Prostitution in South Africa''' is illegal for both buying and selling sex, as well as related activities such as [[brothel]] keeping and [[pimping]].&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexuality, Poverty and Law Programme|url=http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexworklaw/countries|publisher=Institute of Development Studies|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains widespread.&lt;ref name="chartsbin"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legal Status of Prostitution by Country|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/snb|website=Chats Bin|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement is poor.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

In 2013 the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force (SWEAT) estimated that there were between 121,000 and 167,000 [[prostitute]]s in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estimating the size of the sex worker population in South Africa, 2013|url=http://www.sweat.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sex-Workers-Size-Estimation-Study-2013.pdf|publisher=SWEAT|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HIV]],&lt;ref name="sowetanlive"&gt;{{cite web|title=No condoms, more money say prostitutes|url=https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2015-09-11-no-condoms-more-money-say-prostitutes/|website=Sowetanl Lve|accessdate=10 December 2017|date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[child prostitution]] (including [[sex tourism]])&lt;ref name="ecpat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary South Africa|url=http://www.ecpat.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Ex_Summary_AF_S-AFRICA_FINAL.pdf|website=[[ECPAT]]|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[human trafficking]]&lt;ref name="state2"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271281.htm|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are problems in the country.

==Legal and regulatory framework==
The [[Immorality Act, 1927]] prohibited extramarital sex between "Europeans" and "natives".&lt;ref name="immoral27"&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Immorality Act, 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was redefined by the Immorality Amendment Act, 1950 as illicit carnal intercourse between "Europeans" and "non-Europeans",&lt;ref name="immoral50"&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Immorality Amendment Act, 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Immorality Act, 1957]], later renamed the [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]], repealed the 1927 Act (as amended) and introduced new offences for [[brothel]] keeping, [[pimping]] and [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]].&lt;ref name="immoral57"&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Immorality Act, 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interracial sex]] was now criminalised as unlawful carnal intercourse between "white" and "coloured" people.&lt;ref name="immoral57" /&gt;

The [[Criminal Procedure Act, 1977|Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977]] criminalised "committing an immoral or indecent act with such other person" and also [[soliciting]] for the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1977-051.pdf|website=JUTA's Statutes of South Africa|accessdate=9 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523214524/http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1977-051.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipal by-laws also contained provisions about prostitution.

As part of the repeal of many [[petty apartheid]] laws under the government of [[P. W. Botha]],&lt;ref name="back"&gt;{{cite book|title=South Africa: no turning back|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BeirIIXLyYC|first=Shaun|last=Johnson|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-253-35395-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act 1985 repealed the interracial restrictions of the Immorality Acts.&lt;ref name="immoral95"&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Immorality Amendment Act, 1988 renamed the Immorality Act, 1957 to the [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]] and criminalised the act of prostitution. It also made the provisions of the 1957 Act gender neutral.&lt;ref name="immoral88"&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Immorality Amendment Act, 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, an appeal by brothel keepers and prostitutes in the country's [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], submitting that the laws on prostitution were in breach of the [[Constitution of South Africa|constitution]], was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution 'still illegal' in SA|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2314547.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=10 December 2017|date=9 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent legislative change was the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007, section 11 which added Section 20(1)(aA) of the SOA, which states that any person who has unlawful carnal intercourse or commits an act of indecency with any other person for reward, is guilty of an offence, effectively criminalising the client as well as the prostitute.&lt;ref name="soa07"&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 a report by the [[South African Law Reform Commission]], recommended that the current law be retained (proffered option), or that prostitution should be decriminalised but third party involvement remain illegal.&lt;ref name="lrc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Long-awaited report on adult prostitution in South Africa released|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/long-awaited-report-on-adult-prostitution-in-safrica-released|website=ENCA|accessdate=9 December 2017|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decriminalisation===
Decriminalisation has been under active discussion since 2009. Currently the South African Law Reform Commission has four proposals that were submitted for public discussion ranging from criminalisation to decriminalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmg.org.za/files/docs/090507salrc-adultprost.pdf|title= South African Law Reform Commission Project 107, Discussion paper on sexual offences and adult prostitution|publisher=Pmg.org.za|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 Football World Cup]], there were calls to decriminalise and regulate prostitution when an estimated 40,000 prostitutes were expected to travel to South Africa for the tournament.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In March 2012, the [[ANC Women's League]] came out in favor of decriminalisation, and stated that they will campaign for this to become an [[ANC]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC Women's League wants to decriminalise prostitution|url=http://gatewaynews.co.za/2012/03/27/anc-womens-league-wants-to-decriminalise-prostitution/|website=Gateway News|accessdate=10 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504214147/http://gatewaynews.co.za/2012/03/27/anc-womens-league-wants-to-decriminalise-prostitution/|archivedate=4 May 2012|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that decriminalisation "would challenge the stigma that surrounds sex workers. It would help secure their human rights and dignity, and make for safer work and living conditions for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2013-01-14-sex-workers-vulnerability-is-our-vulnerability |title=Sex workers' vulnerability is our vulnerability |publisher=Daily Maverick |date=2013-01-14 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decriminalising prostitution would limit the power the police have on sex workers and it would stop the police or law enforcers from taking advantage of sex workers. Police enforcement is rigorous and police taking and accepting bribes by the police and their clients is common place.

In April 2013, the [[Commission for Gender Equality]] also stated its support for decriminalization. They argued that current laws violate sections of the constitution, and that sex workers would be better protected if the law is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/decriminalise-sex-work-cge |title=Decriminalise sex work: CGE |publisher=eNCA |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force (SWEAT), is a group based in South Africa that has been working to decriminalize sex work and eventually legalize it. They also provide health services for sex workers since they can't access them elsewhere. They have launched different programs to bring awareness to problems facing sex workers such as Sex Work Empowerment and Enabling Environment (SWEEP), #SayHerName, advocacy and law reform, and Sisonke movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sweat.org.za/what-we-do/|title=What We Do {{!}} SWEAT|work=SWEAT|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Police violence ==
Sex workers are at a disadvantage when it comes to the police, since they are facing extreme violence and abuse from them, they have no one to turn to in times of trouble. In an interview with one sex worker in Cape Town, she said: "The colored police officer grabbed me, and my clothes came off. Then they pepper sprayed me in my mouth and beat me".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manoek|first=Stacey-Leigh|date=August 2012|title=A Report on Human Rights Violations by Police Against Sex Workers in South Africa|url=http://www.sweat.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Human-Rights-Violations-WLC-1.pdf|journal=Women's Legal Centre|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sex workers face random and unjustified violence from the police and can't report that violence to anyone. As many as 7 out of 10 sex workers have endured police brutality in some form, whether it's beating or rape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==2010 World Cup==
There were fears of increased prostitution in connection with the [[2010 Football World Cup]], some sources estimating that an extra 40,000 sex workers would enter South Africa for the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup 2010: 40,000 prostitutes to enter South Africa|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/7374301/World-Cup-2010-40000-prostitutes-to-enter-South-Africa.html|website=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=9 December 2017|date=5 Mar 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there were calls for prostitution to be legalised and regulated to help control AIDS and STDs and for the protection of the sex workers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|title= SA prostitution plans condemned|publisher= BBC|date=|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7509357.stm|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this generated considerable opposition&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and no changes were made to the laws.

Despite the fears, there was little evidence of increased prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex Work during the 2010 FIFA World Cup: Results from a Three-Wave Cross-Sectional Survey|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=12|pages=e28363|pmc=3233553|date=7 December 2011|author1=Delva|first1=W|last2=Richter|first2=M|last3=De Koker|first3=P|last4=Chersich|first4=M|last5=Temmerman|first5=M|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028363|pmid=22163298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV==
{{see also|HIV/AIDS in South Africa}}
South Africa has one of the world's largest [[HIV]] epidemics.&lt;ref name="sowetanlive" /&gt; A study by the SA National Aids Council (Sanac) estimated that there was a 60% infection rate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=60 percent of sex workers are HIV positive|url=http://www.health24.com/Medical/HIV-AIDS/News/60-percent-of-sex-workers-are-HIV-positive-20150113|website=Health 24|accessdate=10 December 2017|date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this varies from area to area, for example, Johannesburg 72%, Durban 54% and Cape Town 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: South African health and HIV survey among female sex workers|url=https://www.health-e.org.za/2016/03/16/2014-sex-workers-hiv-survey/|website=Health E-News|accessdate=10 December 2017|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance to use [[condoms]] has contributed significantly to the epidemic.&lt;ref name="sowetanlive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avert"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Workers, HIV &amp; AIDS|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations/sex-workers|website=AVERT|accessdate=10 December 2017|date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However condom distribution by the government&lt;ref name="lrc" /&gt; AND HIV communication programmes have reduced the rate of new instances.&lt;ref name="avert" /&gt;

==Child prostitution==
[[Child prostitution]] is a problem in the country. Whilst there are no reliable figures available, it has been estimated that there are as many as 30,000 children involved.&lt;ref name="ecpat" /&gt;  South Africa has become one of the major destinations for underage sex tourism in Africa. [[Cape Town]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Port Elizabeth]] and [[Durban]] have become popular destinations for this.&lt;ref name="ecpat" /&gt;

Criminal gangs recruit children from poor rural areas and take them to the large cities for [[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|commercial sexual exploitation]].&lt;ref name="state2" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|human trafficking in South Africa}}
South Africa is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]].&lt;ref name="state2" /&gt; Local criminal gangs dominate child sex trafficking. [[Nigerian]] gangs control the sex industry in several provinces. [[Thailand|Thai]] and [[China|Chinese]] nationals control the sex trafficking of Asian women.

{{nihongo|'''''Queen's Blade Rebellion'''''|„ÇØ„Ç§„Éº„É≥„Ç∫„Éñ„É¨„Ç§„Éâ „É™„Éô„É™„Ç™„É≥|Kuƒ´nzu Bureido Riberion|lead=yes}} is a series of [[Gamebook|visual combat books]] published by [[Hobby Japan]]. The sequel to ''[[Queen's Blade]]'', it features an all-new cast of characters as well as remakes of characters from the original series. Like ''Queen's Blade'' before it, ''Rebellion'' is also compatible with [[Flying Buffalo]]'s ''[[Lost Worlds (gamebook)|Lost Worlds]]'' gamebooks. The first gamebook, featuring Annelotte, was released on November 29, 2008, with a total of twelve gamebooks available in Japan as of December 16, 2011. An [[original video animation]] by [[Arms Corporation|Arms]] was announced, and released two episodes from October 2011 to January 2012. There are currently two [[manga]] adaptations based on the ''Rebellion'' universe being serialized. The first adaptation, illustrated by Riri Sagara, began serialization in Hobby Japan's online manga magazine ''Comic Dangan'' in December 2011, while the second manga adaptation, illustrated by Iku Nanzaki, began serialization in the December 2011 issue of ''[[Comp Ace]]''. An anime adaptation by Arms aired on [[AT-X (company)|AT-X]] and other networks between April and June 2012. The anime is licensed in North America by [[Sentai Filmworks]].

== Story ==
Set after the events of ''Queen's Blade'', Gainos and the entire Continent has fallen under a tyrannical rule led by Claudette, the Thundercloud Queen and victor of the last Queen's Blade tournament (Leina renounces the title). Annelotte, a brave young knight and exiled princess, leads a band of rebels called the Rebel Army to overthrow Claudette and restore peace and order to the Continent.

:Annelotte is the charismatic leader of the Rebel Army. Formerly a member of the Knight Corps of {{nihongo|Margrave Kreutz|„ÇØ„É≠„Ç§„ÉÑËæ∫Â¢É‰ºØ|Kuroitsu Henky≈çhaku}} (her father), she was raised as a boy named {{nihongo|Alphonse Kreutz|„Ç¢„É´„Éï„Ç©„É≥„Çπ„Éª„ÇØ„É≠„Ç§„ÉÑ|Arufonsu Kuroitsu}}. However, tragedy struck when her castle was destroyed by Queen Claudette's forces. While fleeing from Queen Claudette's Assassins in the Elven Forest, she was taken in by [[List of Queen's Blade characters#Alleyne|Alleyne]] after being wounded and later became her student, receiving formal swordstraining from her. Seeking revenge for her fallen comrades, she formed the Rebel Army with a group of similarly-fated female warriors in an attempt to otherthrow the Queen.

:It is revealed through the ''Bit≈çshi Senki'' visual book and through the gamebook itself that she is half-demon, and when pushed to the edge, she transforms to her demonic form, which consists of her having black hair, pointed ears, pale skin, and red eyes. Her silver armor also turns gold to reflect this change, and in this state is powerful enough to overwhelm Elina, Ymir, and Mirim, but loses all sense of reason and turns into a berserker, unable to distinguish friend from foe. Through her demonic powers, she fights on horseback with the aid of her spectral steed {{nihongo|Ambrosius|„Ç¢„É≥„Éñ„É≠„Ç¶„Ç∑„Çπ|Anbur≈çshisu}}, and wields {{nihongo|Grim Venus|„Ç∞„É™„É†„Éª„É¥„Ç£„Éä„Çπ|Gurimu Vinasu}}, a [[broadsword]] that can be converted to a [[lance]] at will. In this state, she calls herself the {{nihongo|"Possessed Knight"|ÁãÇÈ®éÂ£´|Ky≈ç Kishi}}.

:It is hinted through flashbacks of the second ''Queen's Blade'' anime adaptation that Annelotte may be Aldra's long lost sister, as a white-haired figure resembling her can be seen walking with the latter. This is further hinted by Annelotte being a half-demon like Aldra. It is finally confirmed in the third volume of the ''Bit≈çshi Senki'' visual book, as they both reunite and remember their past. Her official English name is "Princess Knight Annelotte", and her name is a pun on the demon [[Astaroth]].&lt;ref name="booklet"&gt;{{cite book|title = Vanquished Queens|publisher=[[Hobby Japan]]| year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Eiwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://queensblade.net/index.php/characters_rebellion/annelotte|title=Official Annelotte Bio|publisher=[[Hobby Japan]]|accessdate=February 5, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Yuit is a young girl from the Little Elves tribe and the tactician of the Rebel Army. She is also Annelotte's childhood friend, and refers to her as "big brother". She is the daughter of Cyan, a legendary [[alchemist]], and is a good friend of the weaponsmith [[List of Queen's Blade characters#Cattleya|Cattleya]]. Despite her genius IQ, she acts and behaves like a spoiled child. She controls Vante, an elf-like [[wind-up toy|wind-up]] [[automaton]], built by Yuit's mother, through a remote control she constantly carries, and acts under the orders written on the rune. Because of this, Vante can easily fall into the wrong hands if the remote is stolen. The two of them together are officially known in English as the {{nihongo|"Alchemy Miracle"|Èå¨Èáë„ÅÆÂ•áË∑°|Renkin no Kiseki}}.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;

:{{Voiced by|[[Haruka Tomatsu]] (Tarnyang) and [[Kei Shind≈ç]] (Sainyang)|Eva Christensen (Tarnyang) and Jaime Maelor (Sainyang)}}
:Tarnyang and Sainyang are twin sisters from the Manchurian-like country of {{nihongo|Shai-Fang|„Ç∑„É£„Ç§„Éï„Ç°„É≥|Shaifan}}, an isolated region of the Continent surrounded by steep and cloudy mountains. They are the descendents of a lineage of [[exorcist]]s that has been carrying the responsibility of protecting the village for generations, and are bound by an unbreakable cord called the {{nihongo|''Ryu-Rin-Ren''|ÈæçÈ∫üÈÄ£|Ry≈´rinren}} which is wrapped around their necks. They left for a journey in the outside world to bring back the {{nihongo|[[Goshintai]]|„ÅîÁ•û‰Ωì||lit. "Sacred Body of God"}}, a mysterious divine protection that has once made Shai-Fang a warm and peaceful land. It is later revealed that this "Goshintai" is actually a human, a girl called the {{nihongo|"Child of the Dragon"|Èæç„ÅÆÂ≠ê|Ry≈´ no Ko}}, considered a being with god-like powers in Shai-Fang.

:Tarnyang, the older sister, is a holy sword user wielding a [[jian]] with a strong-willed, but cheerful, personality. Sainyang, the younger sister and more taciturn of the two (she only whispers to her sister's ear), can use arts with a mysterious power similar to magic, but is often seen spacing out and is very weak, so she's not very useful in battle. Although Tarnyang is always complaining to Sainyang, they are sisters united by a deep bond. With their combined attack {{nihongo|"Double Dragon Formation"|ÂèåÈæçÈô£|S≈çry≈´jin}}i.

:Originally a poor rural girl from the village of {{nihongo|Wasilica|„ÉØ„Ç∑„É™„Ç´|Washirika}}, Mirim sought to escape poverty by seeking a job at the Queen's Capital. It was there that she was brought in by Ymir as a test subject for her "Strongest Project", and became a member of the Queen's Army under a high-paying salary. She is equipped with the Hyper Vibration Armor and armed with the Hyper Vibration Sword {{nihongo|"Infinite Slasher"|„Ç§„É≥„Éï„Ç£„Éã„ÉÉ„Éà„Éª„Çπ„É©„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É£„Éº|Infinitto SurasshƒÅ}} ‚Äì a sword with a [[chainsaw]]-like edge, and the Hyper Vibration shield, all of which are powered by the Hyper Vibration Crystal. Despite being given the armor and weapons, she has a weak-willed personality. She eventually leaves the Queen's Army for the Rebel Army after Ymir tries to destroy her home village, in order to punish the villagers for sheltering Annelotte. She calls Annelotte {{nihongo|"Big Sister"|„ÅäÂßâÊßò|Onee-sama}}.

:Luna Luna is a member from the {{nihongo|Calibara|„Ç´„É™„Éê„É©|Karibara}} tribe located in the southern jungles. The Calibara tribe were once rivals of the Wild Elves, but now they're mostly extinguished. She is the strongest warrior of her tribe, and is the guardian of its historic ruins where the {{nihongo|"Great Power"|Â§ß„ÅÑ„Å™„ÇãÂäõ|}} is held. It is later revealed that this "Great Power" is the {{nihongo|"Sacred Treasure Fortress Bligh"|Á•ûÊ©üË¶ÅÂ°û„Éñ„É©„Ç§|Shinki Y≈çsai Burai}}, a massive mobile fortress that Yuit's mother Cyan once sought. She sometimes greets her invaders with either a fascinating dance or a death dance. Luna Luna has the bravery of a warrior and the character of an innocent maiden, and her fighting dance is a mixture of both. She fights using four tentacles that extend from her hair, and her skin color changes with her personality and fighting style. When she is in her innocent, fair-skinned form, she is known as the {{nihongo|"Sun Dancer"|Â§™ÈôΩ„ÅÆË∏ä„ÇäÊâã|Taiy≈ç no Odorite}}.

:{{Voiced by|[[Y≈´ Kobayashi]]|[[Stephanie Sheh|Rebecca Kim]]}}
:A [[nun]] and an [[inquisitor]] belonging to the Holy Dynasty. A [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]], she is an extremely strict, yet devoted follower of God who is known for executing heretics, usually by [[burning at the stake|burning them alive]]. Although many call her a cruel person, she is actually a virtuous woman, but she is too serious and inflexible and does not hesitate in judging people.

:In the OVA prologue, it is revealed that prior to her title as Inquisitor, she was stationed at the 16th monastery, and was invited by the Holy Dynasty to worship in the Grand Cathedral. During that time, she met [[List of Queen's Blade characters#Ymir|Ymir]] following a skirmish with some drunken women, and has grown acquainted to her despite the latter's merchant-like personality. It is also shown that she tends to rush with her Holy Poses, often rendering them ineffective.

:Sigui is very eager to bring down the Rebel Army, who she considers to be a band of heretics, and sees their leader Annelotte, who carries demon blood, as an abomination. She also considers the use of alchemy as a heresy (even the Holy Dynasty has divided opinions on this topic). She is armed with the {{nihongo|Holy Flame Mace|ËÅñÁÇé„ÅÆÊßåÈâæ|}} and {{nihongo|God's Chained Blade|Á•ûÈéñÂâ£|}}, and her fighting skills rivals Annelotte's. Like Melpha in ''Queen's Blade'', she is also a user of the "Divine Power", the manifestation of God's miracles utilized by the provocative "Holy Poses". Later on, she has a crisis of faith, but Annelotte helps her and tells her she doesn't have to fight alone anymore. She ends up joining the Rebel Army, where she calls Annelotte {{nihongo|"Elder Sister"|Âßâ‰∏äÊßò|Aneue-sama}}.

Cool, collected and proud but also gentle in nature, she serves as a mediator for both races (though there are hardly any interaction between the dragons and humans), and is well-known among her people. Captured by the trainer (and master) {{nihongo|Dogura|Ë™øÊïôÂ∏´ „Éâ„Ç∞„É©||{{Voiced by|[[Binbin Takaoka]]|[[Mike Pollock (voice actor)|Mike Pollock]]&lt;ref name="eng cast"/&gt;}}}}, she has now become a [[gladiator]] slave forced to fight against other slaves and monsters in the Swamp Witch's Arena, ordered to fight in exchange for the life of her Dragon Ride, {{nihongo|Asher|„Ç¢„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É£„Éº|AsshƒÅ}}.

:Despite being put through numerous death matches, Branwen's pride as a Dragon Descendant will not allow her to die easily. Her power as a Dragon Descendant is immense, and when she cannot suppress her anger any longer, she becomes a malevolent Dragon Warrior, pulverizing every enemy before her.

:Laila is a half-angel who was taken to the celestial world to become an angel trainee under [[List of Queen's Blade characters#Nanael|Nanael]]'s supervision (much to the despair of those around). However, she was not pushed around by Nanael's whims because of her "my pace" nature (doing things in her own pace), and it actually looked like she was the one in control. Despite this, they get along well. Nanael, who went on a rampage, ordered Laila to clean the chaos on the human world with the "Divine Punishment" using Holy Milk. Because she is not a true angel, Laila must wear the sacred tool {{nihongo|"Nephilim's Wings"|„Éç„Éï„Ç£„É™„É†„ÅÆÁæΩ|Nefirimu no Hane}}, an artificial wing, to fly, and she is armed with the Heavenly Rifle which fires Holy Milk. At first Laila looks very cool-headed, but she makes so many mistakes that she might actually be very dumb. She has the power to grow in size up to a giant form, that she uses to stop the fortress Bligh when the Rebel Army tries to attack Gainos.

:Eilin is a Dwarf from the Gemstone Mountains, a mountain in the Continent that produces gems. She has a refined and elegant personality, but loves to fight, evidenced through the giant war hammer she carries. Increasing the wealth is the pride of Eilin's clan, and she is famous for her outstanding business acumen and negotiation skills. She is the cousin of Ymir, and although she is very sassy with her, she bears a deep respect for her after losing to Ymir in a fight during childhood. She believes the current Ymir to be an imposter, and after agreeing to support Annelotte in exchange for the Rebel Army's assistance in rescuing her cousin, she goes to the Queen's Castle to confirm her suspicions. There, she meets the true Ymir, who bolts out of the room in anger at being called a fake. Failing to convince her old friend Laila to not fight the Rebel Army, when Ymir comes back Eilin notices that's not her cousin anymore.

She acts aloof when she talks, but she still follows her earnestly. Even if she were to lose her, she would follow her with her full spirit. She wields a huge ''[[nodachi]]'' called {{nihongo|Saodake|„Çµ„Ç™„ÉÄ„Ç±}} which she carries on her back (she claims on her profile that she picked it up somewhere). She is also able to play a whistle made from seashells that boosts her and her comrades' strength. As a vain person, she won't ever say she's "just a warrior from Hinomoto" to try and correct her lie, and hates losing more than any of her fighter comrades.

:Liliana was an infamous pirate who laid waste to the Continent's coastal waters. She is the granddaughter of {{nihongo|Pirate Queen Artemis|Êµ∑Ë≥äÂ•≥Áéã„Ç¢„É´„ÉÜ„Éü„Çπ|Kaizoku Jo ≈å Arutemisu}}, the writer of the {{nihongo|"Pirate Aesthetics"|Êµ∑Ë≥ä„ÅÆÁæéÂ≠¶|Kaizoku no Bigaku}}, a set of rules which Liliana follows. After she met her untimely death by the sea monster [[Kraken]], she was resurrected by the Swamp Witch to become the leader of her undead army in her plot to take over the Continent. Despite being a scoundrel, she has elegant manners like a noble, which is one of the rules from the Aesthetics. She also has a weakness for elderly people, treating them with great care. She has the ability to summon a flying pirate ship and its phantom crew members through the Swamp Witch's power. However, it becomes a crumbling phantom ship over time, later disappearing. She fights using a [[rapier]] and a [[crossbow]]. Though she doesn't feel like she owes the Witch anything, she appears listed as a member of the Swamp Army.

:{{Voiced by|[[Junko Minagawa]]}}
:The being who is followed by the demons and corpses inhabiting the Netherworld and who plans to rule the Continent, she is the Swamp Witch. She suddenly appeared 100 years ago, and the swamp which became her residence gradually expanded by her magic, as she is trying to change the whole Continent into a barren land. She despises the Queen's Blade tournament, as it maintains the present world. With techniques to manipulate departed souls, to summon and to curse, it has reached the extreme that her magical power is perhaps the strongest in the Continent. The true character of the Swamp Witch has the form of a wicked spirit, and her soul and magic are confined in a treasure that has a spider-like form. Unless she [[parasitism|parasitizes]] on an excellent body, her power will be extremely restricted. However, the Swamp Witch has finally obtained the supreme body called Werbellia, and is able to display her complete power. Werbellia is the demonic daughter of the Demon King who lives in the Netherworld, and is Aldra's and Annelotte's mother. She "became" the Swamp Witch around the end of the penultimate Queen's Blade, in an incident that happened several years ago.

:The Swamp Witch's behavior is basically decided by vague "fortune-telling". For example, according to a prediction, she cannot kill the beautiful fighters by her own hands; it was predicted that the beautiful fighters would harm themselves, so she weakened the beautiful fighters by casting a curse crueler than killing them. This was known as the {{nihongo|"Beautiful Fighters Hunt"|ÁæéÈóòÂ£´Áã©„Çä|}}. Although she's like an incarnation of evil, she is a being adored by most of her subordinates. Apart from her many unintelligible remarks, she is generous and magnanimous, with an evil charisma.

:Werbellia makes a brief cameo appearance in the final episode of ''Queen's Blade: Beautiful Fighters'', where she appears (albeit in hooded form) to curse Tomoe during the latter's journey back to Hinomoto.

:{{Voiced by|[[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]]|Gladys Weiner}}
:Formerly known as the {{nihongo|Lord of Thundercloud|Èõ∑Èõ≤„ÅÆÂ∞Ü|Raiun no Sh≈ç}}, Claudette is the current ruler of the Continent. She was defeated at the semifinals of the Queen's Blade tournament, but became Queen after Leina, the former champion, refused the throne. She was once respected as an honest, just and upright person, but after she became the Queen, she proclaimed herself as "[[Divine right of kings|chosen by the Gods]]" and abolished the Queen's Blade tournament altogether. She encouraged the research of the {{nihongo|"Wizard Stones"|È≠îÂ∞éÁü≥|Mad≈ç Ishi}}, and civilization progressed very quickly with the effort. She also invalidated the traditional aristocrat system to give a chance of prosperity to all the people regardless of their birth.
 
:By becoming Queen, however, Claudette's strictness has increased, and thus became a ruthless tyrant. Those who break the law are punished without mercy, and any opposition to the Queen are completely obliterated by a powerful military force. Along with a new set of armor, her [[zweihander]], Thunderclap, has also gained a significant upgrade through the power of the Wizard Stones (courtesy of Ymir), and can now manipulate lightning without readying the sword. Although she does not have a gamebook in ''Rebellion'', she has appeared in all other media. Created by [[Hirokazu Hisayuki]].

:{{Voiced by|[[Kaori Mizuhashi]]|Melissa Hope&lt;ref name="eng cast"/&gt;}}
:Claudette's younger half-sister and a former participant in the Queen's Blade tournament. Formerly the Captain of the Vance Guard, Elina is now the leader of the Queen's Assassins of the Fang after the Vance House collapsed. She still has a huge [[Incest in popular culture|sister complex]] for her older sister Leina, who has gone missing prior to the series' start. This has resulted in her being mentally unstable and having a sadistic, if not psychotic, personality. Known to be the cruelist of the Assassins of the Fang, she will take down anyone who goes against the Queen. She wears a brand-new set of armor, though she still retains her trademark claw guantlet and cat-eared headband from her previous outfit. Although she does not have a gamebook in ''Rebellion'', she has appeared in all other media.

:A mysterious woman known as the {{nihongo|Phantom Warrior|ÂπªÂΩ±„ÅÆÊà¶Â£´|Gen'ei no Senshi}} who aids the Rebel Army. In reality, her true identity is Leina, the Exiled Warrior and the true victor of the last Queen's Blade tournament who had given up her title as Queen to her half-sister Claudette to travel the world. However during her travels, she contracted a mysterious disease that requires her to sleep 16 hours a day. Not only does she need to sleep that long, she also experiences sudden cases of [[narcolepsy]], often requiring her to retreat to her hideout whenever she feels drowsiness. Nonetheless, she is a well-revered warrior who is loved by many. Due to the fighting spirit ingrained in her body, even when she falls asleep due to her curse, she viciously attacks all who approach her carelessly. She has joined and helped Annelotte's party on several occasions, but has a tendency to act alone. Although she does not have a gamebook in ''Rebellion'', she has appeared in all other media.

:Formerly known as the {{nihongo|Iron Princess|ÈãºÈâÑÂß´|K≈çtetsu Hime}}, Ymir was a former participant in the Queen's Blade tournament. She had her weapon broken during a fight with Claudette, and by her clan's law is forced to submit to her demands. She became one of Queen Claudette's closest associates and, along with her rich knowledge of alchemy, invented various items to strengthen the Queen's Army. She became much cooler in personality, no longer being afraid of snakes, and rumors from those who knew the often teary-eyed Ymir say she is now another person entirely. She now wields twin battle axes as weapons, and wears a new set of Dwarven armor modeled after the [[gothic lolita]] style of fashion.

:{{Voiced by|[[Ayana Taketatsu]]|Kenzie Brooks}}
:The former Queen and victor of the last two Queen's Blade tournaments, where she was known as the {{nihongo|Bewitched Queen|ÈÄ¢È≠î„ÅÆÂ•≥Áéã|Oma no Jo ≈å}}. In the last tournament, the dark angel Delmore, the source of her demonic powers, was stripped from her body, and reverted to her true adult form after her defeat. She later embarked on a journey to find her long-lost sister, but suffered from [[amnesia]] along the way. During her journey, she fell in love with a man and was later married. Her happy life was short-lived when the war between the Queen's Army and the Rebel Army spread through the whole Continent, and to protect her beloved husband, she was determined to throw herself in the fight, using her innate summoning skills once again. Used to her work as a [[Gondolier]], she was convinced by Ymir to join the Queen's Army when she saw Annelotte (actually Melona, posing as her) acting rude towards a girl from her town.

:She summoned and made a contract with the Underworld dwellers {{nihongo|Belphe|„Éô„É´„Éï„Çß|Berufe|{{Voiced by|[[Mitsuo Iwata]]|Michelle Newman}}}} and {{nihongo|Dogor|„Éâ„Ç¥„Éº„É´|Dog≈çru|{{Voiced by|[[Masahito Yabe]]|[[Casey Mongillo]]}}}} (an amalgamation of the demon [[Belphegor]]).

:A Warrior Priestess from Hinomoto and a former participant of the Queen's Blade tournament. After awakening her ultimate skills in the tournament and returning to Hinomoto, Tomoe was acknowledged as the supreme warrior of Masakado Shrine, and was given the title of Sword Saint Priestess from the High Priest. However, during her travels in the Continent, a curse of blindness was cast on her by the Swamp Witch. Despite her loss of sight, Tomoe did not lose her burning heart and gentle smile. The day her eyes are opened again will probably be the day when the world will submit to Hinamoto's sword skills. When Annelotte travelled to Hinomoto, Tomoe trained her to be calm and observe her foes when she fought, but couldn't join her quest, as Tomoe chose to stay and keep protecting her village. Although she does not have a gamebook in ''Rebellion'', she has appeared in all other media. Created by Eiwa.

:{{Voiced by|[[Yuko Kaida]]|[[Rebecca Soler|Jessica Paquet]]}}
:The benevolent Bandit of the Wilderness and a friendly rival to Leina who, following the tournament, resumed her training. As a result, her muscle strength increased to the point where she discards her mace for hand-to-hand combat. Following Queen Claudette's reign of terror on the Continent, she founded the Rebel Army, funded by the distribution of dark magic stones. However, she was captured by the Queen's Army after the Swamp Witch, during a "Beautiful Fighter Hunt", cast an "indomitable curse" on her that made her unable to eat or sleep. Although she has been weakened after a long stay in prison, her fighting strength still remains. Her "organizational capacity" will fulfill an important role to Annelotte. In the second volume of the ''Bit≈çshi Senki'' visual book, Annelotte comes up with her new nickname, impressed by her resolution. Although she does not have a gamebook in ''Rebellion'', she has appeared in all other media. Created by Eiwa.

:The Ancient Princess of the Amara Kingdom, revived by the power of the Swamp Witch, and one of the participants in the Queen's Blade Tournament. With the help of her eloquent and good partner, the Living Scepter Setora, after the tournament she succeeded in reviving her home, the Amara Kingdom, in a small desert. She became the Queen of the small kingdom. Going at her own pace as usual, she doesn't appear to have changed much since becoming the Queen, but she now seems to think about the ideal way she ought to manage her "country" and her "people". Currently, she loves the citizens of the new Kingdom of Amara (with a population of 98 people) from the bottom of her heart. In the ruins of the Amara desert she found an ancient treasure, the {{nihongo|"Controlling Treasure"|ÊîØÈÖç„ÅÆÁßòÂÆù|Shihai no Hih≈ç}}, that allowed her to manipulate anyone, but she was forced to hand it over to the Swamp Witch.

:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]|[[Lisa Ortiz|Trina Hilbe]]}}
:Not much is known about her current role, but Melona seems to have left the Swamp Witch and is now considered part of the Queen's Army. In fact, she poses as Ymir as a spy for the Swamp Witch (implying that she captured the real Ymir in the castle in the Anime), by aiding the Queen in power, making Mirim a guinea pig for the Hyper vibration Suit Experiment, tricking Aldra to help the queen and trying to make Annelotte to lose her good side as a Demon form. All in order to make conflicts between continents and the rebellions, so the Swamp Witch can attack all of them and to rule all over the continents. Created by F.S.

'''Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc.''' of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] produces [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figures]] in 25&amp;nbsp;mm, 30&amp;nbsp;mm, 15&amp;nbsp;mm, and 54&amp;nbsp;mm [[Scale model|scale]]. The company was founded in 1975 and is now a division of Iron Wind Metals, LLC, a company created in 2001 around Ral Partha's manufacturing capacities. The company's products are made by [[spin-casting]] metal alloys which depict soldiers, adventurers and creatures that have been inspired by history and fiction. Their miniatures are sold at gaming conventions, in hobby shops, and by internet and mail order for use in [[role playing game]]s, [[wargaming]], dioramas, competitive painting, and collecting. 

The company began as a basement enterprise undertaken by a group of wargamers around the talents of [[Tom Meier]], a 16-year-old sculptor. The company grew with the increasing popularity of board and role-playing games. By 1982 Ral Partha products were sold worldwide.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;"Hanging Out: Warriors &amp; Wizards" by Perry Cooper, ''Cincinnati Best and Worst'' magazine, Volume 16, Number 1, October 1982 pp. 18‚Äì25.&lt;/ref&gt; Ral Partha is best known for its historical figures, ''Fantasy Collector's'' series, and miniatures produced for [[TSR, Inc.]]'s ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' and [[FASA Corporation|FASA]]'s ''[[BattleTech]]'' games. Tom Meier became a freelance sculptor in 1988, and retains copyrights to much of his work for Ral Partha. He works on commission and operates Thunderbolt Mountain Miniatures, a boutique company for pet projects involving dioramas, 54&amp;nbsp;mm figurines, and a new series of [[elves]] and [[goblins]]. During its 40-year history Ral Partha has employed more than two dozen sculptors, of whom the most prolific were Dennis Mize, Julie Guthrie, Sandra Garrity, [[Robert N. Charrette]], and Dave Summers. 

The owners of the original Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. sold the company to [[FASA]] in 1998, and was one of the assets acquired by [[WizKids]] in 2000. The following year Ral Partha's production assets were recast as Iron Wind Metals, LLC of Cincinnati, a company which continues to produce many of the Ral Partha lines of miniatures. In 2015 and the 40th anniversary of the founding of Ral Partha, Iron Wind Metals reacquired the long unused trademarks and relaunched Ral Partha as a division of the company focused on producing archived miniature lines under the banner of the ''Chaos Wars'' gaming world.

==Licensees and distributors==

=== United States ===
In 1980 Ral Partha licensed select designs to [[Rawcliffe Pewter]] a long-time producer of cast metal art.&lt;ref name =Tom/&gt; The pewter versions of Ral Partha sculpts were typically bare-metal with a satin finish and decorated with glass jewels. In time, a division of the company called ''Partha Pewter'' was established to produce directly for the giftware market.

=== Canada ===
Ral Partha established a licensing agreement with [[RAFM]], a miniatures manufacturer in [[Paris, Ontario]], Canada in 1980.&lt;ref name = "D36"&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #36, April 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies have had a long-term working relationship which lasted well into the 1990s.

=== Great Britain ===
In 1979 [[Citadel Miniatures]] was formed by [[Games Workshop]] as a miniatures production shop to produce their own figures and to distribute Ral Partha figures in Britain.&lt;ref name=WD11&gt;''White Dwarf Magazine'' #11, February/March 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =GW84&gt;''Citadel Compendium 1'', Games Workshop 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Citadel Miniatures attempted to establish a U.S. division in 1982 with Ral Partha as the local manufacturer.&lt;ref name =D82/&gt;&lt;ref name =C83&gt;Citadel Miniatures U.S. 1983 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership was short lived and in 1984 [[Games Workshop]] established their own U.S. subsidiary and became a direct competitor. The Citadel Miniatures U.S. products were brought under the Ral Partha logo and marketed as ''Ral Partha Imports.''&lt;ref name=RP84I&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1984 Imports Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 the import lines included the ''FTx-xx Fantasy Tribes'', ''FAx-xx Fantasy Adventurer'', ''FF/31-xxx Fiend Factory'', ''FS/32-xx Fantasy Special'', the popular ''WF-xx Weird Fantasy'' series with whimsical themes, ''FMM-xx Fantasy Mysterious Miniatures'', and ''LB-xx Tabletop's Laser Burn'' line of [[space marines]]. Historical lines included Romans ''AR-xx'', Dark Ages ''DA-xx'', Medievals ''M-xxx'' and Samurai ''SAM-xx''.&lt;ref name = RP85H/&gt;{{#tag:ref| Unless otherwise noted, the designs discussed were produced in 25 mm scale.|group=note}} At least two figures (FTT 3 Troll hurling rock and FTT 4 Troll in chainmail with scimitar) were sculpted by [[Tom Meier]] while visiting England in 1981.&lt;ref name=W24&gt;''White Dwarf' Magazine'' #24, April/May 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 [[Miniature Figurines Production|Minifigs]] gained the rights to manufacture and distribute Ral Partha's fantasy range in Britain.&lt;ref name=Minifigs1&gt;[http://www.miniaturefigurines.co.uk/About.aspx], History of Miniature Figurine Production, Accessed December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Ral Partha dropped Citadel Miniatures' historical lines and began to distribute [[Denizen Miniatures]]' [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] (''33-xxx''), [[orcs]] (''34-xxx''), ''36-xxx Legion of the Damned'' skeletons, and ''39-xxx Fantastic Adventurers''.&lt;ref name = "RP87"/&gt;

=== Continental Europe ===
By 1989, [[Jeux Descartes]] of [[Paris]] gained the rights to distribute Ral Partha figures in continental Europe.&lt;ref name = "D144"&gt;"Through the Looking Glass" by Robert Bigelow, ''Dragon Magazine'' #144, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "RP91"&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1991 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; Some early Ral Partha advertisements erroneously give the name as "Jeaux Descartes." The relationship was on-going in 1997,&lt;ref name=RP97&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1997 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; but was probably severed when FASA purchased Ral Partha the following year.

=== Australia ===
In the 1980s and 1990s, Ral Partha products were distributed in Australia by ''Military Simulations'' of [[Moorabbin, Victoria]] and then [[Bentleigh, Victoria]].

==Product codes==

Only a product code marked Ral Partha's early packaging and customers required a contemporary catalog in order to identify the miniature. In late 1979 the company switched from product codes that used descriptive letter and number codes to a numeric system. For example, in the series ''[[Personalities and Things that Go Bump in the Night]]'', ''ES-001 Evil Wizard, casting spell'' became 01-001, and the first figure of the 15th century Renaissance series ''1501 Command Set'' became 54-001.&lt;ref name = "RP78"&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1978 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RP79&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1979 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RP80&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1980 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; The change was not universal. Ral Partha used letter codes for Citadel Miniatures and [[Denizen Miniatures]] in their line of ''Ral Partha Imports'' until 1992.&lt;ref name=D82&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #82, February 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RP84I/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP92&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1992 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; Ral Partha's international partners used their own systems. [[RAFM]] of [[Canada]] used the descriptive product codes as late as 1984.&lt;ref name =D90&gt;RAFM advertisement in ''Dragon Magazine'' #90, October 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeux Descartes initially used Ral Partha's numeric codes on packaging of their own design, but new lines were introduced selectively and given codes sequential to their own series. As a result, product codes often differ depending on whether the miniatures were produced in the United States, Canada, or Europe.

Throughout the company's history, figures were modified to improve reproducibility, unpopular designs were re-sculpted, and existing product codes were used for new designs. A common cause of modification was a level of detail or animation which challenged the casting technology. An industry-wide reorientation of scale from 25&amp;nbsp;mm to 30&amp;nbsp;mm in the late 1990s, and interest in removing artist's royalties from lines, also prompted new sculpts of existing lines.

Few of Ral Partha's miniatures were marked with product codes and the company's advertisements and catalogs remain a critical resource for collectors. Advertisements by Ral Partha  and its British and Canadian partners appear in most editions of [[TSR, Inc.]]'s ''Dragon'' and [[Games Workshop]]'s ''White Dwarf'' magazines. Product catalogs were published annually from 1978 to 1997, and in 2000. The 1998 and 1999 catalogs were combined into a single issue. Ral Partha also released Christmas catalogs in 1982 and 1983, an ''Imports'' catalog in 1984, historical miniatures catalogs in 1985 and 1996, a 2000 ''Direct Mail Catalog'', and sporadically released updated order forms which listed all the figures in production. In the late 1996 Ral Partha augmented their catalogs with a webpage which highlighted popular products and new releases. After the formation of Iron Wind Metals in 2001, an online catalog and electronic order forms entirely replaced printed catalogs.

==Company history==

Ral Partha Enterprises was formed in 1975 when Glenn E. Kidd,  [[Tom Meier]] and Rich Smethurst set out to produce Meier's sculptures. Meier pioneered the sculpture of miniatures in a two-part [[epoxy putty]] designed for automotive repair.&lt;ref name="Carin"&gt;[https://www.thunderboltmountain.com/bio.html], Tom Meier Biography by Carin Meier, Accessed November 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The epoxy held detail better than traditional media and rest of the miniature industry adopted its use. When mixed together, the blue and yellow components of the putty formed a green putty which gave rise to the term "Greens" for the original artist's work. Finding themselves still short of funds, the three enlisted Marc Rubin, Chuck Crain, and Jack Hesselbrock as partners.&lt;ref name = Courier1.4&gt;'[[The Courier (magazine)|'The Courier'']] Volume 1, No. 4, December 1980, "The Courier Interviews Glenn Kidd," by Dick Bryant, editor.&lt;/ref&gt; The six investors pooled [[USD]] $3,000 to purchase the equipment necessary to produce Meier's sculptures.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;

The company had its origins in the established hobby of historical wargaming, but the company's rapid growth was fostered by the popularity of role-playing games. The company was named ''Ral-Partha'' after a particularly successful [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] character created by Tom's young friend John Winkler. The character was a notoriously hard bargainer whose shrewdness was exemplified by the catch phrase "What's it worth to you?" It was hoped that the fledgling company would have similar good fortune.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gardener&gt;''Cincinnati Magazine'' ''Best Buys - Choose Your Demons'' by Jani Gardener May 1978 pages 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Like their popular line of "3-stage characters," Ral Partha has had a trio of aspects. The first was Winkler's gaming character, depicted as ''ES-001 Evil Wizard, casting spell.'' "Ral" Winkler himself became one of the company's chief casters. Lastly, "Ral" was the company's totemic progenitor credited with collaborative projects and depicted as ''10‚Äì412 Lord of the Balrogs''.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Club1&gt;''Ral Partha Gaming Club Newsletter'' Issue #1 June 30, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RP86&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1986 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt;

Products were originally cast in the basement of 3642 Hyde Park Avenue, in the Fairfax neighborhood of Cincinnati, the home of the company's first president, Glenn E. Kidd.&lt;ref name=Courier1.4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Club1/&gt;&lt;ref name=D4&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #4, March 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1978, the company established a factory at 3726 Lonsdale Street in the Norwood section of Cincinnati.&lt;ref name="D16"&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #16, July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the move, the address was erroneously rendered as 2732&lt;ref name=RP78/&gt; and 2736 Lonsdale,&lt;ref name=Gardener/&gt; but there is no 2700 block of that street. Small stickers were applied to the 1978 product catalog to correct the address. Those stickers have typically fallen off in the intervening years. By November 1980 Ral Partha moved to a larger industrial space at 5938 Carthage Court, where it, and the Iron Wind Metals production facilities remained until 2014.&lt;ref name=RP80/&gt;&lt;ref name=D43&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #43, November 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RP00&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 2000 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; Iron Wind Metals has its offices and production facilities at 10437 Chester Rd in [[Woodlawn, Ohio]].

Ral Partha's formative years were the late 1970s, when the company was a part-time basement enterprise producing the art of a teenage sculptor for a nascent gaming market. In 1979, the company became a full-time endeavor with industrial space and two professional sculptors designing products for multiple themes made popular by the rapidly expanding gaming market. The number of sculptors and catalog of miniatures grew rapidly. In the mid-1980s, the preponderance of work moved from Ral Partha's sculptors' designs to manufacturing under license for nationally marketed games. In the short run, the move was economically beneficial. However, the lack of product diversity left the company vulnerable to the marketing decisions of clients for whom miniatures were a minor interest. Between 2001 and 2014, Ral Partha was an unused trademark caught up in the mergers and intellectual property negotiations between large game producers. Since 2001 the focus of Iron Wind Metals has been on existing product lines, ''Battletech'' licensed figures, and manufacturing for partner companies who carryout their own designs, marketing and distribution. In 2014 the production and productive capacities were reunited under Ral Partha Enterprises, a division of Iron Wind Metals.

The young company received early encouragement from the sale of its entire stock at [[Gen Con]] 1976, a convention of gaming enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=Club1/&gt; Ral Partha's lines and customer base grew quickly and they regularly won multiple categories of the [[Origins Award]].&lt;ref name=Orig&gt;[http://www.originsgamefair.com/], Origins Game Fair, Accessed November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Ral Partha's figures were popular with historical wargamers, but fans of fantasy themed role-playing games like TSR Inc.'s ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' accounted for the majority of their sales.&lt;ref name=Tom&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thunderboltmountain.com/autobio.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827203158/http://www.thunderboltmountain.com/autobio.htm |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}, Tom Meier Autobiography, Accessed November 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Meier's sculpts tended to carry greater detail than many of his contemporaries, but some early products presented challenges to the casting process.&lt;ref name=D3&gt;Wargaming World, ''Dragon Magazine'' #3, October 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1976, Meier had begun a series of soldiers from [[Classical antiquity]] which were collected together as ''AN/35-xxx The Hoplites''.&lt;ref name=D11&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #11, December 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978 the line was essentially complete and included [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]s, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s, [[Gaul]]s, [[Roman Republic|Early Republic Romans]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]ns.&lt;ref name=RP78/&gt; Another series begun by Meier in 1976 was a line of 11th-century knights and footmen called ''11/42-xxx 1200 A.D.''.&lt;ref name=D4/&gt; The series included [[Viking]]s, English, French, Spanish, [[Moors|Moorish]], [[Mongol]], and [[Song Dynasty|Sung Chinese]] soldiers.&lt;ref name=RP78/&gt;

In 1978 Ral Partha acquired [[The Old Guard (company)|The Old Guard]]'s ''Legions of the Petal Throne'' line of figures for TSR Inc.'s ''[[Empire of the Petal Throne]],'' a role-playing game based on [[M. A. R. Barker]]'s world of [[T√©kumel]].&lt;ref name="RP78" /&gt;&lt;ref name=D4/&gt; Ral Partha retained the services of [[William Murray (miniature sculptor)|William Murray]], the line's sculptor. Tom Meier and Brian Apple made contributions to the series (''T, Y, P, M, NH-xxx'') in 1979, but it was discontinued later that year.&lt;ref name=RP79/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP80/&gt;

As early as 1978, Ral Partha produced three series of 15&amp;nbsp;mm historical miniatures sculpted by [[George Freeman (miniature sculptor)|George Freeman]] of Dayton, Ohio. They included [[Napoleonic]]-era figures ''N-xxx Days of the Empire'', ''AW-xxx American Civil War'', and ''AK-xxx Desert Rats'', modeling the [[North African Campaign]] of World War II. [[Ann Gallup]] also contributed an ''AC-xxx'' series to the [[American Civil War]] line.&lt;ref name=RP78/&gt; In 1979 Ral Partha added Freeman's 25&amp;nbsp;mm ''W-xxx Waterloo Collector's Series'',&lt;ref name=RP79/&gt; but all of Freeman and Gallup's figures were discontinued in 1980.&lt;ref name=RP80/&gt; George Freeman's 15mm Napoleonics figures are available from Monday Knight Productions (see external links below).

Ral Partha's first venture into science fiction was Meier's 1978 line of [[space marine]]s and [[space alien]]s ''GG-xxx Galactic Grenadiers: Strike Force Alpha''. Their release was in tandem with [[Gamescience]]'s ''Strike Team Alpha'', a set designed by Michael Scott Kurtick for Meier's Galactic Grenadiers.&lt;ref name=Geek_Alpha&gt;[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/10224], Strike Team Alpha, Board Game Geek.

===Producer of signature lines, 1979‚Äì1986===

In the summer of 1978, Meier began reworking the themes of the ''E-xxx'' series to create the ''CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors'' line of [[elves]].&lt;ref name="D19"&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #19, October 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Meier's lines were successful and he began sculpting full-time in 1979. The addition of [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] in 1979 and [[goblin]]s in 1980 almost entirely replaced the ''E-xxx'' series.&lt;ref name=RP79/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP80/&gt; Meier added [[halfing]]s in 1982 and began a series of fantasy vehicles. The first was ''02‚Äì030 Dwarf Steam Cannon'', released in 1983. Meier's contribution to the series was completed when ''02-078 The Warmachine'' and ''02-020 The Elf Chariot'' were put into production in 1984.&lt;ref name=RP82/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP83/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP84/&gt;

Ral Partha hired [[Dennis Mize]] in 1979. With two full-time sculptors, Ral Partha's product lines increased rapidly. Mize's first project was ''H-xxx Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age'' to accompany a [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] game of the same name, based on the world of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan the Barbarian]].&lt;ref name=RP79/&gt; The Hyborean line was dropped in 1980, and Mize introduced ''53-7xx The Samurai'' and a line of 15mm fantasy soldiers called ''05-xxx Armies of Myth and Legend''.&lt;ref name=RP80/&gt; His popular ''CN/13-xxx Children of the Night'' was begun by 1982 and expanded over the course of the next two years.&lt;ref name=RP82/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP83/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP84/&gt; In 1982 Mize and Meier created figures for small thematic box sets called ''98-xxx The Adventurers''.&lt;ref name=RP82/&gt;&lt;ref name=D49&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #49, May 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Mize also added to and revised Meier's ''The Hoplites'' and ''1200 A.D.'' lines in 1984.&lt;ref name=RP84/&gt;

In 1979, Meier introduced ''15/54-xxx Condotitieri'', a line of [[Renaissance]]-era figures.&lt;ref name=RP79/&gt; The first offerings were Imperialists, to which he added Swiss and Turks in 1980.&lt;ref name="RP80"/&gt; Meier expanded the historical ranges with the 1983 addition of ''88-xxx The Colonials''.&lt;ref name=RP83/&gt; Sculpts for the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] were augmented in 1984 with figures for the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|Northwest Frontier]] and the [[Mahdist War|Sudan Campaign]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=RP85H&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1985 Historical Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RP84/&gt;

Ral Partha entered the game market in 1980 with the release of ''99‚Äì001 Witch's Caldron'', ''99-002 Caverns Deep'', ''[[Final Frontier (game)|99-003 Final Frontier]]'', and ''99-004 Galactic Grenadiers'', skirmish games designed by Glenn E. Kidd and Marc Rubin. "Galactic Grenadiers" included miniatures from the ''GG-xxx'' series. 15&amp;nbsp;mm figures from ''Final Frontiers'' were released in 1982 as ''[[Star Warriors (Ral Partha)|08-xxx Star Warriors]]''.&lt;ref name=RP82/&gt; By 1982, the presidency of the company passed from Glenn E. Kidd to Jack Hesselbrock.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; The lines of 15&amp;nbsp;mm fantasy figures were taken out of production and the figures from the ''Caverns Deep'' and ''Witch's Cauldron'' games were incorporated into ''98-xxx The Adventurers'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="RP83"/&gt; Ral Partha returned to the board game market in 1985 when they joined with Leggett Games Inc. to publish ''Fortress'', a skirmish-based board game which incorporated lead Ral Partha miniatures.&lt;ref name=Fort&gt;[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/17429], ''Fortress'', at Board Game Geek.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the company launched ''77-xxx Partha Paints'' and ''Dragonscale'' metallic cremes which were packaged with dragon figures.&lt;ref name=RP85F/&gt;

In the spring of 1983 Ral Partha began publishing a four-page newsletter entitled ''The Partha Pipeline'' which was a house [[fanzine]] with articles generated by staff and friends. A typical issue included "Letters to Ral" where the company's semi-mythical progenitor would answer reader's questions, scenarios for battles with Ral Partha figures, and new releases by Ral Partha and those which they distributed for [[RAFM]].&lt;ref name=PP1.3&gt;The Partha Pipeline, Ral Partha Enterprises, First Series, Volume 1, Number 3, Fall 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Partha Pipeline continued for three more years until ending its first series in 1986. A second series using the same name would be revived in 1999.

[[Julie Guthrie]] began freelance sculpting for Ral Partha in 1983. Her first line was the ''02-9xx All Things Dark and Dangerous''. She worked with Meier and Mize on ''98-xxx The Adventurers''.&lt;ref name=RP83/&gt; Later that year, box sets of ''10-3xx The Best of Ral Partha'' and Julie Guthrie's ''96-xxx Elfquest'' figures for [[Chasosium]]'s ''[[Elfquest (role-playing game)|Elfquest]]'' game were put into production.&lt;ref name=RP83X&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1983 Christmas Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie expanded the ''All Things Dark and Dangerous'' line in 1984, 1985, and 1986. In 1984 she joined Meier and Mize to develop a short series of miniatures (''95-xxx'') for [[Nova Games]]' [[Lost Worlds (gamebook)|Lost Worlds]] series of combat books.&lt;ref name=RP86/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP84/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP85F/&gt; In 1985 Guthrie contributed two sculpts of unicorns to ''PO-3xx Once Upon a Time'' series designed for the giftware market, cast in lead-free alloy, and marketed as "Partha Pewter" by [[Rawcliffe Pewter]].&lt;ref name=D93&gt;Ral Partha Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #93, January 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Their work with pewter allowed Ral Partha's mold-makers to develop the technical expertise necessary to transition to non-lead alloys in the early 1990s.

[[Robert N. Charrette]] joined Ral Partha in 1984 and contributed to Meier's ''The Hoplites'', ''1200 A.D.'', and ''CS/02-xxx Collector Series'' lines.&lt;ref name=RP84/&gt; In 1985, Charrette inaugurated figures for Chaosium's ''[[RuneQuest]]'' and a line of pulp adventurers. The line was initially called "20th Century Plus", but was later renamed ''20-xxx The Roaring Twenties''.&lt;ref name=RP85F/&gt; Charrette revisited a line of figures he sculpted in 1979 to accompany [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]]'s ''[[Gangster!]]''.&lt;ref name=D29&gt;Report on Origins '79, ''Dragon Magazine'' #29, September 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FGU&gt;[http://www.space-opera.net/mirror/fgu/default.htm], Mirror of FGU website, Accessed December 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W14&gt;Molten Magic in ''White Dwarf'' #14, August/September 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Charrette updated the line to include new cinematic themes such as the intrepid archaeologist. In 1986 Charrette introduced ''53-9xx Bushido'', a line of miniatures for ''[[Bushido (role-playing game)|Bushido]],'' a game he authored and sculpted a line of figures for Fantasy Games Unlimited.&lt;ref name=RP86/&gt;&lt;ref name=FGU/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bob&gt;[http://www.charrette.parroom.net/minigames1.html], Bob Charrette Games, Accessed November 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Bob Charrette began producing a line of miniature robot war machines for a game that was first called "Battledroids" and renamed ''[[BattleTech]]'' in 1986, for FASA's game of the same name.&lt;ref name=RP86/&gt; It was the beginning of a permanent relationship between the two companies that would eventually lead to Ral Partha's sale to FASA. Battletech products remain a leading product of Ral Partha's successor, Iron Wind Metals and Charrette continued on as creative development and authored several related novels.

In 1986 Ral Partha sculptors crafted ''01-3xx 3-Stage Characters'' which consisted of three aspects with increasing amounts of arms and armor to represent a single adventurer's game career.&lt;ref name=RP86/&gt; The line was folded into the ''ES/01-xxx'' line in 1987.&lt;ref name=RP87/&gt; Because of their popularity with collectors and role-players, they regained status as a separate line and a place of prominence in the 1991 and subsequent catalogs.&lt;ref name=RP91/&gt;

===Chaos Wars, 1986‚Äì1987===

At the same time that integrated campaign worlds like [[Games Workshop]]'s ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'' were showing early success, Ral Partha introduced the "Chaos Wars" theme into their 1986 and 1987 product lines.&lt;ref name =RP87/&gt;&lt;ref name =RP86/&gt; It was the first step toward unifying a collection of disparate themes into an integrated brand. In the 1986 catalog sculptors were no longer credited and a mythical "Ral Partha" rather than the president of the company addressed customers in the prologue.&lt;ref name=RP86/&gt; At about that same time, the Ral Partha staff had developed a four-page ''Rules According to Ral'' for medieval battles. A fantasy version by Bob Charrette, Rich Smethhurst, Marc Rubin, and Chuck Crain was released in 1987 as part of a boxed set ''Rules According to Ral: Chaos Wars''.&lt;ref name=RP86/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bob/&gt;&lt;ref name =Geek&gt;[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/publisher/547], Board Game Geek, Ral Partha Games, Accessed November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMP2&gt;[http://theminiaturespage.com/rules/fan/chaoswars.html], TMP: Chaos Wars, Accessed November 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chaos Wars theme collected together numerous existing products, many from Meier's ''ES/01-xxx'' line, and their packaging was marked with stickers.

As part of the Chaos Wars product line the ''Partha Pipeline'' newsletter was transformed into the ''Ral Partha War Bulletin'' in January 1986. The ''War Bulletin'' followed much of the same format as the ''Pipeline'' but its focus was the Chaos Wars product line. Releases were sporadic and continued until at least the Spring of 1990.&lt;ref name=WB90&gt;The Ral Partha War Bulletin, Ral Partha Enterprises, Spring 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new initiative was to include ''10-2xx Free Companies of Chaos Wars'' box sets, but large contracts to produce miniatures for other gaming companies became a higher priority and the Chaos Wars lines were appended to the ''CS/02-xxx Collector's Series''. Among these sets were Charrette's popular ''Fangs of Fury'' beastmen, Tom Meier's ''Korg's Killers'' orcs, and Meier's ''Starbrow's Select'' elves. Having never fully materialized, the Chaos Wars theme was set aside in 1988 in order to give necessary attention to producing official miniatures for TSR, Inc.'s ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' game.

Garrity, and Jim Johnson in 1992, and Chis Fitzpatrick and Geoff Valley by 1995.&lt;ref name=RP92/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP95/&gt;

By 1991 the ''20-xxx BattleTech'' line had grown to include eleven box sets, and more than one hundred 'Mechs, Aerospace fighters, and ground vehicles. Ral Partha also produced 25&amp;nbsp;mm ''20-9xx Mechwarriors'' depicting pilots, mechanics and guards for role-playing in the [[BattleTech]] game world. That same year, Ral Partha sculptors had begun crafting figures for FASA's game [[Shadowrun]], a role-playing game set in a futuristic cyber-world.&lt;ref name = RP91/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orig/&gt; Shadowrun miniatures had previously been produced by [[Grenadier Models Inc.|Grenadier Miniatures]].

Other new lines included Richard Kerr's 1992 futuristic tanks for [[Steve Jackson Games]]' ''[[Ogre (game)|Ogre]]''&lt;ref name=Orig/&gt; and the introduction of the  "69-xxx" series for [[White Wolf, Inc.]]'s ''[[Werewolf: The Apocalypse]]'' and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' in late 1993.&lt;ref name=D196&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #196, August 1993, page 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures for White Wolf, Inc.'s ''[[Mage: The Ascension]]'' followed soon after.

Initially, Ral Partha figures were cast from lead and tin alloy, but in 1993 New York legislators nearly passed a public health bill barring the use of lead in toys and miniatures.&lt;ref name=D192&gt;"Through the Looking Glass" by Robert Bigalow, ''Dragon Magazine'' #192, April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the additional cost, numerous manufacturers anticipated parental concerns, similar legislation in other states, workplace safety, and began using white metal alloys. Ral Partha's staff had previously developed a lead-free alloy for their "Partha Pewter," a line of collectible figurines designed for the giftware market. In September 1993 they began using a trademarked white metal alloy they called ''Ralidium'' in all their products &lt;ref name=D197&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. Advertisement, ''Dragon Magazine'' #197, September 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and its use marks a clear benchmark for dating old figures. The move away from lead was promoted in advertisements and bright red stickers on existing packaging. In time, New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] relented to hobbyists' concerns and exempted miniatures from the state's Public Health Law.&lt;ref name=NY2&gt;"Through the Looking Glass" by Robert Bigalow, ''Dragon Magazine'' #205, May 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company never went back to lead. Ral Partha correctly anticipated the industry's movement away from lead, but the associated price increases came at a time when miniatures and role playing games were being eclipsed by [[collectible card games]] like [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s 1993 hit ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''. In 1994 the company experimented with ''Partha Plastics.''&lt;ref name=RP94&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1994 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Club6/&gt; The move was made well after Citadel Miniatures' successful introduction of plastic and part-plastic figures, but the figures were not popular with Ral Partha's older customer base.
 
In 1993 Dennis Mize designed the "Titans of Terror" series which invoked the heroes and monsters of the horror films.&lt;ref name=RP93&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1993 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Mize conceptualized and sculpted ''01-7xx Beastmasters'', a line of carnivores and their trainers. The line was expanded the following year, and would be completed until 1998.&lt;ref name=RP94/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP95/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP98-99&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. Winter '98/'99 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Ral Partha produced "Coins of the Realm," fantasy and historical coinage.&lt;ref name=RP94/&gt; In 1995 Ral Partha's sculptors crafted figures for Steve Jackson Games' ''[[Space Knight]],'' and dioramas called ''Sculptors' Row'', ''The Sterling Collection'', and "Encounters of the Imagination''.&lt;ref name=RP95&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1995 Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The trouble with wizards, 1996‚Äì2001===

During Jack Hesselbrock's second term as company president, he re-established a newsletter which he called the ''Ral Partha Gaming Club.'' Like its predecessors it addressed letters from customers and company news. The series ran for six issues from June 1996 to September 1997. In December of 1996 Ral Partha launched a website which hosted the newsletters and product ordering information. The newsletters reveal a number of licensing setbacks. The hobby market had moved away from [[roleplaying game]]s and [[wargaming|wargames]] and was rapidly becoming dominated by [[collectible card game]]s like [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s [[Magic: The Gathering]]. Ral Partha faced a number of licensing setbacks. Steve Jackson Games' ''Ogre'' miniatures and all three ''White Wolf'' lines were discontinued in 1996. Bob Charrette's ''18-xxx Runequest'' figures were discontinued the following year.&lt;ref name=RP97/&gt;&lt;ref name=Club3&gt;''Ral Partha Gaming Club Newsletter'' #3, September 30, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1970s the gaming miniatures industry had undergone what collectors call "scale creep," an increase in size from 20 and 25&amp;nbsp;mm scales (i.e. height to the eyes of an upright human-sized figure) to 30&amp;nbsp;mm and 32&amp;nbsp;mm. By the late 1990s the move to larger figures by market leaders like [[Games Workshop]] of Great Britain had made it such that Ral Partha's sculpts of the 1970s and early 1980s appeared significantly smaller than others. In response to the shift in the market, Ral Partha began adding to Tom Meier's collector's series (''CS/02-xxx'') with a 30&amp;nbsp;mm scale ''Fantasy Armies'' line in a "British style" which tended to have over-sized weapons, [[punk subculture|punk]] and [[Gothic fashion|Gothic]] fashions, and separate square bases. Chris Fitzpatrick designed a line of elves. Bob Olley produced new dwarves, goblins, trolls and ogres. Jeff Wilhelm created a series of skeletons. Jim Johnson's contributions were bands of humans known as ''Horse Lords'', ''Savages,'' ''Reavers,'' and ''Tyrants.'' Sandra Garrity designed the ''Knights of the Legion of Justice''&lt;ref name=RP97/&gt;  A set of rules of the ''Fantasy Armies'' were developed by an outside work group called ''Ral Partha Publishing.'' The game was first introduced in the 1997 Ral Partha catalog flier as ''14-001 Bloodstorm.'' Soon after the project was retitled ''Battlestorm'' and published in 1998.&lt;ref name=Club6/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP97I&gt;Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1997 Catalog Insert ‚Äì The Final Battle Begins, Bloodstorm.&lt;/ref&gt; The game was advertised as the first volume of the "Fables Gamesystem," but no subsequent installments were issued.&lt;ref name=RP98-99/&gt;

Buoyed by the success of Magic:The Gathering, in 1997 Wizards of the Coast acquired TSR, Inc. and with it, control of the rights to ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' miniatures.&lt;ref name=Wiz0&gt;[http://www.gamecabinet.com/news/TSRWotC.html], Game Cabinet ‚Äì Wizards of the Coast to acquire TSR, Accessed November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After an extension to their contract, Wizards of the Coast did not renew Ral Partha's license for ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' miniatures and the figures went out of production at the end of 1998&lt;ref name=Club6&gt;''Ral Partha Gaming Club Newsletter'' #6, September 30, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Club5&gt;''Ral Partha Gaming Club Newsletter'' #5, June 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; These miniatures are highly sought after by collectors who believe that Wizards of the Coast had ordered the destruction of the master molds.

The loss of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and other licenses meant that FASA's BattleTech figures became the majority of Ral Partha's revenue. Under threat of also losing those lines and the financial difficulties created by the changing hobby market, the owners of Ral Partha sold the company in 1998 to FASA and Lanier Hurdle and Mike Hurdle, owners of Zocchi Distribution, a hobby shop supplier.&lt;ref name=SJ&gt;[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=693],'' Pyramid Magazine'', Industry News, Accessed November 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; FASA gained sole ownership in the spring of 1999,&lt;ref name=SJ/&gt; and Ral Partha began to produce miniatures for FASA's ''[[Crimson Skies]]'', ''[[Crucible: Conquest of the Final Realm]]'', and ''[[VOR: The Maelstrom]]'' games.&lt;ref name=RP00/&gt; No sooner were these miniatures in stores when FASA ceased production of all their games.&lt;ref name =FAQ&gt;[http://www.carnagecon.com/Files/FASA_Closing_FAQ.html], FASA Closing FAQ.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1999 Ral Partha launched ''The Partha Pipeline'' to announce new products for FASA's games, as well as house designs. At this time Ral Partha had an in-house design studio and a host of staff and free-lance sculptors which included Kev Adams, Jeff Grace, Behrle W. Hubboch III, Randy Kerr, Robert Kyde, Phil Lewis,  Dennis Mize, Bob Olley, Tim Prow, Steve Saunders, C. Staples, Dave Summers, Jeff Wilhelm, John Winter.&lt;ref name=PP2.1&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #1, December 1999, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PP2.2&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #2, January 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PP2.3&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #3, February 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PP2.4&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #4, March 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PP2.5&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #5, April 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PP2.6&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #6, May 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PP2.7&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #7, June 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PP2.8&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #8, July 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PP2.9&gt;''The Partha Pipeline'' Second Series, #9, August 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.&lt;/ref&gt; The second series of the ''Partha Pipeline'' ran until late 2000 when the Ral Partha assets faced another acquisition.

In January 2001 [[WizKids]], a New Jersey-based producer of plastic [[collectible miniatures game]]s, acquired the bulk of Ral Partha's assets as part of their purchase of FASA's ''BattleTech'' and ''Shadowrun'' games.&lt;ref name=Wiz0/&gt; WizKids purchased the rights to some figures from Ral Partha sculptors, but the bulk reverted to the artists. Meier retained his ''15/54-xxx Condotitieri,'' ''88-xxx The Colonials'', and most of the ''CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors'' lines.&lt;ref name=Tom3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thunderboltmountain.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=384 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053802/http://www.thunderboltmountain.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=384 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}, Tom Meier, Thunderbolt Miniatures Forums, Accessed December 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Charrette remained in possession of his ''53-9xx Bushido'' figures.&lt;ref name=Bob/&gt; Ral Partha continued to produce miniatures for the ''Battletech'' and ''Shadowrun'' gaming worlds. Wizkids licensed the rights to rulebooks and other gaming materials to [[Fantasy Productions]], better known as "FanPro" in the United States, which had produced and distributed the German language versions of those games for FASA. FanPro's support of the ''Shadowrun'' and ''Battletech'' game worlds resulted in continued demand for metal miniatures by gaming enthusiasts.

In March 2001 Ral Partha began producing collectible metal versions of the WizKids 64-figure ''[[Mage Knight]]'' Rebellion set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mage Knight Metal collectible pewter figures |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/197.html |work=icv2.com |publisher=ICV2 |date=March 1, 2001 |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Wizkids and Ral Partha was a short one. By year's end Wizkids rethought its investment in metal miniatures and divested itself of Ral Partha's manufacturing capabilities while retaining the Ral Partha trademark.

===Iron Wind Metals, 2001‚Äì2014===

In late 2001 Ral Partha's manufacturing capacities were spun off from WizKids, and renamed Iron Wind Metals, LLC, with longtime general manager Michael Noe as president and in partnership with Marc Rubin, one of Ral Partha's original owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WizKids to spin off Ral Partha on its own in January |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/972.html |work=icv2.com |publisher=ICV2 |date=December 25, 2001 |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron Wind Metals retained the same location and much of the same production staff, molds, equipment, working relationships with artists, and licensing agreements. In addition to their own lines, Iron Wind Metals carries out contract production work for other gaming labels such as Tom Meier's Thunderbolt Mountain, Dark Sword Miniatures, Crocodile Games, and dozens of others.

Iron Wind Metals' new focus on productive capacities reflected a shift in game production strategy. The previous model had been that gaming companies hired sculptors and other creative talent to feed their in-house casting and packaging facilities. This model was successful, but artists sometimes didn't have the capital necessary to retain copyrights, and the mercurial nature of the market meant that their game designs could be sold to others, or languish as assets of dead companies. In the late 1980s, many game designers and sculptors established boutique companies, often operating out of their own homes, and then contracted out or made partnerships with companies like Iron Wind Metals to do the production.

Iron Wind Metals continued to use the name Ral Partha to describe archived designs, but the website and Ral Partha trademark remained the property of Wizkids which underwent a series of acquisitions. In 2003 WizKids was purchased by [[Topps]], a manufacturer of sports cards who were interested in WizKids range of similarly collectible plastic miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Topps acquires WizKids |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/2950.html |work=icv2.com |publisher=ICV2 |date=June 23, 2003 |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Topps was purchased by [[The Tornante Company]], a private equity firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Topps sold! |url=http://icv2.com/articles/games/view/11316/topps-sold |work=icv2.com |publisher=ICV2 |date=September 18, 2007 |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing falling profits associated with the [[Great Recession]], Tornante put the Wizkids product lines on hold in November 2008, but continued to lease the [[intellectual properties]] of ''Battletech'' and ''Shadowrun'' game worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Topps shuts down WizKids |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/13701.html |work= icv2.com |publisher=ICV2 |date=November 10, 2008 |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 14, 2009, The Tornante Company sold the majority of the Wizkids assets to the [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] (NECA), but retained the rights to ''Battletech,'' ''Shadowrun,'' and the Ral Partha trademark and website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NECA acquires WizKids assets from Topps |url=http://necaonline.com/29225/blog/press-releases/neca-acquires-wizkids-assets-from-topps/ |work=NECA |publisher=NECA.com |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divisions and purchases meant that assets important to the Ral Partha brand were divided among numerous enterprises. Between 1998 and 2009, the Ral Partha trademark passed from FASA, to Wizkids, Topps, and finally The Tornante Company. None of whom utilized the brand. The miniatures for the ''Battletech'' miniatures produced by Ral Partha and then Iron Wind Metals remained popular, but the future of the game was always in question. FanPro had lost its bid to produce the ''Battletech'' and ''Shadowrun'' game worlds, but [[InMediaRes Productions|InMediaRes]] created a new subsidiary, [[Catalyst Game Labs]] to design new expansions for the games and provided continuity by employing many former FanPro staff &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The convoluted story of the Iron Wind Metals, Ral Partha, and Battletech miniatures |url= http://www.purplepawn.com/2010/03/the-convoluted-story-of-iron-wind-metals-ral-partha-and-battletech-miniatures/#sthash.kH6ZTDcz.dpuf |work=Yehuda Berlinger |publisher= PurplePawn.com |date= March 2, 2010 |accessdate= April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The productive capacities for Ral Partha miniatures remained with Iron Wind Metals who had retained working relationships with many of the artists, but could not use the Ral Partha name. Longtime customers could special order many of the figures, but they could not be marketed as Ral Partha figures. The trademark languished until 2014 when The Tornante Company agreed to sell the assets to Iron Wind Metals. By the end of 2014 Iron Wind Metals had recreated Ral Partha by forming a new division which united the Ral Partha trademark, website and sculptors' copyrights with their improved productive capacities.

===Ral Partha, a Division of Iron Wind Metals, 2014-present===

On the 40th anniversary of the founding of Ral Partha, Iron Wind Metals relaunched the miniature lines from Ral Partha's "golden age." Establishing Ral Partha as a division of Iron Wind Metals, president Mike Noe and co-owner Mark Rubin launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to [[crowdfund]] the production costs of its 1980s lines under the ''Chaos Wars'' game world. Ral Partha had begun developing ''Chaos Wars'' in 1986. At that time they had released a new version of 'house rules" called ''Rules According to Ral'' gaming system with scenarios, several boxed sets, and blister packs marked with ''Chaos Wars'' stickers. However, the initiative was put on hold by the push to produce miniatures for lines licensed by TSR, FASA, and other partners. After a sixteen-year hiatus, ''Chaos Wars'' returned as a series of blister packs, limited edition boxed sets, and battle packs of elves, orcs and goblin figures drawn from Ral Partha's ''CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors'', ''12-xxx The All American'' and other lines. A majority of the figures were sculpted by Tom Meier who supported the re-release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ral Partha's Chaos Wars |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1050509756/ral-parthas-chaos-wars?ref=nav_search |work=IWM |publisher=Kickstarter |date=April 18, 2015 |accessdate= April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Iron Wind Metals completed a second campaign and revived previously archived figures of dwarves, undead and troglodytes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ral Partha's Chaos Wars |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1050509756/ral-parthas-chaos-wars-dwarf-undead-troglodyte-min?ref=hero_thanks |date=May 7, 2016 |accessdate= June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Si Ronda''''' is a 1930 [[silent film]] from the [[Dutch East Indies]] which was directed by [[Lie Tek Swie]] and starred [[Bachtiar Effendi]]. Based on contemporary [[Betawi people|Betawi]] oral tradition, it follows the exploits of a bandit, skilled in ''[[silat]]'' (traditional Malay martial arts), known as Si Ronda. In the ''[[lenong]]'' stories from which the film was derived, Ronda was often depicted as a [[Robin Hood]] type of figure. The production, now thought [[lost film|lost]], was one of a series of martial arts films released between 1929 and 1931. ''Si Ronda'' received little coverage in the media upon its release. A second adaptation of the tale, ''Si Ronda Macan Betawi'', was made in 1978.

==Production==
''Si Ronda'' was adapted from a ''[[lenong]]'' (a [[Betawi people|Betawi]] oral tradition similar to a stage play) popular with [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] and [[Native Indonesians|native]] audiences of the time. The Ronda stories follow the Betawi bandit of the same name, who is skilled at ''[[silat]]'' (traditional martial arts) and reputed to take from the rich to give to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Si Ronda}}; {{harvnb|Biran|2009|pp=104‚Äì05}}; {{harvnb|van Till|1996|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian film scholar [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because of its potential action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=108}}; {{harvnb|Sen|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar stories to Si Ronda's include those of Si Jampang and [[Si Pitung]];{{sfn|JCG, Ronda, Si}} these stage plays centred on extraordinary men (referred to as ''jago'') who, though living outside the law, generally fought for the common populace.{{sfn|Gouda|1999|p=169}} Adaptations of the genre, manifested as bandit films, became popular in domestic cinema following the release of ''[[Si Tjonat]]'' by Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. This release was followed by the [[Wong brothers]]' ''Rampok Preanger'' (also 1929), and an [[Si Pitoeng (1931 film)|adaptation]] of the Si Pitung stories in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sen|1995|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Biran|2009|pp=105, 111, 113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all films in this genre, which consisted of a quarter of all [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic releases for 1929‚Äì1931]], maintained the heroic qualities of the central character: the Wongs' adaptation of ''Si Pitung'', for instance, portrayed him as a simple bandit and not the [[Robin Hood]] figure of stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|pp=379‚Äì80}}; {{harvnb|van Till|1996|pp=461‚Äì68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Si Ronda'' was directed by [[Lie Tek Swie]] and produced by Tan Khoen Yauw of [[Tan's Film]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit Si Ronda}} The two had previously worked together on the company's highly profitable ''[[Njai Dasima (1929 film)|Njai Dasima]]'' in 1929.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=99‚Äì100}} [[Cinematography]] was handled by A. Loepias. Shot in black-and-white,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit Si Ronda}} this [[silent film]] starred [[Bachtiar Effendi]], a set decorator with Tan's, in his on-screen debut playing the title role.{{sfn|Said|1982|p=138}} It also featured Momo, an actor who had appeared in the film ''Njai Dasima''.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Momo}}

==Release and legacy==
[[File:Bachtiar Effendi p104.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bachtiar Effendi]], who played the title role in ''Si Ronda'']]
''Si Ronda'' was released in 1930;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Si Ronda}} Effendi stated that it was released before Tan's ''[[Nancy Bikin Pembalesan]]'' (''Nancy Takes Revenge''), a sequel to ''Njai Dasima'', began screening in May 1930.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=104‚Äì05}} Dutch newspapers indicate that it had screened in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]], by 1932.{{sfn|De Sumatra Post 1932, Kunst en Vermakelijkheden}} Biran writes that the film received little coverage; he notes that [[Sinematek Indonesia]] has no news clippings related to ''Si Ronda''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=104‚Äì05}}

After ''Si Ronda'', Lie and Tan collaborated on three further films.{{sfn|Said|1982|pp=142‚Äì43}} Lie left Tan's in 1932, reportedly as his approach no longer matched Tan's low-class target audience and caused the works to go over budget.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=111}} Effendi continued to work with Tan's until 1932, when he left to head the cinema magazine ''Doenia Film''.{{sfn|Said|1982|p=138}} Momo continued acting until 1941, first with Tan's and later with Standard Film.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Momo}} The film is likely [[lost film|lost]]. The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

Another film based on the Ronda stories, titled ''Si Ronda Macan Betawi'' (''Ronda the Betawi Tiger''), was released in 1978.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Si Ronda}} Directed by Fritz G. Schadt, it starred [[Dicky Zulkarnaen]] in the title role and Lenny Marlina as his lover. In this adaptation Ronda uses his ''silat'' skills to fight corrupt land owners and colonial government workers.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Si Ronda Macan Betawi}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56117">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''South Park'' controversies}}
''[[South Park]]'' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. Its frequent depiction of taboo subject matter, unusual (especially [[Sophomoric humor|Sophomoric]]) humor and portrayal of religion for comic effect has generated controversy and debate throughout the world over the course of its 22 seasons. Stone and Parker, who write the show, use the show frequently to lampoon [[Subject matter in South Park|a wide range of topics]] and both sides of contentious issues.

Parker and Stone usually reply to such controversies by regarding themselves as "equal opportunity offenders".&lt;ref name="whois"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |title=Who is Kyle Broslofski? |accessdate=2009-02-04 |author=Raphael, Rebecca |date=1998-05-22 |work=[[New Voices (magazine)|New Voices]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815135956/http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |archivedate=2012-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They reject the notion of [[political correctness]], and state that no particular topic or group of people will be exempt from mockery and satire, out of fairness to any person or group of people who have been ridiculed before.&lt;ref name="abc1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tapper, Jake|author2=Dan Morris|lastauthoramp=yes |  title=Secrets of 'South Park'| publisher=ABC News| date= 2006-09-22| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Entertainment/Story?id=2479197&amp;page=1| accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite news|first=William |last=Cohen |title=Respect Its Authoritah! |work=The Cornell American |date=2005-11-04 |url=http://www.cornellamerican.com/article/109/print/ |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100129195812/http://www.cornellamerican.com/article/109/print/ |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lowbrow"&gt;{{cite news | author=Lim, Dennis| title = Television: Lowbrow and proud of it  | publisher = independent.co.uk| date = 1998-03-29| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/television-lowbrow-and-proud-of-it-1153256.html| accessdate = 2009-05-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcfarland2"&gt;{{cite news|author=McFarland, Melanie| title= Oh my God, 'South Park' killed a decade!| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date= 2006-09-30|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/287052_southpark02.html| accessdate = 2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesconserv"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rich, Frank| title = Conservatives ‚ô• 'South Park' | work = The New York Times | date = 2005-05-01 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/opinion/01rich.html | accessdate = 2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cityjournal"&gt;{{cite news|author=Anderson, Brian C.| title = We‚Äôre Not Losing the Culture Wars Anymore| publisher = [[Manhattan Institute]]| year = 2003| url = http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_4_were_not_losing.html | accessdate = 2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating==
===United States===
In the [[United States]], South Park is mainly rated [[TV-MA]]: This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17. TV-MA: This program may contain one or more of the following: crude indecent language (L), strong sexual content (S), or graphic violence (V). To note, some episodes on syndication have been reclassified TV-14.
===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the first three seasons and some episodes in season 4, were rated [[Australian Classification Board|M]]: Recommended for mature audiences 15 years and over. The M rating is unrestricted and moderate in impact, and it is equivalent to America's TV-14 rating. The latter seasons are rated MA15+, which is a rating restricted for people over 15 years, and is strong in impact. Despite being rated M on television, the [[South Park (season 3)|season 3]] DVD set was the first season to receive an MA15+ rating. The consumer advice usually goes as follows; Adult themes (A), coarse language (L), sexual references (S) and/or animated violence (V). Depending on the rating, the terms "moderate" and "strong" precede these descriptions.
===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the show is generally rated [[BBFC|15]], until [[South Park (season 7)|season 7]] when it gets an 18 rating due to the audio commentaries (the episodes are only rated 15). However, some episodes, such as those in the first four seasons do have a 12 rating ([[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]). Furthermore, the [[South Park season 3|season 3]] DVD set was originally rated 18 in the UK, [[Canada]] and [[Ireland]], due to the content of the final episode, [[World Wide Recorder Concert]] (which contains references to [[child molestation]]). It was re-rated 15 in the UK upon its re-release in 2008, although in Ireland it is still rated 18, as a number of episodes in the latter seasons.
===Other countries===
In [[Canada]], most of the DVD sets have a 14A rating. [[South Park (season 9)|Season 9]] has an 18A rating though. [[South Park (season 4)|Season 4]] is the only season rated R13 in [[New Zealand]] and the first season is rated M, akin to Australia's rating. The rest of the seasons have a R16 rating. The television rating of the show in New Zealand is AO (adults only). In [[Spain]], the show is rated 18 (years and above).

''South Park'' was banned in [[India]]. According to [[VH1 India]]'s channel head Ferzad Palia, after being reviewed by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Indian Ministry of Broadcasting]], the show was banned for its vulgarity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/television/south-park-in-india-shuts-runs-into-trouble-in-us-too/article1-561421.aspx South Park in India shuts, runs into trouble in US too] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031151704/http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/television/south-park-in-india-shuts-runs-into-trouble-in-us-too/article1-561421.aspx |date=October 31, 2014 }}.

==Criticism and protests==
As the series first became popular in the [[United States]], several schools punished students for wearing ''South Park''-related T-shirts, while a group of school principals in [[New Jersey]] mounted a small campaign to notify parents of the show's content. [[Canton, Georgia#Education|Hickory Flat Elementary]] School in [[Cherokee County, Georgia]] issued a ban on wearing any ''South Park'' clothing.&lt;ref name="lowbrow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27699.html|title=Goin' Down to South Park: How kids can learn from 'vile trash'|date=May 2000|publisher=www.reason.com|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Fagin

This drew the concern of several parent councils, who were expecting that a children's television show character would top the list, and the headmaster of a [[Cambridgeshire]] public school urged parents to prevent their children from watching the show.&lt;ref name="bbcpoll"&gt;{{cite news | title = Cartman top with kids| publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 1999-08-26 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/430977.stm | accessdate = 2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker and Stone, who are not opposed to allowing kids to watch the show, assert however that the show is not meant to be viewed by kids, and the show is almost ''always'' rated TV-MA,&lt;ref name="nydailyratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mifflin"/&gt; while being accompanied by the following warning:
''"All characters and events in this show‚Äîeven those based on real people‚Äîare entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated... poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone."''

The conservative [[advocacy group]] [[Parents Television Council]] has frequently criticized ''South Park'' for "over-the-top vulgar content" and "tastelessness," condemning the show as a "curdled, malodorous black hole of Comedy Central vomit" that "shouldn't have been made."&lt;ref name ="Reconsidered"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozell |first=L.

[[Action for Children's Television]] founder [[Peggy Charren]] claimed that the show's use of language and racial slurs represents the depravity of Western civilization, and that it is "dangerous to the democracy."&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite news|author=David Horowitz |title=Why Gore would censor "South Park" |publisher=Salon.com |date=1999-07-19 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/07/19/south_park/index2.html |accessdate=2009-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121035850/http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/07/19/south_park/index2.html |archivedate=2009-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other Christian activist groups have protested the show's parodies of [[Christianity]]-related matter and portrayal of Jesus Christ‚Äîwhom ''South Park'' has depicted saying "Goddamn," shooting and stabbing other characters, and as unable to perform actual miracles.&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt; In its review of the ''South Park'' movie, the [[ChildCare Action Project]] stated that children who watch either the show or film would have their efforts to "understand or [develop] an understanding of the Gospel" hindered or corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://capalert.com/capreports/southpark.htm|title=ChildCare Action Project (CAP) Media Analysis Report |year=1999|publisher=capalert.com|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Carder|first=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Family Network]] prepared an educational guide on how to "protect our youth from vile trash like ''South Park''," and claims that their efforts to "restore morality, and protect life for the individual, family, and community" would be impeded if children watched the series.&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt;

Matt Stone insists that "[kids] don't have any kind of social tact or etiquette", and claims that parents who disapprove of ''South Park'' for its portrayal of how kids behave are upset because they "have an idyllic vision of what kids are like."&lt;ref name="lowbrow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcpoll"/&gt;

Several groups have called for a boycott of the show, its sponsors, and the networks that air it. For example, in late 2008, on behalf of Muslim activists and members of the [[Pentecostalism|Russian Pentecostalist Church]], a group of prosecutors in [[Moscow]] sought to have the Russian channel [[2x2 (TV channel)|2√ó2]] closed in an attempt to prevent them from broadcasting the series, which they claimed promoted "hatred between religions." Their appeal was rejected by Russian media officials, and the channel's broadcasting license was extended until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Holdsworth|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994318.html?categoryid=1050&amp;cs=1|title=Russia's 2X2 wins license renewal|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2008-10-20|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL869731820080908?sp=true

A Canadian judge in the [[Judicial District|Calgary Judicial District]] has described ''South Park'' as a "vulgar, socially irreverent program that contributes nothing to society."

==Vulgarity and depiction of racism==
The show further lampooned the controversy surrounding its use of profanity, as well as the media attention surrounding the network show ''[[Chicago Hope]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; single use of the word "shit," with the [[South Park (season 5)|season five]] premiere "[[It Hits the Fan]]".&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite we|url=http://www.miamipoetryreview.com/2006/07/south-park-insight200706.html|title=Why South Park Is The Most Liberated Show On Television|date=2006-07-20|publisher=www.miamipoetryreview.com|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Warren |first=Mitchell|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013113107/http://www.miamipoetryreview.com/2006/07/south-park-insight200706.html|archivedate=2009-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTC also criticized the show for its excessive use of the racial epithet "[[nigger]]" in the [[South Park (season 11)|season 11]] (2007) premiere "[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]."&lt;ref name="anti imus lobby"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozell|first=L.

==Parody of Scientology==

''South Park'' parodied [[Scientology]] in a short that aired as part of the [[2000 MTV Movie Awards]].

===Departure of Isaac Hayes===
{{Wikinews|Isaac Hayes quits South Park over Scientology episode}}
On March 13, 2006, nearly two months after suffering a [[stroke]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/MYSA102706_WK_hayes_1db37cb_html7971.html Hayes has put stroke, 'South Park' behind him] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720002541/http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/MYSA102706_WK_hayes_1db37cb_html7971.html |date=2009-07-20 }}, MySanAntonio.com, October 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Hayes]], the voice of the character [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]], quit ''South Park''. A press release cited his objections to the show's attitudes toward and depiction of various religions. While the press release did not specifically mention "Trapped in the Closet," Parker and Stone assert that he quit because of the episode and its treatment of Scientology, as Hayes was a member. Stone commented that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on ''South Park'': "[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we [lampooned] Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2006/03/13/entertainment/e133318S62.DTL |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210230645/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2006%2F03%2F13%2Fentertainment%2Fe133318S62.DTL |archivedate=February 10, 2009 |title=Isaac Hayes Quits 'South Park,' |website=web.archive.org and www.sfgate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]] suggested that, because he was still suffering from the effects of his stroke, Hayes was hospitalized and not in a position to make a rational decision to leave the show.&lt;ref name="Friedman-March2006"/&gt; Fox also reported that Hayes left the show because of pressure from fellow Scientologists and that the decision was not voluntary, noting that Hayes had previously defended the episode after an amicable discussion with Parker and Stone about its content.

The [[South Park (season 10)|season 10]] episodes "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]" and "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]" feature a plot in which the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] plans to air an episode of the animated show ''[[Family Guy]]'' that contains an uncensored cartoon depiction of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. Residents of South Park panic, fearing a terrorist response and a repeat of the real-life violent protests and riots that occurred worldwide after some Muslims regarded Muhammad's cartoon depiction in a [[Denmark|Danish]] newspaper as insulting and blasphemous. The first episode had a cliffhanger ending instructing viewers to watch part two to find out whether the image of Muhammad would be shown uncensored. In the second episode, Kyle persuades a Fox executive to air the ''Family Guy'' with the image uncensored, while echoing Parker and Stone's sentiments regarding what should or should not be censored of "[either] it's got to all be OK or none of it is".&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt; Within the universe of the episode, the ''Family Guy'' episode is aired uncensored, despite a retaliation threat from [[Al-Qaeda]]. However, the actual ''South Park'' broadcast itself ran a black screen that read "Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Mohammed on their network" instead of the scene containing Muhammad's depiction, which Parker and Stone say was neutral and not intended to insult Muslims.&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miami"/&gt;

Parker and Stone note the contradiction in being allowed to feature a profane depiction of [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]], while being forbidden to feature a purely benign depiction of Muhammad, but claim they harbor no hard feelings toward Comedy Central for censoring the scene, since the network confessed to being "afraid of getting blown up" rather than claim 'religious tolerance' like other networks.&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="odoherty"/&gt; Parker and Stone claim the only regrets they have over the incident was that their mocking of the show ''Family Guy'' in the episode generated more attention than its commentary on the ethics of censorship.&lt;ref name="growsup2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jaime J. Weinman |title=South Park grows up |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20080312_115131_115131&amp;page=2 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802210052/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20080312_115131_115131&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2009-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Muhammad was depicted uncensored and portrayed in a heroic light in the [[South Park (season 5)|season five]] (2001) episode "[[Super Best Friends]]", which resulted in virtually no controversy.&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt; Muhammad also appears among the large crowd of characters gathered behind the main characters and "South Park" sign in some of the show's previous opening sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = South Park's been showing Muhammad all season! | url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season|author= Ryan J. Budke|date=2006-04-15|publisher= TVSquad.com|accessdate=2009-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker and Stone repeated this plot for the 200th episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]".  Again, the depiction was censored throughout the episode. After the episode aired, a leader of [[Revolution Muslim]], an obscure New York-based radical Muslim organization, targeted ''South Park''‚Äôs creators for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of Muhammad. The author of the post, who goes by the username Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee, wrote on Twitter that he prayed for Allah to kill the show‚Äôs creators and ‚Äúburn them in Hell for all eternity.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League: [http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/revolution_muslim.htm?Multi_page_sections=sHeading_1 ‚ÄúBackgrounder: Revolution Muslim‚Äù] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203095005/http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/revolution_muslim.htm?Multi_page_sections=sHeading_1 |date=2010-12-03 }} April 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  He also posted a similar entry on his blog and on the Revolution Muslim website. The post included a picture of the assassination of Dutch filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo Van Gogh]] by a Muslim extremist in 2004 with the caption: "Theo Van Gogh ‚Äì Have [[Matt Stone]] And [[Trey Parker]] Forgotten This?" He also noted: "We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh if they do air this show."&lt;ref name="adl.org"/&gt;

Following the airing of this episode, Malaysia's conservative Islamic [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]] party demanded that the makers of the satirical cartoon sitcom ''South Park'' apologize to Muslims around the world for its portrayal of Muhammad dressed as a bear, though it was later shown that it was actually Santa inside the suit. "Even though they have added the audio bleeps, ''South Park'''s producer and broadcaster should apologize to the Muslims, as this is a sensitive issue," said PAS vice-president [[Mahfuz Omar]]. "The show itself spells of bad intention, and the depiction of the Prophet is provocative. It creates religious tension."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/Malaysian_Islamists_want_apology_from_South_Park_P108414/ Malaysian Islamists want apology from "South Park" ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708011903/http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/Malaysian_Islamists_want_apology_from_South_Park_P108414/ |date=2012-07-08 }}". ''forum.bcdb.com'', April 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The following episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" censored the word "Muhammad" throughout the episode, as well as several lines from the "Super Best Friends" during the final act. According to the South Park Studios webpage, episode "201" was censored by Comedy Central after the studio delivered the episode, but before it was aired. The studio advises that the episode is not available online because they do not have network clearance to air the uncensored episode.

Due to the controversies, the episode "201" was removed from the British Comedy Central TV schedule, and replaced with a repeat of "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs," and the repeat of "200" was replaced with a repeat of "Sexual Healing". The episode "Super Best Friends", previously available via the South Park Studios website has been made unavailable. Additionally, the Netflix streaming version of the episode, also previously available, has been changed to "Disc Only".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/04/puss-tv-update-2.html | author=Andrew Sullivan | title=Puss TV Update ‚Äì The Daily Dish | date=2010-04-24 | accessdate=2010-04-24 | publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Super Best Friends" was also removed from the [[iTunes Store]] as well as the [[Xbox Live]] Video Marketplace.

Despite the controversies, "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" are available on the Region 1 release of "South Park ‚Äì The Complete Fourteenth Season" disc. The episodes were censored and so were the commentaries regarding the episodes.
The Region 2 and 4 releases of "South Park ‚Äì The Complete Fourteenth Season" had both "200" and "201" removed for undisclosed reasons, despite the packaging claiming that all fourteen episodes are included in the set. In the chalkboard gag of [[The Simpsons]] episode, "[[The Squirt and the Whale]]", Bart pokes fun at the death threats Parker and Stone received by writing "South Park, We'd Stand Beside You If We Weren't So Scared."  

All this being said, in some South Park season intros, Muhammad can be seen uncensored.

==Depiction of Steve Irwin==
{{main|Hell on Earth 2006}}
Several viewers criticized the [[South Park (season 10)|season 10]] (2006) episode "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" for its depiction of [[Steve Irwin]] with a [[stingray]] stuck in his chest.&lt;ref name="odoherty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/how-kenny-survived-10-years-of-south-park-68126.html|title=How Kenny survived 10 years of South Park|date=2006-11-10
|publisher=www.independent.ie|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=O'Doherty|first=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The episode originally aired seven weeks after Irwin, an internationally popular Australian TV personality and wildlife expert, died when his heart was pierced by a stingray barb. Several groups and even devout fans of the show derided the scene and its timing as "grossly insensitive" and "classless", while Irwin's widow [[Terri Irwin]] expressed concern that her children could one day see the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To hell with Irwin, says South Park|publisher=''[[The Herald Sun]]''|author1=Kent, Paul  |author2=Gee, Steve |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006-10-28|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20658735-661,00.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-412911/Oh-god-South-Park-mocks-Irwin.html|publisher=''[[The Daily Mail]]''|title=Oh my god, South Park mocks Irwin|author=Staff|date=2006-10-27|accessdate=2009-01-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6093802.stm|title=South Park defends Irwin sketch |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|author=Staff|date=2006-10-28|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="entertainmentwise"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=24176|title=Steve Irwin's Wife "Devastated" By ''South Park'' Lampooning|publisher=''Entertainment Wise''|author=Taylor, Chris|date=2006-10-29|accessdate=2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexican flag==
{{main|Pinewood Derby (South Park)}}
In the 2009 episode "[[Pinewood Derby (South Park)|Pinewood Derby]]" several world leaders were depicted, including Mexican President [[Felipe Calder√≥n]], failing to successfully deal with an international crisis. [[MTV]] withdrew the episode in Mexico causing controversy amongst [[Mexico]]'s ''South Park'' fans who felt it was censorship; MTV denied this, claiming they had just failed to get permission in time to show the Mexican flag on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MTV under fire as it pulls South Park episode in Mexico|publisher=''[[BBC]]''|date=2010-02-10|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8507514.stm|accessdate=2010-02-10 | first=Julian | last=Miglierini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Paris attacks==
{{main|Sponsored Content (South Park)}}
[[Comedy Central (Netherlands)]] chose temporarily not to broadcast some scenes from several shows following the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]]. While no specifics were given, it included a scene in the 2015 episode "[[Sponsored Content (South Park)|Sponsored Content]]" where presidential candidate Mr. Garrison states that he knows there is only one way how to deal with Syrian refugees, and the crowd shouts "fuck them all to death".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nu.nl/media/4170891/comedy-central-schrapt-scene-south-park-aanslagen-parijs.html Comedy Central schrapt sc√®ne South Park na aanslagen Parijs], Nu.nl, 24 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smart.pr/viacom/reactie-comedy-central-south-park-scene Reactie Comedy Central South Park sc√®ne], 24 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dumpert.nl/embed/6698462/a61bfe4e/ Broadcast with and without the scene], dumpert.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies not related to the show's content==

===April Fools prank===
{{main|Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus}}
One of Parker and Stone's earliest responses to the show being condemned as "nothing but bad animation and fart jokes" was creating a show-within-the-show about two even-more-crudely-drawn characters named [[Terrance and Phillip]] who do little else but [[fart|pass gas]] around each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = South Park Studios Chat with Matt and Trey | publisher = spscriptorium.com | date =2001-05-10 | url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/SPinfo/010510SPStudiosChatWithMattAndTrey.htm| accessdate = 2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The child characters on the show find Terrance and Phillip, who debuted in the [[South Park (season 1)|season one]] (1997) episode "[[Death (South Park)|Death]]", to be hysterical, while their parents find them to be horribly offensive.&lt;ref name="tvamerica"&gt;{{cite news| author = Randy Fallows| title = The Theology of South Park| publisher = The Institute for the Study of American Popular Culture| date = January 2002| url = http://www.americanpopularculture.com/archive/tv/theology_southpark.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus|entire episode]] featuring the duo aired on April 1, 1998. It was broadcast in lieu of an episode that was supposed to continue from the show's previous episode from four weeks earlier, which ended with a cliffhanger promising to reveal the identity of Cartman's father in the show's next airing. Several fans were angered by the [[April Fools' Day]] prank, and Comedy Central received thousands of e-mail complaints. Comedy Central moved the planned air date of the next show up a month, so that fans could sooner watch the actual show they originally expected to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/not-eternity-cartman-paternity-article-1.792738|title=NOT AN ETERNITY TO CARTMAN PATERNITY
|date=1998-04-09|publisher=www.nydailynews.com|accessdate=2009-05-24|last=Huff|first=Richard | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Moore===
[[Michael Moore]] interviewed Matt Stone for his 2002 film ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]''. Stone discussed his experiences growing up in the [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] area and the social alienation that might have contributed to the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Stone, who is a gun-owner himself, said that Moore's presentation of their interview was fair, but he criticized the director for a short animated segment that followed the interview. The cartoon, which is about the history of guns in the United States, implies that there is a connection between the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the establishment of the [[National Rifle Association]]. Matt Stone, who did not have anything to do with that short cartoon, criticized Moore for making the cartoon "very South Park-esque" and argued that Moore deliberately sought to give viewers the incorrect impression that he and Trey Parker had produced the animation, by playing these two completely separate segments consecutively. "We have a very specific beef with Michael Moore. I did an interview, and he didn't mischaracterize me or anything I said in the movie. But what he did do was put this cartoon right after me that made it look like we did that cartoon."&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6228221/ 'Team America' takes on moviegoers] msnbc.com, October 15, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone called it "a good reference to what Michael Moore does in films [...] he creates meaning where there is none by cutting things together."&lt;ref name=indie&gt;"[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/film/team_america_stoneQ&amp;A.html Team America: World Police ‚Äì Matt Stone Q&amp;A]." ''IndieLondon''&lt;/ref&gt; The pair responded by depicting Moore in an unflattering light before having his character [[Suicide bombing|blow himself up]] in their 2004 film ''[[Team America: World Police]]''.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt;

'''Storygraph''' is the term of storytelling format which was introduced by [[Rio Haminoto]]. Writings are combined with illustrations as reflections of story and also accompanied with soundtrack consisting of several songs. His first storygraph was titled as Don Joviano. it was published in 1998, about an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafioso]] in [[New York City]] who happens to be half [[Indonesia]]n.  In 2010, Rio became the writer of [[Catatan Si Boy]] in storygraph format. First presented as radio show in the 1980s (Prambors Radio), Catatan Si Boy became a motion picture with 5 sequels. This storygraph of Rio's was filmed in the new version of Catatan Si Boy named Catatan Harian Si Boy which was released in 2011. The first storygraph of Catatan Si Boy was auctioned for IDR 3.5 Million.

'''The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment''' ('''UKIE''') is a non-profit [[trade association]] for the [[video game industry]] in the United Kingdom (UK). UKIE was originally founded as the European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), and then later Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), before changing to UKIE in 2010.

==History==
The association was founded in 1989, though then named as the European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA). Around 2002, the organisation changed its name to Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, reflecting that their primary concerns were video game development on the United Kingdom islands and not mainland Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolf |first=Mark |date=2008 |title=The Video Game Explosion: A History from PONG to Playstation and Beyond |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=208 |isbn=9780313338687 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2010, members of the ELSPA voted to rename the association as UKIE, reflecting "the evolving and expanding nature of the industry, which the association exists to represent, and to encompass the new areas of activity that will be undertaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/elspa-to-become-uk-interactive-entertainment-association-678228 | title = ELSPA to become UK Interactive Entertainment Association | first = Patrick | last = Goss | date = 19 March 2010 | accessdate = 5 March 2018 | work = [[TechRadar]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was fully changed by September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2010-09-07-elspa-relaunches-as-ukie | title=ELSPA relaunches as UKIE | work=[[Gamesindustry.biz]] | first=Phil | last=Elliott | date=7 September 2010 | accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, UKIE proposed a merger with [[The Independent Game Developers' Association]] (TIGA), a UK trade association for video game developers, to consolidate the two organisations under one trade body to represent the entire UK games industry.&lt;ref name="tiga_merge"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mcvuk.com/business/ukie-deeply-disappointed-tiga-ruled-out-merger | title=UKIE 'deeply disappointed' Tiga ruled out merger | work=[[The Market for Computer &amp; Video Games|MCV]] | date=3 March 2011 | accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However TIGA's board rejected the proposal.&lt;ref name="tiga_merge" /&gt; TIGA's stance remained unchanged when a merger proposal was raised once again in 2013.&lt;ref name="tiga_stance"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development/tiga-stance-unchanged-amidst-ukie-merger-talk | title=Tiga stance unchanged amidst UKIE merger talk | work=[[The Market for Computer &amp; Video Games|MCV]] | first=Craig | last=Chapple | date=4 October 2013 | accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
UKIE's primary goal is to represent the UK's video game industry, and as of December 2017, represented over 395 video game companies worldwide.&lt;ref name="2017joiners"&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-12-14-criterion-naturalmotion-team-17-and-more-join-ukie | title = Criterion, NaturalMotion, Team 17 and more join UKIE | publisher = UKIE | date = 14 December 2017 | accessdate=  5 March 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association provides strategy and advice for developers and publishers, collects and publishes retail date for UK video game sales, and lobbies and meets with members of the government to help establish policy related to video games.

One of its more notable activities was to help petition the UK government to use the [[Pan European Game Information]] (PEGI) rating system rather than the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC). Prior to 2012, video games were exempted from being required to be rated by BBFC, unless they contained sexual content, nudity, or violence, though developers and publishers could voluntarily submit their works for review. Works that exceeded certain ratings could not be legally sold to minors. The ELSPA worked with the [[Video Standards Council]] (VSC), a government organization that was created to form a code of practice for how to inform consumers about content ratings in games and other video formats. ELSPA had recommended that as an industry standard, any game not needing classification by BBFC to be otherwise classified under the PEGI system, with the VSC helping to determine appropriating ratings.&lt;ref name="pegi Byron"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7533462.stm | title = Row over video games ratings plan | date = 31 July 2008 | accessdate=  5 March 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, [[Tanya Byron|Dr. Tanya Byron]] published a report commissioned by Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], colloquially called the [[Byron Review]], describing potentially harmful effects of video games on children, a debate over how to better label video games arose, and recommended that parents need to be given more information than the BBFC's rating alone.&lt;ref name="pegi Byron"/&gt; ELSPA along with other concerned groups believed that the BBFC lacked the clarity needed for video game ratings; current CEO Mike Rawlinson also said that the BBFC ratings were developed for linear content, while PEGI's were better reflective of interactive content such as video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/interview-elspa-boss-explains-pegi-age-ratings-610158 | title = Interview: ELSPA boss explains PEGI age ratings | first=  Adam | last = Hartley | date = 23 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 March 2018 | work = [[TechRadar]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ELSPA started a large push to getting PEGI as the approved system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7496327.stm | title = Divide on games industry ratings | first = Darren | last = Waters | date  = 8 July 2009 | accessdate = 5 March 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the interim petitioning the BBFC to color-code its ratings labels to approach the same color-coding used by PEGI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7692966.stm | title = Games ratings row gets colourful | date = 28 October 2008 | accessdate = 5 March 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Parliament passed the [[Digital Economy Act 2010]] into law, and required by July 2012 to transfer the rating of video games from BBFC to the VSC (outside of games that contain strong pornographic content) and officially adapting the PEGI rating system, along with legal enforcement of selling mature titles to minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19042908 | title = UK enforces Pegi video game ratings system | date=  30 July 2012 | accessdate = 5 March 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The associate continued to work with the VSC to help establish how the PEGI rating should be displayed on packaging and other materials, and provide awareness to consumers and parents of the new change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18017385 | title = Video Standards Council to take over games age ratings | date = 10 May 2012 | accessdate = 5 March 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UKIE has campaigned and lobbied for the availability of [[tax relief]] for the UK games sector for many years.&lt;ref name="taxrelief2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-03-27-eu-approves-uk-games-tax-relief-signalling-188m-windfall | title=EU approves UK games tax relief, signalling ¬£188m windfall | work=[[Gamesindustry.biz]] | first=Dan | last=Pearson | date=27 March 2014 | accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, they offered recommendations to the government consultations based on responses and opinions from over 200 video games companies in the country.&lt;ref name="taxrecommendations"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-09-10-ukie-makes-tax-relief-recommendations | title=UKIE makes tax relief recommendations | work=[[Gamesindustry.biz]] | first=Rachel | last=Weber | date=10 September 2012 | accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tax incentive scheme was scheduled to be included in the [[March 2010 United Kingdom budget]] by the outgoing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]], however it was not finalised and introduced until 2014 when the [[European Commission]] approved the decision.&lt;ref name="taxrelief2014" /&gt; The tax relief scheme allows video games developers and companies to claim back up to 20% of their production costs if the project meets certain conditions,&lt;ref name="taxrelief2017"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-11-02-uk-games-tax-relief-extended-to-2023 | title=UK games tax relief extended to 2023 | work=[[Gamesindustry.biz]] | first=James | last=Batchelor | date=2 November 2017 | accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an estimated ¬£188 million per year for the UK games industry.&lt;ref name="taxrelief2014" /&gt; In 2017, the European Commission granted an extension to the scheme for another six years until 2023.&lt;ref name="taxrelief2017" /&gt;

'''''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre''''' is a [[video game]], based on the [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|film of the same name]],  released in March of [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] by [[Wizard Video|Wizard Video Games]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariage.com/company_page.html?SystemID=2600&amp;CompanyID=42 About Wizard Video] from [[AtariAge]]&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Atari 2600]].&lt;ref name="AA"&gt; 
[http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=556 ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre''] on AtariAge&lt;/ref&gt; The game was designed and programmed by VSS, a software development company started by Ed Salvo and several other ex-Apollo programmers.

==Publication==
In 1982, a mass-market [[video game]] adaptation of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' was released for the [[Atari 2600]] by [[Wizard Video]].&lt;ref name="TCMGame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/atari2600/action/texaschainsawmassacre/index.html|title=''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' Atari game|accessdate=2008-06-01|publisher=GameSpot|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201142130/http://uk.gamespot.com/atari2600/action/texaschainsawmassacre/index.html|archivedate=2009-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
In the game, the player takes on the role of the movie's [[chainsaw]]-wielding villain, [[Leatherface]],&lt;ref name="ign-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/30/ign-presents-the-history-of-survival-horror|title=IGN Presents the History of Survival Horror|last=Fahs|first=Travis|work=[[IGN]]|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences, wheelchairs, and cow skulls.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&amp;sql=1:9317 ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre''] on AllGameGuide&lt;/ref&gt; The player controls the murderer with the objective to chase and kill victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=D.S.|title=Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the Atari 2600 ‚Äì The First Slasher Video Game|url=http://classicgames.about.com/od/consoleandhandheldgames/a/TCMAtari2600.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each victim slain gives the player 1,000 points. The player receives additional fuel at every 5,000 points (5 victims). A life is lost when the player's chainsaw runs out of gasoline. Gameplay ends when the last tank of gas is consumed.

==Controversy==
As one of the first horror-themed video games, ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' caused controversy when it was released due to the violent nature of the video game and sold poorly as many video game stores refused to carry it.&lt;ref name="TCMGame"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bavatuesdays.com/classic-horror-movies-on-the-atari-2600/|title=Classic horror movies on the Atari 2600|accessdate=2008-07-08|publisher=BavaTuesdays.com|date=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was poorly received due to its lackluster gameplay, and suffered low sales due to many game stores refusing to carry it.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; Wizard's other commercial release, ''[[Halloween (video game)|Halloween]]'', had a similar reception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roguecinema.com/article241.html|title=Halloween for the Atari 2600|accessdate=2008-07-11|publisher=Rogue Cinema|date=April 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the limited number of copies sold have made them both highly valued items amongst [[Atari]] collectors. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.digitpress.com/DP/cmf/game.cmf?gameid=24388 ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre''] on [[Digital Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76865">'''Toa''' are a fictional species of [[cyborg]] warriors and the primary protagonists of the [[Lego]] toy series [[Bionicle]]. Constructible Lego sets depicting Toa were marketed as the main toys of the franchise and released regularly throughout its tenure.

In the theme's original story (Generation 1), the Toa are heroic beings - usually depicted in teams of six - whose duty is to protect their villager counterparts, the Matoran, from danger and maintain peace throughout their universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Bionicle Encyclopedia, 2nd edition''. Scholastic/Lego 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Matoran are destined to become Toa after their dormant Toa Power is activated. Once they have completed their destiny, a Toa can choose to sacrifice their power and transform into Turaga, elders who typically governs Matoran. Each Toa represents an [[Classical elements|element]] and has the ability to create, manipulate and absorb it, for which they normally use a set of a tools to channel. Each also wear a [[List of Kanohi|Kanohi]], a mask that grants them specific powers.

In the theme's rebooted story (Generation 2), the premise is similar. The Toa are six element-powered heroes who are summoned to the island of Okoto to save the inhabitants from the schemes of Makuta and his minions. Each Toa wears a Great Mask of Power that amplifies their elemental energy and carry tools to channel it.

==Production==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
The first Bionicle sets created and released were six Toa characters, later known as the Toa Mata. The warrior-like appearance of the toys was believed to be to restricting by some [[Lego]] "company traditionalists" because it went against Lego's values of "high-quality products that have an emphasis on free play and encouraging the imagination, and not modern warfare or violence." &lt;ref name=conception&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/apr/29/shopping.toys|title=Building blocks for the future|accessdate=29 December 2009 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=29 April 2004 | first=Rupert | last=Widdicombe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional history==
Toa have been around for most of the Bionicle universe's existence, devised by the Great Beings to serve as heroes for the Matoran, and fulfill dangerous tasks that would ensure the workers could continue to fulfill their duties. These tasks could range from rescuing Matoran from Rahi attacks, to engaging in war to defend territories and prevent enslavement, and in some cases ensure the survival of the Great Spirit Mata Nui. The first Toa to come into existence was Helryx, a Toa of Water. She assisted with the construction of Metru Nui. Shortly before Mata Nui was brought to life, the Toa Mata were created, trained and placed in hibernation inside Karda Nui, ready to awaken the Great Spirit should he ever fall into a coma. After Mata Nui became active, destined Matoran were transformed into Toa through the use of Toa Stones. This was the process by which most Toa came into being, with the Toa Mata and Helryx soon becoming exceptions rather than the standard.

Over time, the number of Toa grew greatly, with some giving up their powers to become Turaga, allowing other Matoran to take their place. Most joined teams and fought against Dark Hunters and Rahi; death in such conflicts was a regular occurrence. Those who served with distinction were chosen as bodyguards for the Brotherhood of Makuta, taking the name Toa Hagah. When the team assigned to Makuta Teridax discovered his plan to depose Mata Nui and began a rebellion, they were mutated by his lieutenants and became outcasts, while the other teams were swiftly eliminated or corrupted. Following the Great Cataclysm in which the Brotherhood's evil became common knowledge, Toa became fugitives, and their numbers reduced drastically, with some elements like Iron and Magnetism suffering particularly heavy persecution due to the danger they posed to Makuta.

Toa are bound to adhere to the Toa Code, a set of ethics not fully detailed in the story. The most important aspect of this code is not to commit murder; killing is only permitted in self-defense or the defense of an innocent's life. While Toa are almost always heroes, some do not adhere to the code: Helryx does not due to being created before the existence of the code, Lesovikk does not consider himself worthy of the title of Toa, and there are traitors who simply ignore it. Throughout the disastrous takeover by [[Teridax|Makuta Teridax]], the main antagonist of the Bionicle saga, the Toa continued to operate, albeit in hiding. After Teridax's defeat at the hands of Mata Nui, the Toa migrated to the newly reformed Spherus Magna along with all the other Matoran Universe residents, who could now speak the Agori language.

There were once as many as 3,000 Toa in existence, but after many centuries of war, murder and Toa Power sacrifice, their numbers diminished to near as 40.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bzpower.com/board/topic/10845-which-matoran-would-you-like-to-see-as-a-toa/page-3#entry654980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Toa teams==

===Toa Mata/Toa Nuva===
The chosen guardians of the Great Spirit Mata Nui, destined to awaken him if he would ever fall. They were known as the '''Toa Mata''', six Toa warriors. In Matoran, "Toa Mata" literally means "Spirit heroes" or "Heroes of the Spirit." Their eventual summoning failed to deliver them to the island of Mata Nui immediately, and left them drifting in the ocean for a millennium. When they finally arrived on the island, they had forgotten all but their names, and had to be informed of their quest by the Turaga. Despite regular disagreement about their next course of action, they learned to work together to achieve their duty, and were able to end the Rahi threat to the Matoran by defeating Makuta temporarily, and later fought the Bohrok and Rahkshi with the same success.
 
After their transformation in Energized Protodermis, they became the '''Toa Nuva''', with increased strength and improved armor, weaponry, and masks. They then added the suffix "Nuva" (meaning "New") to their name and masks. Their new powers did not come without risk; their command of the elements was tied to artifacts known as Nuva Symbols. They learned this when the Bohrok-Kal targeted and stole the Symbols, which made their powers desert them. The Toa Nuva would later hide these symbols at locations known only to themselves to prevent such a disaster occurring again.

After donning Artakha's Adaptive Armor, they were able to master any environment with its ability to adapt to the current situation. After being teleported to Karda Nui, Tahu, Gali, and Onua dispatched themselves to the Swamp of Secrets, while Lewa, Kopaka and Pohatu remained in the skies and stalactite villages to rescue the local Av-Matoran. After using legendary Keystones to power the Codrex dome, Energy Storms raged throughout Karda Nui, killing every Makuta there (save those who had already fallen in battle). The storms confirmed that they succeeded in their ultimate quest to awaken Mata Nui, unaware that Makuta Teridax had taken over his body. They would lead a resistance movement against their archenemy during the months of his reign. After Spherus Magna's reformation, Tahu's transformation, and Mata Nui's last wish (to find the Great Beings), the team has currently split up to fulfill different missions.

In their time on Karda Nui, Tahu's team was known as the '''Mistika''', in the Matoran language translating to "spirits of the mist", with their armor adapting to a swamp environment with aerial capabilities armed with Nynrah Ghost Blasters. Kopaka's team also received a Matoran term, "spirits of the sky", or '''Phantoka''', armed with Midak Skyblasters.

In the 2015 reboot new versions of the Toa Mata appear, mostly retaining their respective elements (only the "Air" element has changed, being replaced with "Jungle"). After awakening Ekimu and helping reclaim his Mask of Creation, the Mask Maker forges new armor for the Toa, which gives them the ability to "Unify" with Elemental Creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lego.com/en-us/bionicle/explore/unity/chapter0|title=Chapter 0 - Unity - Explore - Bionicle LEGO.com|website=www.lego.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; With aid from Ekimu, they battle Umarak the Hunter, a minion of Makuta's, who steals the Mask of Control and is transformed into a horrifying beast upon putting it on. Stealing the pieces of the Mask of Ultimate Power, he attempts to bring Makuta back from the Shadow Realm and into the main reality. Ultimately, the Toa fulfill their destiny and manage to reimprison Makuta before returning to the stars from whence they came.

The Toa of Fire and the leader of the Toa, Tahu initially demanded fierce loyalty to his command, discarding others' own opinions and ignoring them altogether, plunging them into dangerous tasks. Although the team acknowledged him as a leader, they did not respect him. His aggression after arriving on Mata Nui was easily brought to the surface, causing him to almost drive himself to madness with the burdens of his amnesia. He eventually managed to control his anger, gaining the respect of his comrades, even the Toa of Ice, Kopaka, whom he constantly clashed with.

Toa Mata Tahu's weapons included a Kanohi Hau, the Mask of Shielding, which could protect him from oncoming attacks, but not ambushes. He also carried a Fire Sword to channel his Fire element. Like his fellow Toa Mata, he collected five other Kanohi and went to Kini-Nui for a Golden Kanohi, containing the powers of the Kanohi Hau, Akaku (X-Ray Vision), Kaukau (Underwater Breathing), Miru (Levitation), Kakama (Speed), and Pakari (Strength). Tahu's appearance in this form is dominantly red with orange legs and arms.

Toa Nuva Tahu's weapons included a Kanohi Hau Nuva, the Nuva Mask of Shielding, which allowed him to protect not just himself, but others around him. His Fire Sword transformed into two Magma Swords, which served to channel his Fire element or be put together to make a lavaboard. He collected five Kanohi Nuva to store at Ta-Suva, but were lost when Ta-Koro sank after a Rahkshi attack. Tahu's Nuva appearance slightly unchanged from his Toa Mata form, but bared silver shoulder and chest armor.

Once he gained Adaptive Armor, his armor shifted in the Swamp of Secrets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetoyshop.com/media/toyshop/products/Lego/zoom/344150.jpg |accessdate=28 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717040615/http://www.thetoyshop.com/media/toyshop/products/Lego/zoom/344150.jpg |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gaining a Nynrah Ghost Blaster, and Rotating Blades which could also serve as a shield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/mistika/ToaTahu.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123110314/http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/mistika/ToaTahu.aspx |date=23 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also carried a Nynrah Ghostblaster, which fired energy which could be manipulated mentally.

After arriving on Bara Magna, he was devolved into a crude version of his Toa Mata self by the Ignika in order to wield the Golden Armor, as the armor was designed to be wielded by his Mata form, not his Nuva form. As such, his adaptive weapon has taken the form of his old Fire Sword. Soon after, he was clad in Golden Armor and destroyed all the Kraata controlling the Rahkshi, which interrupted Makuta Teridax's concentration and gave Mata Nui his only chance to defeat the tyrant. After Mata Nui's victory, he helped lead the inhabitants of the reformed Spherus Magna, the original "paradise." Having assumed the powers of all the Kraata the armour destroyed, he is now the most powerful Toa in existence.

In the 2015 rebooted series, Tahu is characterized with a forgetful nature, an undying sense of luck, and a drive to be the best of his team, but he retains his original temper.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lego.com/en-us/bionicle/characters/tahu-master-of-fire-69e2277efc454e4cb147feefa5025fe2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toa of Air, Lewa is often eager to face his Toa responsibilities with carelessness, considering the entire ordeal of a fight as an "adventure." Cheery and light-hearted, he has no bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bionicle/images/8/8a/Lewa.jpg|title=Lewa|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikia|publisher=Wikia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He naturally speaks in the "treespeak" dialect native to Le-Koro, and prefers dense jungle areas as his home. After briefly being controlled by both Makuta Teridax (after his Mask was infected by an infected Rahi, then rescued by Onua) and a Bohrok krana, he learned not to take his urgent role so lightly, his will renewed to never again underestimate threats. After Teridax took over the universe, Lewa was transported to Tren Krom's island, who switched bodies with him in order to save their universe. Though their spirits were switched back by Arthaka, he was recently expelled into space along with everyone else in the Core Processor. He is currently on Bota Magna thanks to a dimension-hopping Vezon.

Lewa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/theworldofbionicle/lewa_nuva.jpg |title=Lewa Nuva |publisher=Freewebs.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is armed with the Kanohi Miru, Mask of Levitation, which allows him to glide or hover in the air; the Nuva version allowing him to share this ability with others. As a Toa Mata, he was armed with an Axe, later transformed into a pair of Air Katana, which when put under his arms could also help him glide or soar in conjunction with his Kanohi. As a Phantoka, he is armed with an Air Saber, and a Midak Skyblaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/phantoka/Lewa%20Nuva.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206112652/http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/phantoka/Lewa%20Nuva.aspx |date=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on the journey of Karda Nui,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jaller154.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/toa-lewa-phantoka1.jpg |title=Lewa Phantoka |publisher=Jaller154.files.wordpress.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discovers the Axalara T9, and pilots it against Makuta Antroz in the Jetrax T6, though this vehicle was later teleported back to Karda Nui following Mata Nui's reawakening.

In the 2015 rebooted series, Lewa's element is now "Jungle" instead of "Air." He is portrayed as a rebellious, cunning, and sarcastic Toa, whose carelessness and out-of-the-box thinking can lead to trouble with his teammates, but can also help to solve situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lego.com/en-us/bionicle/characters/lewa-master-of-jungle-06773a35a8654a10a79d949f24aa33d6&lt;/ref&gt;  As a Uniter, he is depicted similarly, but his speech is often ungrammatical.

The Toa of Water, Gali is calm and extraordinarily wise. Seeking to contain Tahu's aggression and protect the unity of the Toa, she takes her role as a Toa with the utmost importance, and is willing to protect any sentient being threatened by the evils of the Brotherhood of Makuta. Considering her peaceful lifestyle, she is an accomplished warrior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archimatrix.com/Bionicle7/images/Gali_big.jpg |title=Gali |publisher=Archimatrix.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; against those who threaten her allies, like the amphibious rahi that dwell near Ga-Koro. Her concern for Tahu greatens in the 2003 "Mask of Light" storyline, where she saves him from dying after being poisoned by the Rahkshi, after which the two came to mutually respect one another.

Gali &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Herald/FanSitePics/ToaNuva/Full-Size/galinuva.jpg |title=Toa Nuva |publisher=Brickshelf.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is armed with the Kanohi Kaukau, Mask of Underwater Breathing, which allows her to breathe underwater for a limited time; the Nuva version of this mask allows her to share this ability with others, as well as last longer underwater. As a Toa Mata, she was armed with hooks, which were later transformed into Aqua Axes, which doubled as fins to help her swim faster underwater. She additionally had [[propeller]]s as a Nuva. As a Mistika,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saberdragon.at11.clyx.com/Favorites/Gali%20Mistika.png |title=Gali Mistika |publisher=Saberdragon.at11.clyx.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is armed with a Nynrah Ghost Blaster with laser sighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/mistika/ToaGali.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912133237/http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/mistika/ToaGali.aspx |date=12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 rebooted series, Gali's personality is similar to the original series, willing to bring help to the less fortunate with her strong sense of justice. She can be kind, mellow and somewhat prone to jokes that rarely deliver, but also aggressive if the situation calls for it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lego.com/en-us/bionicle/characters/gali-30974de07c8642d2b8f6e9f75dc7f8a2&lt;/ref&gt; During the final battle against Makuta, Gali was briefly trapped in the Shadow Realm, where she learned of what would happen to herself and her teammates once Makuta was defeated.

The Toa of Ice and team deputy, Kopaka's modus operandi is to work alone, often despising the Matoran's virtue of unity, but his analytical side persuaded him to go against his will after realizing it was the only way to fight Teridax. His aloof nature constantly brought him into conflict with Tahu, though the two eventually came to respect one another. He has also learned to respect the ideals of unity. Despite Kopaka's prior issues with teamwork and unity, he always protected the innocent with the same devotion of his fellow Toa, especially the inhabitants of Ko-Koro, his home region. He was the first to actually defeat a group of Rahkshi warriors in open combat, protecting Jaller and Takua from being attacked on an ice lake in their journey with the Mask of Light; he did this by shooting Panrahk, Guurahk and Lerahk into a frigid lake with an ice-spike then flash freezing all three under the water.

Kopaka is armed with the Kanohi Akaku, Mask of X-Ray Vision, which allows him to see through objects; the Nuva version lets him share this power with others. As a Toa Mata, he was armed with an Ice Sword, which was later transformed into a double-ended Ice Blade, and an Ice Shield; the Ice Blade also had the added benefit of splitting in half to provide Kopaka with a pair of "Power Skis" allowing him to slide down the slopes surrounding Ko-Koro with immense speed and agility. As a Phantoka, he is armed with a Midak Skyblaster equipped with a Protosteel Blizzard Blade attached with an aiming laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/phantoka/KopakaNuva.aspx |accessdate=2 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912114608/http://bionicle.lego.com/en-US/story/bios/phantoka/KopakaNuva.aspx |archivedate=12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also piloted the Jetrax T-6, which was briefly stolen by Makuta Antroz.

In the 2015 rebooted series, Kopaka carries an Ice Spear and a Frost Shield, the latter weapon being able to split apart into a pair of skiis. He retains much of his original personality, primarily his cold demeanor, with the added elements of a strict code of conduct, clumsiness, a poor sense of direction, and perfectionism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lego.com/en-us/bionicle/characters/kopaka-800c9581c5cd47938ebb13a55b2c9841&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toa of Stone, Pohatu is regarded as one of the friendliest Toa. With Gali, he continues to hold the peace between the Toa, but unlike her, is ready to do so in a friendlier way that benefits all of his friends. The only thing he feared was water, on account of the fact he couldn't swim (and was too heavy to float).

The Toa of Earth, Onua is very quiet, speaking only when he has something important to add, making him very well-respected among his comrades. He is intelligent, wise, and strong. He also has excellent night vision but can't see well in bright light. A running gag in the series has Onua saving people at the last moment, including catching Tahu as he was dropped from the sky and Lewa when he was given an infected mask by the Makuta and later infected by a Bohrok Krana (this has been somewhat carried on in the 2015 reboot, in which he saves the other Toa from a deadly arena and moves Pohatu out of the way of incoming rocks).

Onua wears the Kanohi Pakari, Mask of Strength, which increases his already-impressive strength; the Nuva version of the mask lets him share this extra strength with others. As a Toa Mata, his weapons were his hands, which sported large claws. When he became a Toa Nuva, he received dual Quake Breakers which he could put on his feet to travel over rough ground, and as a Mistika, he is armed with a Nynrah ghost blaster and a Multi-Resistant shield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/mistika/ToaOnua.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912133257/http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/story/bios/mistika/ToaOnua.aspx|date=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 rebooted series, Onua carries an Earthquake Hammer, which can split into a pair of Turbo Shovelors. His personality remains very much the same as his old one, with the addition of using underground caves as a place to think and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lego.com/en-us/bionicle/characters/onua-d97db9bcfa2a41e4a6a1e130add7a229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toa Hagah/Rahaga===
The history of the '''Toa Hagah''' dates back to prior the coming of the Toa Mata during the early stages of Makuta Teridax's plan. The guardians of Makuta Teridax, the Toa Team was made of six Toa chosen specifically in reward of their previous deeds. Given an elite status and unique armor that identified them as Hagah, or Guardians in the Matoran language, and thus were named the Toa Hagah.&lt;ref&gt;Farshtey, G (2007): Bionicle Encyclopedia: Updated Edition", Scholastic.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toa Hagah served Teridax on Destral, deceived and manipulated to destroy the rampant artificial Bohrok the Brotherhood created, which were initially considered by the Brotherhood as a potential weapon, unknown to the elitist faction. Eventually, this deception did not last long, and they rebelled against Teridax and the Brotherhood when they discovered that they had committed theft and stolen the Kanohi Avohkii. When four of their number were captured by the Brotherhood, Norik and Iruini rescued their comrades, but were mutated by Roodaka into Toa Hagah-Rahkshi mutants named '''Rahaga'''. Although they escaped with their lives, they had been given a fate worse than death, and could never be accepted into Matoran society as true heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Farshtey, G &amp; Elliot, R (2005): "Comic 25: Birth of a Rahaga".&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Rahaga", accepting their fate, educated themselves about Rahi to save them from the onslaught of the Visorak legion. They also searched for the mythical Keetongu (which possessed the ability to cure those infected with Hordika venom) to aid in their task. The quest eventually took them to Metru Nui, ruined by the Great Cataclysm and overrun by the Visorak.&lt;ref&gt;Farshtey, G (2007): "Bionicle Encyclopedia: Updated Edition", under "Rahaga", p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; they chose to hide the Mask of Light in Metru Nui, creating a seal that could only be opened with the fragments of the Makoki stone they had broken and hidden across the city. Arriving to rescue the Toa Metru, sent to their deaths, they informed them of their mutation by Hordika venom into Toa Hordika, educating them in their new forms and the possibility of a cure in Keetongu.&lt;ref name="Adventures#7"&gt;"Farshtey, G (2005): "Bionicle Adventures #7: "Web of the Visorak", Scholastic&lt;/ref&gt;

There, they helped the Toa Hordika in defeating the Visorak and evacuating the Matoran from the city. They were later transformed back into the Toa Hagah by Roodaka when she was coerced by the Toa Nuva. On behalf of the Order of Mata Nui, They searched for Teridax under the Coliseum, but were trapped in an illusion where they only saw the happiness and peace of a world freed from Teridax's reign. They were later snapped out of the illusion by Tren Krom in Lewa's body, and fought in the resistance against Teridax. As of the original series' cancellation, they were preparing to go to the aid of the Toa Mahri, who had been brainwashed by a monstrous enemy.

Norik is the '''Toa Hagah of Fire''', and the leader of the Toa Hagah, and was previously the Rahaga of Fire. In the discovery of the Brotherhood's rebellion, he allowed his team to become overconfident against their foes, paving the way for their capture. He, along with Iruini, was the only one to escape the fate of his teammates, and teamed up with him to rescue them. Now changed to a Turaga-esque wise persona, he became cautious, but still preferred to lead with actions instead of words. He was also very concerned about Vakama's rapid primal transformation, and was the only one to escape capture once more when Vakama joined Roodaka.

As a Rahaga, Norik was armed with a Rhotuka spinner with the ''Snare'' power, which tangled the limbs of a target. His Rahaga Staff could also be manipulated to distract his reptile Rahi prey (Norik specialized in the capture and study of these Rahi such as Furnace Salamanders) as he prepared to strike.

As a Toa Hagah, he is armed with the Hagah's standard weapons: a '''Lava Spear''' which contained the power of Lava and could sap or increase the heat of its target, and a Rhotuka-Launching Shield with Rhotuka containing ''slow opponent'' power which weakened and slowed its target. He wears the Kanohi Pehkui, Great Mask of Diminishment, although it was in the shape of a standard Noble Kiril and not of a standard Great Pehkui. It was presented to him by enslaved Matoran working under threats from the Brotherhood of Makuta and is shaped like a Noble Kiril to honor a past hero.

Gaaki is the Toa Hagah, and formerly Rahaga, of Water. As a Toa of Water, Gaaki can create, control, and absorb water. This also gives her the ability to control water, create storms, and cause floods. These abilities were lost when she was turned into a Rahaga, but she has since regained her powers. Her Rhotuka spinner as a Rahaga was used to capture Rahi by flowing through the depths of water, attaching itself to the target, and floating them up towards the surface. As a Rahaga, she was feisty and always wanted to prove herself as good a Rahaga as the rest. She was also a translator, and her area of expertise was the capture of water Rahi. She always wanted to show the other Rahaga that she was a great expert in the capture of Rahi. She was visibly affected by her mask, as she often felt that the power was using her rather than the other way round.

Bomonga is the Toa Hagah of Earth. As a Rahaga, Bomonga was known to hunt in absolute silence and preferred to work alone. His prey were the Rahi "hiders," insect and nocturnal species. Bomonga searched for Rahi under cover of darkness and was known to burrow into the earth to wait for the creatures to come near. From a place of concealment, he would launch silent spinners to incapacitate his targets. Extremely patient and skilled, he would wait for hours to catch one Rahi. As a Toa of Earth, Bomonga can create, control, and absorb earth. This also gives him the ability to control earth, and create earthquakes. He frequently used his Mask of Growth in battle, being proficient enough to bring down a Tahtorak, a Rahi far stronger than he. These abilities were lost when he was turned into a Rahaga, but he has since regained his powers.

He truly loves massive beasts and can teach others how to befriend them. As a Rahaga, he used a lasso spinner to capture the beasts and used his staff to leave an invisible mark so he could track them. He has since been turned back into a Toa.

The Toa Hagah of Air. As a Toa, he believed that the team needed to spend more time on more routine dangers, such as Rahi invasions; the rest of the team did not share this view, and the differences of opinion lead to him quitting the team. This meant he was not present when his comrades were captured, so he was able join forces with Norik again to save them. Upon becoming a Rahaga, Iruini quickly resigned himself to the mutation, and did not accept that Keetongu had the power to cure him. However, he was overjoyed to become a Toa again, adopting an adventurous attitude.

===Toa Inika/Toa Mahri===
The '''Toa Inika/Toa Mahri''' were once six Matoran from the island of Mata Nui that journeyed to Voya Nui to save the Toa Nuva, who had disappeared on the island while searching for the Mask of Life. These Matoran were Jaller, Hahli, Kongu, Matoro, Hewkii, and Nuparu. Having braved the nightmare realm of Karzahni on their journey to the island, they were immediately transformed by a bolt of lightning from the Red Star when they came ashore. The unusual nature of their transformation meant they had electricity interlaced with their elemental powers, their faces glowed bizarrely, and their Kanohi were organic.

As Toa Inika, they battled the Toa Nuva's captors, the evil Piraka, for control over the Mask of Life, while also searching for the Toa Nuva. They teamed up with the Voya Nui Resistance Team, led by Garan and consisting of Balta, Dalu, Kazi, Piruk, and Velika, as well as one the Mask's guardians, Order of Mata Nui operative Axonn. They eventually battled against Vezon and Fenrakk/Kardas, and Kongu used his Mask of Telepathy to read the Mask's mind, learning that the Mask wanted Matoro as its new guardian. After Jaller froze Vezon and Kardas, Matoro took the Mask off of Vezon. To his own surprise, it came off right when he touched it, but before long the Mask flew into the sea. Axonn opened a secret tunnel so the Toa Inika could go down into the Pit and find the mask, while on the surface, the Toa Nuva were rescued by the Voya Nui resistance team.

Upon emerging out into the dark water of Pit, a blast of energy from the Mask of Life transformed them again, changing their Kanohi and removing their lightning powers. They were branded as allies of the Barraki by the Mahri Nui Matoran, and most were captured by the Barraki themselves while Matoro was imprisoned by Hydraxon, but later freed by Teridax, who had taken control over a Maxilos robot. The Toa Mahri later escaped with the help of a Hahnah Crab and stole some Cordak Blasters from the Barraki. They were named the protectors of Mahri Nui by Defilak, the city's leader. They battled the Barraki and Hydraxon (who was working against both sides), for the Mask of Life, but temporarily abandoned this objective when they learned that they had destroy the Cord connecting Voya Nui to Mahri Nui for Mata Nui to live. With Axonn's help, they evacuated the Matoran of Mahri Nui and Voya Nui into the tunnels above the Cord, where they would be safe from the destruction that would follow. Having saved the Matoran from another attack by the Piraka, they returned to the Pit destroyed the Cord and wrested the Mask of Life from their enemies. As Mahri Nui was wiped out by the falling island, the Mahri rushed to the hole where the island would fall, only for the Mask of Life to go dark, as the Great Spirit Mata Nui finally died. Matoro, however refused to give up, and his allies agreed to stand and fight against the approaching armies of the Barraki to buy Matoro time to revive Mata Nui. Matoro reached the hole just before Voya Nui fell back into place, and fell through a torrent of water to Karda Nui, the core of the Matoran Universe while the others held off the Barraki. As Jaller prepared to unleash a Nova Blast in last ditch effort to obliterate the Barraki, Matoro gave his life to don the Ignika and save Mata Nui's life, and sent his fellow Toa back to Metru Nui. After Jaller powered down his energy, they learned of Matoro's fate from Turaga Vakama. They became the protectors of Metru Nui in the absence of the Toa Nuva (they had left Voya Nui to fulfill their own destiny of awakening Mata Nui, now possible thanks to Matoro's sacrifice).

During Teridax's reign the Toa Mahri were chosen to perform an espionage mission on the island Zakaz, home of the Skakdi, who created a powerful gold-skinned fusion. The Mahri were hypnotized by the creature and relished following the fusion's command. On Spherus Magna, Kopaka learned of this, and Gaaki gathered her team to rescue the Mahri. The fusion's hold over the team was disrupted when a being called "Annona" attacked the Skakdi, freeing them from its control.&lt;ref&gt;https://community.lego.com/t5/LEGO-General/Chat-with-Greg-Farshtey/m-p/10008169/highlight/true#M235251&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaller has a strong sense of justice and responsibility, and is known for his immense courage. He is willing to do whatever it takes to do his duty.

As leader of a Toa team, Jaller tries to be a more cautious leader of Toa compared to other Toa of Fire such as Tahu or Vakama. He tries hard to heed the opinions of his teammates as well, but nevertheless experienced annoyance when Matoro began taking charge of the team in the Pit, though the two eventually resolved their differences.

As a Matoran, Jaller was captain of the Ta-Koro (and later Ta-Metru) Guard, and played defense for the Ta-Koro Kolhii Team. He was best friends with Takua, who later became Toa Takanuva, and their friendship continues even as Toa. When Jaller was a Matoran and Takua accidentally melted the totem turning into the Mask of Light, Jaller also carried a [[backpack]] for carrying Kanohi masks like the one they discovered. He originally wore a powerless Komau (Mask of Mind Control) before it broke inside a Matoran sphere. Turaga Vakama replaced it with a Noble Hau originally worn by Turaga Lhikan.

As a Toa Inika, Jaller wore the Kanohi Calix, the Mask of Fate, which allows him to perform at his physical peak, pulling off feats others would deem impossible. He carried two Energized Flame Swords and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher.

As a Toa Mahri, he wears the Kanohi Arthron, which gives him echolocation. He carries a Power Sword and a Cordak Blaster as his main tools. During his time in Mahri Nui, Jaller mounted his blaster on the back of a Hahnah Crab, which remained in the Pit after Jaller was teleported back to Metru Nui.

As a Matoran on Mata Nui, Hahli spent most of her time tending to her many village chores like fish-catching and net-mending, without ambition to travel or go on adventures. Her shyness kept her from speaking up, despite being full of ideas, and her fellow Ga-Matoran would often forget or overlook her. Nevertheless, Nokama could see true potential in her, selecting her to play for Ga-Koro in the Kolhii Tournament. She wore a Kaukau as her Kanohi Mask. She also came to share an affectionate friendship with Jaller following the Bohrok crisis.

When she became a Toa, Hahli was initially nervous about her new role, and the power she possessed. She eventually warmed up to it, however, and became more confident to the point of choosing to go on solo missions without fear. She soon became her team's strongest member during the underwater Mahri quest.

As a Toa Inika, she wore the Kanohi Elda, Mask of Detection, which allowed her to sense the presence of other beings and the Mask of Life. She carried a Laser Harpoon and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher.

As a Toa Mahri, she wears the Kanohi Faxon, Mask of Kindred, which allows her to copy the abilities of other Rahi that shares her current environment. She carries a set of Protosteel Talons and a Cordak Blaster. She also gained a pair of fins on her back to help her swim faster.

Hewkii is known for his athletic ability on both Metru Nui and Mata Nui, winning many Copper Masks as a Matoran. These talents helped develop his combat skills and reflexes. He also possessed keen senses, allowing him to pinpoint weak spots. He wore a Kakama as his Kanohi Mask.

When he became a Toa Inika, he was initially uncomfortable with his new role, desiring to find the Ignika quickly so that he could return to his old friends and his old life. However, he eventually grew accustomed to being a Toa. An athlete by nature, he also disliked the advantage afforded to him by his Mask of Power, and did not use it in combat unless necessary.

As a Toa Inika, he wore the Kanohi Sanok, Mask of Accuracy, which, as the title suggests, increased his accuracy in hitting a target. He carried a Laser Axe with a Climbing Chain attached to it and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher.

As a Toa Mahri, he wears the Kanohi Garai, Mask of Gravity, which increases or decreases the gravity of a target. He carried a Cordak Blaster mounted on his wrist, an Aqua Warblade, and a pair of Electrifying Chains. One of the chains was broken during the underwater Mahri quest, but was later repaired.

Nuparu is a master engineer, and feels at ease when surrounded by machinery he can tinker with, continuing this passion even as a Toa. He also has a great passion for learning, enjoying being a Toa, as it meant the ability and opportunity to explore new places and study new things, like Rahi. While in Mahri Nui, he continued his duties, but was upset that he was in the middle of a crisis, meaning he couldn't take the time to learn all there is to learn.

As a Matoran, he wore a Pakari as his Kanohi Mask and was known for creating the Boxor robots to help repel the Bohrok.

As a Toa Inika, he wore the Kanohi Kadin, Mask of Flight, which allowed him to fly, an ironic twist for a Toa of Earth. He carried a Laser Drill and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher mounted on his right shoulder. His hands became a pair of sharp claws for digging.

As a Toa Mahri, he wears the Kanohi Volitak, Mask of Stealth, which allows him to become completely silent and mostly transparent. He carries a Cordak Blaster, a Razor-Edged Protosteel Shield, and an Aqua Blaster Blade, the latter of which was not featured in the set.

While a Matoran, Kongu was known to be very serious during times of danger, being the military leader of the Gukko Force. Over time, however, Lewa was known to influence Kongu, teaching him to be more laid back and gain enjoyment out of his missions. Once becoming a Toa, Kongu began following that advice, and is now generally fun-loving and full of wit, having a joke or comment ready at the right time. Kongu gets along well with his fellow Toa, especially with Nuparu. The Toa of Air at first complained that Nuparu, being a Toa of Earth, shouldn‚Äôt have received the Kadin, Mask of Flight. But he later cheerfully offered to help his friend learn to fly, saying that Nuparu might break the Mask of Flight as an excuse to help him.

As a Toa Inika, Kongu suffered an unusual problem with his own mask; he could not turn the Kanohi Suletu off, and was thus constantly forced to listen to the thoughts of his teammates, something that was naturally very distracting. His problems with Kanohi continued as a Toa Mahri when the Kanohi Zaath was bestowed upon him, as he had no control over the Rahi once he had summoned them, and the undersea monsters that he did call to his aid invariably made the situation worse.

As a Toa Inika, he wore the Kanohi Suletu, Mask of Telepathy, which, as mentioned above, allowed him to read other people's minds. He carried a Laser Crossbow and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher.

As a Toa Mahri, he wears the Kanohi Zatth, Mask of Summoning, which, as mentioned above, allows him to summon Rahi to his aid. He originally carried a Cordak Blaster and an unidentified Toa tool, which he quickly replaced with a second Cordak Blaster out of personal preference.

While a Matoran, Matoro had served as Turaga Nuju's translator and trusted aide, as he could understand Nuju's strange bird calls. When translating for Nuju, he would strike a narrator's pose, with his legs apart, head back and use a deep and booming voice to relay Nuju's wisdom. Unlike most other Ko-Matoran, Matoro was not asocial, but instead was very friendly towards others. When he became a Toa, Matoro felt that his job as a translator had not prepared him for being a Toa nearly as much as the other Toa Inika, most of whom had backgrounds as athletes or warriors. Despite his fear, he did his best to fulfill his new duties.

Constantly burdened with the amount of secrets he was intended to keep, Matoro struggled with being unable to tell his friends, though he ultimately knew that revealing anything would endanger them, something he was not willing to do. His secrecy led some of the other Toa, such as Hahli and Jaller, to think that Matoro refused to share secrets with them on purpose, even though they were friends.

During his time as a Toa, and the experiences in searching for the mask, Matoro slowly began taking charge, filling the role of the leader. Jaller, who naturally emerged as the leader, felt conflicted about Matoro's attitude, though the two amicably resolved their differences. Meanwhile, Matoro struggled with  his own challenges; the power of his Kanohi Tryna appalled him, and he tried to avoid using it where possible. The mask was in fact bestowed upon him by the Ignika to test his character. Matoro also discovered Makuta Teridax had not merely survived his supposed death, but possessed a robotic prison guard called Maxilos. In this form, the tyrant coerced Matoro into cooperating with his plans, threatening to kill the other Toa Mahri if he did not.

As a Toa Inika, Matoro wore the Kanohi Iden, Mask of Spirit, which allowed his spirit to physically leave his body. He carried an Energized Ice Sword and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher as his Toa tools. As a Toa Mahri, he wore the Kanohi Tryna, Mask of Reanimation, which allowed him to give life to and control dead beings. He carried a Twin Cutter and a Cordak Blaster, transformed from his previous weapons.

As a destined bearer and user of the Kanohi Ignika, Matoro was not cursed by the mask, and was also one of the only ones that could access its power. He ended up sacrificing his life so that Mata Nui could be resurrected and that his teammates could breathe air again (he teleported them back to Metru Nui).

===Other Toa teams===
* '''Toa Cordak:''' The first ever Toa team led by Toa Lesovikk, including Toa Nikila, a Toa of Fire, a Toa of Water, a Toa of Sonics, a Toa of Iron, a Toa of Stone, and a Toa of Gravity. All members of the team, except for Lesovikk, were killed in a battle against a tribe of Zyglak, due to a fatal hesitation on Lesovikk's part. He is now fully committed to find a way to make it up to his teammates.
* '''Toa Mangai:''' Toa Lhikan's team of 11, formed to defend Metru Nui against the Kanohi Dragon. Most remained after the Rahi had been defeated and guarded the city throughout the Dark Hunters' invasion. Known members include Nidhiki (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]), Tuyet, Naho, four Toa of Ice, a Toa of Stone, a Toa of Earth, and a Toa of Plant Life. All members were killed, except Nidihki, who turned traitor by joining the Dark Hunters and was mutated into an [[arthropod]]-like Dark Hunter, and Lhikan (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]), who became a Turaga after summoning the Toa Metru. All are deceased with the exception of Tuyet, who was recently revealed to be alive in the official web serial, ''Reign of Shadows''.
* '''Jovan's Team:''' Known Members included a Toa who died using The Ignika, another who wore an Elda to help track the Ignika, and one who wore a Kanohi Olmak to help his team escape the Energy Storms (all later killed by the Makuta). Jovan later became the Turaga of Voya Nui, but died when part of the island that later became Mahri Nui broke off.
* '''Toa Metru/Hordika:''' Vakama's team of six, whose duty was to rescue and protect the Matoran from Makuta Teridax. It included Nokama Toa of Water (voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]]), Vakama Toa of Fire (voiced by [[Alessandro Juliani]]), Matau Toa of Air (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]), Whenua Toa of Earth (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]), Nuju Toa of Ice (voiced by [[Trevor Devall]]) and Onewa Toa of Stone (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]). Having achieved their destiny, they became the Turaga of Mata Nui, and led the defense of the Matoran in the Dark Time, when Makuta used Rahi to attack their villages. After briefly serving with Dume as Turaga of Metru Nui, they were imprisoned by Ahkmou when Makuta Teridax took control of the Matoran Universe. When the Great Spirit Mata Nui killed Teridax, the Turaga were part of the migration onto the reformed Sphereus Magna.

Takanuva was originally an Av-Matoran named Takua, who was hidden on Metru Nui during the Time Slip to ensure that a Toa of Light would one day come into being to counter the Makuta. At some point his Mask was damaged, and was replaced with a Kanohi Pakari that never fit properly, and turned blue due to his lack of control over his disguise as a Ta-Matoran. He was known in Metru Nui for his tendency to wander off and not fulfill his duties; Matoran joked that a squad of Vahki were assigned to keep an eye on him.

Takua continued to show this lack of interest in his work after being brought to Mata Nui, and was eventually banished by Turaga Vakama during the Dark Time. Takua began wandering across the island, and undertook errands to aid the Turaga of all the villages. On the way, he discovered the Toa stones hidden by the Toa Metru 1,000 years before, and with the Turaga's blessing, assembled them at the Kini Nui in the middle of the island. Together, the stones activated the beacon that finally summoned the Toa Mata to Mata Nui, although the blast threw him to the beach of Ta-Wahi and left him with amnesia. Once again he set off across the island on missions for the Turaga, who named him Chronicler for his heroics. Finally, the Turaga gave him an important task: assemble a small group of Matoran to guard the Kini-Nui temple from Rahi attack, while the Toa confronted Makuta below. At the Turaga's request, Takua chose Matoran from each village who were either the most skilled in their crafts or loners like himself. Takua's Matoran, who named themselves the Chronicler's Company, waged a noble defence of the Kini-Nui, while Takua had visions of the struggle underground through a mental link with Toa Gali. As the battle seemed impossible, reinforcments from the other villages appeared to turn the tide. Takua then journeyed to the Great Mine of Onu-Koro at Whenua's behest, where he discovered another path to Makuta's lair. Thus, Takua witnessed the Toa's battle with the Makuta, and the awakening of the Bohrok. Using an ancient portal, Takua barely escaped with his life.

Now accepted by the Matoran, Takua documented the war with the Bohrok, and journeyed with Nuparu to assist the villages most at risk. Following the defeat of the Bohrok-Kal, Takua discovered the Kanohi Avohkii, Mask of Light, and once again set off across the island, this time accompanied by his best friend Jaller, in the hope they could locate the seventh Toa. They were chased for much of their journey by the Rahkshi, culminating in a final stand at the Kini-Nui with the Toa Nuva. Jaller was killed in the attack, prompting Takua to realize he was in fact the seventh Toa. He donned the Avohkii and became the first Toa of Light. After renaming himself Takanuva (meaning Takua Nuva, as he considered himself a Toa Nuva, although he was not), he fought and temporarily defeated Makuta Teridax, allowing the Matoran to return to Metru Nui after 1,000 years.

Takanuva would guard Metru Nui in the Toa Nuva's absence, and fought Frostelus to defend the city. He later intercepted a dark presence in his mind and went after the culprit, the Dark Hunter codenamed "Dweller". As he did, Makuta Icarax dropped a Shadow Leech upon him, (meant to bite Ahkmou and become a Shadow Toa) but was able to incinerate the leech with concentrated light, and fell unconscious from the light drain. His gold colored armor turned to a shining iron gray color, to symbolize the powers of light and shadow now surging through his right and left hands. He then met with Helryx, Krakua, and Brutaka, who showed him the origins of the Toa Nuva through a set of visions, before sending him to Karda Nui. Brutaka opened a portal, but due to the damaged state of his Kanohi Olmak, led to several dimensional journeys, one resulting in him receiving a powdered Makuta virus from a heroic Krika, giving him the power of flight, before arriving in Karda Nui. There, he found the Toa Nuva in the swamps. Takanuva grew to a height of ten feet as a result of arriving in an area with such strong light.

Takanuva saw the Makuta Krika near Toa Gali Nuva, not knowing that Krika was trying to help her. He provided the Toa Nuva with vital information and fought against the Makuta. He witnessed Krika's death, having his density completely eradicated into microscopic particles, because he tried to warn them all of Teridax's betrayal. Enraged by this, he fought ferociously against the remaining Makuta. Vican, a mutated Le-Matoran, (a Shadow Matoran just minutes before) sought out Takanuva, and told him of the Klakk. The Klakk had the power to screech and shatter the barrier that prevented light from returning to Shadow beings. He then restored all Shadow Matoran to Av-Matoran, and lastly himself, turning him gold again. Takanuva then took the Matoran (Still mutated into bat-like creatures) to another location. He assisted the Toa Nuva in awaking Mata Nui, and left for Metru Nui. He, along with the other Toa have formed a revolt against Teridax when he took over the universe.

When the Makuta landed on Bara Magna, Takanuva exited the giant robot onto the new planet, altering his colors in the process to not draw attention to himself. He assisted Tahu in retrieving the Golden Armor, killing two Heat Vision Rahkshi in the process. He has since returned his armor to Gold and White.

Krakua is a Toa of Sonics working for the Order of Mata Nui.

Like all De-Matoran, Krakua had very acute hearing. However, despite this, he had a habit of humming to himself, which caused many of his fellow De-Matoran to avoid him.

As a Toa of Sonics, Krakua is able to create, control and absorb sound. This allows him to create sound waves or concentrated beams of sound, use sonic waves to disrupt a structure's integrity, and absorb all of the sound in an area to create a field of silence. As with other Order operatives, his mind is shielded from mental assaults.

He carries a Sonic Vibration Sword and wears a Suletu, which is shaped like a Great Hau.

Krakua is currently the only Toa of Sonics still alive.

Helryx was the first Toa ever to be created and is the leader of the Order of Mata Nui.

Despite being a Toa of Water, Helryx is extremely fierce, somewhat impatient, and quick to anger. She always strives to achieve her vision of the greater good, no matter the decisions and choices she has to make to get it.

She carries a spiked mace and a shield for melee combat and wears the Kanohi '''Mask of Psychometry''', which allows her to see into a being's past just by touching him. Her mind is also shielded from outside mental presences, as is mandatory with Order training.

Due to the nature of her role in the Order, Helryx excluded herself from the Toa Code, which stipulates that Toa cannot kill their opponents.

Lesovikk is a guilt-ridden Toa of Air and the leader of the first Toa Team.

Due to his hesitation, which led to his team's death, Lesovikk blames himself for causing their deaths, and considers himself unworthy to be a Toa. His self-perceived failure to live up to the standards of the Toa exempts him from the code, and he is willing to kill his opponents.

Lesovikk carries an '''Air Sword''' and a '''Cordak Blaster''' as his main Toa tools. He wears a Faxon as his Kanohi mask.

After Lesovikk arrived on Spherus Magna, he was suspected with killing Karzahni, as his sword was found near his body, but a message in the stars caused Kopaka to suspect otherwise.

==Powers and abilities==
All Toa have elemental powers, which they can use to manipulate existing elements or create new substance, as well as physical traits they possessed as Matoran. These elemental powers recharge naturally over time - the amount the energy exerted will determine how long it takes to return to full strength. They also have the mental discipline to use Great and Noble Kanohi Masks (only the Toa Nuva can use Kanohi Nuva). An ability all Toa share is the ability to perform Nova Blasts in which they release all their elemental energies at once. This has only ever been seen once in the story, when Gali of the Toa Nuva leveled the realm of Karzahni with a wall of water in a last-ditch attempt to defeat Makuta Icarax; it took all her concentration to save the other Toa from drowning. Jaller planned to unleash a Nova Blast in the Pit to buy Matoro time from the armies of the Barraki, and would almost certainly have killed everyone in the immediate area by doing so. Six Toa can combine their elemental powers to create a Protodermis Seal. Any six Toa can do this as long as two of the Toa are not Light and Shadow, as the two are cancelled out. This ability has only been seen being done by teams consisting of a Fire, Ice, Water, Air, Stone, and Earth. Toa are also able to use their Toa Power to heal certain things and create Toa Stones, which contain some of their own Toa Power. When a Toa has united with others, completed his or her duty, and achieved his or her destiny, he or she can sacrifice all of his or her Toa Power, and he or she becomes a Turaga. They can also choose to give up their Toa Power before their destiny is complete, and will become Turaga upon fulfilling that destiny.

==Controversy==
In 2001, Lego faced legal action by [[MƒÅori people|MƒÅori]] activists from [[New Zealand]] for trademarking MƒÅori words used in naming the Bionicle product range for use in the [[Matoran]] language, including the names of some Toa, and even the word "Toa" itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = | last = | author = | coauthors =| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1362435.stm | title =Lego irks Maoris | work = | publisher =BBC News | pages = | page = | date =31 May 2005 | accessdate =14 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, many of the names of the Toa from MƒÅori language, were still kept, though Lego was careful in naming characters from then on. In the 2015 relaunch, the new versions of the original six Toa are called "Master" and "Uniters" on their packaging, but still referred to as Toa in-universe.

'''Ubisoft Toronto Inc.''' is a Canadian [[video game developer]] and a [[subsidiary]] of [[Ubisoft]] based in [[Toronto, Ontario]]. The studio was announced on 6 July 2009, with the [[government of Ontario]] pledging $260&amp;nbsp;million to Ubisoft to create 800 new jobs in the Ontario region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/5308480/ubisoft-toronto-brings-800-jobs-to-ontario |title=Ubisoft Toronto Brings 800 Jobs To Ontario |first=Mike |last=Fahey |date=6 July 2009 |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio's location was confirmed on 4 December 2009.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Led by ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' producer [[Jade Raymond]], the studio developed ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist]]'', the most recent instalment of the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell|Splinter Cell]]'' series, in conjunction with [[Ubisoft Montreal]]. In November 2011, it was revealed that the studio would be supporting the development of the new ''[[Rainbow Six]]'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ubisoft Press Release - TERRORISM HITS HOME IN TOM CLANCY'S RAINBOW 6¬Æ PATRIOTS VIDEO GAME FROM UBISOFT¬Æ |url=http://pressextranet.ubisoft.com/US/US/PublicPages/PressReleasesDetails.aspx?prid=403&amp;title=TERRORISM+HITS+HOME+IN+TOM+CLANCY%E2%80%99S+RAINBOW+6%C2%AE+PATRIOTS+VIDEO+GAME+FROM+UBISOFT%C2%AE |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Union Films''' was a film production company located in Batavia, [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Jakarta]], Indonesia). Established by [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] businessmen Ang Hock Liem and Tjoa Ma Tjoen in 1940, it produced seven [[black-and-white]] films before it was dissolved in 1942; all are thought to be [[lost film|lost]]. The company's films were directed by four men, mostly ethnic Chinese, and launched the careers of actors such as [[Rendra Karno]] and [[Djoewariah]].

Established during the revival of the Indies film industry, Union released its first film, ''[[Kedok Ketawa]]'', in July 1940. This was followed by a series of films penned by [[Saeroen]] which were increasingly oriented towards the Indies' growing [[intelligentsia]] and attempted to distance themselves from the theatrical conventions which were common in the contemporary film industry. This continued after Saeroen left for [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]] in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. Following the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation of the Indies]] in March 1942, Union was dissolved, though its films continued to be screened into the mid 1940s.

==History==
Following the commercial successes of ''[[Terang Boelan]]'' (''Full Moon''; 1937), ''[[Fatima (1938 film)|Fatima]]'' (1938), and ''[[Alang-Alang (film)|Alang-Alang]]'' (''Grass''; 1939), the film industry of the [[Dutch East Indies]]&amp;nbsp;‚Äì which had been severely weakened by the [[Great Depression]]&amp;nbsp;‚Äì was revived. Film production increased and, in 1940, four new [[production house]]s were opened, including Union Films.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=205}} The company was funded by [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] businessman Ang Hock Liem, who is credited as producer for the majority of the company's releases;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ang Hock Liem}} daily operations, however, were handled by Tjoa Ma Tjoen.{{Sfn|Biran|2009|pp=232‚Äì233}} Union was headquartered in Prinsenlaan, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, [[Jakarta]]), and, according to a press release, established to "improve the quality of Indonesian art".{{efn|Original: "''... buat mengangkat derajatnya kesenian Indonesia.''"}}{{Sfn|Biran|2009|pp=232‚Äì233}}

[[File:Kedok Ketawa ad, Surabaya.jpg|300px|thumb|A Dutch-language advertisement for Union's first film, ''[[Kedok Ketawa]]'' (1940)]]
The fledgling Union's first film, ''[[Kedok Ketawa]]'', was released in July 1940. Following a young couple who face off against criminals with the help of a masked bandit,{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, Kedok Ketawa}} this film was directed by Jo An Djan and starred Oedjang, Fatimah, and [[Basuki Resobowo|Basoeki Resobowo]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kedok Ketawa}} It received positive reviews; the journalist [[Saeroen]] wrote in ''Pemandangan'' that the film's quality was comparable to imported [[Hollywood]] productions,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=232}} and a review in ''[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'' praised the cinematography.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1940, Filmaankondiging Cinema Palace}} Following these positive reviews, Union hired Saeroen&amp;nbsp;‚Äì who had previously written ''Terang Boelan'' and several works for [[Tan's Film]]&amp;nbsp;‚Äì as a screenwriter. He made his debut for the company with ''[[Harta Berdarah]]'', directed by new hires R Hu and [[Rd Ariffien]], following Jo An Djan's departure for Populair's Film. The film, in which a young man convinces a miserly [[hajji]] to be more charitable, was released in October 1940 and starred the singer Soelastri and martial artist Zonder.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=233}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Harta Berdarah}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, (untitled)}}

Union released their third production, ''[[Bajar dengan Djiwa]]'', by February 1941.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Untitled}} Directed by R Hu, this film&amp;nbsp;‚Äì a drama in which a young woman is sold to a [[loan shark]] in order to pay her father's debt{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Bajar dengan Djiwa}}&amp;nbsp;‚Äì marked the film debut of [[Djoewariah]]; she later became Union's leading lady.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=145}} Ariffien, meanwhile, was tasked with directing ''[[Asmara Moerni]]'', based on a script by Saeroen. Attempting to reach the educated audiences by casting a young doctor, [[Adnan Kapau Gani]], opposite Djoewariah,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=260}} this romance told of a young man who is ultimately able to marry his former maid after she receives an education.{{sfn|Saeroen|1941}} Released in April, the film received mixed reviews: one, in the ''Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad'', found the film "fascinating",{{efn|Original: "''... boeiend ...''"}}{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Filmaankondigingen}} while another for the same paper considered the film dependent on the stage traditions which its advertisements had denounced.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Iets over de Maleische Film}}

In July 1941 Union released ''[[Wanita dan Satria]]'', a Djoewariah vehicle which follows a well-born womaniser who abuses his social status to gain women's trust before ultimately getting his comeuppance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}}; {{harvnb|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941a, Warta dari Studio|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In advertising ''Wanita dan Satria'', the company again emphasised the non-theatrical background of the film's cast, which also included Moesa, Djoewita and Hidajat.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=262‚Äì263}} The film received positive reviews; one, from the ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'', wrote that ''Wanita dan Satria'' "gives a clear picture of the precarious position of Indonesian women and motivates the desire for a firmer outline of her rights in the Moslem society."{{efn|Original: "... ''geeft een duidelijk beeld van de wankele positie der Indonesische vrouw en motiveert den drang naar een vaster omlijning harer rechten in de Mohammedaansche maatschappij.''"}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}} This was the company's last film to be directed by Ariffien or written by Saeroen; both men migrated to rival company [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]] soon afterwards.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=234, 276}}

[[File:Poster mega mendoeng.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for Union's last production, ''[[Mega Mendoeng]]'' (1942)]]
Hu remained with Union and directed the company's next production, ''[[Soeara Berbisa]]'', with ''[[peranakan]]'' sound technician Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed two young men who compete for the love of a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Soeara Berbisa}} Djoewita had left the company at this point, and the studio hired [[Rendra Karno|Raden Soekarno]] for the leading role of this late 1941 release.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=397}} The company's final completed production, ''[[Mega Mendoeng]]'', was directed by Boen and announced soon after shooting for ''Soeara Berbisa'' had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Tirai Terbentang}}; {{harvnb|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1942, Studio Nieuws}}&lt;/ref&gt; In producing both films, Union emphasised [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and targeted educated audiences.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941b, Warta dari Studio|p=28}}

By the end of 1941, the government of the Dutch East Indies were concerned that [[Empire of Japan]] could invade the colony.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=98}} This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of the film magazine ''Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film'' reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Union, though already beginning production of a film set in the [[Majapahit]] era titled ''Damar Woelan'', was forced to stop filming.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1942, Studio Nieuws|p=18}} When the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupied the Indies]] in March 1942,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=234}} Union was closed, never to reopen.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=319, 332}}

Aside from Ariffien, who continued directing into the 1960s,{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=390}} none of Union's directors or producers returned to the film industry after the conclusion of the Japanese occupation in 1945. Several actors, however, continued their careers. Djoewariah, for instance, made her first film after leaving Union, ''Sehidup Semati'' (''One Life, One Death''), in 1949, and continued acting until the mid-1950s.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=145}} The career of Soekarno, meanwhile, lasted through the 1970s; he was mostly credited as Rendra Karno after changing his name in the 1950s.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=397}} Others had careers behind the screen; ''Kedok Ketawa'' star Basoeki Resobowo, for instance, became art director on films such as ''[[Darah dan Doa]]'' (''The Long March''; 1950).{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Basuki Resobowo}}

In a period of two years, Union released seven films; all were feature length, made in black-and-white, and received wide releases in the Dutch East Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=233}} Several were screened in nearby Singapore, including ''Bajar dengan Djiwa'' and ''Asmara Moerni''.{{sfn|Millet|2006|p=24}}{{sfn|The Straits Times 1941, (untitled)}} Though its films were screened at least into the 1940s,{{efn|''Asmara Moerni'', for instance, was screened until at least November 1945 {{harv|Soeara Merdeka 1945, Pilem}}, and ''Soeara Berbisa'' played as late as February 1949 {{harv|Pelita Rakjat 1949, (untitled)}}.}} the company's output is likely lost.{{efn|Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed {{harv|Biran|2012|p=291}}. As such, the American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost {{harv|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, J.B. Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and the film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]] {{harv|Biran|2009|p=351}}.}}

[[Image:Aa fitzcarraldo ship.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the side of the Fitzcarraldo]]
'''Walk the Plank''' are a British group of artists, theatre makers, pyrotechnicians and event engineers who specialise in outdoor arts/theatre, touring performance and [[pyrotechnic]]s. 

Their shows are on land and on water and often mix performance, music, lighting, visual images, fire, and [[fireworks]]. The company was established by John Wassell and Liz Pugh in 1991, who identified a [[niche market]] for a touring theatre ship, and other aquatic shows on the waterways. The company's work began when the pair purchased a touring [[theatre]] ship, the MV ''Fitzcarraldo''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The company's work has now extended far beyond the ship and they work on delivering shows and events, varying in scale from intimate to epic. Walk the Plank have produced work for Toronto‚Äôs [[Wintercity Festival]], [[Singapore Festival]], [[Euro 2004]], [[Tall Ships 2005]], [[Centerparcs]], Sir [[Paul McCartney]], the [[Commonwealth Games]], as well as multiple city and local councils. Perhaps their most well known credit are the opening and closing ceremonies for Liverpool's Capital of Culture celebrations.

Their administrative base is in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Greater Manchester]] and they have workshop facilities in Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall.

Their work often involves community engagement and they are known for scheduling and leading participation elements which fit the context of the event they are organising.

==Event management and consultancy==
The company's Senior Management Team (including co-founders John Wassell and Liz Pugh and Project Directors Andy Stratford and Billie Klinger) are trusted advisers in the areas of outdoor arts and cultural events.

==MV Fitzcarraldo==
The ''Fitzcarraldo'' [http://www.walktheplank.co.uk/wtp/index.php?page=nauticalia] was built in 1971 in [[Sandnessj√∏en]], Norway for [[TFDS]] as the MV Bjark√∏j. She was 20 years a general cargo and passenger ferry working the islands around [[Troms√∏]] in north [[Norway]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In December 1991 Walk the Plank purchased the ship, renaming it the ''Fitzcarraldo''. The ship was registered British in 1992, the same year of its first British national tour. Its hold was adapted as a theatre. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Each summer, from 1992 to 2006 the ''Fitzcarraldo'' set sail from the [[Albert Dock]], [[Liverpool]] and toured ports and harbours in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Audiences of up to 125 people can sit the aft deck to watch as the hatches rise and the cargo holds are [[Crane (machine)|crane]]d open.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 2000, 's co-production (with  Company) of "Moby Dick" won Best Fringe Production at the [[Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards]]. Jim Burke also won the Best New Play award for this adaptation. 

In 2003 the ship went on a national tour to 19 ports with a stage adaption of [[Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea]], to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dorset Echo'', 23 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Evening News'', 2 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; At first the audience sits on the [[quayside]], and the ''Fitzcarraldo'' represents the ''Abraham Lincoln''; later they sit in the ''Fitzcarraldo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hold, which represents the inside of the ''Nautilus'', or occasionally the seabed.

Currently, due to mechanical deterioration to some of its driving components the ship resides in the [[Canning Dock]], which is part of Liverpool's [[Albert Dock]] complex, and is used as a static venue for many events including parties, [[cabaret]] evenings, live music, and drama.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Walk the Plank are currently making plans to sell the Fitzcarraldo, in order to focus on delivering large scale outdoor events, creating touring performance and continue to provide pyrotechnics elements and firework displays to both public sector and private corporate organisations.

==WTP Pyrotechnics==
'''WTP Pyrotechnics''' is a [[limited company]] who donate all their profits to Walk the Plank. This is a major source of income for Walk the Plank other than arts grants and donations. WTP Pyrotechnics creates [[fireshows]], [[firework]] displays, site-specific work, and outdoor spectacles ‚Äì producing work in landlocked and waterside locations. They have created shows on canals and rivers, in harbours and parks and town centres in the UK and abroad.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Past projects include site-specific events, fireshows and aquatic spectacle, working with [[pyrotechnics]], machines, music, large images, and mobile structures, performance, and fire; usually, one-off specially-commissioned pieces created for a particular site or occasion. The work is often on, near, or by water, but they work inland also.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
