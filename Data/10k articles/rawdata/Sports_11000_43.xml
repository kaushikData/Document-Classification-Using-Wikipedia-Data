The '''1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game''' was the most lopsided in the history of college [[American football|football]], with Georgia Tech winning 222–0.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news| work=[[The New York Times]]| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/sports/ncaafootball/07tech.html |accessdate=18 May 2015 |date=2006-10-07| title=In 1916, a Blowout for the Ages| last=Litsky| first=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dropped"&gt;{{cite book| title=You Dropped It, You Pick It Up| publisher=Ed's Publishing Company| location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana| last=Paul| first=Jim| isbn=99934-0-444-6| year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbp"&gt;{{cite news| title=Yellow Jackets-Cumberland Score Was Record One; Tops the List According to Statistics Compiled Showing All Scores Past the Century Mark| last=Davis| first=Parke H.| publisher=''The Atlanta Constitution''| date=1916-10-15| pages=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played on October 7, 1916, between the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Engineers]] and [[Cumberland University|Cumberland College]] Bulldogs at Grant Field (now a part of [[Bobby Dodd Stadium]]) in [[Atlanta]].

With Cumberland opting to punt on multiple possessions, the infamous score can be partially attributed to 97% of the game's plays occurring in Cumberland territory, with 64 of those plays occurring in Cumberland's own [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]].

==Background==
Cumberland College, a Presbyterian school in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]], had discontinued its football program before the season but was not allowed to cancel its game against the Engineers.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt; The fact that Cumberland's baseball team had crushed Georgia Tech earlier that year 22–0 (amidst allegations that Cumberland used professionals as [[List of sports idioms#R|ringers]]) probably accounted for Georgia Tech coach [[John Heisman]]'s [[running up the score]] on the Bulldogs, as Heisman was also Georgia Tech's baseball coach.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt; It is speculated that Heisman may have deliberately aimed for a score of exactly 222 as a numerically significant retaliation to Cumberland's 22.&lt;ref name="revisiting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/revisiting-georgia-tech-222-cumberland-0-and-how-it-may-have-saved-the-school/ |title=Revisiting Georgia Tech 222, Cumberland 0 and how it may have saved the school |date=2016-10-07 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted on the schools' scheduling agreement, which required Cumberland to pay $3,000 ({{Inflation|US|3000|1916|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to Tech if its football team failed to show.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt; In fact, Heisman actually paid Cumberland $500 ({{Inflation|US|500|1916|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) as an incentive to play the game; his letter to Cumberland's athletic department read in part:

{{quote|I hearby [sic] offer you the sum of $500 and an all-expenses-paid trip to Atlanta for your football team on the condition that you honor your contract by participating in and completing the Cumberland-Georgia Tech football game ... However, if this offer is refused ... I shall be forced to demand that your school reimburse the Tech Athletic Dept. in the amount of $3,000 for losses from the projected net gate receipts ...&lt;ref name="philly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1990-08-26/sports/25932112_1_cumberland-university-nick-coutras-georgia-tech |title=A Loss That Lives In Legend Cumberland Crashed In Football, 222-0 |date=1990-08-26 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

[[George E. Allen]] (who was elected to serve as Cumberland's football team student manager after first serving as the baseball team student manager) therefore put together a team of 12–16 players,{{efn|Conflicting sources report anywhere from 12 to 19 players (and of those 19, 3 got lost in Nashville and missed their train, leaving at most only 16 players).&lt;ref name="philly"/&gt;}} most of whom were his fraternity brothers, to travel to [[Atlanta]] as Cumberland's football team.&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt;

Another reason for Heisman's plan to run up the score was the practice among the sportswriters of the time to rank teams based upon how many points they scored.  Since this statistic did not account for the strength or weakness of a team's opponent, Heisman disagreed with the amount of weight the writers tended to assign to it, and he may have unleashed his players on Cumberland to make his point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Football Hall of Shame| last=Nash| first=Bruce |publisher=Schuster Merchandise| year=1990| isbn=978-0-671-72922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The game==
Cumberland received the opening [[kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]] and failed to make a [[down (gridiron football)|first down]]. After a [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]], the Engineers scored on their first play.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbp"/&gt; Cumberland then [[fumble]]d on their next play from the [[line of scrimmage]], and a Georgia Tech player returned the fumble for a [[touchdown]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbp"/&gt; The Bulldogs fumbled again on their next play, and it took Georgia Tech two [[Rush (gridiron football)|rush]]es to score its third touchdown.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbp"/&gt; Cumberland lost nine yards on its next possession, and Georgia Tech scored a fourth touchdown on another two-play drive.&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbp"/&gt;

Georgia Tech led 63–0 after the first quarter and 126–0 at [[halftime]]. Georgia Tech added 54 more points in the third quarter and 42 in the final period.&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbp"/&gt;

Georgia Tech scored a total of 32 touchdowns, and Georgia Tech's left end James Preas kicked 18 [[point after touchdown|extra points]].&lt;ref name= wp1916&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/145495409/ Makes a Record Score]". ''The Washington Post''. October 8, 1916. p. S3.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland's only effective defense was an extra point blocked with a sort of [[Pyramid Play|human pyramid]].&lt;ref name=dropped/&gt;

Several myths have developed around the game. Some have written that Cumberland did not have a single play that gained yards; in fact, its longest play was a 10-yard [[Forward pass|pass]] (on 4th-and-22&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt; or 3rd-and-18&lt;ref name="pbp"/&gt;). One page on Cumberland's website says Georgia Tech scored on every offensive play, but the play-by-play account of the game refutes this and suggests a more likely scenario: that Georgia Tech scored on every one of its sets of downs. However, neither team made a first down that was not also a touchdown, as Cumberland made no first downs in the entire game.&lt;ref name="pbp"/&gt;

Cumberland purportedly committed 15 [[Turnover (football)|turnovers]]—nine fumbles and six [[Interception|interceptions]]—during the game.

{{rquote|right|As a general rule, the only thing necessary for a touchdown was to give a Tech back the ball and holler, ‘Here he comes’ and ‘There he goes.’|''[[The Atlanta Journal]]'', 1916}}

Sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] wrote, "Cumberland's greatest individual play of the game occurred when fullback Allen circled right end for a 6-yard loss."&lt;ref name="philly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-09-16/sports/9003180423_1_cumberland-university-nick-coutras-georgia-tech |title=220-0-the Infamous Cumberland Gap |date=1990-09-16 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At halftime, Heisman reportedly told his players, "You're doing all right, team, we're ahead. But you just can't tell what those Cumberland players have up their sleeves. They may spring a surprise. Be alert, men! Hit 'em clean, but hit 'em hard!"&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramblinwreck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100606aab.html |title=A Monumental Victory |date=2006-10-06 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even Heisman relented, and shortened the third and fourth quarters from 15 minutes to 12.&lt;ref name="ramblinwreck"/&gt;

== Records ==
Since World War II, only a [[List of 100 point games in NCAA college football|handful of schools have topped 100 points]] in a college football game. The modern-era record for most points scored against a college opponent is 106 by [[Fort Valley State University|Fort Valley State]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] against [[Knoxville College]] in 1969. In the previous year [[Houston Cougars|Houston]] defeated [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane|Tulsa]] 100–6 to set the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] record in major college football. In 1949 the [[University of Wyoming]] defeated [[University of Northern Colorado]] 103–0. The Division III football scoring record was set in 1968 when [[North Park University]] defeated [[North Central College]] 104–32, using ten passing touchdowns along the way.&lt;ref name="northcentralcollege.edu"&gt;North Central College Football Record Book ({{cite web |url=http://northcentralcollege.edu/Documents/athletics/fb_record_book.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307203748/http://northcentralcollege.edu/Documents/athletics/fb_record_book.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The game ball had the score written on it as a memento. It was donated to the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] sports museum by Bill Schroeder, an avid sports collector. When the museum moved locations in the 1980s, the ball was boxed and remained in storage. In 2014, Ryan Schneider, a Georgia Tech alumnus, purchased the ball in a charity auction for $40,388 ($33,657 without [[buyer's premium]]), with the intention of donating it back to Georgia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Tech alum returning 222-0 ball to 'rightful place'| last=Sugiura| first=Ken| publisher=''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution''| date=2014-08-25| url=http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/college/tech-alum-returning-222-0-ball-to-rightful-place/ng8dq/ |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1956, a 40th reunion was held for players from both teams, of whom 28 were able to attend.&lt;ref name="ramblinwreck"/&gt; While reminiscing, one of the Cumberland players pointed out one play that saved Cumberland from an even worse defeat; had Cumberland punted as normal instead of running a [[quarterback sneak|sneak]], the score would probably have been 229–0.&lt;ref name="ramblinwreck"/&gt;

The FFL schedules two games at one location for saving on transportationcosts for referees and the costs of renting an ambulance and first aid responders. Half of the time, teams are playing virtually at home but actually play at the hosting team's homefield due to these costsaving measures.

'''Ali Mall''' is the first major shopping mall in the Philippines. It is located at [[Araneta Center]], [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]] beside [[SM Cubao]], and owned by The Araneta Center Inc. , a subsidiary of the [[Araneta Group]]. The mall was named in honor of boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], and was built in 1976, making it one of the oldest malls in the country.&lt;ref name="Imray"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kinshasa-manila-and-beyond-ali-enraptured-fans-everywhere/2016/06/04/12af11cc-2a58-11e6-8329-6104954928d2_story.html|title=Kinshasa, Manila and beyond, Ali enraptured fans everywhere|last=Imray|first=Gerald|date=4 June 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewsOK"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/article/feed/1022534|title=Ali's death rekindles memories of epic 'Thrilla in Manila'|date=4 June 2016|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Santiago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2014/08/04/philippine-businesses-of-yesteryears/|title=Philippine businesses of yesteryears|last=Santiago|first=Andrea|work=[[Manila Standard]]|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, they relaunched the new Cinemas (Alimall Cineplex 4) and Food Court (Food Plaza).

== History ==
Construction on the mall began in 1975 after [[Muhammad Ali]]'s boxing victory against [[Joe Frazier]] in Araneta Coliseum, dubbed "[[Thrilla in Manila]]".&lt;ref name="Santiago"/&gt; At the time there were no malls in the entire country, so Ali addressed a speech to the Philippines to build a shopping mall near the Araneta Center in honor of his victory, a shopping mall with a floor area of 62,000 sq.m.&lt;ref name="Imray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comeback"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aranetacenter.net/2008/archiveAlimallComeback.php |title=Ali Mall: First Ever Shopping Mall Makes A Comeback |accessdate=2 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902164449/http://www.aranetacenter.net/2008/archiveAlimallComeback.php |archivedate=2 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shopping mall was completed within the year and was inaugurated on June 30, 1976. Ali himself attended the ceremony.&lt;ref name="thearaneta"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alcazaren|first1=Alfred|last2=Yuson|first2=Paulo|title=The Araneta Center : the big dome and beyond|date=2008|contributor-last=Antonio|contributor-first=Hidalgo|contribution=Renewing Old Ties|isbn=9789719398103|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the mall has been undergoing expansions and renovations since its construction. In 2009, an expansion to Ali Mall was opened. There is also a bridge linking Ali Mall to nearby [[SM Cubao]].

In 2016, with the passing of the Boxing icon [[Muhammad Ali]], the mall paid tribute to Ali's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/hoy-san-diego/sdhoy-philippines-ali-mall-pays-tribute-to-boxing-legend-2016jun10-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bare-knuckle boxing''' (also known as '''bare-knuckle''', '''prizefighting''', '''fist fight''' or '''fisticuffs''') is the original form of [[boxing]], closely related to ancient [[combat sport]]s. It involves two individuals fighting without [[boxing gloves]] or other padding on their hands.

The difference between [[street fighting]] and a bare-knuckle boxing match is that the latter has an accepted set of rules, such as not striking a downed opponent.

==Early history==
The first bare-knuckle champion of England was [[James Figg]], who claimed the title in 1719 and held it until his retirement in 1730. Before Jack Broughton, the first idea of current boxing originated from James Figg, who is viewed as the organizer of cutting edge boxing. In 1719, he set up a 'pugilistic foundation' and charged himself as 'a professional in the Noble Science of Defense' to instruct boxers on the utilization of clench hands, sword, and quarterstaff. Noted champions were [[Jack Broughton]], [[Elizabeth Wilkinson]], [[Daniel Mendoza]], [[Jem Belcher]], [[Hen Pearce]], [[John Gully]], [[Tom Cribb]], [[Tom Spring]], [[Jem Ward]], [[James Burke (boxer)|James Burke]], [[William Thompson (boxer)|William "Bendigo" Thompson]], [[Ben Caunt]], [[William Perry (boxer)|William Perry]], [[Tom Sayers]] and [[Jem Mace]].&lt;ref name="BKC"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.georgianindex.net/Sport/Boxing/champ-boxers.html |title=The Bare Knuckle Champions of England |accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record for the longest bare-knuckle fight is listed as 6&amp;nbsp;hours and 15&amp;nbsp;minutes for a match between James Kelly and Jonathan Smith, fought near Fiery Creek, Victoria, Australia, on December&amp;nbsp;3, 1855, when Smith gave in after 17 rounds.&lt;ref name="Bells Life in Sidney and Sporting Reviewer"&gt;{{citation |title=The Victoria Ring |newspaper=[[Bell's Life in Sydney and Sporting Reviewer]] |date=22 December 1855 |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page5326638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bare-knuckle fighter [[Jem Mace]] is listed as having the longest professional career of any fighter in history.&lt;ref name="Bare Knuckle Records"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trivia-library.com/a/strange-trivia-in-sports-boxing.htm|title=Synonyms Thesaurus With Definitions and Antonyms|work=trivia-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fought for more than 35&amp;nbsp;years into his 60s,&lt;ref&gt;James B. Roberts, Alexander G. Skutt, [https://www.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aA2LO_DGdu4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=jem+mace+boxer&amp;ots=4vq4IwfUIo&amp;sig=oGsBbyh-GYQ5tBgfXKKx0BFr54o#v=onepage&amp;q=mace&amp;f=false ''The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book'']&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded his last exhibition bout in 1909 at the age of 79.

Professional bare-knuckle boxing was never legal under any federal or state laws in the United States until Wyoming became the first to legalize on March 20, 2018. Prior to that date, the chief sanctioning organization for bare-knuckle boxing was the magazine ''[[National Police Gazette]]'', which set up matches and issued championship belts throughout the 1880s. The ''Police Gazette'' sanctioned what is considered the last major bare-knuckle heavyweight world championship, between [[John L. Sullivan]] and [[Jake Kilrain]] on July 8, 1889, with Sullivan emerging as the victor.&lt;ref name="Gazette_4-16-2018"&gt;[http://policegazette.us/index.php/2018/04/16/lineal-police-gazette-championships-revived/ National Police Gazette, 16 Apr 2018, p.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mastrofist&gt;{{citation |last=Mastro |first=Tim |title=Fistful of Danger |newspaper=[[The News Journal]] |date=13 August 2011 |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110813/NEWS/108130346/-1/NLETTER01/Fistful-of-danger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other claimants to being sanctioned bare-knuckle championship bouts include the August 5, 2011, match at Fort McDowell Casino on the Yavapai Nation reservation in Arizona. The Native American tribe sanctioned the bout between Rich Stewart of [[New Castle, Delaware]] and [[Bobby Gunn]], with Gunn emerging as the victor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woods|first1=Michael|title=Reviving a bygone, bare-knuckle era|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/6835788/bringing-back-bygone-bare-knuckle-era-boxing|accessdate=June 17, 2015|work=[[ESPN]]|date=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noted champions were [[Tom Hyer]], [[Yankee Sullivan]], [[Nonpareil Dempsey]], [[Tom Sharkey]], [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] and [[John Morrissey]].

===Techniques===
While boxing has always included punching, historically it also included grappling techniques like throws, arm locks, chokes as well as kicks. These techniques were banned during the several rule changes which turned classical pugilism, or bare knuckle boxing, into the modern sport of boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawson |first=Kirk |date=3 June 2011 |title=Banned from Boxing - The forgotten grappling techniques of Classic Pugilism|publisher=lulu.com |isbn=9781257140244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish stand down==
"Irish stand down" is a type of traditional bare knuckle fighting where the aspect of maneuvering around the ring is removed, leaving only the less nuanced aspects of punching and "taking" punches. This form of combat was popular in Irish American ghettos in the United States in the late 19th century but was eclipsed in the [[Irish American]] community first by bare knuckle boxing and then later by regulation boxing. The Irish stand down is also known as strap fighting or toe to toe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Modern Bare Knuckle Combat==
Modern Bareknuckle Combat, a contemporary form of fist fight, exists on a small scale worldwide, however, recently it has been making its way into the public eye.

In the United States, publicly ticketed events started in the 1990s in the Rocky Mountains, promoted by Jim Smith's Poorboys Professional Boxing. In 2007, Corey Williams and his promotion Who's Your Daddy Productions stepped onto the scene. After years of false starts due to claims that the sport was "brutal" Mr. Williams conducted a medical study proving that bare knuckle combat is in fact safer than its gloved counterpart. Mr. Williams medical research and his publicly ticketed events in Wyoming lead to the States Combat Sports Commission to becoming the first to legitimize the sport of Bare Knuckle Fighting by sanctioning it.

In the United Kingdom, promoters Joe Brown and Jim Freeman Dove (following a visit to America to observe Mr. Williams program) have made strides furthering bare knuckle combat in England. Their promotion, BKB, was the first legal Bare Knuckle promotion in the United Kingdom. There are now several UK promotions successfully conducting shows including UBKB, Rouge Elite and Barefist.

Bare Knuckle Fighting bouts have several changes from traditional gloved boxing rules, notably there is a 20-second count on any knockdown and the fights consist of 3x2 minute rounds, 5x2/7x2 on title fights.

BKB has put on shows all over the United Kingdom including prestigious venues such as the Echo Arena in Liverpool and the O2 Arena in London. BKB have fighters with backgrounds from professional boxing and MMA promotions such as [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] and [[Bellator MMA|Bellator]].

==Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship==
David Feldman was able to get a fully sanctioned bare knuckle boxing match on Saturday, June 2 in Cheyenne, WY, which was the first-ever legal, regulated, and sanctioned bare-knuckle fight the U.S. in 130 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fastcompany.com/40579781/bareknuckle-fighting-makes-its-fully-legal-return-after-130-years&lt;/ref&gt; A second fight was sanctioned in Biloxi, Mississippi on Aug 26, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fightsports.tv/bkfc-ceo-on-early-success-of-bare-knuckle-fighting/&lt;/ref&gt; A third fight was sanctioned in on October 20, 2018 in Biloxi.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.bjpenn.com/bare-knuckle-boxing/bare-knuckle-fc-3-results-kendall-grove-suffers-brutal-ko-loss-to-marcel-stamps-videos/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cameroonian National Paralympic Committee''' ({{lang-fr|Comité national paralympique camerounais}}, '''CNPC''') is the primary [[Sports governing body|body]] in [[Cameroon]] for the promotion of sports for people with disabilities.  It has four member organizations: [[Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Visually Impaired]] (FECASDEV),  [[Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Physically Disabled]] (FECASDEP),  [[Cameroonian Federation of Sports the Intellectually Disabled]]  (FECASDI) and the [[Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Deaf]] (FECASSO). The President of the Cameroonian Paralympic Committee is [[Jean Jacques Ndoudoumou]]. The organization has four vice presidents, who all serve as the presidents of CNPC's member organizations.

The CNPC's history dates to the early 2010s, following a period where the country's previous [[National Paralympic Committee]] (NPC) had poor relations with the [[government of Cameroon]] and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC).  After the CNPC was formally created and recognized by law, the created a strategic plan and set about capacity building activities.  The CNPC has some funding via grants and sponsorship.  Future success for the CNPC is perceived by insiders as being dependent on government support for the Paralympic movement in Cameroon.

Following the formal legislative creation of the CNPC in 2011, the organization and its four new member organizations had 30 days to hold elections for the boards of these organizations. Candidates to head the CNPC were already known prior to the election announcement, with FECASH Chairman Abeng Mbozo'o having bowed out of contention before then.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The process leading to the CNPC's creation began in March 2011.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The organization changed their name to "Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)" on August 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camerounparalympique.org/download/clientfiles/files/PLAN%20STRATEGIQUE%20CNPC%202013-2016.doc|title=Plan Strategique 2013-2016 due Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)|last=CNPC|first=|date=2013|website=Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|language=fr-FR|access-date=October 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329202140/http://www.camerounparalympique.org/download/clientfiles/files/PLAN%20STRATEGIQUE%20CNPC%202013-2016.doc#|archive-date=2016-03-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name change and changes in the law signaled  major change in the organization.  In December 2011 in [[Beijing]], the CNPC participated in their first IPC Congress.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  The changes normalized the CNPC's relationship with the International Paralympic Committee, and the country's athletes were then eligible to compete in some competitions because of the Paralympic Solidarity program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The CNPC developed a strategic plan for period of 2013 to 2016. This plan was designed to prepare the country for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. It had seven major objectives.  These included improving organizational structure, developing human and institutional resources, sustaining and improving para-sports physical infrastructure and sporting equipment, increase awareness of para-sports, creating athlete development pathways, and ensure Cameroonian participation in national and international events.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The NPC had their first website in 2012 as part of efforts by the International Paralympic Committee to increase the digital presence for its member nations.  This website was designed with the goal of providing information for sportspeople on the local level all the way up to the elite level of Paralympic sport in Cameroon. The website was in French.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-launches-first-official-website-npc-el-salvador|title=IPC launches first official website for NPC El Salvador|last=IPC|first=|date=July 9, 2013|website=International Paralympic Committee|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1010546/ipc-launches-new-websites-for-cameroon-and-panama|title=IPC launches new websites for Cameroon and Panama|last=Gold|first=David|date=July 27, 2012|website=Inside the Games|publisher=Inside the Games|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2012, the NPC participated in an athletics (track and field) training seminar organized by the IPC in Dakar, Senegal for French speaking African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camerounparalympique.org/projets/|title=Projets - International Paralympic Committee|last=Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)|first=|date=2016|website=Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|language=fr-FR|access-date=October 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406001610/http://www.camerounparalympique.org/projets/#|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Marie Aléokol Mabiemé co-wrote a guide called, "Guide du Sport pour Personne vivant avec un Handicap".  In 2014, he was a trainer at a CONFEJES event in Yaoundé organized by the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education and the Paralympic Committee of Cameroon.  Twenty sports administrators from four Central African countries participated in the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.confejes.org/formation-des-formateurs-du-sport-pour-les-personnes-vivant-avec-un-handicap/|title=Formation des formateurs du sport pour les personnes vivant avec un handicap - Confejes|last=|first=|date=July 17, 2014|work=|newspaper=Confejes|language=fr-FR|access-date=October 12, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the NPC hosted a capacity building workshop in coordination with the [[IPC Academy]].  Capacity building inside NPCs like Cameroon was part of the IPC's Strategic Plan to improve NPC capacity and efficiency in governance, management, leadership and sport promotion in member countries.  Other countries that held similar workshops in 2013 and 2014 included [[Ghana]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Haiti]], [[Liberia]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Serbia]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Vanuatu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/npcs-positively-progress-towards-developing-para-sport|title=NPCs positively progress towards developing para-sport|last=IPC|first=|date=May 21, 2014|website=International Paralympic Committee|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
One of the sources for funding of the disability sports movement in Cameroon has been [[Agitos Foundation]] grants. In 2014, the NPC received a grant to promote Paralympic Sport in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/video/29-agitos-foundation-grows-paralympic-movement-globally|title=29 Agitos Foundation grows Paralympic Movement globally|last=|first=|date=2014|website=International Paralympic Committee|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPC received a grant of €800 ahead of the Rio Games to promote Paralympic and para-sports before, during and after the Paralympic Games.  This grant was part of the Organisational Capacity Programme (OCP).  The money was used by Cameroon to host a come and try it event in July 2016, and used to get additional media coverage from radio and television news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/countries-receive-support-awareness-campaigns|title=Countries to receive support for awareness campaigns|last=|first=|date=June 17, 2016|website=International Paralympic Committee|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, the CNPC signed a sponsorship agreement with MACRON to provide the kit for the Cameroon team at the 2016 Summer Paralympics.  The CNPC viewed this historic sponsorship deal as important towards the continued professionalization of Paralympic sport in Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camerounparalympique.org/centre-de-presse/news/|title=News News|last=Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)|first=|date=2016|website=Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|language=fr-FR|access-date=October 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329202148/http://www.camerounparalympique.org/centre-de-presse/news/#|archive-date=2016-03-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success going forward in the Paralympic movement is perceived by those involved with para-sports in Cameroon as being dependent on the government for continued and increased support.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Cochrane Cup''' has been competed for since 1961 by the Men's Varsity Eight [[College rowing (United States)|rowing]] teams of [[Dartmouth College]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and [[Wisconsin Badgers Crew|Wisconsin]].

The cup was placed in competition by Mrs. Edward Cochrane in 1961 for heavyweight races among Dartmouth, MIT and Wisconsin.  The cup is named after Admiral Edward L. Cochrane, former president of M.I.T., and director of the Navy’s Bureau of Ships. After one race of one mile (1961), one of 1.75 miles (1962) and another of two miles (1963), the cup has been raced on a 2000-meter course ever since.

The cup is named after Adm. [[Edward L. Cochrane]] of the Navy's [[Bureau of Ships]] who is a former president of [[MIT]].

'''Danish Longball''' (also known as ''Swedick longball'') is a [[Bat-and-ball games|bat-and-ball]] game founded in [[Denmark]].  It is popular in some  [[British people|British]] secondary schools {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}, and is also played recreationally by [[scouts]], the [[Air Training Corps]] and by the [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] and [[Australian Navy]].  It is also a popular sport at U.S. [[summer camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Joy|title=Danish Longball: A Novel game to introduce the batting/ fielding games category|url=http://ubcpete.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/danish-longball.pdf|publisher=UBC PETE Association|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
Danish Longball can be described as a hybrid of [[baseball]] and [[cricket]]. There is a modern variant that is based on [[football]]&lt;ref name=21st&gt;{{cite web|title=Danish Longball Football |url=http://21stbournemouth.org.uk/games/?p=93 |publisher=21st Group Games Database |accessdate=5 July 2013 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; too. Each team takes turns batting and fielding. In British secondary schools in particular, an element of [[dodgeball]] is incorporated, with a player being "out" if he or she  is hit with the ball (outside the safety zone) below the head whilst aiming to get a run.

===Teams and positions===
Players are split into two teams, a batting team and a balling team. The batting team waits behind the batting goal ready to bat. The balling team is spread behind the batting goal and the safe goal ready to field.

===Field of play===
The batting field has two parts: Inside and outside a square (or circle). Fielders can position themselves inside or outside the square. The fielder who fields the ball cannot move with it rather they must pass it to another fielder in a better position to hit the runner.

===Equipment===
*ball, usually a [[tennis ball]]
*bat/tennis racket
*optional safety pads

===Rules===
The bowler pitches the ball to the batter, who must use their bat to hit the ball. The ball must be hit within the field of play – the square. The ball must hit the ground at least once before it bounces or rolls off the field. The batter must then run to the other side of the square to a "safe zone".  The runner may rest in safety, but to earn a "run" they must make it safely back to the original side of the square without getting out. Each side bats its entire line-up.  Five rounds of play are recommended.

When played in Britain it is usually an alternative to Cricket, so timed [[innings]] may be used along with a set of stumps (though usually not a cricket ball, as the risk of injury is significantly raised rather than a tennis ball).

A player is out if 
* The hit is caught by one of the fielding team
* the ball does not touch the ground of the marked area
* or if the fielders hits a runner outside the safe-zones with the ball. 
* he/she runs outside the side lines of the square.

A variant of the above is sometimes used: if a fielder hits a runner with the ball outside the safe-zones then the entire batting team is out.

== Winning the game==
The winning team is the one that scores the most runs.

:''This article refers to a play.  For the book by [[Shalom Auslander]] see ''[[Foreskin's Lament: A Memoir]]''.''
'''''Foreskin's Lament''''' is a landmark play in the history of New Zealand theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/ephemera/43968/foreskins-lament-1981|title=Foreskin's lament, 1981|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the breakthrough play for its writer, [[Greg McGee]], and was initially workshopped at the New Zealand Playwrights' Conference in Wellington in 1980, and has since become a staple of New Zealand theatre. Being produced as it was immediately before and during the social unrest of the [[1981 Springbok Tour]] of New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11030|title=Nothing lamentable in play's latest outing|date=2000-06-30|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; it hit a nerve with the public and was named Best New Zealand Play of 1981.

The play is a drama set in a [[rugby union]] changing room after a practice, and at an after-match party. The captain is kicked in the head off-stage at the beginning of the first act, and again during the game between acts. He dies in hospital during the second act. The theme is the conflict between fair play and winning at all costs, and the non-conformist lead character Foreskin's struggle to reconcile his university liberal values with those of his rugby-playing conservative mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/profiles/549211/Greg-McGee-and-telling-tales|title=Greg McGee and telling tales|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play ends with Foreskin directly addressing the audience in a monologue - or rather interrogation - filled with rugby allusions, questioning their own values, ending with the repeated question, "Whaddarya?" (usually used in New Zealand to question someone's masculinity). Early performances left audiences in stunned silence. In some productions Foreskin undresses during the lament and finishes nude.

In New Zealand a rugby union player is an everyman, and the game and play present a model of society.  Set in 1976, it looks forward to the 1981 Springbok Tour. It has been suggested {{by whom?|date=May 2018}} the misnamed character "Clean" was based on [[Rob Muldoon]]. The script was updated after the 1981 tour and was later heavily revised by the author for filming as ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382303/ Skin and Bones]''.

{{Formula One|lists}}
'''Formula One sponsorship liveries''' have been used since the late 1960s, replacing the previously used [[list of international auto racing colors|national colours]]. With [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] becoming more important with the rising costs in Formula One, many teams wanted to be able to display the logos of their sponsors as clearly as possible.

The liveries are usually changed for every season in the sport, marking the marketing ideas of the sponsors. Many teams keep some consistency over the years however, like the red colour of Ferrari, which has its origin in a shade of red known as [[rosso corsa]] being the national racing colour of Italy. Tobacco and alcohol advertising was common in motorsport, however as bans spread throughout the world teams used an alternate livery which alluded to the tobacco or alcohol sponsor, or entirely eliminated their name when in nations with a ban – this is now only seen on Ferrari's Marlboro sponsored vehicles – where the sponsor is technically banned from advertising in all host nations. At historical events, cars are allowed to use the livery which was used when the car was actively competing.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix K to the International sporting code, section 2.1.10&lt;/ref&gt;

==AGS==
[[Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives]] (AGS) were founded in [[Gonfaron]], France, in the late 1960s, but only entered Formula One in 1986.

==Alfa Romeo==
[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] was a Formula One constructor between 1950 and 1951, and again between 1979 and 1985. In 1950–1951 and 1979 the team used the [[rosso corsa]] (racing red) national color of Italy. In 1980 they switched to a livery sponsored by [[Phillip Morris International|Phillip Morris']] [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarette brand. In 1984 the Italian clothing brand [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] took over Alfa Romeo's livery sponsorship, which they held until the withdrawal of Alfa Romeo from Formula One at the end of 1985.

==Arrows==
Starting in the 1970s and going for decades until ending in mid-2002, [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]], that was known as Footwork for a few years in the 1990s, had quite distinctive liveries, like the unusual Ruffles sponsorship in Footwork, an all-black car in the 1998 season, and an orange car in its final years.

==Benetton==
[[Benetton Formula|Benetton Formula Ltd.]], commonly referred to simply as Benetton, was a Formula One constructor that participated from 1986 to 2001. The team was owned by the Benetton family who run a worldwide chain of clothing stores of the same name. In 2000 the team was purchased by Renault, but competed as Benetton for the 2001 season. In 2002 the team became [[Renault F1]]. From the 1991 to 1993, [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]] sponsored the Benetton team, but, from the 1994 to 2001 the main sponsor was [[Mild Seven]].

==BMS Scuderia Italia==

In its Dallara years, Scuderia Italia raced with a livery slightly similar to Ferrari (rosso corsa with white details and black wings), but prior to the absorption by Minardi in 1993, when raced with Lola cars, had a white livery with red and yellow flames.

==BMW Sauber==
After having been an engine supplier in the 1980s and again since 2000, [[BMW]] entered Formula One with a works team of its own in [[2006 Formula One season|2006]] after buying the Swiss Formula One constructor [[Sauber]]. Although the cars had many sponsorship logos on them, the main pattern was based on the traditional [[BMW Motorsport]] team colours of white with light blue, dark blue and a little red (in an almost purple shade). White is also the original [[List of international auto racing colors|national racing colour]] of Germany, while white and blue are the colours of [[Bavaria]] and of BMW itself.

On 27 November 2009, BMW agreed to sell the team back to its original founder, [[Peter Sauber]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/bmwsauber/6669774/Formula-One-team-BMW-agree-deal-with-Peter-Sauber.html Formula One team BMW agree deal with Peter Sauber]'' telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 3 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2010 Formula One season]] marked Sauber's return as an independent constructor.

==Brabham==
Prior to sponsorships, Brabham raced in turquoise with a gold band running across the car. This later changed to green and gold, the racing colours of Australia. In 1975 and 1976, Brabham received sponsorship from [[Martini &amp; Rossi|Martini]]; in 1976 the color scheme changed from white to red with light blue trim. The primary sponsor changed to [[Parmalat]] in 1978, with the cars retaining a variant of the same red and blue colors. With the team's switch to BMW engines in 1982, the new livery consisted of a clean dark blue and white with a stylized BMW "kidney grille" on the nose. This scheme was retained throughout the BMW years, even through a sponsorship change to [[Olivetti]] in 1984, until 1989. (This unusual representation of the engine supplier, specifically BMW, in the color scheme was revived by Williams when they debuted their own BMW cars in 2000.) In 1989, Brabham signed with Bioptron, a brand of [[Philip Zepter|Zepter International]], which continued until the team was bought by Middlebridge Group. Since then, it was sponsored by many Japanese companies like Garage Italiya, a company that imports Italian cars in Japan, Autobacs, Nippon Shinpan, and Mitsukoshi. Prior the swansong of Brabham in 1992, the team raced in blue and pink livery of the Japanese metal group [[Seikima-II]].

==Brawn GP==
After Honda pulled out of F1 at the end of 2008, team boss Ross Brawn struggled to find a buyer to save the team, eventually buying it himself. A lack of sponsors resulted in the white livery, with flashes of bright yellow and black. Towards the end of the season, the team arranged one-race sponsor deals with a variety of major local companies, including [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Mapfre]], [[Itaipava]] and [[Qtel]].

[[Brawn GP]] dominated the early part of the 2009 season, with Jenson Button winning six of the first seven races. As other teams improved their cars Brawn struggled for pace, but still recorded several podiums during the rest of the year.  Their strong start and consistent finish was enough to secure the Constructors World Championship at the first (and only) attempt, as well as the drivers title with Jenson Button. At the end of the season, the team was purchased by engine suppliers Mercedes-Benz, marking the return of the Silver Arrows after 55 years.

==British American Racing==
[[British American Racing]] competed in Formula One from 1999 to 2005. The name of the team was taken from [[British American Tobacco]] which provided the main sponsorship and was livery sponsor through two of its main cigarette brands.  In their debut season, the team wished to have its two cars painted in different liveries (one 555, the other Lucky Strike), but this was forbidden by the rules.  So the team decided on a unique two-sided design, with the blue 555 livery of the right side of the car, and the red and white Luckies livery on the left and a zipper design on the middle.

==Caterham==
The [[Team Lotus (2010–11)|Lotus team, which made its début in 2010]], was renamed to [[Caterham F1]] in {{F1|2012}}. It was formally from Malaysia but still had a livery dominated by [[British racing green]], like the old Lotus team had for many years.

==Ferrari==
In keeping with their Italian roots, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] has always kept a red colour in the tradition of [[rosso corsa]], the national racing colour of Italy, except for two races in 1964 when Enzo Ferrari let his cars enter by [[North American Racing Team|NART]] in American blue and white colours to protest against Italian racing authorities. Over the years, rosso corsa has been combined with white parts and with various sponsorship schemes, but Ferrari has never fully let their cars be dominated by the sponsorship livery like many other teams have. This changed in the 1990s when Ferrari replaced their traditional rosso corsa colour with a "Marlboro red" which is noticeably lighter; this colour remains despite the ban on tobacco sponsorship.

The team used special livery for [[2001 Italian Grand Prix]] in remembrance of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the [[United States]]; both cars ran without any sponsorship livery and sported matte black nose-cones. In the [[2005 Bahrain Grand Prix]] the cars sported black nosecones as a sign of mourning for Pope John Paul II.

|rowspan=10|Due to a total tobacco livery ban, from 2008 onwards only a "bar code" has been used instead of the Marlboro logo.  As of the [[2010 Spanish Grand Prix]], even the "bar code" was removed on allegations of subliminal tobacco advertising. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was replaced in 2011 with a new 'Scuderia Ferrari' logo, which uses a similar graphical design to the Marlboro logo while purporting to be a team logo and is placed in the main areas the previous barcode was visible. Philip Morris's sponsorship deal with Ferrari has been extended to 2015.  In May 2015, another deal between The Philip Morris group and Ferrari took place, extending the sponsor deal until 2018, and in August 2017 another "multi-year" deal was signed.

==Hill==

The [[Embassy Hill]], founded by two-time World Champion [[Graham Hill]], raced during the 1975 season with Imperial Tobacco's Embassy brand as title sponsor.  The cars were predominantly white, with a red vertical stripe behind the cockpit.  The team folded following the aircraft accident in which Hill, driver [[Tony Brise]] and four other team members were killed in November 1975.

==Honda==
[[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] first raced in Formula One from [[1964 Formula One season|1964]] to [[1968 Formula One season|1968]]. The cars were entered in an all-white livery with a red circle, duplicating the [[Flag of Japan|Japanese flag]]. The company won several races but left F1 at the end of the 1968 season, before returning as an engine supplier in the 1980s. Honda in the 1990s never raced, but created prototypes like the RC 100 and the RA099 tested at Suzuka Circuit.
After a decade away from the sport, Honda returned again as an engine supplier in [[2001 Formula One season|2001]], before buying the [[British American Racing]] team and entering F1 as a constructor in [[2006 Formula One season|2006]].
For the 2006 season, Honda continued with the [[British American Tobacco|BAT]] sponsorship with the Lucky Strike logo, but BAT pulled out for 2007. From 2007, the only logos on the car are the [[Honda]] badge, the [[Bridgestone]] logo, and the logo of Honda's environmental awareness program, Earth Dreams. For 2007, the livery itself was a picture of the Earth on a black background. For 2008, however, there are only pieces of the image of Earth on a mainly white background, as opposed to the whole of the Earth being on Honda's car.

==HRT==
The [[HRT F1|HRT Formula 1 Team]] competed for just three seasons, between [[2010 Formula One season|2010]] and [[2012 Formula One season|2012]]. In that time, the team competed with three different liveries, this was due to a lack of sponsor continuity.

==Lotus (2012–2015)==

The [[Renault in Formula One|Renault team]] was renamed to [[Lotus F1 Team|Lotus]] in 2012, following an agreement with [[Caterham F1]]. The team is owned by Luxembourg-based venture capital group [[Genii Capital]] and named after its branding partner [[Group Lotus]]. Its livery, introduced back in 2011 with [[Renault R31]], was designed as a tribute to the [[Team Lotus]] cars of 1981–1986 and their famous [[John Player &amp; Sons|John Player Special]] liveries.

==Mercedes-Benz==

[[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes-Benz]] first competed in [[Formula One]] during the {{f1|1954}} and {{f1|1955}} seasons. This was in the time before sponsorship liveries and the team was using an all silver livery, the national racing color of Germany. The team was absent from Formula One after this, returning in {{f1|1994}} as an engine supplier.

Mercedes-Benz rejoined [[Formula One]] as a team in {{f1|2010}} after having purchased the [[Brawn GP]] team on 16 November 2009. On 21 December 2009 it signed a €30 million per season contract with [[Petronas]] as
''title sponsor''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2009/12/mercedes-lands-e30-million-petronas-sponsorship/ Mercedes lands €30 million Petronas sponsorship.]'' jamesallenonf1.com. Retrieved 29 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 January 2010 Mercedes GP unveiled the car livery for the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://f1.gpupdate.net/en/formula-1-news/226604/mercedes-reveals-2010-livery/ Mercedes reveals 2010 livery.]{{cbignore}}{{dead link|date=February 2015}}'' f1.gpupdate.net/en/. Retrieved 27 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The blueish green livery color of Petronas is just present as fine lines at the side of the car, which overall is mainly painted in silver like the old time Mercedes race cars of the 1930s and 1950s.

The deal with Sauber lasted until the end of the {{f1|2004}} season.

Since its first season in {{f1|2005}} the car livery did not change much, always keeping Red Bull as the main sponsor. This changed in [[2013 Formula One season|2013]], when [[Infiniti]] became the team's title sponsor and Red Bull's branding on the car was reduced.

Red Bull have used special liveries on multiple occasions, supporting the release up upcoming films and company's charity program Wings for Life.

Retrieved 3 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning, the team used to have the same name and sponsors as its parent team, with the major difference being the presence of a scarlet "charging bull" painted over the engine cowling.

==Williams==
[[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]], as a major constructor, is rare in modern F1 in that they have no manufacturer backing.  Over the years, their supply of engines and other major components has often changed, meaning that their livery is renewed more often than most of their rivals.  Sponsors of Williams can often have the livery dramatically changed, which has helped to keep Williams competitively financed since [[1978 Formula One season|1978]], when Williams first entered as a constructor.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://williams.latphoto.co.uk/?page=Images&amp;cat=1 Photography archive.]''williamsf1.com. Retrieved 3 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The BMW-engined Williams cars from 2001-2006 featured a dark blue and white scheme with stylized BMW "kidney grille", which resembled Brabham's BMW-engined cars from the 1980s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3236">The '''Gundersen method''' is a method in the [[Nordic combined]] developed by [[Gunder Gundersen]], a Nordic combined athlete from [[Norway]], that was first used in the 1980s. This technique turned the [[cross country skiing]] part of the Nordic combined from a point-based system where all athletes ski in an [[Time trial|interval start]] manner and whoever earned the most points with the [[ski jumping]] part of the Nordic combined won the event to a [[pursuit racing|pursuit]] race for the cross country skiing part where whoever crossed the finish line first in the cross country skiing part of the Nordic combined event won the competition. This parallels the [[modern pentathlon]] in which the start times of the final event (a cross-country run) are also staggered so that the first to cross the finish line is the winner of the entire event.

Initially put in at the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1985]] and at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]], the event point-time differential has been adjusted at every [[Winter Olympics]]. The table below is one point difference at the ski jump equaliing a specific number of seconds between skiers or teams at the start of the cross country portion of the event.

'''Heaton Stadium''' was a [[baseball stadium]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]], United States. It was the home field of the [[Augusta Pirates]]/[[Augusta GreenJackets]] [[Minor League Baseball]] team of the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[South Atlantic League]] from 1988 to 1994. After the 1994 season the site was redeveloped as the GreenJackets' next home, [[Lake Olmstead Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Similar" /&gt;

Heaton Stadium was named for Bill Heaton, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and partner in the team ownership who worked for six years to bring a minor league club to Augusta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Macon Baseball Franchise to Move to Augusta |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-11/sports/sp-13568_1_minor-league-baseball |accessdate=November 11, 2018 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 11, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton reportedly built the stadium with his own money,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mullins |first1=Robert A. |title=12 Monkeys &amp; a Green Jacket |date=May 2014 |publisher=[[Xlibris Corporation]] |isbn=9781493189717 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiyeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=Bill-Heaton+augusta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CDzBFHiOn6&amp;sig=3Qf-BwFk-XWdHL2Lqdrr0gWuDxc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiitN6hq9ncAhWTHjQIHZ5WB0UQ6AEwEnoECFYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bill-Heaton%20augusta&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembling bleachers bought from other locations&lt;ref name="heaton-builds"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirby |first1=Bill |title=WAY WE WERE: Bill Heaton builds a ballfield, lures a team |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/2017-09-03/way-we-were-bill--ballfield-lures-team |accessdate=November 11, 2018 |work=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |date=September 3, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904035853/http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/2017-09-03/way-we-were-bill-heaton-builds-ballfield-lures-team |archivedate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of volunteers and high school workers paid minimum wage.&lt;ref name="heaton-builds" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boyette |first1=John |title=Bill Heaton, who brought minor league baseball back to Augusta, dies |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/sports/2017-08-08/bill-heaton-who-brought-minor-league-baseball-back-augusta-dies |accessdate=November 11, 2018 |work=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |date=August 8, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209113140/http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/sports/2017-08-08/bill-heaton-who-brought-minor-league-baseball-back-augusta-dies |archivedate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard Head''' (July 31, 1914 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] – March 3, 1991) was an [[aeronautical engineer]] who is credited with the invention of the first commercially successful aluminum [[laminate]] [[skis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skiing History journal: A short history of skis|url=https://skiinghistory.org/history/short-history-skis-0|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oversized [[tennis racket]]. Head founded the ski (and later tennis racquet) making firm [[Head (company)|Head]] in 1950. Later he became chairman of [[Prince Sports|Prince]] Manufacturing Inc. The U.S. [[patents]] for the laminate skis and oversized tennis racket are in the name of Howard Head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Howard Head|url=http://www.chrisoleary.com/projects/TheParadoxOfPain/Documents/TheParadoxOfPain_TheStoryOfHowardHead.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ski equipment ==
[[File:Ski.jpg|thumb|right|90px|A Head Ski Company alpine ski, 2006 model.]]
In 1947, Howard Head was an aircraft engineer for [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and went [[Alpine skiing|skiing]] for the first time. Head was frustrated with the quality of the clumsy and heavy wooden skis, which made skiing very difficult for beginners. He decided to develop a lighter and more efficient ski that could make skiing much easier for everyone. He left his job and devoted all his time and energy to developing the skis and supported himself with earnings from [[poker]].

The skis developed by Head were based on the structural principles that he had learned during his experience as an aircraft engineer. In a warehouse he rented from Albert Gunther Inc in an alley off of Biddle Street in downtown Baltimore, he used a technique known as metal sandwich construction. The first skis he made consisted of two light layers of [[aluminum]] bonded to sidewalls of thin [[plywood]], with a center filling of honeycomb plastic.  Although these skis were very light, they all broke quite quickly during trials.  Head did not give up on his idea, and was encouraged by several professional skiers, including 1939 World Champion [[Emile Allais]] and ski instructors Clif Taylor and Neil Robinson, who assured Head that he would love to use his skis if they did not break.  Throughout that winter Head would make a ski pair and send it out to Robinson, who returned it to Head after it broke.  Head figured out the flaws of his design, came up with modifications, sent the new ski pair to Robinson, and the process repeated. By the end of the winter of 1947, Head came up with skis that were as strong as wooden skis but were half the weight.

In order to make his skis more efficient, Head made several other changes, like substituting plywood for honeycomb plastic, covering the bottom of the ski with polyethylene to avoid the problem of icy bottoms and adopting continuous steel edges to harden the edges of the ski.  The new improved skis were almost as heavy as the conventional wooden skis, but were stronger and easier to control.  Head skis helped to popularize alpine skiing in the U.S.; the innovative equipment made turning significantly easier.

In 1950, Head founded the Head Ski Company, which became very successful.  Within a couple of years it was the major supplier of alpine skis in the [[United States of America|U.S.]] and influenced ski design worldwide. The company later diversified into [[tennis]] and other racquet sports; its most notable product was the innovative [[Arthur Ashe]] racquet, constructed of aluminum honeycomb. Howard Head sold the company to [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] in 1969 and retired.  After a number of takeovers and acquisitions, [[Head (company)|HEAD, N.V.]] is currently based in [[Kennelbach]], Austria (operational) and [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] (corporate offices).

== Tennis racquet ==
After retiring, Head decided to take tennis lessons and for this purpose he got himself a tennis ball machine, which was manufactured by [[Prince Sports|Prince Manufacturing Inc.]]  Although Howard was not very good at tennis, he figured out that the equipment for the game needed a lot of improvement or he was going to need a lot more practice. To begin with he became the majority shareholder and chairman of the board of Prince.  While Head considerably improved the design of the ball machine, he still did not get any better at the game. He figured it out that it was because of the small sweet-spot of the tennis racquet.  In order to make the game of tennis easier, Head came up with the design of oversized racquet.  He filed and obtained a patent that covered tennis racquets with size 95–135 square inches.  He also pioneered the development of the [[graphite]] racquet, which eventually became the industry standard, replacing wooden racquets.

Although Prince was the first company to patent oversize racquets, the [[Bentley Fortissimo]] preceded the patent by two years, causing Germany to invalidate it. [[Tad Weed|Weed]] also introduced an oversize racquet in 1975, before the first Prince oversize, the aluminum Prince Classic, was introduced.

'''[[Laos]]''' competed at the '''[[2012 Summer Olympic Games]]''' in [[London]], from 27 July – 12 August 2012. This was the nation's eighth appearance at the Olympics, having attended all Summer Games since 1980 except the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, because of its support of the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet boycott]].

Three Laotian athletes were selected to the team by wild card entries in athletics and swimming, without having qualified. This was also the nation's smallest team after the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney. Sprinter [[Kilakone Siphonexay]] was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Laos has yet to win its first Olympic medal.

'''List of Women's Basketball Academic All-America Team Members of the Year''' is a list of the annual selection by the [[College Sports Information Directors of America]] and its [[Academic All-America]] sponsor of the individual athlete selected as the most outstanding of the annual Women's Basketball Academic All-America selections. From 1996 through 2011, one winner each was chosen from both the College and University Divisions for all twelve Academic All-America teams, including football. The Academic All-America program recognizes combined athletic and academic excellence of the nation's top student-athletes.  The University Division team included eligible participants from [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] member schools, while the College Division team included scholar-athletes from all of the following: [[NCAA Division II]], [[NCAA Division III]], [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), [[List of universities in Canada|Canadian universities]] and [[List of colleges in Canada|colleges]] and two-year schools.

Beginning in 2012, COSIDA revamped its award structure. The University Division was renamed "Division I". NCAA Divisions II and III now have their own separate All-Americans, while the College Division now consists only of non-NCAA institutions.

Currently, each team selects Academic All-District honorees in eight geographic districts across the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosida.com/media/documents/2011/2/2010_11_AAA_MBB_All_District_Teams.pdf|title=Capital One Academic All-District ® Men’s Basketball Teams Released|accessdate=March 22, 2011|date=February 3, 2011|publisher=[[College Sports Information Directors of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First team All-District honorees make the All-America team ballots. Currently, all twelve Academic All-American teams (Men's and women's [[basketball]], men's and women's [[soccer]], men's and women's [[track &amp; field]], men's [[baseball]], women's [[softball]], men's [[American football]], women's [[volleyball]] and men's and women's at-large teams) have one Academic All-American of the Year for each division.  One of these twelve sport-by-sport Academic All-American of the year is selected as the [[List of Academic All-America Team Members of the Year|Academic All-America Team Members of the Year]] for each division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosida.com/media/documents/2011/1/Academic_AllAmerica_FAQs.pdf|title=Academic All-America program Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|accessdate=March 22, 2011|publisher=[[College Sports Information Directors of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent women's basketball player to have earned the all-sports honor is Lauren Battista of [[Bentley University]] in Massachusetts, winner of the 2014 Division II award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.cosida.com/news/2014/7/29/AAA_0729142202.aspx |title=Bentley's Battista named Capital One D2 Academic All-America® of the Year |publisher=College Sports Information Directors of America |date=July 31, 2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MHSK''' ({{lang-uz|Марказий Ҳарбий спорт клуби|translit=Markaziy Harbiy Sport Klubi}}) is a [[Uzbekistan]]i [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Tashkent]]. Its abbreviation means Army Central Sports Club, similar to the Soviet equivalent CSKA.

==History==
The year of establishment is unknown, yet the club participated in the Soviet competitions since 1946. Until 1988 it played as part of the Soviet Armed Forces sports club which often was changing its name. Since 1955 it was named as SKA Tashkent. In 1989 it was transformed into a junior squad as Regional School of Higher Sports Mastery, SKA-RShVSM Tashkent. With the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1992, the club became a farm club of [[FC Pakhtakor Tashkent]] as Pakhtakor-79 Tashkent. Since 1993 and until 2001 the club played as MHSK Tashkent.

MHSK Tashkent played 7 seasons in [[Uzbek League]]: 1992–1998. In that time club won championship in 1997 and runner-up in 1995 [[Uzbek Cup]]. One year later in 1998 season, club finished [[1998 Uzbek League|16th]] and relegated to lower division. In 1999–2000 club played in [[Uzbekistan First League]]. Before the start of 2001 season in First League, MHSK officially withdrew from competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oez01.html|title=First League (Second Level) 2001|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=|date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''March 28 Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|ملعب 28 مارس}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Benghazi]], [[Libya]]. Also known as
''''Sports City Stadium'''' It is a part of [[Benghazi Sports City]]. It was used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and it also has athletics facilities.  The stadium holds 65,000. The stadium is sometimes used by the [[Libya national football team]] although it is not as popular a choice as  the [[June 11 Stadium]] in [[Tripoli]].

The name of the stadium commemorates 28 March, in which British Forces were asked to relinquish their military base rights in Libya and leave the country.

Along with [[June 11 Stadium]] in [[Tripoli]], the 28 March Stadium hosted many games, including a semi-final, of the [[1982 African Cup of Nations]] held in Libya.

==New stadium==

As of 2013, the stadium will be closed, and demolition work will begin for the construction of a new stadium. The new stadium will be an 85,000 all seater stadium. Thomas Phifer and Partners, a New York-based architectural firm won the international competition for the design of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbika.com/projects/view/2141-benghazi-sport-city- Benghazi Sport City Tower], ''Urbika'', Accessed Sep 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction work is part of a general restructuring of the entire Medina al-Riyadhia (Sports City) site or what is about to be called "The Arena" in the honour of the Libyan multi-millionaire owner Musbah  for saving the club from all their debts, in which another all seater stadium will be built. Construction work was expected to finished in time for Libya's hosting of the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startimes2.com/f.aspx?t=16406672 Startimes &lt;u&gt;New March 28th Stadium&lt;/u&gt;]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.kooora.com/f.aspx?t=23783052 28 March Stadium - kooora.com {{ar icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to its hosting of the tournament being cancelled in August 2014.

The '''Miracle in Motown''' was the final play of an [[American football]] game between the [[NFC North]] divisional rivals [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[Detroit Lions]] on December 3, 2015. The game, which was broadcast on television nationally on ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', was played at [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]] during the [[2015 NFL season]]. On the final play of regulation, with no time remaining on the game clock, Packers [[quarterback]] (QB) [[Aaron Rodgers]] threw a {{convert|61|yd|m|adj=on}} [[Hail Mary pass]] into the end-zone that was caught by [[tight end]] (TE) [[Richard Rodgers (American football)|Richard Rodgers]] for the game-winning [[touchdown]].

The play resulted in a dramatic 27&amp;ndash;23 come-from-behind victory for the Packers, who had trailed 20&amp;ndash;0 in the second half. The victory was the Packers fourth-largest comeback in franchise history. It was also the start of a 3&amp;ndash;game winning streak that would help the Packers clinch their seventh consecutive postseason berth. The Lions would end the season with a record of 7&amp;ndash;9 and fail to reach the playoffs.

==Background==
Before the game on December 3, 2015, the Green Bay Packers had struggled in their previous games, while the Detroit Lions had found their form since winning against the Packers on the road at [[Lambeau Field]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]. The Packers had lost four of their last five games after a 6–0 start for the season and were in dire need of a change of fortune to reach the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions came to the game with a three-game winning streak, and they still had a chance to earn a playoff spot despite starting the season with a 1-7 record.

Eighteen days earlier, the Lions had ended a 24-year winless streak against the Packers in a road game by beating them 18–16 at [[Lambeau Field]]. If they had also defeated the Packers at their second meeting of the season, the Lions would have swept the season series with Green Bay for the first time since 1991.&lt;ref name="ESPN report"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=400791568 |title= Packers Stun Lions on Aaron Rodgers-to-Richard Rodgers Hail Mary |publisher= [[ESPN]] |date= December 4, 2015 |access-date= December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Packers started their comeback from the 20–0 deficit in the second half of the game, the Lions had snapped a 56-game streak during which the Packers had scored in the first half. Counting the previous game against the [[Chicago Bears]] and the greater part of the Lions game, Packers went nearly 70 game-minutes without scoring a point.

==Events of the play==
With six seconds left on the game clock, Green Bay was on 3rd-and-10 at its own 21-yard line. After one forward pass and one backward pass, Packers tight end Richard Rodgers lateraled the ball to quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was quickly tackled at his 24-yard line by Detroit Lions defender [[Devin Taylor]], with the game clock having gone to zero during the play. However, the official standing behind the play called a 15-yard penalty on Taylor for a face mask foul on the tackle, and so, because NFL rules state that a game cannot end on a defensive penalty, the Packers were given an [[untimed play]] at their own 39-yard line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Eric |last= Edholm |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/miracle-in-motown--packers-stun-lions-on-controversial-walk-off-td-050026407.html |title= Miracle in Motown: Packers Stun Lions on Controversial Walk-off Touchdown |work=[[Yahoo!

After the snap, all Packers receivers ran towards the end zone and Aaron Rodgers broke right, escaping the Detroit defenders before throwing a {{convert|61|yd|m|adj=on}} Hail Mary pass into the end zone.&lt;ref name="nantz/simms"&gt;{{cite news |first1= Jim |last1= Nantz |first2= Phil |last2= Simms  |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vVqStvh_8|title=Aaron Rodgers' Amazing Hail Mary: The Miracle in Motown!

According to a number of estimations, Aaron Rodgers' pass traveled {{convert|66|-|68|yd|m}} before reaching the hands of Richard Rodgers. The throw was also high enough to nearly hit the rafters at Ford Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= John |last= Breech |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25401029/look-this-is-how-close-rodgers-hail-mary-came-to-hitting-the-rafters |title= Look: This Is How Close Rodger's Hail Mary Came to Hitting the Rafters |publisher= CBS Sports |date= December 4, 2015 |access-date= December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comeback victory was the fourth-largest in franchise history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/comebacks.htm|title=Green Bay Packers Greatest Comebacks|work=[[Pro-Football-Reference.com]]|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Players involved ==
QB Aaron Rodgers and TE Richard Rodgers are not related, but both attended [[University of California, Berkeley]] and played for the [[California Golden Bears football|California Golden Bears]], graduating in 2005 and 2014, respectively.&lt;ref name="slusher"/&gt;

The play was Aaron Rodgers' first ever completed Hail Mary pass of his career, just one day after his 32nd birthday.&lt;ref name="slusher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=  Jason |last= Wilde |url= http://espn.go.com/blog/green-bay-packers/post/_/id/25587/throw-that-beat-lions-was-aaron-rodgers-first-ever-successful-hail-mary |title= Aaron Rodgers First Ever Hail Mary |publisher= ESPN |date= December 4, 2015 |access-date= December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Packers TE Richard Rodgers is the son of Richard Rodgers Sr., who was involved in one of the most famous plays in American football, "[[The Play (Stanford vs. California)|The Play]]", that ended the game between Cal and Stanford in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Joe |last= DeLessio |url= http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/12/5-incredible-things-about-the-packers-hail-mary.html |title= 5 Incredible Things about the Packers' Hail Mary |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date= December 4, 2015 |access-date= December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Rodgers Sr. contended after the game that his son's role in the play rivaled his involvement in the famous play which he called and in which he threw two of the five laterals in 1982:

{{quote|It's the complete scenario. If you look at it from my perspective, Rodgers throws it to Rodgers, not Aaron to Richard but Richard to Aaron, to start the whole thing. The penalty gets called. And then Rodgers throws it back to Rodgers again.

==Penalty controversy==
Like most significant calls by officials, the [[Face mask (gridiron football)|face mask penalty]] against Detroit that led to the winning play by Green Bay generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sean|last=Wagner-McGough|title=LOOK: Twitter can't believe the Miracle in Motown actually happened|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-twitter-cant-believe-the-miracle-in-motown-actually-happened/|publisher=CBS Sports|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dean Blandino, NFL Vice President of Officiating, responded to the call on [[Twitter]] moments after the game:
{{quote|Hand up to the mask, quick grab with finger and the head gets turned. At full speed, official is going to make that call almost every time.|NFL Vice President of Officiating, Dean Blandino, posted 12:05 a.m., December 4, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25400385/nfl-ref-czar-defends-controversial-facemask-penalty-in-miracle-in-motown |publisher= CBS Sports |first= Sean |last= Wagner-McGough |title= NFL Ref Czar Defends Controversial Face Mask Call in Miracle in Motown |date= December 4, 2015 |access-date= December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During a visit by NFL officials to a Lions training camp in 2016, Carl Cheffers, the official who threw the flag, was asked about the penalty; he said "I think it was an illegal tackle. Horse-collar, facemask, I think it was an illegal tackle. I’m very comfortable with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Justin|last=Rogers|title=Ref who flagged Lions before Hail Mary: It was right call|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2016/08/05/ref-who-flagged-lions-before-hail-mary-right-call/88303842/|website=[[The Detroit News]]|date=August 5, 2016|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming the play==
The nickname for the play, "Miracle in Motown", was first used by Jim Nantz during the nationally broadcast ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' postgame show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Verderame|first=Matt|title=Jim Nantz Coins Game 'Miracle in Motown'|url=http://fansided.com/2015/12/04/jim-nantz-coins-game-miracle-in-motown|work=Fansided|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
* Aaron Rodgers's pass is the longest game-winning Hail Mary play in NFL history.&lt;ref name="ESPN report"/&gt;
* The touchdown-throw distance of {{convert|61|yd|m|adj=pre|air}} from the line of scrimmage is the most air-yards on a touchdown in the previous 10 NFL seasons,&lt;ref name="ESPN report"/&gt; and it was the second-longest offensive game-winning touchdown on the final play of regulation in NFL history. It came {{convert|4|yd|m|spell=in}} short of [[Earl Morrall]] and [[Jim Gibbons (American football)|Jim Gibbons]] combining for a {{convert|65|yd|m|adj=on}} game-winning play for the [[Detroit Lions]] in a 20–15 win over the [[Johnny Unitas]]-led [[Baltimore Colts]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Reineking"&gt;{{cite news |first= Jim |last= Reineking |url= http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000597494/article/packers-duo-from-cal-now-has-its-own-the-play |title= Packers' Duo from Cal Now Has Its Own 'The Play' |publisher= National Football League |date= December 8, 2015 |access-date= December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overcoming a 20-point deficit represented the fourth-biggest comeback win in Packers franchise history. It rates behind a 23-point deficit in a 35–23 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in 1982, a 23-point deficit in a 37–36 win over the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in 2013 (with [[Matt Flynn]] as a QB) and a 21-point deficit in a 35–34 win over the New Orleans Saints in 1989. This 20-point deficit was later tied in [[2018 Green Bay Packers season|2018]] when the Packers overcame a 20-point third quarter deficit to beat the [[Chicago Bears]] 24-23.&lt;ref name="Reineking"/&gt;
* Before the final game-winning play, the Green Bay Packers had gone the full 60 minutes of the game without leading.
* The play was named the "[[NFL Play of the Year Award|Bridgestone Performance Play of the Year]]" at the [[5th Annual NFL Honors]] ceremony the night before Super Bowl 50.&lt;ref name=hodkiewicz&gt;{{cite news |first= Weston |last= Hodkiewicz |date= February 6, 2016 |url= http://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/insidersblog/2016/02/06/miracle-motown-wins-nfl-play-year/79950792/ |title= 'Miracle in Motown' Wins NFL Play of the Year |work= [[The Sheboygan Press]] |access-date= February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

'''Prāṇāyāma''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word alternatively translated as "extension of the ''prāṇa'' (breath or life force)" or "breath control." The word is composed from two Sanskrit words: ''[[prana]]'' meaning life force (noted particularly as the breath), and either ''ayama'' (to restrain or control the prana, implying a set of breathing techniques where the breath is intentionally altered in order to produce specific results) or the negative form ''ayāma'', meaning to extend or draw out (as in extension of the life force). It is a [[Yoga|yogic]] discipline with origins in ancient [[India]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Etymology==

''Prāṇāyāma'' ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|प्राणायाम}} ''{{IAST|prāṇāyāma}}'') is a Sanskrit compound.

[[Vaman Shivram Apte|V. S. Apte]] provides fourteen different meanings for the word ''prāṇa'' ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|प्राण}}, ''{{IAST|prāṇa}}'') including these:&lt;ref&gt;Apte, p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Breath, [[Breathing|respiration]]
* The breath of life, vital air, principle of life (usually plural in this sense, there being five such vital airs generally assumed, but three, six, seven, nine, and even ten are also spoken of)&lt;ref&gt;For the vital airs as generally assumed to be five, with other numbers given, see: Macdonell, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Energy, vigor
* The spirit or soul

Of these meanings, the concept of "vital air" is used by Bhattacharyya to describe the concept as used in Sanskrit texts dealing with prāṇāyāma.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas McEvilley translates ''prāṇa'' as "spirit-energy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas McEvilley|McEvilley, Thomas]]. "The Spinal Serpent", in: Harper and Brown, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[breath]] is understood to be its most subtle material form, but is also believed to be present in the [[blood]], and most concentrated in men's [[semen]] and women's [[vaginal fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard King, ''Indian philosophy: an introduction to Hindu and Buddhist thought''. Edinburgh University Press, 1999, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monier-Williams defines the compound ''{{IAST|prāṇāyāma}}'' as "(m., also pl.) N. of the three 'breath-exercises' performed during {{IAST|Saṃdhyā}} (''See'' ''{{IAST|pūrak}}'', ''{{IAST|rechak (English: retch or throw out)}}'', ''{{IAST|kumbhak}}''".&lt;ref&gt;Moner-Williams, p. [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0700/mw__0739.html 706, left column.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This technical definition refers to a particular system of breath control with three processes as explained by Bhattacharyya: ''{{IAST|pūrak}}'' (to take the breath inside), ''{{IAST|kumbhak}}'' (to retain it), and ''{{IAST|rechak}}'' (to discharge it).&lt;ref name="Bhattacharyya, p. 429"&gt;Bhattacharyya, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also other processes of prāṇāyāma in addition to this three-step model.&lt;ref name="Bhattacharyya, p. 429"/&gt;

Macdonell gives the etymology as ''{{IAST|prāṇa}}'' + ''āyāma'' and defines it as "''m.'' suspension of breath (''sts. pl.'')".&lt;ref&gt;Macdonell, p.185, main entry ''{{IAST|prāṇāghāta}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apte's definition of ''{{IAST|āyāmaḥ}}'' derives it from ''{{IAST|ā}}'' + ''{{IAST|yām}}'' and provides several variant meanings for it when used in compounds.  The first three meanings have to do with "length", "expansion, extension", and "stretching, extending", but in the specific case of use in the compound ''{{IAST|prāṇāyāma}}'' he defines ''{{IAST|āyāmaḥ}}'' as meaning "restrain, control, stopping".&lt;ref&gt;See main article {{lang|sa|आयामः}} ({{IAST|āyāmaḥ}}) in: Apte, p. 224.  Passages cited by Apte for this usage are Bhagavatgita 4.29 and Manusmriti 2.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative etymology for the compound is cited by Ramamurti Mishra, who says that:

{{quote|Expansion of individual energy into cosmic energy is called ''{{IAST|prāṇāyāma}}'' (''{{IAST|prāṇa}}'', energy + ''{{IAST|ayām}}'', expansion).&lt;ref&gt;Mishra, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Orthodox Hinduism==
===Bhagavad Gītā===
Prāṇāyāma is mentioned in verse 4.29 of the [[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]].&lt;ref&gt;Gambhirananda, pp. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is]], ''prāṇāyāma'' is translated to "trance induced by stopping all breathing", also being made from the two separate Sanskrit words, ''prāṇa'' and ''āyām''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskconpress.com/books/bg/4/29|title=Bhagavad-gītā 4.29 — ISKCON Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga Sutras of Patanjali===
{{Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
Pranayama is the fourth "limb" of the eight limbs of [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga#Eight Limbs of Ashtanga|Ashtanga Yoga]] mentioned in verse 2.29 in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].&lt;ref name="Taimni, p. 205"&gt;Taimni, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali, a Hindu Rishi, discusses his specific approach to pranayama in verses 2.49 through 2.51, and devotes verses 2.52 and 2.53 to explaining the benefits of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Taimni, pp. 258–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali does not fully elucidate the nature of prana, and the theory and practice of pranayama seem to have undergone significant development after him.&lt;ref name=Pande90_97&gt;G. C. Pande, ''Foundations of Indian Culture: Spiritual Vision and Symbolic Forms in Ancient India''. Second edition published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He presents pranayama as essentially an exercise that is preliminary to concentration, as do the earlier Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=Pande90_97/&gt;

Many yoga teachers advise that pranayama should be part of an overall practice that includes the other limbs of Patanjali's Raja Yoga teachings, especially [[Yamas|Yama]], [[Niyama]], and [[Asana]].&lt;ref name=Iyengar&gt;{{cite book |title=Light on prāṇāyāma : the yogic art of breathing |year=2011 |publisher=Crossroad |location=New York |author=Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Iyengar |oclc=809217248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hatha yoga===
The Indian tradition of [[Hatha Yoga]] makes use of various pranayama techniques. The 15th century [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] is a key text of this tradition and includes various forms of pranayama such as breath retention techniques termed [[Kumbhaka]] and various body locks ([[Bandha (Yoga)|Bandha]]).&lt;ref&gt;James Mallinson (2011). Knut A. Jacobsen; et al., eds. Haṭha Yoga in the Brill Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 3. Brill Academic. pp. 772-773. {{ISBN|978-90-04-27128-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of pranayama breathing include [[Ujjayi breath]] ("Victorious Breath"), [[Bhastrika]] ("bellows breath") and [[Kapalabhati (Hatha Yoga)|Kapalabhati]] ("skull shining breath").&lt;ref&gt;Budilovsky, Joan; Adamson, Eve (2000). The complete idiot's guide to yoga (2 ed.). Penguin. Chapter 7. {{ISBN|978-0-02-863970-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these practices have become popular in Western forms of Yoga.

==Buddhism==
According to the [[Pali Canon|Pali Buddhist Canon]], the Buddha prior to his enlightenment practiced a meditative technique which involved pressing the palate with the tongue and forcibly attempting to restrain the breath. This is described as both extremely painful and not conducive to enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bronkhorst, ''The Two Traditions of Mediation in Ancient India.'' Franz Steiner Verlag Weisbaden GmbH, pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddhist scheme, breathing stops with the fourth [[jhana]], though this is a side-effect of the technique and does not come about as the result of purposeful effort.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bronkhorst, ''The Two Traditions of Mediation in Ancient India.'' Franz Steiner Verlag Weisbaden GmbH, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha did incorporate moderate modulation of the length of breath as part of the preliminary tetrad in the [[Anapanasati Sutta]]. Its use there is preparation for concentration. According to commentarial literature, this is appropriate for beginners.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Conze, ''Buddhist Meditation.'' Harper &amp; Row, 1956, p. 66. Regarding the Buddha's incorporation of pranayama see also [[Buddhadasa]], ''Mindfulness with Breathing.'' Revised edition published by Wisdom Publications, 1997, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Tibetan tradition===
Later Indo-Tibetan developments in Buddhist pranayama which are similar to Hindu forms can be seen as early as the 11th century, in the Buddhist text titled the ''Amṛtasiddhi'', which teaches three bandhas for [[kumbakha]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, James; 2016. SOAS, University of London. The Amṛtasiddhi: Haṭhayoga's Tantric Buddhist Source Text, pages 1-3 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments continued in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] which includes its own forms of pranayama exercises termed [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|Tsa-lung]] (Skt: nadi-vayu) usually incorporated into a system of yogic practice such as [[Trul khor]] or into the full [[Tantra|Tantric]] systems of various [[Buddhist Tantras]] such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]] of the [[Cakrasamvara]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, Trans. by Adriano Clemente. Yantra Yoga Snow Lion Publications, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhist breathing exercises such as the "nine breathings of purification" or the "Ninefold Expulsion of Stale Vital Energy" (''rlung ro dgu shrugs''), a form of alternate nostril breathing, commonly include visualizations.&lt;ref&gt;Tenzin Wangyal. Awakening the Sacred Body, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=B. Alan Wallace|date= |title=Tsalung Practice-Ninefold Expulsion of Stale Vital Energy |trans-title= |medium=video |language=English |url=http://meridian-trust.org/video/tsalung-practice-ninefold-expulsion-of-stale-vital-energy/ |access-date=2017-08-16 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location=http://meridian-trust.org |publisher=Meridian Trust |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Nyingma]] tradition of [[Dzogchen]] these practices are collected in the textual cycle known as "The Oral Transmission of [[Vairotsana]]" (''Vai ro snyan brgyud'').&lt;ref&gt;Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, Trans. by Adriano Clemente. Yantra Yoga Snow Lion Publications, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical==
Several researchers have reported that pranayama techniques are beneficial in treating a range of [[stress-related disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008250.pub2 | issn = 1469-493X | volume = 10 | pages = CD008250 | last = Holland | first = Anne E. |author2=Hill, Catherine J. |author3=Jones, Alice Y. |author4=McDonald, Christine F. | title = Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | date = 2012 | pmid = 23076942}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane systematic review on the symptomatic relief of asthma by breathing exercises did not find a statistically significant improvement but did find that there was a statistically significant increase in the dose of histamine needed to provoke a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PD20) during pranayama breathing but not with the placebo device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freitas DA, Holloway EA, Bruno SS, Chaves GS, Fregonezi GA, Mendonça KP |title=Breathing exercises for adults with asthma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=10 |issue=CD001277.pub3 |pages= CD001277|date=1 October 2013 |pmid=24085551 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001277.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Authoritative texts on Yoga state that, in order to avoid injuries and unwanted side effects, pranayama should only be undertaken when one has a firmly established yoga practice and then only under the guidance of an experienced Guru.&lt;ref name=Iyengar/&gt; Although relatively safe, Hatha Yoga is not risk free. Sensible precautions can usefully be taken such as beginners should avoid advanced moves if they have any physical health related issue. It can get dangerous if someone is trying to pose tough exercise which requires extreme flexibility and good shapes of bones.  Hatha Yoga should not be combined with psychoactive drug use, and competitive Hatha Yoga should be avoided. Person should inform the teacher or trainer of their physical limitations and concerns before getting involved themselves for extreme pose positions. Functional limitations should be taken into consideration. Modifications can then be made using props, altering the duration or poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cramer H, Krucoff C, Dobos G |title=Adverse events associated with yoga: a systematic review of published case reports and case series |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=e75515 |year=2013 |pmid=24146758 |pmc=3797727 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075515 |type=Systematic review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to at least one study, pranayama was the yoga practice leading to most injuries, with four injuries in a study of 76 practitioners. There have been limited reports of [[adverse effects]] including [[haematoma]] and [[pneumothorax]], though the connections are not always well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cramer H, Krucoff C, Dobos G |title=Adverse events associated with yoga: a systematic review of published case reports and case series |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=e75515 |year=2013 |pmid=24146758 |pmc=3797727 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075515 |type=Systematic review |quote=The yoga practice that was most often associated with reported adverse events was Pranayama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Savonlinnan Pallokerho''' ('''SaPKo''') is an [[ice hockey]] team from [[Savonlinna]], [[Finland]], playing in the [[Mestis]] league. It plays its home matches in [[Winter Salon rink]].

The sports club Savonlinnan Pallokerho was founded in 1929. First it consisted [[association football|football]] and [[bandy]] sections, but since the 1960s ice hockey has been the main sport.

In 1960s SaPKo played four seasons in the highest tier of Finnish ice hockey ''SM-sarja'' but was relegated to Suomi-sarja in 1971. In 1974 the new First Division was formed and SaPKo was one of the teams participating. SaPKo soon established itself as the team of I-divisioona expect few visits to Second Division. In 1968 SaPKo worked its way to the final of Finnish Cup, but lost the final to [[KooVee]] 10-2.

Later bigger success came in the season 1994/1995 when SaPKo had very good regular season with players like [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] captain [[Brian Tutt]] and was close to promotion to the [[SM-liiga]]. It played tight promotion playoffs against [[Ilves]] but failed to promote. After the success started downtrend which culminated to relegation to ''Suomi-sarja''. At the end of the 2005/2006 season SaPKo finally gained promotion back to the second tier, [[Mestis]].

The final took place between South Africa and Pakistan at the [[Nairobi Gymkhana Club|Gymkhana Club Ground]] in Nairobi. Pakistan had qualified for the final by edging past Sri Lanka on net run rate, largely due to their first innings effort of 9 for 371 when the two teams met.

[[Saeed Anwar]] won the toss for Pakistan and elected to bat first. They were all out of 203 in the 46th over with [[Allan Donald|Donald]] and [[Derek Crookes|Crookes]] taking 3 wickets each. Ijaz Ahmed top scored for Pakistan with 47. In reply the South Africans started off well, putting on 77 for the 1st wicket before [[Shahid Afridi]] took a couple of quick wickets. [[Gary Kirsten]] finished unbeaten on 118 off just 127 as his side reached their target in the 39th over. Kirsten was named as the Man of the Match.

==Famous surf spots==

===[[Muizenberg]]===
This beach is the home of surfing in South Africa and arguably the oldest surfing town in Africa. Let alone South Africa. Heather Price is considered to be the first ever person recorded to stand-up surf with a photo appearing in a local newspaper in 1919. The modern surfing movement in South Africa was in essence founded by a women, who was born in Zimbabwe. 

===[[Jeffreys Bay]]===
Jeffreys Bay is one of the five most famous [[surfing]] destinations (no.2 on one "[http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/30/travel/50-surf-spots/ best in the world]" surfing list) in the world and hosts the annual [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong Pro]] [[ASP World Tour]] surfing event at Super Tubes during July.

===St Francis Bay===
A right hand point wave at [[St. Francis Bay]] was first idolised and promoted in the cult classic surf movie ''[[The Endless Summer]]'' in the 1960s

The '''WHL Bantam Draft''' is an annual outing, in which the teams of the [[Western Hockey League]] select players who have graduated from [[Minor ice hockey#Canada|bantam]].  The draft's order of selection depends on where the team finishes in the league standings.  The teams that miss the playoffs are placed into a lottery for the 1st round only.  After the 1st round, the teams select in order from fewest to most regular season points.

==History==
Years ago, WHL teams were allowed to list first-year bantam players as of a set date in September. However, first-year bantams had been playing at the peewee level the previous year, and to list first-year bantams, WHL teams needed to scout the peewee ranks. This had many drawbacks including the need for extensive scouting systems along with the related expense, as well the added pressure on peewee-aged players (12- and 13-year-olds).

To get away from scouting peewees, the WHL instituted a bantam draft. WHL teams send scouts to watch second-year bantams from the start of the minor hockey season. After the season, the WHL holds a draft specifically to allow teams to add bantam players in an orderly manner to their protected lists. While this draft is the first opportunity for teams to select bantam players, it is not the last chance for a player to be listed. After the draft is completed, all the remaining bantams become eligible to be listed by teams, and many will be added as spots become available on team's PPLs, or as a player's talents improve or are more noticeable at a later date or at a higher level of hockey.

During the bantam draft (typically held in early May), players from the four Western Provinces and the states of [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Hawaii]], [[Idaho]], [[Kansas]], [[Minnesota]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Oregon]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]] are eligible to be selected.

Players from non-North American countries are allowed to be added in the [[CHL Import Draft]] which is held in June.

==Protected player list==
A team is allowed to add up to 50 players between the ages of 14 and 20 onto its PPL. 14-year-olds may not be added to the list until the Bantam Draft has been completed following their final year at the bantam level.

The 50 Player Protected List is used by the Western Hockey League to ensure there is a method of organization and control in the League for the rights to players. Without this type of built-in control, the system would be problematic.

The 50 Player Protected List works in a very simple manner. Each WHL team is permitted to place a maximum of 50 players between the ages of 14 and 20 on their List. A player may not be added to a WHL List until he has been eligible for the WHL Bantam Draft, which occurs following his final season of bantam hockey.

All players on a WHL team's roster are required to be on the 50 Player Protected List, so if a WHL team is carrying 23 players, this leaves only 27 spots available for future prospects. Needless to say, only the elite players will be represented on a team's List. If a player on the List no longer meets the expectations of the team, he will be replaced by another prospect. As a result, the List is constantly changing as teams evaluate their players and make adjustments. Teams are permitted to make changes to their 50 Player List throughout the entire year.

It is imperative for a team to build their List with quality players if they wish to be competitive in the future. By limiting each team's List to 50 players, this ensures that the talent level will be consistent throughout the WHL, while still rewarding the teams who do the best job in scouting talent.

With only 50 available spots, this means that decisions must be made carefully so as to ensure the team's future viability. Depending on circumstances, a player may be added or removed from a team's List at any time.

Although many players are added to WHL team Lists during the Bantam Draft, there are also numerous situations where players develop later and are listed at that time. The following WHL stars were not selected in the WHL Bantam Draft but were added to a WHL team's list at a later date: [[Jarome Iginla]], [[Darcy Tucker]], [[Jeff Friesen]], [[Dan Hamhuis]], [[Scottie Upshall]], [[Joffrey Lupul]], [[Jeff Woywitka]], [[Brendan Witt]] and [[Shane Doan]].

A player who is on a WHL team's List may not play for another WHL team, or attend another WHL team's training camp or rookie camp. However, being a member of a WHL team's 50 Player Protected List does not restrict a player from playing for, or attending a camp of a non-WHL team. The 50 Player Protected List is used strictly to determine which WHL team holds the player's rights.

The WHL, along with the [[Ontario Hockey League]] and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] comprise the [[Canadian Hockey League]]. Rules are in place to ensure that a player may be selected by only one league

The '''Whitney Classic''' is an {{convert|136|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} endurance [[Mountain bike racing|mountain bike race]] that is held in late September or October every year.  The ride runs from the [[Badwater Basin]] in [[Death Valley]] to [[Whitney Portal]]. Badwater, at {{convert|279|ft}} below sea level,&lt;ref name=NED&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-national-elevation-dataset-ned-1-meter-downloadable-data-collection-from-the-national-map-|title=USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1 meter Downloadable Data Collection from The National Map 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) - National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA) National Elevation Data Set (NED)|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=September 21, 2015|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the lowest place in the North America and Whitney Portal at {{convert|8360|ft}} is the trailhead that leads to [[Mount Whitney]], the highest peak in the contiguous United States with an elevation of {{convert|14505|ft|m}}.

==The ride==
[[Image:Mount Whitney 2003-03-25.jpg|thumb|Mount Whitney]]
The ride is {{convert|136|mi|km}} long with an elevation gain of {{convert|15800|ft|m}}.  There are three major hills: Townes Pass, climbing up from Stovepipe Wells; Hillcrest, climbing from Panamint Springs; and the Whitney Portal Road, which leaves the town of [[Lone Pine, California]] to climb to the Portal.

# Townes Pass is {{convert|16.6|mi|km}} long with an elevation gain of more than {{convert|5000|ft}};
# Hillcrest is {{convert|11.9|mi|km}} long, with an elevation gain of slightly more than {{convert|3000|ft}}; and
# The Whitney Portal road gains close to {{convert|5000|ft}} in {{convert|12|mi|km}}.

In addition to long distances and elevation, the temperature can play a major factor.  At the start in Badwater, temperatures can routinely be as high as {{convert|130|F|C}} degrees, but the temperature quickly drops at higher altitudes.  Below freezing temperatures can be encountered near the Portal at night, making temperature swings of over {{convert|100|F|C}} degrees possible in a single day.

[[Image:Badwater elevation sign.jpg|thumb|Badwater Basin elevation sign.]]

The ride is a small event, with an average number of riders in the 50s.  Riders may ride as individuals or as a team.  Due to the heat, the cold, the length, the hills, the dark, and a number of other factors, it is not unusual for 25-50% of the participants not to finish.

==History==
The Whitney Classic started in 1981 as a fundraiser for Summit Adventure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summitadventure.com/whitney-classic-history/ |title=Whitney Classic History |work= |publisher=Summit Adventure |date=15 September 2016 |access-date=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit wilderness ministry in [[Bass Lake, California]], and still serves as a major fundraiser for the organization.  There are multiple races and runs that travel the same course, including the [[Badwater Ultramarathon]], held in July every year.

The ride was originally conceived as a Badwater to the summit of Whitney bike-hike event, making it the lowest to highest.  In later years, as the [[United States Forest Service]] required summit permits to climb Mt. Whitney, the official course was shortened to end at Whitney Portal.  Forest Service regulations do not allow competitive events in the [[John Muir Wilderness]], however, many riders choose to continue tradition and complete the ascent to Mount Whitney's summit on their own.

:''Not to be confused with [[Portland Ice Arena (Oregon)]].''
The '''William B. Troubh Ice Arena''' (formerly the '''Portland Ice Arena''') is an [[ice hockey]] [[arena]] in [[Portland, Maine]], USA. Located on Park Avenue between [[Fitzpatrick Stadium]] and [[Hadlock Field]], the Ice Arena has a [[seating capacity]] of 750 and is open year around. Since its opening in 1984, it has been home to [[Portland Pirates]] hockey practices as well as local amateur teams and open skating hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandicearena.com/ Official Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was funded by a 20-year bond which was repaid in 2004.&lt;ref name="PPH"&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/news/city-weighs-new-management-for-sports-sites-running-in-red_2011-02-05.html City weighs new management for sports sites running in red] ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'', February 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 2012, the facility closed for energy efficiency repairs, which were the first major upgrades since the building opened in 1984. The repairs were funded by a $625,000 bond passed by voters in 2011 and were estimated to save the city 67,000 kilowatt-hours in energy use yearly.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theforecaster.net/news/print/2012/09/18/portland-ice-arena-reopens-after-renovation/135212|title=Portland Ice Arena reopens after renovation|last=Hall|first=William|date=September 18, 2012|work=[[The Forecaster]]|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2015 the Portland Ice Arena changed its name officially to the William B. Troubh Ice Arena as a dedication to William B. Troubh.

A '''yard globe''', also known as a '''garden globe''', '''gazing ball''', '''lawn ball''', '''garden ball''', '''gazing globe''', '''mirror ball''', '''chrome ball''', or '''orb''', is a mirrored sphere typically displayed atop a conical ceramic or wrought iron stand as a [[lawn ornament]]. Its size ranges from 2 inches to 10 feet in diameter, with the most popular gazing ball being about 12&amp;nbsp;inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm). Gazing balls were glass but can now be stainless steel, ceramic, or stained glass.
 
Unlike hanging friendship balls or [[witch balls]] that have a loop, gazing balls have a stem so they can securely sit in a stand. Larger sizes can be made but prove difficult due to the weight of the blown glass.

==History==
Gazing balls originated in 13th century [[Venice, Italy]], where they were hand-blown by skilled craftsmen.

King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], sometimes referred to as Mad King Ludwig, is said to have adorned his [[Herrenchiemsee]] palace with lawn balls, however, the palace and gardens were never finished after Ludwig died in 1885. Sometime later the gardens, based on [[Versailles]], were open to the public and visitors may have seen the 'lawn balls,' but the Victorian period was quickly coming to an end.  By the 1880s and 90s the nature of English landscape was changing dramatically with [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]]'s and [[Gertrude Jekyll]]'s designs. It would be difficult to say that "Mad King Ludwig" had much influence in the area of garden ornaments.

Gazing balls enjoyed a brief resurgence in popularity in the 1930s. They appear in a number of modernistic gardens of the period as a variation on the traditional sundial or birdbath centrepiece. Many of them from this period may have been made in polished metal rather than glass.

Their popularity was probably influenced by the illuminated glass globe which was the central focal point of the modernist garden shown at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, Paris, in 1925.  The "Jardin d’Eau et de Lumière" was  triangular in shape, largely consisting of tiered triangular reflecting pools and planting beds. At the center of the ensemble was an electrically propelled and internally illuminated sphere of stained glass. "The mirror globe turning slowly to reflect lights is rather a night-club trick than a serious attempt at garden decoration. But it is completely successful in focusing the interest and relieving, by its unexpected location, what would otherwise be an altogether stiff pattern." 
 
Other modernist garden designs followed, using plain metal or glass mirror globes; notable examples included several roof top gardens developed by Department Stores in London, America and Australia.  

The gazing ball suited the geometric clean lines of the [[Art Deco]] style especially the visual connection with the chrome plating which was part of the Streamline-moderne aesthetic of the 1930s and 1940s - so much so in fact that they became identified in many people’s minds as an invention of the 1930s. 

Subsequently many people in the 1950s and afterwards viewed them as a bit tacky; an example of prosaic suburban taste of the interwar period on a level with [[garden gnome]]s - they have never quite regained status.
