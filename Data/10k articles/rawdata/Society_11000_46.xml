By the medieval period, the [[Semitic languages]] would have spread southward as far as southern [[Shewa]], eastward into the [[Hararghe]] highlands, and westward up to eastern Damot (eastern [[Welega Province|Wellega]]).&lt;ref name=A6-10&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Kleiner |editor1=Verena Böll |title=Studia Aethiopica - Were the Gambo a Gafat Group?

The Ge'ez language, [[Tigre language|Tigre]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] spoken in the north were influenced by [[Beja language|Beja]], [[Agaw languages|Agaw]] and [[Saho-Afar languages|Saho-Afar]] substrates, with [[Amharic]] and [[Gafat language|Gafat]] in the south also partially influenced by these substrates. The Amharic, [[Argobba language|Argobba]], [[Harari language|Harari]] and [[Gurage languages|Gurage]] tongues spoken in central Ethiopia are characterized by an Eastern Sidamo or [[Highland East Cushitic languages|Highland East Cushitic]] substratum, as well as [[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Somali language|Somali]] influences. Overall, the linguistic impact of the Cushitic languages is more marked toward the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipinski|first1=Edward|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|date=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=9042908157|page=87|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Sabaean inscription describes an alliance between Shamir Yuhahmid of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] and King [[`DBH]] of [[Aksum]] in the first quarter of the third century. They had lived alongside the Sabaeans, who lived across the [[Red Sea]] from them for many centuries:
{{quote|[[Shammar Yahri'sh|Shamir]] of dhū Raydān and Himyar had called in the help of the clans of Habashat for war against the kings of Saba; but Ilmuqah granted... the submission of Shamir of dhū Raydān and the clans of Habashat."&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term "Habesha" was formerly thought by some scholars&lt;ref name=HABESHA&gt;Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]'': D-Ha. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. p. 948.&lt;/ref&gt; to be of Arabic descent because the English name [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] comes from the Arabic form. (Arabs used the word ''Ḥabaš'', also the name of an Ottoman province, [[Habesh Eyalet]], comprising parts of modern-day Eritrea).&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; South Arabian expert Eduard Glaser claimed that the hieroglyphic ''ḫbstjw'', used in reference to "a foreign people from the incense-producing regions" (i.e. [[Land of Punt|Punt]], located in Eritrea and northeast Ethiopia) used by Queen [[Hatshepsut]] c. 1460 BC, was the first usage of the term or somehow connected.

Based on the inscriptions the Aksumites left behind, they did not regard themselves or their territory as Habesha. For them, Habeshas likely meant people who collected [[incense]] in [[South Arabia]]. [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], the Greek-speaking Egyptian traveler who visited the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] in 525, also made no reference to Habesha.&lt;ref name=HABESHAT6&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Pankhurst|first=Estelle Sylvia|title=Ethiopia: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GdyAAAAMAAJ|year=1955|publisher=Lalibela House}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HABESHAT2" /&gt; According to Dr. Eduard Glaser, an Austrian epigraphist and historian, "Habesha" was originally used to refer to a kingdom in southeastern Yemen located east of the [[Hadhramaut]] kingdom in what is now [[Al Mahrah Governorate]]. He believed the etymology of Habesha must have derived from the [[Mehri language]], which means “gatherers” (as in gatherers of incense).&lt;ref name=HABESHAT2&gt;[http://www.eriswiss.com/the-true-origin-of-habesha/ "The True Origin of Habesha"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415051356/http://www.eriswiss.com/the-true-origin-of-habesha/ |date=2015-04-15 }}, eriswiss.com Retrieved 2015-04-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HABESHAT1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MlA8AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=habashat&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks%20%22The%20Academy,%20Volume%2048%20-%20Google%20Books "The Academy, Volume 48 - Google Books"]: J. Murray, 1895. p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until long after Aksumite kingdom had ended that Gulf Arab travelers and geographers began to describe the Horn region as [[Al-Habash]]. The first among these travelers were Al-Mas`udi and Al-Harrani.&lt;ref name=HABESHAT8&gt;[http://www.dskmariam.org/artsandlitreature/litreature/pdf/aksum.pdf "An African Civilisation of Late Antiquity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125055/http://dskmariam.org/artsandlitreature/litreature/pdf/aksum.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}: Stuart Munro-Hay, 1991. p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Masudi]], a tenth-century Gulf Arab traveler to the region, described Habesha country in his geographical work ''[[The Meadows of Gold]]''. He wrote that "the chief town of the Habasha is called Kuʿbar, which is a large town and the residence of the Najashi (nagassi; king), whose empire extends to the coasts opposite the Yemen, and possesses such towns as Zayla, Dahlak and Nasi."&lt;ref name="HABESHAT8"/&gt; Al-Harrani, another Gulf Arab traveler, also asserted in 1295 CE that "one of the greatest and best-known towns is Kaʿbar, which is the royal town of the najashi . . . Zaylaʿ, a town on the coast of the Red Sea, is a very populous commercial center... . Opposite al-Yaman there is also a big town, which is the sea-port from which the Habasha crossed the sea to al-Yaman, and nearby is the island of ʿAql."&lt;ref name="HABESHAT8" /&gt;

By the end of the 8th century, most of the prominent Yemeni kingdoms ended and areas they once controlled were under foreign occupation. Yemen’s turbulence, coupled with its ecological volatility likely shifted the international trade of incense from South Arabia to the Horn region. With Habasha originally used to describe people who gathered incense, this term was also given to the region by early Gulf Arab merchants and travelers as a geographic expression that some of the inhabitants of the Horn adopted over time.&lt;ref name="HABESHAT2" /&gt;

When Portuguese missionaries arrived in the interior of what is present-day Ethiopia in the early 16th century CE, they took the altered word Abesha (without the letter “H” beginning) which is used by Amharic speakers and subsequently Latinized it to ''Abassia'', ''Abassinos'', ;''Abessina'' and finally into ''Abyssinia''. This Abyssinia term was widely used as a geographic expression for centuries, even though it was a term not used by the local inhabitants.&lt;ref name="HABESHAT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=HABESHAT10&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=The Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Difussion of Useful Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9A0uAW929EC&amp;pg=PA52|year=1833|publisher=Charles Knight}}, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:African Map in 1840.jpg|thumb|200px|Abyssinia depicted on map before 1884 [[Berlin Conference]] to divide Africa.]]
Abyssinian civilization has its roots in the pre-Aksumite culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fattovich|first1=Rodolfo|title=Pre-Aksumite Civilization of Ethiopia|date=1975|publisher=Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies, Volumes 5-7|page=73|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ldVtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early kingdom to arise was that of [[Dʿmt|D'mt]] in the 8th century BC. The [[Kingdom of Aksum]], one of the powerful civilizations of the ancient world, was based there from about 150 BC to the mid of 12th century AD. Spreading far beyond the city of Aksum, it molded the one of the earliest cultures of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Architectural remains include finely carved [[stela]]e, extensive palaces, and ancient places of worship that are still being used.

Around the time that the Aksumite empire began to decline, the burgeoning religion of [[Islam]] made its first inroads in the Abyssinian highlands. During the first [[Hegira]], the companions of prophet [[Muhammad]] were received in the Aksumite kingdom. The [[Sultanate of Showa]], established around 896, was one of the oldest local Muslim states. It was centered in the former [[Shewa]] province in central Ethiopia. The polity was succeeded by the [[Sultanate of Ifat]] around 1285. Ifat was governed from its capital at [[Zeila]] in northern [[Somalia]] and was the easternmost district of the former Shewa Sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Lidwien|last1=Katpeijns|title=The History of Islam in Africa - Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa|date=2000|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=0821444611|page=228|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=J1Ipt5A9mLMC&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
[[File:Africa in 400 BC.jpg|thumb|Approximate realm of the ancient [[Dʿmt|Kingdom of Dʿmt]].]]
Throughout history, populations in the Horn of Africa had been interacting through migration, trade, warfare and intermarriage. Most people in the region spoke [[Afroasiatic languages]], with the family's [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branches predominant.&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 3rd millennium BCE, the pre-Aksumites had begun trading along the Red Sea. They mainly traded with Egypt. Earlier trade expeditions were taken by foot along the Nile Valley. The ancient Egyptians' main objective in the [[Red Sea]] trade was to acquire [[myrrh]]. This was a commodity that the Horn region, which the ancient Egyptians referred to as the [[Land of Punt]], had in abundance.

The Kingdom of Aksum may have been founded as early as 300 BCE. Very little is known of the time period between the mid-1st millennium BCE to the beginning of Aksum's rise around the 1st century CE. It is thought to be a successor kingdom of [[Dʿmt]], a kingdom in the early 1st millennium BC most likely centered at nearby [[Yeha]].&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Aksum was situated in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, with its capital city in Northern Ethiopia. [[Axum]] remained its capital until the 7th century. The kingdom was favorably located near the Blue Nile basin and the Afar depression. The former is rich in gold and the latter in salt: both materials having a highly important use to the Aksumites. Aksum was accessible to the port of [[Adulis]], [[Eritrea]] on the coast of the Red Sea. The kingdom traded with Egypt, India, Arabia and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Aksum’s "fertile" and "well-watered" location produced enough food for its population. Wild animals included elephants and rhinoceros.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst 1998, pp. 22-3&lt;/ref&gt;

From its capital, Aksum commanded the trade of [[ivory]]. It also dominated the trade route in the Red Sea leading to the Gulf of Aden. Its success depended on resourceful techniques, production of coins, steady migrations of Greco-Roman merchants, and ships landing at Adulis. In exchange for Aksum’s goods, traders bid many kinds of cloth, jewelry, metals and steel for weapons.

At its peak, Aksum controlled territories as far as southern Egypt, east to the [[Gulf of Aden]], south to the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]], and west to the Nubian Kingdom of [[Meroë]]. The South Arabian kingdom of the Himyarites and also a portion of western Saudi Arabia was also under the power of Aksum. Their descendants include the present-day ethnic groups known as the Amhara, Tigrayans and Gurage peoples.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Medieval and Early Modern period===

After the fall of Aksum due to declining sea trade from fierce competition by Muslims and changing climate. The power base of the kingdom migrated south and shifted its capital to Kubar (near Agew). They moved southwards because, even though the Axumite Kingdom welcomed and protected the companions of Prophet Muhammad to Ethiopia, who came as refugees to escape the persecution of the ruling families of Mecca and earned the friendship and respect of the Prophet. Their friendship deteriorated when South-Arabians invaded the Dahlak islands through the port of Adulis and destroyed it, which was the economic backbone for the prosperous Aksumite Kingdom. Fearing of what recently occurred, Axum shifted its capital near Agew]{{clarify|date=December 2014}} After the Gragn wars in the 16th century the centre of the kingdom moved to around [[Lake Tana]] in the [[Amhara Region]]. Following Gragn invasions the southern part of the Empire was lost to Ethiopia and scattered Semitic-speaking people like the Gurage people were cut off from the rest of Abyssinia. Sometime in the Middle Ages, [[Amharic language|Amharic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] began to evolve from, possibly [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], which eventually became extinct outside of religious liturgical use. Abyssinian warlords often competed with each other for dominance of the realm. The Amharas seemed to gain the upper hand with the accession of Yekuno Amlak of Ancient Bete Amhara in 1270, after defeating the Agaw lords of Lasta (in those days a non-Semitic-speaking region of Abyssinia)
[[File:Yohannesson.jpg|thumb|[[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV]] with his son and heir, Ras [[Araya Selassie Yohannes]].]]
The Gondarian dynasty, which since the 16th century had become the centre of Royal pomp and ceremony of Abyssinia, finally lost its influence as a result of the emergence of powerful regional lords, following the murder of [[Iyasu I]], also known as Iyasu the Great. The decline in the prestige of the dynasty led to the semi-anarchic era of [[Zemene Mesafint]] ("Era of the Princes"), in which rival warlords fought for power and the [[Yejju Oromo tribe|Yejju Oromo]] {{lang|gez|እንደራሴ}} ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|enderase]]''s ("regents") had effective control. The [[Emperor of Ethiopia|emperors]] were considered to be figureheads. Until a young man named Kassa Haile Giorgis also known as [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Emperor Tewodros]] brought end to ''Zemene Mesafint'' by defeating all his rivals and took the throne in 1855. The Tigrayans made only a brief return to the throne in the person of [[Yohannes IV]] in 1872, whose death in 1889 resulted in the power base shifting back to the dominant Amharic-speaking elite. His successor [[Menelik II]] an Emperor of Amhara origin seized power. Under his leadership Ethiopia maintained its long-standing independence by decisively defeating a colonial invasion.

Some scholars consider the Amhara to have been Ethiopia's ruling elite for centuries, represented by the Solomonic line of Emperors ending in [[Haile Selassie I]]. Marcos Lemma and other scholars dispute the accuracy of such a statement, arguing that other ethnic groups have always been active in the country's politics. This confusion may largely stem from the mislabeling of all [[Amharic language|Amharic-speakers]] as "Amhara", and the fact that many people from other ethnic groups have adopted Amharic [[Onomastics|names]]. Another is the claim that most Ethiopians can trace their ancestry to multiple ethnic groups, including the last self-proclaimed emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] and his Empress Itege [[Menen Asfaw]] of [[Ambassel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/ny/ethiocrown/Haile.html Emperor Haile Selassie I, Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/657cRi0fP?url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny/ethiocrown/Haile.html |date=2012-02-01 }}, Official Ethiopian Monarchy Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Indigenous theory===
[[File:Thequeenofsheba.jpg|thumb|Nigist (Queen) [[Queen of Sheba|Makeda]] of [[Sheba]]]]
The Imperial family of Ethiopia (which is currently in exile) claims its origin directly from descent from [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]] ({{lang-gez|ንግሥተ ሣብአ}} ''nigiśta Śabʿa''), who is named ''Makeda'' ({{lang-gez|ማክዳ}}) in the Ethiopian account. The Ethiopian narrative ''[[Kebra Negast]]'' ("Glory of Kings"), written in 1225 AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David Allen |last=Hubbard |title=The Literary Sources of the "Kebra Nagast" |publisher=St Andrews |year=1956 |page=358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; contains an account of Makeda and her descendants. Solomon is said in this account to have seduced the Queen, and sired a son by her, who would eventually become [[Menelik I]], the first Emperor of Ethiopia. The tradition that the biblical Queen of Sheba was a ruler of Ethiopia who visited King Solomon in Jerusalem is repeated in a 1st-century account by the Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus]]. He identified Solomon’s visitor as a queen of Egypt and Ethiopia. There is no primary evidence, archaeological or textual, for the queen in Ethiopia. The impressive ruins at Aksum are a thousand years too late for a queen contemporary with Solomon, based on traditional dates for him of the 10th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/sheba_01.shtml "The Queen Of Sheba"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029222918/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/sheba_01.shtml |date=2012-10-29 }}, BBC History&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=August 2016}}

In the past, scholars including [[Hiob Ludolf]] and [[Carlo Conti Rossini]] postulated that the ancient communities that evolved into the modern Ethiopian state were formed by a migration across the Red Sea of Semitic-speaking South Arabians around 1000 BC, who intermarried with local non-Semitic-speaking peoples. Both the indigenous languages of Southern Arabia and the Amharic and Tigrinya languages of Ethiopia belong to the large family of [[South Semitic languages]].

Scholars have determined that the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia was not derived from an [[Old South Arabian]] language such as [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]]. There is evidence of a Semitic-speaking presence in Ethiopia and Eritrea as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref name=Geez&gt;Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]'', "Ge'ez" (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 732.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of ancient Southern Arabian communities in modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea in certain localities, attested by some archaeological artifacts and ancient Sabaean inscriptions in the old [[South Arabian alphabet]]. However, Stuart Munro-Hay points to the existence of an older D'MT kingdom, prior to any Sabaean migration c. 4th or 5th century BC, as well as evidence that Sabaean immigrants had resided in Ethiopia for little more than a few decades at the time of the inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Aksum-57&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Archeological evidence has revealed a region called ''Saba'' in Northern Ethiopia and Eritrea; it is now referred to as "Ethiopian Saba" to avoid confusion.

Essentially no archaeological evidence supports the story of the Queen of Sheba. In the 21st century, scholars have largely discounted the longstanding presumption that Sabaean migrants had played a direct role in Ethiopian civilization.&lt;ref name="pankhurst2003-01-17"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard K. P. |authorlink=Richard Pankhurst |work=Addis Tribune |url=http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2003/01/17-01-03/Let.htm |title=Let's Look Across the Red Sea I |date=January 17, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830103110/http://addistribune.com/Archives/2003/01/17-01-03/Let.htm |archivedate=August 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Munro-May and related scholars believe that Sabaean influence was minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have represented a trading or military colony in a symbiotic or military alliance with D`MT.&lt;ref name=Aksum-57/&gt;

In the reign of King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]], c. early 4th century AD, the term "Ethiopia" is listed as one of the nine regions under his domain, translated in the [[Greek language|Greek]] version of his inscription as {{lang|grc|Αἰθιοπία}} ''Aithiopía.'' This is the first known use of this term to describe specifically the region known today as Ethiopia (and not [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] or the entire African and Indian region outside of Egypt).&lt;ref name="HABESHA" /&gt; The 6th-century author [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] later used the term "Αβασηγοί" (i.e. Abasēnoi) to refer to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;an Arabian people living next to the [[Sabaeans]] together with the [[Hadhramaut|Ḥaḍramites]]. The region of the Abasēnoi produce[d] myrrh, incense and cotton and they cultivate[d] a plant which yields a purple dye (probably ''wars'', i.e. ''[[Flemingia grahamiana|Fleminga Grahamiana]]''). It lies on a route which leads from [[Zabīd]] on the coastal plain to the Ḥimyarite capital [[Zafar, Yemen|Ẓafār]].&lt;ref name="HABESHA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abasēnoi was located by Hermann von Wissman as a region in the Jabal Hubaysh (perhaps related in etymology with the ḥbš [[Semitic root]]). Other place names in Yemen contain the ḥbš root, such as the Jabal Ḥabaši, whose residents are still called ''al-Aḥbuš'' (pl. of ''Ḥabaš'').&lt;ref name="Encyc2"&gt;Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]];: D-Ha. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. pp. 949.&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the Abasēnoi in Yemen may perhaps be explained by remnant Aksumite populations from the 520s conquest by [[Kaleb of Axum|King Kaleb]]. [[Ezana of Axum|King Ezana's]] claims to Sahlen (Saba) and Dhu-Raydan (Himyar) during a time when such control was unlikely may indicate an Aksumite presence or coastal foothold.&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay. ''Aksum'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional scholarship has assumed that the Habashat were a tribe from modern-day Yemen that migrated to Ethiopia and Eritrea. However, the [[South Arabian alphabet|Sabaic]] inscriptions only use the term ḥbšt to the refer to the Kingdom of Aksum and its inhabitants, especially during the 3rd century, when the ḥbšt (Aksumites) were often at war with the Sabaeans and Himyraites.&lt;ref name="Encyc2" /&gt;

===South Arabian/Sabaean origin theory===
[[File:Ancient Blocks With Sabaean Inscriptions, Yeha, Ethiopia (3146498586).jpg|thumb|Ancient stone slabs with [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] inscriptions found at [[Yeha]], Ethiopia.]]
Before the 20th century, the Sabean theory was the most common one explaining the origins of the Habesha. It was first suggested by Hiob Ludolf and revived by early 20th-century Italian scholar [[Carlo Conti Rossini|Conti Rossini]]. They said that at an early epoch, South Arabian tribes, including one called the ''Habashat,'' emigrated across the Red Sea from Yemen to Eritrea. According to this theory, Sabaeans brought with them South Arabian letters and language, which gradually evolved into the Ge'ez language and [[Ge'ez script]]. Linguists have revealed, however, that although its script developed from [[South Arabian alphabet|Epigraphic South Arabian]] (whose oldest inscriptions are found in Yemen, Ethiopia and Eritrea) used to write the Old South Arabian languages, Ge'ez is descended from a different branch of Semitic.&lt;ref name=Geez/&gt;

The large corpus of South Arabian inscriptions does not mention any migration to the west coast of the Red Sea, nor of a tribe called "Habashat." All uses of the term date to the 3rd century AD and later, when they referred to the people of the Kingdom of Aksum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Matthew C. |last=Curtis |chapter=Ancient Interaction across the Southern Red Sea: cultural exchange and complex societies in the 1st millennium BC |title=Red Sea Trade and Travel |location=Oxford |publisher=Archaeopress |year=2002 |page=60 |isbn=1841716227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.

"Ḥäbäshat", ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopia and Sudan are among the main areas linguists suggest were the [[Afro-Asiatic Urheimat|Afro-Asiatic ''Urheimat'']]. Recent linguistic studies as to the origin of the Ethiosemitic languages seem to support the DNA findings of immigration from the Arabian Peninsula, with a recent study using Bayesian computational phylogenetic techniques finding that "contemporary Ethiosemitic languages of Africa reflect a single introduction of early Ethiosemitic from southern Arabia approximately 2,800 years ago", and that this single introduction of Ethiosemitic subsequently underwent quick diversification within Ethiopia and Eritrea.&lt;ref name="Semitic Bayesian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1668/2703.abstract |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907033822/http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1668/2703.abstract |archivedate=2014-09-07 |df= }} Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the [[Near East]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories regarding the beginning of the Abyssinian civilisation. One theory, which is more widely accepted today, locates its origins in the Horn region, while acknowledging the influence of the Sabeans on the opposite side of the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum: An African Civilisation of Late Antiquity''. Edinburgh: University Press, 1991, pp. 57f.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later period, this culture was exposed to [[Judaic]] influence, of which the best-known examples are the [[Qemant]] and Ethiopian Jews (or [[Beta Israel]]) ethnic groups, but Judaic customs, terminology, and beliefs can be found amongst the dominant culture of the Amhara and Tigrinya.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of this influence see Ullendorff, ''Ethiopia and the Bible'', pp. 73ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian alphabets have been claimed as the example used to create the vowel system of the [[Ge'ez]] [[abugida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Henze|first= Paul B. |title= Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia|year= 2000|publisher= Palgrave|location= New York|isbn=0-312-22719-1|page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most Westerners and some Horn Africans influenced by German anthropologists, have agreed with the South Arabian origin theory, most indigenous Abyssinian historians claim that it is historically inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kebede|first=Messay|date=2003|title=Eurocentrism and Ethiopian Historiography: Deconstructing Semitization|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27828817|journal=International Journal of Ethiopian Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Ethiopia|Culture of Eritrea}}
The Habesha developed an agricultural society, which most continue, including raising of [[camel]]s, [[donkey]]s, and [[sheep]]. They plow using oxen. The Orthodox Church is an integral part of the culture. The church buildings are built on hills. Major celebrations during the year are held around the church, where people gather from villages all around to sing, play games, and observe the unique [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] of the church. It includes a procession through the church grounds and environs.

[[Coffee production in Ethiopia|Coffee]] is a very important ceremonial drink. The "coffee ceremony" is common to the Tigrayans and the Amharas. Beans are roasted on the spot, ground, and brewed, served thick and rich in tiny ceramic cups with no handles. This amount of coffee can be finished in one gulp if drunk cold; but, traditionally it is drunk very slowly as conversation takes place. When the beans are roasted to smoking, they are passed around the table, where the smoke becomes a blessing on the diners. The traditional food served at these meals consists of [[injera]], a spongy flat bread, served with ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'', a spicy meat sauce.

Houses in rural areas are built mostly from rock and dirt, the most available resources, with structure provided by timber poles. The houses blend in easily with the natural surroundings. Many times the nearest water source is more than a kilometer away from the house. In addition, people must search for fuel for their fires throughout the surrounding area.

The Habesha people have a rich heritage of music and dance, using drums and stringed instruments tuned to a [[pentatonic scale]]. Arts and crafts and secular music are performed mostly by artisans, who are regarded with suspicion. Sacred music is performed and icons are painted only by men trained in monasteries.

===Language and literature===

Abyssinians speak languages belonging to the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. Among these tongues is the classical [[Ge'ez language]]. The kingdom of Dʿmt wrote proto-Ge'ez in Epigraphic South Arabian as early as the 9th century BCE. Later, an independent script replaced it as early as the 5th century BCE.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Ge'ez literature is considered to begin with the adoption of [[Christianity]] in Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as the civilization of Axum in the 4th century BCE during the reign of Ezana. While Ge'ez today is extinct and only used for liturgical purposes in the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], many related Ethiopian Semitic languages continue to be spoken such as [[Tigre language|Tigre]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Amharic]], [[Harari language|Harari]], [[Gurage languages|Gurage]], [[Zay language|Zay]], [[Silte language|Silte]], and [[Argobba language|Argobba]]. Some of these languages, such as Harari and Tigre, are traditionally written in the [[Arabic script]].

Historically, the Ethiopian Semitic languages were often known among certain linguists as the ''Abyssinian languages''.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|title=Metalogicon, Volumes 12-13|date=1999|publisher=L.E.R.|page=36|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LdLwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;br&gt;*{{cite book|last1=Ullendorf|first1=Edward|title=The Semitic Languages of Ethiopia: A Comparative Phonology|date=1955|publisher=Taylor's (Foreign) Press|page=45|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=xJJNAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;br&gt;*{{cite book|last1=Dʹi︠a︡konov|first1=Igorʹ Mikhaĭlovich|title=Semito-Hamitic Languages: An Essay in Classification|date=1965|publisher=Nauka, Central Department of Oriental Literature|page=12|url=https://www.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=hHoOAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mainly spoken by the [[Amhara people|Amhara]], the [[Tigrayans]], the [[Tigre people|Tigre]], the [[Gurage people|Gurage]], the [[Argobba people|Argobba]] and the [[Harari people|Harari]] people.&lt;ref name=Z2-5&gt; Igorʹ Mikhaĭlovich Dʹi︠a︡konov [https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=hHoOAAAAYAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Abyssinian+languages%22 Semito-Hamitic Languages: An Essay in Classification - Google Books"]: Nauka, Central Department of Oriental Literature, (1965) pp 12 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Z2-4&gt;Andrew Kitchen, Christopher Ehret, Shiferaw Assefa, Connie J.

;Cuisine
[[File:Injera (during Easter Time, Lalibela, Ethiopia).JPG|thumb|Traditional Habesha [[injera]]]]
Habesha cuisine characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes, usually in the form of ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' (also ''w'et'' or ''wot''), a thick stew, served atop ''[[injera]]'', a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]],&lt;ref name="gonomad"&gt;Javins, Marie.

''[[Fit-fit]],'' or ''fir-fir,'' is a common breakfast dish. It is made from shredded ''injera'' or ''[[kitcha]]'' stir-fried with spices or [[Wat (food)|wat]]. Another popular breakfast food is ''fatira.'' The delicacy consists of a large fried pancake made with flour, often with a layer of egg, eaten with honey. ''[[Kitcha fit-fit|Chechebsa]]'' (or ''kita firfir'') resembles a [[pancake]] covered with ''berbere'' and ''niter kibbeh'', or spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. A [[porridge]], ''genfo'' is another common breakfast dish. It is usually served in a large bowl with a dug-out made in the middle of the genfo and filled with spiced ''niter kibbeh''.

''[[Wat (food)|Wat]]'' begins with a large amount of chopped red [[onion]], which is simmered or sauteed in a pot.

Another distinctively Habesha dish{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} is ''[[kitfo]]'' (frequently spelled ''ketfo''). It consists of raw (or rare) beef mince marinated in ''[[mitmita]]'' (Ge'ez: ሚጥሚጣ ''mīṭmīṭā'', a very spicy chili powder similar to the ''berbere'') and ''niter kibbeh''. ''[[Gored gored]]'' is very similar to ''kitfo'', but uses cubed rather than ground beef.

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] prescribes a number of [[fasting]] (''tsom'' {{lang-gez|ጾም}}, ''ṣōm'') periods, including Wednesdays, Fridays, and the entire [[Lent]]en season; so Habesha cuisine contains many dishes that are [[Vegan cuisine|vegan]].&lt;ref name=Henze&gt;Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: a history of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 12 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

;Dress
[[File:Habesha women-a.jpg|thumb|right|Habesha women in traditional ''[[Habesha kemis]]'' performing a folklore dance.]]
The ''[[habesha kemis]]'' is the traditional attire of Habesha women.&lt;ref&gt;''Travel &amp; Leisure'' Volume 36 2006 "A woman with her hair in tight braids and wearing habesha kemis — a white ankle-length dress with intricate embroidery — came around to each of us with a silver kettle of warm water and a silver basin for washing our hands."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa L. Schoonover, 2012, ''The Indigo Butterfly'', p.114&lt;/ref&gt; The ankle length dress is usually worn by Ethiopian and Eritrean women at formal events. It is made of [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], and typically comes in white, grey or beige shades. Many women also wrap a shawl called a ''[[netela]]'' around the formal dress.

The ''[[netela]]'' or ''netsela'' is a handmade cloth many [[Ethiopia]]n women use to cover their head and shoulders when they wear clothing made out of [[chiffon (clothing)|chiffon]], especially when attending church. It is made up of two layers of fabric, unlike ''[[gabi (clothing)|gabi]]'', which is made out of four. ''[[Kuta (clothing)|Kuta]]'' is the male version.

An ''[[Ethiopian or Eritrean suit]]'' is the traditional [[formal wear]] of Habesha men.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Jaymes ''Dirty Laundry: a memoir''. 2006, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a long sleeve, knee-length shirt, and matching pants. Most shirts are made with a Mandarin, band, or Nehru collar. The suit is made of chiffon, which is a sheer [[silk]] or [[rayon]] cloth. The ''netela'' [[shawl]] or a ''kuta'' is wrapped around the suit.

==Religion==

===Christianity===
[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|The Chapel of the Tablet at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] is believed to house the original [[Ark of the Covenant]].]]
The Habesha empire centered in Axum and [[Adowa]] was part of the world in which Christianity grew. The arrival of Christianity in Northern Ethiopia and Eritrea happened around the 4th century. The Aksumites, in fact, had been converted to Christianity hundreds of years before most of Europe. Many of their churches were cut into cliffs or from single blocks of stone, as they were in [[Turkey]] and in parts of [[Greece]], where Christianity had existed from its earliest years. The church is a central feature of communities and of each family's daily life. Each community has a church with a [[patron saint]].

Ethiopia has often been mentioned in the [[Bible]]. A well-known example of this is the story of the [[Ethiopian eunuch]] as written in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] (8: 27): "Then the angel of the Lord said to Philip, Start out and go south to the road that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza. So he set out and was on his way when he caught sight of an Ethiopian. This man was a eunuch, a high official of the Kandake (Candace) Queen of Ethiopia in charge of all her treasure." The passage continues by describing how Philip helped the Ethiopian understand one passage of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] that the Ethiopian was reading. After the Ethiopian received an explanation of the passage, he requested that Philip baptize him, which Philip obliged. Queen [[Gersamot Hendeke VII]] (very similar to Kandake) was the Queen of Ethiopia from the year 42 to 52. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was founded in the 4th century by [[Syria]]n monks. Historically, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church have had strong ties with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria appointing the archbishop for the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. They gained independence from the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in the 1950s, although the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has recently reforged the link.
[[File:Ethiopian Painting 2005 SeanMcClean.JPG|thumb|This leather painting depicts [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] priests playing [[Sistrum|sistra]] and a [[drum]]]]
A number of unique beliefs and practices distinguish Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity from other Christian groups; for example, the [[Ark of the Covenant]] is very important. Every Ethiopian church has a replica of the Ark. Also, the Ethiopian Church has a larger biblical canon than other churches.

Church services are conducted in Ge´ez, the ancient language of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Ge´ez is no longer a living language, its use now confined to liturgical contexts, occupying a similar place in Eritrean and Ethiopian church life to [[Latin language|Latin]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Other Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox practices include such things as fasting, prescribed prayers, and devotion to saints and angels. A child is never left alone until baptism and cleansing rituals are performed. Boys are baptized forty days after birth, whereas girls are baptized eighty days after birth.

Defrocked priests and deacons commonly function as diviners, who are the main healers. Spirit possession is common, affecting primarily women. Women are also the normal spirit mediums. A [[debtera]] is an [[itinerant minister|itinerant]] lay priest figure trained by the Church as a [[scribe]], [[Cantor (church)|cantor]], and often as a folk healer, who may also function in roles comparable to a [[deacon]] or [[exorcist]]. Folklore and legends ascribe the role of magician to the debtera as well.

A number of Ethiopian Christians adhere to various forms of [[Pentecostalism]] or [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], collectively known as [[P'ent'ay]].

====Similarities to Judaism and Islam====
The Ethiopian church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in the Roman Catholic or Protestant churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in Orthodox or Conservative [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kebranegast.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110140601/http://www.kebranegast.com/ |date=2011-11-10 }} Kebra Negast&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopian Christians, like some other [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]], traditionally follow dietary rules that are similar to Jewish [[Kashrut]], specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly, [[pork]] is prohibited, though unlike Kashrut, Ethiopian cuisine does mix [[dairy]] products with [[meat]]- which in turn makes it even closer to [[Islamic dietary laws]] (see [[Halal]]). Women are prohibited from entering the church during their [[menses]]; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or ''shash'') while in church in keeping with {{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|11|KJV}}. As with Orthodox [[synagogue]]s, men and women are seated separately in the Ethiopian church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar). However, women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in the Church building officially is common to many [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Catholic Christians and not unique to Judaism. Ethiopian Orthodox worshippers remove their shoes when entering a church, in accordance with {{bibleverse|Exodus|3:5|KJV}} (in which [[Moses]], while viewing the [[burning bush]], is commanded to remove his shoes while standing on holy ground). Furthermore, both the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] (Saturday), and the Lord's Day (Sunday) are observed as holy, although more emphasis, because of the [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ]], is laid upon the Holy Sunday.

===Islam===
[[File:Mešita v Bahir Daru.jpg|thumb|A mosque in [[Bahir Dar]].]]
Islam in Ethiopia dates to 615. During that year, a group of Muslims were counseled by [[Muhammad]] to escape persecution in Mecca and [[Migration to Abyssinia|migrate to Abyssinia]], which was ruled by, in Muhammad's estimation, a pious Christian king (''al-najashi''). Muhammad's followers crossed the Red Sea and sought refuge in the Kingdom of Aksum, possibly settling at [[Negash]], a place in present-day Tigray Region. Moreover, Islamic tradition states that [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi|Bilal]], one of the foremost companions of Muhammad, was from Ethiopia, as were many [[non-Arab Companions of Muhammad]] - in fact, Ethiopians were the single largest non-Arab ethnic group who were Muhammad's companions. Among these was Umm Ayman who cared for Muhammad during his infancy, a woman that he referred to as "mother".{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Ethiopia was thus the earliest home outside of Arabia for the dispersal of the Islamic world faith. Ethiopia is almost evenly split between Orthodox Christians and Sunni Muslims.

Most of Ethiopia and Eritrea's Muslims are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims and much as in the rest of the [[Muslim world]], the beliefs and practices of the Muslims of Ethiopia and Eritrea are basically the same: embodied in the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]]. There are also [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders present in Ethiopia. According to the 1994 census of Ethiopia (with similar numbers for the 1984 census), about half of its population is adherent of Islam and members of the Muslim community can be found throughout the country. Islam in Ethiopia is the predominant religion in the regions of [[Debub Wollo Zone|Wollo]], [[Somali Region|Somali]], [[Afar Region|Afar]], [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region|Berta]], [[Gurage Zone|Gurage]], and the section of [[Oromia Region|Oromia]] east of the [[East African Rift|Great Rift Valley]], as well as in [[Jimma Zone|Jimma]]. Islam in Eritrea is the predominant religion of all the ethnic groups except for the Tigrayan people, the [[Bilen people]], and the [[Kunama people]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The most important Islamic religious practices, such as the daily ritual prayers (''[[salat|ṣalāt]]'') and fasting ({{lang-ar|صوم}} ''[[sawm|ṣawm]]'', [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopic]] {{lang|am|ጾም}}, ''ṣom'' - used by local Christians as well) during the holy month of [[Ramadan]], are observed both in urban centers as well as in rural areas, among both settled peoples and nomads. Numerous Ethiopian Muslims perform the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] every year.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Ethiopian Jews|Qemant people}}
Judaism in Ethiopia is believed to date from very ancient times. Precisely what its early history was, however, remains obscure. The now dominant [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] claims it originated from the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon back in the 10th century BCE. This visit is mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures (I Kings 10:1), [[Sheba]] was a kingdom that stretched from Ethiopia to the south of the Yemen. Yemen is very close to Ethiopia across the Red Sea, and it has been recorded that modern Ethiopia has been heavily influenced by the ancient Sabean kingdom. Moreover, the details of the queen's visit, including the alleged theft of the Holy Ark as well as Solomon getting her pregnant with a child who established the "Solomonic" lineage in Ethiopia, as given in Christian Ethiopian tradition, were written in the [[Kebra Nagast]] the Ethiopian chronicle of its early history. The oldest known existing copies of the book date from as far back as the 13th century. Jewish Ethiopians are mentioned in both the Torah [[Old Testament]] as well as the Christian [[New Testament]]. It is clear that the Jewish presence in Ethiopia dates back at least 2500 years.

The Jewish Pre-settlement Theory essentially states that starting around the 8th century BCE until about the 5th century BCE, there was an influx of Jewish settlers both from Egypt &amp; Sudan in the north, and southern Arabia in the east.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Whether these settlers arrived in great numbers is yet a matter of debate. What is certain, however, is that these settlers must have preceded the arrival of Christianity. Evidence for their presence exists not only in historical books, but also in material artifacts depicting ancient Jewish ceremonies. For instance the temple at Yeha (in Tigray region), which is said to have been erected in the 8th century BCE, is believed to be an architectural copy of other Jewish temples found in Israel and Egypt during the pre-Babylonian era (before 606 BCE).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Another example is found on the monastery islands of Lake Tana (northern Gojjam), where several archaic stone altars, fashioned in the manner of Jewish sacrificial altars of pre-8th century BCE Israel, have been found not only preserved in good condition but also containing blood residue.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The manner of the blood placed on the stone altars was found to be typical of a culture that strongly adhered to Mosaic Law.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The chief Semitic languages of Ethiopia also suggest an antiquity of Judaism in Ethiopia. "There still remains the curious circumstance that a number of Abyssinian words connected with religion -- [[Hell]], [[cult image|idol]], [[Easter]], [[Ritual purification|purification]], [[alms]] -- are of Hebrew origin. These words must have been derived directly from a Jewish source, for the Abyssinian Church knows the scriptures only in a Ge'ez version made from the Septuagint"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Monroe | first = Elizabeth | title = The History of Ethiopia | publisher = Simon Publications | page = 40 | location = London | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-931541-62-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beta Israel traditions claim that the Ethiopian Jews are descended from the lineage of Moses himself, some of whose children and relatives are said to have separated from the other Children of Israel after the Exodus and gone southwards, or, alternatively or together with this, that they are descended from the tribe of Dan, which fled southwards down the Arabian coastal lands from Judaea at the time of the breakup of the Kingdom of Israel into two kingdoms in the 10th century BCE. (precipitated by the oppressive demands of [[Rehoboam]], King Solomon's heir), or at the time of the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in the 8th century BCE. Certainly there was trade as early as the time of King Solomon down along the Red Sea to the Yemen and even as far as India, according to the Bible, and there would, therefore, have been Jewish settlements at various points along the trade routes. There is definite archaeological evidence of Jewish settlements and of their cultural influence on both sides of the Red Sea well at least 2,500 years ago, both along the Arabian coast and in the Yemen, on the eastern side, and along the southern Egyptian and Sudanese coastal regions.

In practical terms, anarchy can refer to the curtailment or abolition of traditional forms of [[government]] and [[institution]]s. It can also designate a nation (or anywhere on earth that is inhabited) that has no system of government or central rule. Anarchy is primarily advocated by [[anarchists]], individuals who propose replacing government with voluntary institutions.

== Etymology ==
The word ''anarchy'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] ἀναρχία (''anarchia''), which combines [[:wikt:ἀ-|ἀ]] (''a''), "not, without" and [[:wikt:ἀρχή|ἀρχή]] (''arkhi''), "ruler, leader, authority."  Thus, the term refers to an anti-hierarchical person or society "without rulers" or "without leaders".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/7118?redirectedFrom=anarchy&amp; anarchy, n.]".  ''OED Online''.  December 2011.  Oxford University Press.  Accessed January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political philosophy ==
=== Immanuel Kant ===
The German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] treated anarchy in his ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' as consisting of "Law and Freedom without Force".  Thus, for Kant, anarchy falls short of being a true [[State (polity)|civil state]] because the law is only an "empty recommendation" if force is not included to make this law efficacious ("legitimation", etymologically fancifully from ''legem timere'', i.e. "fearing the law").&lt;ref&gt;
Compare {{OEtymD|legitimate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For there to be such a state, force must be included while law and freedom are maintained, a state which Kant calls a ''republic''.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1798). [http://korpora.zim.uni-duisburg-essen.de/kant/aa07/330.html "Grundzüge der Schilderung des Charakters der Menschengattung"].  In ''Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht''.  AA: VII, s.330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louden, Robert B., ed. (2006).  ''Kant: Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View''.  Cambridge University Press.  p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant identified four kinds of government:
# Law and freedom without force (anarchy)
# Law and force without freedom ([[despotism]])
# Force without freedom and law ([[Societal collapse|barbarism]])
# Force with freedom and law ([[republic]])

=== Description===
{{main|Anarchism}}
Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]] advocates [[self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as [[stateless society|stateless societies]],&lt;ref&gt;"ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies." George Woodcock. "Anarchism" in ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. "Anarchism" from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anarchism." The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 "Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].&lt;ref&gt;"as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state". Judith Suissa. ''Anarchism and Education: a Philosophical Perspective''. Routledge. New York. 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iaf-ifa.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement – at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist." [[Peter Kropotkin]]. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Anarchism__its_philosophy_and_ideal.html Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy – hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__An_Anarchist_FAQ__03_17_.html#toc2 "B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?"] in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism holds the [[state (polity)|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"My use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a "classless" or "libertarian" society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom." [[Murray Bookchin]]. ''The Ecology of Freedom: the emergence and dissolution of Hierarchy. Cheshire Books, Palo Alto. 1982. p. 3''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Authority is defined in terms of the right to exercise social control (as explored in the "sociology of power") and the correlative duty to obey (as explored in the "philosophy of practical reason"). Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those "authoritative" powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation."[https://books.google.com/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism'' by Paul McLaughlin. AshGate. 2007. p. 1]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations." [[Emma Goldman]]. "What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority, as follows: "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism&amp;nbsp;... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.  representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

Anarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. The central tendency of anarchism as a mass social movement has been represented by [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]], with [[individualist anarchism]] being primarily a literary phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandre Skirda|Skirda, Alexandre]]. ''Facing the Enemy: A History of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968''. AK Press, 2002, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; which nevertheless did influence the bigger currents&lt;ref&gt;Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of [[anarcho-communist]] groups and by members of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as [[Federico Urales]] and [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] who were members of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]]. Xavier Diez.

Since the 1890s, the term [[libertarianism]] has been used as a synonym for anarchism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Guérin]].

At this time, [[classical liberal]]s in the United States began to describe themselves as libertarians, and it has since become necessary to distinguish their individualist and capitalist philosophy from socialist anarchism.  Thus, the former is often referred to as ''[[right-wing libertarianism]]'', or simply ''right-libertarianism'', whereas the latter is described by the terms ''[[libertarian socialism]]'', ''socialist libertarianism'', ''[[left-libertarianism]]'', and ''left-anarchism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Perlin |first=Terry M. |title=Contemporary Anarchism |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1979 |page=40|isbn=0-87855-097-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Noam Chomsky |author2=Carlos Peregrín Otero |title=Language and Politics |publisher=[[AK Press]] |year=2004 |page=739}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Right-libertarians are divided into [[minarchists]] and [[anarcho-capitalists]] or [[voluntaryism|voluntarists]].

One of humanity's two closest primate relatives, the [[chimpanzee]], is anything but egalitarian, forming hierarchies that are dominated by [[alpha (ethology)|alpha]] males. So great is the contrast with human hunter-gatherers that it is widely argued by palaeoanthropologists that resistance to being dominated was a key factor driving the development of human consciousness, language, kinship, and social organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erdal | first1 = D. | last2 = Whiten | first2 = A. | year = 1994 | title = On human egalitarianism: an evolutionary product of Machiavellian status escalation? | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 175–183 | doi=10.1086/204255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, D. and A.

In ''[[Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology]]'' anarchist [[anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] attempts to outline areas of research that intellectuals might explore in creating a cohesive body of [[anarchist]] [[social theory]]. Graeber posits that anthropology is "particularly well positioned" as an academic discipline that can look at the gamut of human societies and organizations, to study, analyze and catalog alternative social and economic structures around the world, and most importantly, present these alternatives to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Fragments of an anarchist anthropology|year=2004|publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0972819640|edition=2nd pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Society Against the State]]'' [[Pierre Clastres]] examines stateless societies where certain cultural practices and attitudes avert the development of hierarchy and the state.

=== English Civil War (1642–1651) ===
{{main|English Civil War}}
Anarchy was one of the issues at the [[Putney Debates]] of 1647:
:[[Thomas Rainsborough]]: I shall now be a little more free and open with you than I was before. I wish we were all true-hearted, and that we did all carry ourselves with integrity. If I did mistrust you I would not use such asseverations. I think it doth go on mistrust, and things are thought too readily matters of reflection, that were never intended. For my part, as I think, you forgot something that was in my speech, and you do not only yourselves believe that some men believe that the government is never correct, but you hate all men that believe that. And, sir, to say because a man pleads that every man hath a voice by right of nature, that therefore it destroys by the same argument all property – this is to forget the Law of God. That there's a property, the Law of God says it; else why hath God made that law, Thou shalt not steal? I am a poor man, therefore I must be oppressed: if I have no interest in the kingdom, I must suffer by all their laws be they right or wrong. Nay thus: a gentleman lives in a country and hath three or four lordships, as some men have (God knows how they got them); and when a Parliament is called he must be a Parliament-man; and it may be he sees some poor men, they live near this man, he can crush them – I have known an invasion to make sure he hath turned the poor men out of doors; and I would fain know whether the potency of rich men do not this, and so keep them under the greatest tyranny that was ever thought of in the world. And therefore I think that to that it is fully answered: God hath set down that thing as to propriety with this law of his, Thou shalt not steal. And for my part I am against any such thought, and, as for yourselves, I wish you would not make the world believe that we are for anarchy.
:[[Oliver Cromwell]]: I know nothing but this, that they that are the most yielding have the greatest wisdom; but really, sir, this is not right as it should be. No man says that you have a mind to anarchy, but that the consequence of this rule tends to anarchy, must end in anarchy; for where is there any bound or limit set if you take away this limit , that men that have no interest but the interest of breathing shall have no voice in elections? Therefore, I am confident on 't, we should not be so hot one with another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1322&amp;Itemid=264 |title=The Putney Debates, The Forum at the Online Library of Liberty}} Source: Sir William Clarke, Puritanism and Liberty, being the Army Debates (1647–9) from the Clarke Manuscripts with Supplementary Documents, selected and edited with an Introduction A.S.P. Woodhouse, foreword by A.D. Lindsay (University of Chicago Press, 1951).]&lt;/ref&gt;

As people began to theorize about the English Civil War, "anarchy" came to be more sharply defined, albeit from differing political perspectives:
* 1651 – [[Thomas Hobbes]] (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]])'' describes the [[State of nature|natural condition of mankind]] as a [[Bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]], where man lives a brutish existence. "For the savage people in many places of America, except the government of small families, the concord whereof dependeth on natural lust, have no government at all, and live at this day in that brutish manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXIII |title=Chapter XIII |publisher=Oregonstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528165112/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXIII |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes finds three basic causes of the conflict in this [[state of nature]]: competition, diffidence and glory, "The first maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third, for reputation".  His first [[law of nature (precept)|law of nature]] is that "every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war". In the state of nature, "every man has a right to every thing, even to then go for one another's body" but the second law is that, in order to secure the advantages of peace, "that a man be willing, when others are so too… to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much [[liberty]] against other men as he would allow other men against himself".  This is the beginning of contracts/covenants; performing of which is the third law of nature.  "Injustice," therefore, is failure to perform in a covenant; all else is just.
* 1656 – [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] (''[[The Commonwealth of Oceana]]'') uses the term to describe a situation where the [[people]] use force to impose a government on an economic base composed of either solitary land ownership (absolute [[monarchy]]), or land in the ownership of a few (mixed monarchy). He distinguishes it from [[commonwealth]], the situation when both land ownership and governance shared by the population at large, seeing it as a temporary situation arising from an imbalance between the form of government and the form of property relations.

=== French Revolution (1789–1799) ===
{{main|French Revolution|Reign of Terror}}
[[File:Heads on pikes.jpg|thumb|Heads of aristocrats on spikes]]
[[Thomas Carlyle]], Scottish essayist of the Victorian era known foremost for his widely influential work of history, ''[[The French Revolution (Carlyle)|The French Revolution]]'', wrote that the French Revolution was a war against both [[aristocracy]] ''and'' anarchy: {{quote|Meanwhile, we will hate Anarchy as Death, which it is; and the things worse than Anarchy shall be hated more! Surely Peace alone is fruitful. Anarchy is destruction: a burning up, say, of Shams and Insupportabilities; but which leaves Vacancy behind. Know this also, that out of a world of Unwise nothing but an Unwisdom can be made. Arrange it, Constitution-build it, sift it through Ballot-Boxes as thou wilt, it is and remains an Unwisdom,-- the new prey of new quacks and unclean things, the latter end of it slightly better than the beginning. Who can bring a wise thing out of men unwise? Not one. And so Vacancy and general Abolition having come for this France, what can Anarchy do more? Let there be Order, were it under the Soldier's Sword; let there be Peace, that the bounty of the Heavens be not spilt; that what of Wisdom they do send us bring fruit in its season! – It remains to be seen how the quellers of Sansculottism were themselves quelled, and sacred right of Insurrection was blown away by gunpowder: wherewith this singular eventful History called French Revolution ends.&lt;ref name="Carlyle"&gt;{{cite book |author =Thomas Carlyle |authorlink=Thomas Carlyle |title=[[The French Revolution (Carlyle)|The French Revolution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Armand II]], duke of Aiguillon came before the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in 1789 and shared his views on the anarchy: {{quote|I may be permitted here to express my personal opinion. I shall no doubt not be accused of not loving liberty, but I know that not all movements of peoples lead to liberty. But I know that great anarchy quickly leads to great exhaustion and that despotism, which is a kind of rest, has almost always been the necessary result of great anarchy. It is therefore much more important than we think to end the disorder under which we suffer. If we can achieve this only through the use of force by authorities, then it would be thoughtless to keep refraining from using such force.&lt;ref name="Duke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/inter/rev_002_ber/page02.html |title=Duke d'Aiguillon |publisher=Justice.gc.ca |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Armand II was later exiled because he was viewed as being opposed to the revolution's violent tactics.

Professor Chris Bossche commented on the role of anarchy in the revolution: {{quote|In The French Revolution, the narrative of increasing anarchy undermined the narrative in which the revolutionaries were striving to create a new social order by writing a constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/carlyle/vandenbossche/4g.html |title=Revolution in Search of Authority |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2001-10-26 |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Jamaica (1720) ===
Sir [[Nicholas Lawes]], Governor of [[Jamaica]], wrote to [[John Robinson (1650-1723)|John Robinson]], the [[Bishop of London]], in 1720: &lt;blockquote&gt;As to the Englishmen that came as mechanics hither, very young and have now acquired good estates in Sugar Plantations and Indigo &amp; co., of course they know no better than what maxims they learn in the Country. To be now short &amp; plain Your Lordship will see that they have no maxims of Church and State but what are absolutely anarchical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the letter, Lawes goes on to complain that these "estated men now are like [[Jonah]]'s [[Kikayon|gourd]]" and details the humble origins of the "[[Creole peoples|creolians]]" largely lacking an education and flouting the rules of church and state. In particular, he cites their refusal to abide by the Deficiency Act, which required [[slavery|slave]] owners to procure from [[England]] one [[White people|white]] person for every 40 enslaved [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]], thereby hoping to expand their own estates and inhibit further English/[[Irish people|Irish]] immigration. Lawes describes the government as being "anarchical, but nearest to any form of [[Aristocracy]]". "Must the King's good subjects at home who are as capable to begin plantations, as their Fathers, and themselves were, be excluded from their Liberty of settling Plantations in this noble Island, for ever and the King and Nation at home be deprived of so much riches, to make a few upstart [[Gentleman|Gentlemen]] Princes?"&lt;ref&gt;''Jamaica: Description of the Principal Persons there'' (about 1720, Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor) in ''[[Caribbeana]]'' Vol. III (1911), edited by [[Vere Langford Oliver]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian Civil War (1917–1922) ===
[[File:Makhno en 1918.JPG|thumb|[[Nestor Makhno]] (1918), the leader of the anarchist Free Territory in [[Ukraine]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]]]
During the [[Russian Civil War]] – which initially started as a confrontation between the [[Communists]] and [[White Army|Monarchists]] – on the territory of today's [[Ukraine]], a new force emerged, namely the [[Anarchist]] [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]]. The Ukrainian Anarchist during the Russian Civil War (also called the "Black Army") organized the [[Free Territory]] of Ukraine, an [[list of anarchist communities|anarchist society]], committed to resisting [[State (polity)|state]] authority, whether [[Capitalist state|capitalist]] or [[communist state|communist]].&lt;ref&gt;Yekelchyk 2007, p 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OIHMW163"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Charles Townshend |author2=John Bourne |author3=Jeremy Black |title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Modern War |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-19-820427-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was cut short by the consolidation of Bolshevik power. Makhno was described by anarchist theorist [[Emma Goldman]] as "an extraordinary figure" leading a revolutionary peasants' movement.&lt;ref name="MDR"&gt;{{cite book |author =Emma Goldman |title=My Disillusionment in Russia |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |location= |year=2003 |page=61 |isbn=0-486-43270-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1918, most of Ukraine was controlled by the forces of the [[Central Powers]], which were unpopular among the people. In March 1918, the young anarchist Makhno's forces and allied anarchist and guerrilla groups won victories against German, Austrian, and Ukrainian nationalist (the army of [[Symon Petlura]]) forces, and units of the [[White Movement|White Army]], capturing a lot of German and Austro-Hungarian arms.  These victories over much larger enemy forces established Makhno's reputation as a military tactician; he became known as ''Batko'' ('Father') to his admirers.&lt;ref name="RN173"&gt;{{cite book |author =Edward R. Kantowicz |title=The Rage of Nations |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |location= |year=1999 |page=173 |isbn=0-8028-4455-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makhno called the Bolsheviks dictators and opposed the "Cheka [secret police]... and similar compulsory authoritative and disciplinary institutions" and called for "[f]reedom of speech, press, assembly, unions and the like".&lt;ref name="RIAdeclaration"&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/arshinov/appendix.html Declaration Of The Revolutionary Insurgent Army Of The Ukraine (Makhnovist)].

''Anarchism: Theory and Practice''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain (1936) ===
{{further|Anarchism in Spain}}
[[Francisco Franco]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Spain|Spanish]] general staged a military rebellion which attempted overthrew the Popular Front (the established Spanish government), in 1936. Following [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] rebellion, [[anarchist]], [[Communism|communist]] and what remained of [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] joined forces against [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. This was seen as a social revolution as much as a political revolution to some. Throughout the war and shortly after, many Spanish [[Working class|working-class]] citizens lived in anarchist communities, many of which thrived during this time. With major support of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[National Fascist Party|Italy]] the nationalists won the war, and set up a fascist dictatorship led by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], effectively ending much of the anarchism in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The Anarchist Collectives|The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' Self-management in the Spanish Revolution, 1936-1939]]|last=Dolgoff|first=Sam|date=1974|publisher=Black Rose Books Ltd.|isbn=9780919618206|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Albania (1997) ===
{{main|1997 rebellion in Albania}}
In 1997, Albania fell into a state of anarchy, mainly due to the heavy losses of money caused by the collapse of pyramid firms. As a result of the societal collapse, heavily armed criminals roamed freely with near total impunity. There were often 3–4 gangs per city, especially in the south, where the police did not have sufficient resources to deal with gang-related crime.

=== Somalia (1991–2006) ===
{{main|History of Somalia (1991–2006)}}
[[File:Somalia-regions-states 2.PNG|thumb|Map of Somalia showing the major self-declared states and areas of factional control in 2006]]
Following the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in [[Somalia]] and the ensuing collapse of the central government, residents reverted to local forms of conflict resolution; either secular, traditional or Islamic law, with a provision for appeal of all sentences. The legal structure in the country was thus divided along three lines: [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[religious law]] and [[Custom (law)|customary law]] ([[xeer]]).&lt;ref name="2009factbook"&gt;{{cite web|author =Central Intelligence Agency|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|year=2011|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html|accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Somalia's formal judicial system was largely destroyed after the fall of the [[Siad Barre]] regime, it was later gradually rebuilt and administered under different regional governments, such as the autonomous [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]] macro-regions. In the case of the [[Transitional National Government]] and its successor the [[Transitional Federal Government]], new interim judicial structures were formed through various international conferences.

Despite some significant political differences between them, all of these administrations shared similar legal structures, much of which were predicated on the judicial systems of previous Somali administrations. These similarities in civil law included: a) a [[charter]] which affirms the primacy of Muslim [[shari'a]] or religious law, although in practice shari'a is applied mainly to matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and civil issues. The charter assured the independence of the [[judiciary]], which in turn was protected by a judicial committee; b) a three-tier judicial system including a [[supreme court]], a [[court of appeal]]s, and courts of first instance (either divided between district and regional courts, or a single court per region); and c) the laws of the civilian government which were in effect prior to the military coup d'état that saw the Barre regime into power remain in forced until the laws are amended.&lt;ref name="SJS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stateless Justice in Somalia |url=http://www.hdcentre.org/files/Somalia%20report.pdf |date=2005-06-01 |author=Andre Le Sage |publisher=Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue |accessdate=2009-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118151830/http://www.hdcentre.org/files/Somalia%20report.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atotoztli''' ({{lang-nci-IPA|Atotoztli|atoˈtostɬi}}) or '''Huitzilxochtzin''' ({{lang-nci-IPA|Huitzilxōchtzin|witsiɬˈʃoːtʃtsin}}) was a daughter of the [[Aztec emperor]] [[Moctezuma I]] and [[Chichimecacihuatzin I]], the daughter of [[Cuauhtototzin]], the ruler of [[Cuauhnahuac]].

She married [[Tezozomoc (son of Itzcoatl)|Tezozomoc]], son of the previous emperor [[Itzcoatl]], and gave birth to three sons who would later become emperors themselves: [[Axayacatl]], [[Tizoc]], and [[Ahuitzotl]].

Some sources indicate she served as regent or even huetlatoani herself. The ''Anales de Tula'' and ''Relación de la Genealogía'' state she ruled the Triple Alliance herself, possibly for as long as 30 years. If true, the records of the Mexica may have omitted her from the records because she was a woman. On the other hand, the documents supporting these claims were not contemporary, and made on request of [[Juan Cano de Saavedra]] to support the claims of his wife [[Isabel Moctezuma]] as heiress to Tenochtitlan.

==Biography==
Bethenia Owens was born on February 8, 1840, in [[Van Buren County, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=OE/&gt; She was the third of eleven children born to Tom and Sarah Damron Owens.&lt;ref name=OE/&gt; The family traveled to the [[Oregon Country]] via the [[Oregon Trail]] in 1843 with the [[Jesse Applegate]] wagon train.&lt;ref name=OE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonpioneers.com/1843.htm |title= Emigrants to Oregon in 1843 |first= Stephenie |last= Flora |publisher= oregonpioneers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family settled in the [[Clatsop Plains]] and later moved to [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]] in the [[Umpqua Valley]].&lt;ref name=OE/&gt;&lt;ref name=OHS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=C08C5AE4-1C23-B9D3-68CDD6F6494E9A5E |title= Bethenia Owens-Adair (1840–1926) |publisher= [[Oregon Historical Society]] |accessdate= March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 14, Owens married LeGrand Henderson Hill, one of her father's farmhands.&lt;ref name=OHS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardino&gt;{{cite web |first= M. Constance, III |last= Guardino |author2= Rev.

Their son George was born when Owens was 16.&lt;ref name=OE/&gt; She and Hill moved to [[Yreka, California]] so Hill could join the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name=Guardino/&gt; She left Hill, and graduated from the [[Eclectic medicine|Eclectic Medical College of Pennsylvania]] in 1874 (writing her thesis on ''Metritis'')&lt;ref name=AbrahamsExtinctPhila&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahams|first=Harold J.|title=Extinct medical schools of nineteenth-century Philadelphia|year=1966|publisher=Univ. of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=317|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/928734}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=OE/&gt;

She practiced medicine in Roseburg, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Clatsop County, Oregon|Clatsop County]], Oregon, and in [[Yakima, Washington]].&lt;ref name=OE/&gt;

She married Col. John Adair, in 1884. They divorced in 1907.&lt;ref name=OE/&gt;

She worked in the [[temperance movement]]. Owens also promoted the [[eugenics movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James, ed.|first1=Edward T.|title=Notable American Women 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary|date=1971|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780674627345|page=659|edition=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1909, she supported a bill to sterilize criminals, epileptics, the insane, and the feebleminded. The bill passed the Oregon legislature but the governor refused to sign it into law. Eight years later the bill became law. A similar bill became law in Washington state, in 1909, largely due to her efforts. Owens was called the "pioneer advocate" of the Pacific Northwest eugenic sterilization movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Adam|title=Imbecile: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck|date=2016|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781594204180|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bhadala''' ({{lang-gu|ભડાલા}}; {{lang-ar|بدل}}; {{lang-hi|भदाला}}) are an [[ethnic group]] found in Pakistan and India. They are found mainly in the [[Kutch District]] of [[Gujarat]]. In [[Pakistan]], they are found mainly in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 234 to 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin (JADEJA)==
The word Bhadala meant a hardworking businessman and sea rider in the [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] language, but now refers to a distinct community found along the coast of [[Kutch]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. According to their traditions, they were originally settled in the town of [[Keti Bandar]] in [[Sindh]], where members of the community are still said to be found. The community were said to be invited to settle in [[Kutch]] by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Shahjahan]]. Their original settlement was the village of Mota Salaya in [[Mandvi]] [[Taluka]]. The community are now settled in a number of villages in [[Mandvi]] [[Taluka]] such as Mandis Bhadala Phool and Juna Salaya. In the 18th Century, a large number of Bhadalas moved to [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], where they settled in the ports of [[Veraval]], [[Jamnagar]], [[Dwarka|Dwaraka]] and [[Porbandar]]. A second migration took place in the 19th Century, which saw many Bhadala move to [[Mombasa]], [[Lamu]] and [[Daresalam]] in [[East Africa]].  They were pioneers in the [[Asia]]n settlement of [[East Africa]]. The community now speak Kutchi, while those in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] also speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 234 to 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Bhadala are divided into a number of clans, the main ones being the Jadeja, Sap, Aspun, Ruknani, Fatwani, Hashmani, Madwani, Kana, Babar, Bhopal, Thaim, Bholim, Turk, Madyar, Vidhani, karani, Betara, Nakhrani, Juneja, Sodha, Sameja, Patha, Palija, Koreja, Kandeja, Bhatti, Yuspani, Jafarabadi and Chauhan. Many are names of well-known [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] tribes, and could point to a diverse origin of the community. But community boundaries are clear, and there is no intermarriage with neighbouring [[Muslim]] [[Maldhari]] communities like the [[Junejo|Juneja]], [[Royma]] and [[Ker (tribe)|Ker]]. Each of their clans are of equal status and inter marry. The community have a well established caste association, the Muslim Bhadala Jamat, which is one of the oldest Muslim castes association in [[Gujarat]]. It has offices in [[Mombasa]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Dubai]], [[Karachi]] (Keamari &amp; Baba Island) and [[Keti Bandar]], reflecting the widespread distribution of the community.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 234 to 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhadala is still a seafaring community, and almost all the [[Dhow]] captains on the [[Dubai]] to [[India]] route are Bhadala. Many are also employed by the merchant navies of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Generally each [[dhow]] crew is made up of close kinsmen. In [[Pakistan]], the Bhadala owns a significant part of that countries fishing fleet. In [[India]], the Bhadala often employ [[Muslim]] [[Machiyar]] or [[Hindu]] [[Kharwa (caste)|Kharwa]] on their fishing boats, while in [[Pakistan]] most of the crew is made up of ethnic [[Bengali Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 234 to 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhadala are entirely [[Sunni]], and follow the traditions of the other neighbouring [[Muslim]] communities.

The '''Chimbu–Wahgi languages''' are a [[language family]] sometimes included in the [[Trans–New Guinea]] proposal.

==Languages==
There is little doubt that the Chimbu–Wahgi family is valid. The languages are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/simbu-western-highlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Chimbu–Wahgi''' family
**Chimbu (Simbu) branch
**:[[Kuman language (New Guinea)|Kuman]] (Chimbu), [[Chuave language|Chuave]], [[Nomane language|Nomane]], [[Golin language|Golin]]–[[Dom language|Dom]], [[Salt-Yui language|Salt-Yui]], [[Sinasina language|Sinasina]]
**Western Highlands
***Jimi branch
***: [[Maring language|Maring]], [[Narak language|Narak]]–[[Kandawo language|Kandawo]]
***Wahgi branch
***: [[Nii language|Nii]], [[Wahgi language|Wahgi]], [[Wahgi language|North Wahgi]] (= Yu We?)
***Hagen branch
****[[Melpa language|Melpa]] (Medlpa)
****Kaugel River: [[Kaugel language|Imbo Ungu]], [[Kaugel language|Umbu-Ungu]], [[Tembagla language|Mbo-Ung]] (Bo-Ung)

==Features==
Several of the Chimbu–Wahgi languages have [[lateral consonant]]s, which are uncommon: see [[Nii language|Nii]], [[Wahgi language|Wahgi]], and [[Kuman language (New Guinea)|Kuman]] for examples. Tone is contrastive. The singular pronouns are:

:{|
! !!sg
|-
!1
|*ná
|-
!2
|*nim
|-
!3
|*[y]é
|}

Dual *-l and plural *-n reflect Trans–New Guinea forms.

'''Chinese Filipinos''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Pilipinong Tsino'', ''Tsinoy'' {{IPA-tl|tʃɪnoɪ|}} or ''Pilipinong Intsik'' {{IPA-tl|ɪntʃɪk|}}) are Filipinos of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] descent, mostly born and raised in the [[Philippines]]. Chinese Filipinos are one of the largest [[overseas Chinese]] communities in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="ocac.gov.tw" /&gt; There are approximately 1.5 million Filipinos with pure Chinese ancestry, or around 1.8% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2013/0121_prib1.asp |title=Senate declares Chinese New Year as special working holiday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Sangley]]s—Filipinos with at least some Chinese ancestry—comprise a substantial proportion of the Philippine population, although the actual figures are not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/clc/587677 |title=Sangley, Intsik und Sino : die chinesische Haendlerminoritaet in den Philippine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://summit.sfu.ca/system/files/iritems1/6689/b1744892x.pdf |title=The ethnic Chinese variable in domestic and foreign policies in Malaysia and Indonesia |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various universally accepted terms used in the Philippines to refer to Chinese Filipinos:{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* '''''[[Chinese people|Chinese]]''''' (Filipino: ''Tsino'' (Formal), '''Intsik''' referring Chinese British National 英籍  ; Chinese: ''華人'', ''Hoâ-jîn'', ''Huáren'')—often refers to all Chinese people in the Philippines regardless of nationality or place of birth. 
* '''''Chinese Filipino, Filipino Chinese,''''' or '''''Philippine Chinese''''' (Filipino: Tsinoy, Chinoy; '''Intsik''' ; Chinese: ''華菲'', ''Hoâ-hui'', ''Huáfēi'')—refers to Chinese people with Philippine nationality, and to Chinese peoples with Chinese nationality but were born in the Philippines. This also includes Filipino Chinese who live and/or are born in the UK and are often referred to us "britsinoy".
**  '''''[[Lan-nang]], Lán-lâng, Bân-lâm: Hokkienese''''' (咱人, 福建人, ''Fújiànren'')—a Hokkien term referring to Chinese Filipinos whose ancestry is from Fujian province.
**  '''''Keńg-tang-lâng: Cantonese''''' (廣東人, ''Guǎngdōngren'')—a Hokkien term referring to Chinese Filipinos whose ancestry is from Guangdong province.
* '''''[[Filipino mestizo|Chinese mestizo]]''''' (Filipino: ''Mestisong Tsino'', Chinese: ''華菲混血'', ''Chhut-si'' or ''Chhut-si-ia'')—refers to people who are of mixed Chinese and indigenous Filipino ancestry. A common phenomenon in the Philippines; those with 75% Chinese ancestry are considered to be Chinese Filipino (Tsinoy), rather than Chinese mestizo.
* '''''Mainland Chinese, Mainlander'''''—refers to Chinese people with Chinese nationality and were born in China.
* '''''Taiwanese''''' (Filipino: ''Taga-Taiwan''; Chinese: ''台灣人'', ''Tâi-oân-lâng'', ''Táiwānrén'')—refers to Chinese people with Republic of China (Taiwan) nationality and were born in Taiwan.
*[[File:Morong Church 06.jpg|thumb|Example of a Chinese influence in Filipino Spanish Architecture in [[St. Jerome Parish Church (Morong, Rizal)]]]]'''''Tornatras''''' or '''''Torna atras'''''—refers to people who are of varying mixtures of Chinese, Spanish, and indigenous Filipino during the Spanish Colonial Period.

Other terms being used with reference to China include:
* 華人 – ''Hoâ-jîn '' or ''Huárén''—a generic term for referring to Chinese people, without implication as to nationality
* 華僑 – ''Hoâ-kiâo'' or ''Huáqiáo''—Overseas Chinese, usually China-born Chinese who have emigrated elsewhere
* 華裔 – ''Hoâ-è'' or ''Huáyì''—People of Chinese ancestry who were born in, residents of and citizens of another country

During the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish Colonial Period]], the term [[Sangley]] was used to refer to people of unmixed Chinese ancestry while the term [[Sangley|Mestizo de Sangley]] was used to classify persons of mixed Chinese and indigenous Filipino ancestry; both are now out of date in terms of usage. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

"Indigenous Filipino", or simply "Filipino", is used in this article to refer to the [[Filipino people|Austronesian]] inhabitants prior to the Spanish Conquest of the islands. During the Spanish Colonial Period, the term ''Indio'' was used.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The Chinese Filipinos has always been one of the largest [[ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnic groups in the country]] with Chinese immigrants comprising the largest group of immigrant settlers in the Philippines.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} They are one of the three major ethnic groupings in the Philippines, namely: Christian Filipinos (73% of the population-including indigenous ethnic minorities), Muslim Filipinos (5% of the population) and Chinese Filipinos (27% of the population-including [[Sangley|Chinese mestizos]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Today, most Chinese Filipinos are locally born.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The rate of intermarriage between Chinese settlers and indigenous Filipinos is among the highest in Southeast Asia, exceeded only by [[Thailand]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} However, intermarriages occurred mostly during the Spanish colonial period because Chinese immigrants to the Philippines up to the 19th century were predominantly male.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It was only in the 20th century that Chinese women and children came in comparable numbers.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Today, Chinese Filipino male and female populations are practically equal in numbers. These Chinese mestizos, products of intermarriages during the Spanish colonial period, then often opted to marry other Chinese or Chinese mestizos .{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Generally, Chinese mestizos is a term referring to people with one Chinese parent.

By this definition, the ethnically Chinese Filipinos comprise 1.8% (1.5 million) of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno=1163&amp;no=1163&amp;level=B :: Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission, R.O.C. ::] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123193905/http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno=1163&amp;no=1163&amp;level=B |date=November 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure however does not include the Chinese mestizos who since Spanish times have formed a part of the middle class in Philippine society {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} nor does it include Chinese immigrants from the People's Republic of China since 1949.

==History==

===Early interactions===
Ethnic Chinese sailed around the Philippine Islands from the 9th century onward and frequently interacted with the local Filipinos.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Chinese and Filipino interactions initially commenced as bartering and items.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This is evidenced by a collection of Chinese artifacts found throughout Philippine waters, dating back to the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Spanish colonial attitudes (16th century – 1898)===
{{Main article|Sangley}}
[[File:Pinayavatar.jpg|thumb|right|A Chinese mestiza in a photograph by Francisco Van Camp, c. 1875. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}]]
[[File:0100jfMinor Basilica Saint Lorenzo Ruiz Binondo Landmarksfvf 11.JPG|thumb|right|Binondo Church, the main church of the district of Binondo]]
When the Spaniards arrived in the Philippines, there was already a significant population of Chinese migrants due to the relationship between the ''barangays'' (city-states) of the island of Luzon, and the Ming dynasty.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The first encounter of the Spanish authorities with the Chinese was not entirely pleasant - several Chinese pirates under the leadership of [[Limahong]], who proceeded to besiege the newly established Spanish capital in Manila in 1574.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} He tried to capture the city of Manila in vain and was subsequently beaten by the combined Spanish and native forces under the leadership of [[Juan de Salcedo]] in 1575. Almost simultaneously, the Chinese imperial admiral [[Homolcong]] arrived in Manila where he was well received. On his departure he took with him two priests, who became the first Catholic missionaries to China from the Philippines. This visit was followed by the arrival of Chinese ships in Manila in May 1603 bearing Chinese officials with the official seal of the Ming Empire. This led to suspicion on the part of the Spaniards that the Chinese had sent a fleet to try to conquer the nearly defenseless islands. However, seeing the city as strongly defended as ever, the Chinese made no hostile moves.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} They returned to China without showing any particular motive for the journey, and without either side mentioning the apparent motive.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Fortifications of Manila were started, with a Chinese settler in Manila named [[Engcang]], who offered his services to the governor.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} He was refused, and a plan to massacre the Spaniards quickly spread among the Chinese inhabitants of Manila. The revolt was quickly crushed by the Spaniards, ending in a large-scale massacre of the non-Catholic Chinese in Manila. Throughout the Spanish Colonial Period, the Chinese outnumbered the Spanish colonizers by ten to one, and at least I\on two occasions tried to grab the power, but their revolts were quickly put down by joint forces composed of indigenous Filipinos, Japanese, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="blair-tpi-15" /&gt;{{rp|page=138}}

Following the mostly unpleasant initial interaction with the Spaniards, most ethnic Chinese in Manila and in the rest of the Philippines started to focus on retail trade and service industry in order to avoid massacres and forced deportations to China. The Spanish authorities started restricting the activities of the Chinese immigrants and confined them to the ''Parían'' near [[Intramuros]]. With low chances of employment and prohibited from owning land, most of them engaged in small businesses or acted as skilled artisans to the Spanish colonial authorities. Most of the Chinese who arrived during the early Spanish period were Cantonese from "Canton, Nyngo, Chincheo, and Macau", who worked as stevedores and porters, as well as those skilled in the mechanical arts. From the mid-19th century, the Hokkienese migrants from Fujian would surpass and vastly outnumber the Cantonese migrants.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The Spanish authorities differentiated the Chinese immigrants into two groups: ''Parían'' (unconverted) and ''Binondo'' (converted).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Many immigrants converted to Catholicism, and due to the lack of Chinese women, intermarried with indigenous women, and adopted Hispanized names and customs. The children of unions between indigenous Filipinos and Chinese were called [[Sangley|Mestizos de Sangley]] or Chinese mestizos, while those between Spaniards and Chinese were called [[Tornatrás]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The Chinese population originally occupied the [[Binondo]] area although eventually they spread all over the islands, and became traders, moneylenders, and landowners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/1129/1/CEAS.1964.n10.pdf Wickberg, Edgar. (March 1964) "The Chinese Mestizo in Philippine History". ''The Journal of Southeast Asian History'', 5(1), 62-100. Lawrence, Kansas: The University of Kansas, CEAS.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Mestizos as Filipinos===
During the waning years of Spanish colonization in the Philippines in the 19th century, the Philippines was referred to as an "Anglo-Chinese colony with a Spanish flag" in reference to the majority of the colony's trade and industry being conducted by the Chinese while exports were controlled by British merchants.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It was during this period that the population of the ''Mestizos de Sangley'' (Chinese mestizos) greatly increased. During the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1898, they would eventually refer to themselves as ''Filipino'',{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} which during that time referred to Spaniards born in the Philippines. The Chinese mestizos would later fan the flames of the Philippine Revolution.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Many leaders of the Philippine Revolution themselves have substantial Chinese ancestry. These include [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], [[Andrés Bonifacio]], [[Marcelo del Pilar]], [[Antonio Luna]], [[José Rizal]], and [[Manuel Tinio]].&lt;ref name="Weightman 1960" /&gt;

An estimated 27% of the present-day Philippine population have some Chinese ancestry stemming from this period.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Divided nationalism (1898–1946)===
During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial period]], the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] in the United States was also put into effect in the Philippines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenagain.info/WebChron/USA/ChineseExclusion.html|title=Chinese Exclusion Act: 1882|author=|date=|website=www.thenagain.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the Chinese were able to settle in the Philippines with the help of other Chinese Filipinos, despite strict American law enforcement, usually through "adopting" relatives from Mainland or by assuming entirely new identities with new names.

The privileged position of the Chinese as middlemen of the economy under Spanish colonial rule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wickberg|first1=Edgar|title=Early Chinese Economic Influence in the Philippines, 1850–1898|url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/1072/1/CEAS.1962.n3.pdf|publisher=Extract from PACIFIC AFFAIRS Fall, 1962|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; quickly fell, as the Americans favored the ''[[principalía]]'' (educated elite) formed by Chinese mestizos and Spanish mestizos. As American rule in the Philippines started, events in [[Mainland China]] starting from the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Chinese Civil War]], and [[Boxer Rebellion]] led to the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]], which led thousands of Chinese from [[Fujian]] province in China to migrate ''en masse'' to the Philippines to avoid poverty, worsening famine, and political persecution. This group eventually formed the bulk of the current population of unmixed Chinese Filipinos.&lt;ref name="Weightman 1960" /&gt;

===Formation of the Chinese Filipino identity (1946–1975)===
Beginning in [[World War II]], Chinese soldiers and guerrillas joined in the fight against the Japanese Imperial Forces during the Japanese Occupation in the Philippines (1941–1945).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} On April 9, 1942, many Chinese Filipino Prisoners of War were killed by Japanese Forces during the [[Bataan Death March]] after the fall of [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor]] in 1942.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Chinese Filipinos were integrated in the U.S. Armed Forces of the First &amp; Second Filipino Infantry Regiments of the [[United States Army]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} After the Fall of Bataan and Corregidor in 1942, when Chinese Filipinos was joined the soldiers is a military unit of the [[Military history of the Philippines during World War II|Philippine Commonwealth Army]] under the U.S. military command is a ground arm of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) was started the battles between the Japanese Counter-Insurgencies and Allied [[Philippines campaign (1944-45)|Liberators]] from 1942 to 1945 to fought against the Japanese Imperial forces. Some Chinese-Filipinos joined the soldiers were integrated of the 11th, 14th, 15th, 66th &amp; 121st Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Philippines{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} - Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL) under the military unit of the Philippine Commonwealth Army started the Liberation in Northern Luzon and aided the provinces of [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[La Union]], [[Abra (province)|Abra]], [[Mountain Province]], [[Cagayan]], [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] and [[Nueva Vizcaya]] and attacking Imperial Japanese forces. Many Chinese-Filipinos joined the guerrilla movement of the Philippine-Chinese Anti-Japanese guerrilla resistance fighter unit or Wa Chi Movement,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} the Ampaw Unit under by Colonel Chua Sy Tiao {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and the Chinese-Filipino 48th Squadron since 1942 to 1946 to attacking Japanese forces.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Thousands of Chinese Filipino soldiers and guerrillas died of heroism in the Philippines from 1941 to 1945 during World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Thousands of Chinese Filipino Veterans are interred in the Shrine of Martyr's Freedom of the Filipino Chinese in World War II located in Manila.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The new-found unity between the ethnic Chinese migrants and the indigenous Filipinos against a common enemy - the Japanese, served as a catalyst in the formation of a Chinese Filipino identity who started to regard the Philippines as their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl100564.htm|title=Vanzi, Sol Jose.

===Assimilation and acculturation (1975–1987)===
The election of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to the Philippine presidency brought forth much of the changes within the Chinese Filipino community.

Following the recognition of the [[People's Republic of China]] as the sole representative of the Chinese government, and at the same time fearful of harboring Chinese nationals whose loyalty will shift to the newly recognized Communist government{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}, Marcos ordered a revision of all existing nationality laws which led to an easier acquisition of Philippine citizenship, which most Chinese Filipinos took advantage of. This signified a major leap for the community, majority of which now owes loyalty to [[Manila]], rather than to [[Taipei]] or [[Beijing]].

In relation to this, Chinese schools, which were governed by the [[Ministry of Education]] of the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), were transferred under the jurisdiction of the Philippine government's Department of Education. Virtually all Chinese schools were ordered closed or else to limit the time allotted for Chinese language, history, and culture subjects from 4 hours to 2 hours, and instead devote them to the study of Filipino languages and culture.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This method of teaching persists to this very day. Marcos' policies eventually led to the formal assimilation of the Chinese Filipinos into mainstream Filipino society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Palanca |first=Ellen |title=A Comparative Study of Chinese Education in the Philippines and Malaysia |date=January 1999 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila |location=Manila |url=http://192.38.121.218/issco5/documents/Palancapaper_000.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following [[People Power Revolution]] (EDSA 1), the Chinese Filipinos quickly gained national spotlight as [[Cory Aquino]], a Chinese Filipino, eventually became president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public-conversations.org.za/_pdfs/anderson_12.pdf Anderson, Benedict. (1988) Cacique Democracy in the Philippines: Origins and Dreams.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003035607/http://www.public-conversations.org.za/_pdfs/anderson_12.pdf |date=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current period (1987&amp;ndash;present)===
[[File:Corazon Aquino 1986.jpg|thumb|right|[[Corazon Aquino]], the third Philippine president of Chinese ancestry]]
The mass nationalization of ethnic Chinese during the 1970s eventually led to the eventual assimilation of the Chinese Filipinos as an integral part of the Philippines.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

However, there were still pressing problems that face the community. Despite President Aquino's Chinese ancestry, the initial proliferation of anti-Chinese sentiments among some Filipinos and the sudden attainment of freedom from Martial Law under President Marcos led to several crimes being committed against Chinese Filipinos. These include rampant extortion, kidnapping, and even murder.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/17/world/kidnapping-of-ethnic-chinese-rises-in-philippines.html|title=Kidnapping of Ethnic Chinese Rises in Philippines|first=Seth|last=Mydans|date=17 March 1996|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/24/world/chinese-filipinos-protest-ransom-kidnappings.html|title=Chinese-Filipinos Protest Ransom Kidnappings|first=Carlos H.|last=Conde|date=24 November 2003|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these led to the formation of the first Chinese Filipino organization, [[Bahay Tsinoy|Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran, Inc.]] (Unity for Progress) by Teresita Ang-See,&lt;ref group=n&gt;Teresita Ang-See is a prominent leader of the Chinese Filipino community. Kaisa, the organization she heads, aims to inform the Filipino mainstream of the contributions of the ethnic Chinese to Philippine historical, economic, and political life. At the same time, Kaisa encourages Chinese Filipinos to maintain loyalties to the Philippines, rather than China or Taiwan. Teresita Ang-See is a member of the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]].&lt;/ref&gt; which called for mutual understanding between the ethnic Chinese and the native Filipinos. Aquino encouraged free press and cultural harmony, a process which led to the burgeoning of the Chinese-language media.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lISGiGDW2Z0C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Caroline+Hau&amp;sig=ACfU3U1HXFgvR6c6gpVFnIf9BFWFlYKQgQ#PPA128,M1 Hau, Caroline S.

Figures of Criminality in Indonesia, the Philippines and Colonial Vietnam, 128-151. ''SEAP Publications''. Ithaca, New York.]&lt;/ref&gt;

While anti-Chinese sentiments were toned down, crimes against the Chinese Filipinos, particularly kidnapping, further blossomed throughout the presidencies of [[Fidel Ramos]] (1992–1998), and [[Joseph Estrada]] (1998–2000).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The police remained unsympathetic to the Chinese Filipinos, while many government officials were found to be accomplices.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The combination of these factors led many Chinese Filipinos to emigrate back to China, or to either Canada or the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} An increasing number of Chinese Filipinos also actively sought political seats to protect and promote Chinese interests.

==Origins==
[[File:Chinese Filipino Ethnicity.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Ethnicity of Chinese Filipinos, including Chinese mestizos]]
Virtually all Chinese in the Philippines belong to either the Hokkienese- or Cantonese-speaking groups of the Han Chinese ethnicity. Most Filipino-Chinese now are second or third generation, natural-born Philippine citizens who can still look back to their Chinese roots and have Chinese relatives both in China as well as in other Southeast Asian or Australasian or North American countries.

===Minnan (Hokkienese) people===

Chinese Filipinos who are classified as Minnan people (福建人) have ancestors who came from Fujian province and speak one of the Minnan dialects. They form the bulk of Chinese settlers in the Philippines after the Spanish Colonial Period, and settled primarily in Metro Manila and key cities in Luzon such as Angeles, Baguio, Dagupan, Ilagan, Laoag, Lucena, Tarlac, and Vigan, as well as in major Visayan and Mindanao cities such as Bacolod, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Davao, Dumaguete, General Santos, Iligan, Iloilo, Ormoc, Tacloban, Tagbilaran, and Zamboanga.


Minnan peoples are more popularly known as "Hokkienese", or "Fujianese" in English, or Lan-nang, Lán-lâng, Bân-lâm, Fújiànren in Chinese. The Minnan form 98.7% of all unmixed ethnic Chinese in the Philippines. Of the Minnan peoples, about 75% are from Quanzhou prefecture (specifically, Jinjiang City), 23% are from Zhangzhou prefecture, and 2% are from Xiamen City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ng |first=Maria |author2=Philip Holden |title=Reading Chinese transnationalisms: society, literature, film |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |date=1 September 2006 |page=20 |isbn=978-962-209-796-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnan peoples started migrating to the Philippines in large numbers from the early 1800s and continue to the present, eventually outnumbering the Cantonese who had always formed the majority Chinese dialect group in the country.

The Minnan (Hokkienese) currently dominate the light industry and heavy industry, as well as the entrepreneurial and real estate sectors of the economy. Many younger Minnan people are also entering the fields of banking, computer science, engineering, finance, and medicine.

To date, most emigrants and permanent residents from Mainland China, as well as the vast majority of Taiwanese people in the Philippines are Minnan (Hokkienese) people.

Linguistically related to the Hokkienese people are the [[Teochew people|Teochew]] (潮州人: Chaozhouren). They began to migrate in small numbers to the Philippines during the Spanish Period, but were eventually absorbed by intermarriage into the mainstream Hokkienese.

===Cantonese people===

Chinese Filipinos who are classified as Cantonese people (廣府人; [[Yale romanization of Cantonese|Yale]] '''''Gwóngfúyàhn''''') have ancestors who came from Guangdong province and speak one of the Cantonese dialects. They settled down in Metro Manila, as well as in major cities of Luzon such as Angeles, Naga, and Olongapo. Many also settled in the provinces of Northern Luzon (e.g., Benguet, Cagayan, Ifugao, Ilocos Norte).

The Cantonese (Guangdongnese) people (Keńg-tang-lâng, Guǎngdōngren) form roughly 1.2% of the unmixed ethnic Chinese population of the Philippines, with large numbers of descendants originally from [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]] city, [[Macau]], and nearby areas. Many are not as economically prosperous as the Minnan (Hokkienese). Barred from owning land during the Spanish Colonial Period, most Cantonese were into the service industry, working as artisans, barbers, herbal physicians, porters (''coulis''), soap makers, and tailors. They also had no qualms in intermarrying with the local Filipinos and most of their descendants are now considered Filipinos, rather than Chinese or Chinese mestizos. During the early 1800s, Chinese migration from Cantonese-speaking areas in China to the Philippines trickled to almost zero, as migrants from Hokkienese-speaking areas gradually increased, explaining the gradual decrease of the Cantonese population. Presently, they are into small-scale entrepreneurship and in education.

===Others===
There are also some ethnic Chinese from nearby Asian countries and territories, most notably [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Hong Kong]] who are naturalized Philippine citizens and have since formed part of the Chinese Filipino community. Many of them are also [[Hokkien]] speakers, with a sizeable number of [[Cantonese]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] speakers.

Temporary resident Chinese businessmen and envoys include people from [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], and other major cities and provinces throughout China.

The exact number of all ethnic Chinese in the Philippines is unknown.

According to a research report by historian Austin Craig who was commissioned by the United States in 1915 to ascertain the total number of the various races of the Philippines, the pure Chinese, referred to as ''Sangley'', number around 20,000 (as of 1918), and that around one-third of the population of Luzon have partial Chinese ancestry. This comes with a footnote about the widespread concealing and de-emphasising of the exact number of Chinese in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofaustincr00crairich/reportofaustincr00crairich_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Report of ...

==Language==
[[File:Chinese Filipino Language.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Languages spoken by Chinese Filipinos at home]]
The vast majority (74.5%) of Chinese Filipinos speak either Filipino or English as their first languages. The majority of Chinese Filipinos (77%) still retain the ability to understand and speak Hokkien as a second or third language.&lt;ref name="Teresita Ang-See, p. 57" /&gt;

The use of Minnan (Hokkien) as first language is seemingly confined to the older generation, as well as in Chinese families living in traditional Chinese bastions, such as Binondo in Manila and Caloocan. In part due to the increasing adoption of Philippine nationality during the Marcos era, most Chinese Filipinos born from the 1970s up to the mid-1990s tend to use Filipino or other Philippine regional languages, frequently admixed with both Minnan and English. Among the younger generation (born mid-1990s onward), the preferred language is English. Recent arrivals from Mainland China or Taiwan, despite coming from traditionally Minnan-speaking areas, typically use Mandarin among themselves.

Unlike other Overseas Chinese communities in [[Southeast Asia]] which featured a multiplicity of dialect groups, Chinese Filipinos descend overwhelmingly from [[Southern Min|Minnan]]-speaking regions in Fujian province. Hence, Minnan (Hokkien) remains the ‘’lingua franca’’ among Chinese Filipinos. [[Philippine Mandarin|Mandarin]], however, is perceived as the prestigious dialect, and it is used in all official and formal functions within the Chinese community, despite the fact that very few Chinese are conversant in Mandarin.&lt;ref name="Teresita Ang-See, p. 57" /&gt;

For the Chinese mestizos, Spanish used to be the important commercial language and the preferred first language at the turn of the century. Starting from the American period, the use of Spanish gradually decreased and is now completely replaced by either English or Filipino.&lt;ref name="Teresita Ang-See, p. 60" /&gt;

===Minnan (Philippine Hokkien)===
{{Main article|Philippine Hokkien}}

Since most of the Chinese in the Philippines trace their ancestry to the southern part of [[Fujian]] province in China, Minnan, otherwise known as Hokkienese is the ''lingua franca'' of Chinese Filipinos.

The variant of Minnan or Hokkienese spoken in the Philippines, Philippine Hokkien, is called locally as ''lan-lang-oe'', meaning, "our people's language". Philippine Hokkien is mutually intelligible with other Minnan variants in China, Taiwan, and Malaysia, and is particularly close to the variant of Minnan spoken in Quanzhou.  Its unique features include the presence of loanwords (Spanish, English, and Philippine language), excessive use of colloquial words (e.g., ''piⁿ-chu''病厝: literally, "sick-house", instead of the Standard Minnan term ''pīⁿ-īⁿ'': hospital; or ''chhia-tao'': literally, "car-head", instead of the Standard Minnan term  ''su-ki''), and use of words from various variants within Minnan (such as Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen).

Due to the relatively small population of Chinese Filipinos who are Cantonese, most of them, especially the new generation, never learned Cantonese.

===Mandarin===
{{Main article|Philippine Mandarin}}

[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is the medium of instruction of Chinese subjects in Chinese schools in the Philippines. However, since the language is rarely used outside of the classroom, most Chinese Filipinos would be hard-pressed to converse in Mandarin, much less read books using Chinese characters.

As a result of longstanding influence from the Ministry of Education of the [[Overseas Chinese Affairs Council]] of the Republic of China (Taiwan) since the early 1900s up to 2000, the Mandarin variant taught and spoken in the Philippines closely mirror that of Taiwan. While Traditional Chinese characters and the [[Bopomofo]] phonetic system are still used, instead of the Simplified characters and Pinyin phonetic system currently being used in both Mainland China and Singapore.

===Cantonese===
{{Main Article|Philippine Cantonese}}

===English===
The vast majority of the Chinese in the Philippines are fluent in [[English language|English]]{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} - and around 30% of all Chinese Filipinos, mostly those belonging to the younger generation, use English as their first language.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Filipino===
As with English, the majority of Chinese Filipinos speak the Philippine language of the region where they live (e.g., Chinese Filipinos living in Manila speak Tagalog).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Many Chinese Filipinos, especially those living in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], speak the regional language of their area as their first language.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Spanish===
Spanish was an important language of the Chinese-Filipino, Chinese-Spanish, and ''Tornatras'' (Chinese-Spanish-Filipino) mestizos during most of the 20th century. Most of the elites of Philippine society during that time was made up of both Spanish mestizos and Chinese mestizos.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Many of the older generation Chinese (mainly those born before WWII), whether pure or mixed, can also understand some Spanish, due to its importance in commerce and industry.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Hokaglish===
{{Main article|Hokaglish}}

Chinese Filipinos or Filipino-Chinese have a trilingual facility which they use in everyday life. During informal, as well as local business transactions, codeswitching between Minnan ([[Philippine Hokkien]]), English, and Filipino is very common and comes naturally, as a result of having to maintain command of all three languages in the spheres of home, school, and greater Philippine society. Other places where this code-switching is observed are academic institutions, restaurants, religious institutions, phone calls, and houses.&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290395747_Exploring_trilingual_code-switching_The_case_of_'Hokaglish'|title=Exploring trilingual code-switching: The case of ‘Hokaglish’ (PDF Download Available)|author=|date=|website=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Chinese Filipino Religious Persuasion.jpg|thumb|400 px|right|Religions of Chinese Filipinos]]
Chinese Filipinos are unique in Southeast Asia in being overwhelmingly Christian (83%).&lt;ref name="Teresita Ang-See, p. 57" /&gt; Almost all Chinese Filipinos, including the Chinese ''mestizos'' but excluding recent immigrants from either Mainland China or Taiwan, had or will have their marriages in a Christian church.&lt;ref name="Teresita Ang-See, p. 57" /&gt;

; Roman Catholicism
Majority (70%) of Christian Chinese Filipinos are [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholics]].&lt;ref name="Teresita Ang-See, p. 57" /&gt; Many Catholic Chinese Filipinos still tend to practice the traditional Chinese religions side by side with Catholicism, due to the openness of the Church in accommodating Chinese beliefs such as ancestor veneration.

Unique to the Catholicism of Chinese Filipinos is the religious syncretism that is found in Chinese Filipino homes. Many have altars bearing Catholic images such as the ''[[Santo Niño de Cebu|Santo Niño]]'' (Child Jesus) as well as statues of the [[Buddha]] and Taoist gods. It is not unheard of to venerate the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] using joss sticks and otherwise Buddhist offerings, much as one would have done for [[Guan Yin]] or [[Matsu (goddess)|Mazu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alineang.blogspot.com/2006/09/feast-of-ma-cho.html|title=Feast of Ma-cho|author=|date=28 September 2006|website=alineang.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Protestantism
Approximately 13% of all Christian Chinese Filipinos are [[Protestantism|Protestants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=RP Joshua Project - Ethnic People Groups of Philippines]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Chinese Filipino schools are founded by Protestant missionaries and churches.

Chinese Filipinos comprise a large percentage of membership in some of the largest [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches in the Philippines, many of which are also founded by Chinese Filipinos, such as the [[Christian Gospel Center]], [[Christ's Commission Fellowship]], [[United Evangelical Church of the Philippines]], and the [[Youth Gospel Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apts.edu/jam/99-1/j-shao.pdf Shao, Joseph T. (1999) Heritage of the Chinese-Filipino Protestant Churches. ''Journal of Asian Mission'', 1(1), 93-99.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409133235/http://www.apts.edu/jam/99-1/j-shao.pdf |date=2008-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Roman Catholicism, Protestantism forbids traditional Chinese practices such as ancestor veneration, but allows the use of meaning or context substitution for some practices that are not directly contradicted in the Bible (e.g., celebrating the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] with moon cakes denoting the moon as God's creation and the unity of families, rather than the traditional Chinese belief in [[Chang'e]]). Many also had ancestors already practicing Protestantism while still in China.

Unlike ethnic Filipino-dominated Protestant churches in the Philippines which have very close ties with North American organizations, most Protestant Chinese Filipino churches instead sought alliance and membership with the [[Chinese Congress on World Evangelization]], an organization of Overseas Chinese Christian churches throughout Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cccowe.org/8ccowe/eng_index.php|title=8th CCOWE|author=|date=|website=Chinese Coordination Centre of World Evangelism (CCCOWE)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of Chinese Filipinos (2%) continue to practise traditional Chinese religions solely.

Buddhist and Taoist temples can be found where the Chinese live, especially in urban areas like Manila.&lt;ref group=n&gt;most prominently the Buddhist [[Seng Guan Temple]] in Tondo, Manila.&lt;/ref&gt; Veneration of the [[Guanyin]] (觀音), known locally as ''Kuan-im'' either in its pure form or seen a representation of the [[Virgin Mary]] is practised by many Chinese Filipinos.

Around half (40%) of all Chinese Filipinos regardless of religion still claim to practise ''ancestor worship''.&lt;ref name="Teresita Ang-See, p. 57" /&gt; The Chinese, especially the older generations, have the tendency to go to pay respects to their ancestors at least once a year, either by going to the temple, or going to the Chinese burial grounds, often burning incense and bringing offerings like fruits and accessories made from paper.

; Others
There are very few Chinese [[Filipino Muslim]]s, most of whom live in either [[Mindanao]] or the Sulu Archipelago, and have intermarried or assimilated with their [[Moro people|Moro]] neighbors. Many of them have attained prominent positions as Islamic political leaders. They include [[Datu Piang]], [[Abdusakur Mahail Tan|Abdusakur Tan]], and [[Michael Mastura]], among such others.

Others are also members of the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], or [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Some younger generations of Chinese Filipinos also profess to be atheists.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Education==

There are 150 Chinese schools that exist throughout the Philippines, slightly more than half of which operate in Metro Manila.&lt;ref name="mccarthy" /&gt; Chinese Filipino schools have an international reputation for producing award-winning students in the fields of science and mathematics, most of whom reap international awards in mathematics, computer programming, and robotics olympiads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/369357/filipino-math-wizards-reap-medals-in-hong-kong]&lt;/ref&gt;

;History
The first school founded specifically for Chinese in the Philippines, the [[Anglo-Chinese school]] (now known as [[Tiong Se Academy]]) was opened in 1899 inside the Chinese Embassy grounds. The first curriculum called for rote memorization of the four major Confucian texts [[Four Books and Five Classics]], as well as Western science and technology. This was followed suit by the establishment of other Chinese schools, such as [[Hua Siong College of Iloilo]] established in Iloilo in 1912, the [[Manila Patriotic School|Chinese Patriotic School]] established in Manila in 1912 and also the first school for Cantonese Chinese, [[Saint Stephen's High School]] established in Manila in 1915 and was the first sectarian school for the Chinese, and [[Cebu Eastern College|Chinese National School]] in Cebu in 1915.&lt;ref name="mccarthy" /&gt;

Burgeoning of Chinese schools throughout the Philippines as well as in Manila occurred from the 1920s until the 1970s, with a brief interlude during World War II, when all Chinese schools were ordered closed by the Japanese, and their students were forcibly integrated with Japanese-sponsored Philippine public education. After [[World War II]], the Philippines and the Republic of China signed the [[Sino-Philippine Treaty of Amity]], which provided for the direct control of the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]]'s [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] over Chinese schools throughout the archipelago.

Such situation continued until 1973, when amendments made to the [[Philippine Constitution]] effectively transferred all Chinese schools to the authority of the [[Republic of the Philippines]]' [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]].&lt;ref name="mccarthy" /&gt; With this, the medium of instruction was shifted from [[Mandarin Chinese]] to English. Teaching hours relegated to Chinese language and arts, which featured prominently in the pre-1973 Chinese schools, were reduced. Lessons in Chinese geography and history, which were previously subjects in their own right, were integrated with the Chinese language subjects, whereas, the teaching of Filipino and Philippine history, civics, and culture became new required subjects.

The changes in Chinese education initiated with the 1973 Philippine Constitution led to the large shifting of mother tongues and assimilation of the Chinese Filipinos to general Philippine society. The older generation Chinese Filipinos who were educated in the old curriculum typically used Chinese (e.g., Hokkien and Cantonese) at home, while most younger generation Chinese Filipinos are more comfortable conversing in either English or Filipino admixed with Chinese.

;Curriculum
Chinese Filipino schools typically feature curriculum prescribed by the Philippine Department of Education. The limited time spent in Chinese instruction consists largely of language arts.

The three core Chinese subjects are 華語 (Mandarin: Huáyŭ; Hokkien: Hoâ-gí, English: Chinese Grammar), 綜合 (Mandarin: Zōnghé; Hokkien: Chong-ha'p; English: Chinese Composition), and 數學 (Mandarin: Shùxué; Hokkien: Sòha'k; English: Chinese Mathematics). Other schools may add other subjects such as 毛筆 (Mandarin: Máobĭ; Hokkien: Mô-pit; English: Chinese calligraphy) . Chinese history, geography, and culture are integrated in all the three core Chinese subjects - they stood as independent subjects of their own before 1973. All Chinese subjects are taught in Mandarin Chinese, and in some schools, students are prohibited from speaking English, Filipino, or even Hokkien during Chinese classes.

;[[File:Philippine Cultural College.jpg|thumb|[[Philippine Cultural College]], also known as Kiâo Tiong in [[Hokkien]].]]Schools and Universities
Many Chinese Filipino schools are sectarian, being founded by either Roman Catholic or Protestant Chinese missions. These include [[Grace Christian College]] (Protestant-Baptist), Hope Christian High School (Protestant-Evangelical), [[Immaculate Conception Academy-Greenhills|Immaculate Conception Academy]] (Roman Catholic-Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception), Jubilee Christian Academy (Protestant-Evangelical), LIGHT Christian Academy (Protestant-Evangelical), Makati Hope Academy (Protestant-Evangelical), [[MGC-New Life Christian Academy]] (Protestant-Evangelical), Saint Peter the Apostle School (Roman Catholic-Archdiocese of Manila), [[Saint Jude Catholic School (Manila)|Saint Jude Catholic School]] (Roman Catholic-Society of Divine Word), [[Saint Stephen's High School]] (Protestant-Episcopalian), [[Ateneo de Iloilo]], [[Ateneo de Cebu]], and [[Xavier School]] (Roman Catholic-Society of Jesus).

Major non-sectarian schools include [[Chiang Kai Shek College]], [[Manila Patriotic School]], [[Philippine Chen Kuang School]], [[Philippine Chung Hua School]], [[Philippine Cultural College]] - the oldest Chinese Filipino '''secondary''' school in the Philippines, and [[Tiong Se Academy]] - the oldest Chinese Filipino school in the Philippines.

[[Chiang Kai Shek College]] is the only college in the Philippines accredited by both the Philippine Department of Education and the Republic of China (Taiwan) Ministry of Education.

Most Chinese Filipinos attend Chinese Filipino schools until Secondary level, and then transfer to non-Chinese colleges and universities to complete their tertiary degree, due to the dearth of Chinese language tertiary institutions.

==Name format==
{{Main article|Chinese name}}

Most Chinese Filipinos, particularly the younger generation, now follow the typical Western naming convention (given name, then family name), albeit with English first names coupled with Chinese surnames .{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

;Historical trends in naming
Many Chinese who lived during the Spanish naming edict of 1849 eventually adopted Spanish name formats, along with a Spanish given name (e.g., Florentino Cu y Chua).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Some adopted their entire Chinese name as a surname for the entire clan (e.g., Alberto Cojuangco from 許寰哥, ''Khó-hoân-ko''). Chinese mestizos, as well as some Chinese who chose to completely assimilate into the Filipino or Spanish culture, adopted Spanish surnames.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Newer Chinese migrants who came during the American Colonial Period use a combination of an adopted Spanish (or rarely, English) name together with their Chinese name (e.g., Carlos Palanca Tan Quin Lay or Vicente Go Tam Co).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This trend was to continue up to the late 1970s.

As both exposure to North American media as well as the number of Chinese Filipinos educated in English increased, the use of English names among Chinese Filipinos, both common and unusual, started to increase as well. Popular names among the second generation Chinese community included English names ending in "-son" or other Chinese-sounding suffixes, such as ''Anderson'', ''Emerson'', ''Patrickson'', ''Washington'', among such others. For parents who are already third and fourth generation Chinese Filipinos, English names reflecting American popular trends are given, such as ''Ethan'', ''Austin'', and ''Aidan''.

It is thus not unusual to find a young Chinese Filipino named ''Chase Tan'' whose father's name is ''Emerson Tan'' and whose grandfather's name was ''Elpidio Tan Keng Kui'', reflecting the depth of immersion into the English language as well as into the Philippine society as a whole.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

;Surnames
Chinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines from 1898 onward usually have single syllable Chinese surnames, the most common of which are [[Chen (surname)|Tan]] (陳), [[Wang (surname)|Ong]] (王), [[Lin (surname)|Lim]] (林), [[Wu (surname)|Go/Ngo]] (吳), [[Huang (surname)|Ng/Uy/Wong]] (黃), [[Gao (surname)|Gao/Kao]] (高), [[Cai (surname)|Chua/Cua]] (蔡), [[Si (surname)|Sy/See/Si]] (施), [[Xǔ (surname)|Co]] (許), [[Li (李)|Lee/Dy]] (李), [[Ang (surname)|Ang/Hong/Hung]] (洪)and [[Zhuang (surname)|Ching/Chong]] (莊).

Many also took on Spanish or Filipino surnames (e.g. Bautista, De la Cruz, De la Rosa, Gatchalian, Mercado, Palanca, Robredo, Sanchez, Tagle, Torres etc.) upon naturalization. Today, it can be difficult to identify who are Chinese Filipinos based on surnames alone.

A phenomenon common among Chinese migrants in the Philippines dating from the 1900s would be ''purchasing of surnames'', particularly during the American Colonial Period, when the Chinese Exclusion Act was applied to the Philippines. Such law led new Chinese migrants to 'purchase' the surnames of Filipinos and thus pass off as long time Filipino residents of Chinese descent, or as ethnic Filipinos. Many also 'purchased' the Alien Landing Certificates of other Chinese who have gone back to China and assumed his surname and/or identity. Sometimes, younger Chinese migrants would circumvent the Act through ''adoption'' - wherein a Chinese with Philippine nationality ''adopts'' a relative or a stranger as his own children, thereby giving the ''adoptee'' automatic Filipino citizenship - and a new surname.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

On the other hand, most Chinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines prior to 1898 use a Hispanicized surname ''(see below)''.

;Hispanicized surnames
Chinese Filipinos, as well as Chinese mestizos who trace their roots back to Chinese immigrants to the Philippines during the Spanish Colonial Period, usually have multiple syllable Chinese surnames such as Angseeco (from ang/see/co/kho) Aliangan (from liang/gan),Angkeko (from ang/ke/co/kho), Chuacuco, Chuatoco, Chuateco, Ciacho (from Sia), Cojuangco, Corong, Cuyegkeng, Dioquino, Dytoc, Dy-Cok, Dysangco, Dytioco, Gueco, Gokongwei, Gundayao, Kimpo/Quimpo, King/Quing, Landicho, Lanting, Limcuando, Ongpin, Pempengco, Quebengco, Siopongco, Sycip, Tambengco, Tambunting, Tanbonliong, Tantoco, Tiolengco, Tiongson, Yuchengco, Tanciangco, Yuipco, Yupangco, Licauco, Limcaco, Ongpauco, Tancangco, Tanchanco, Teehankee, Uytengsu, and Yaptinchay among such others. These were originally full Chinese names which were transliterated into Spanish and adopted as surnames.&lt;ref name=alipem-2 /&gt;

There are also multiple syllable Chinese surnames that are Spanish transliterations of Hokkien words. Surnames like Tuazon (Eldest Grandson, 大孫), Dizon (Second Grandson, 二孫), Samson (Third Grandson, 三孫), Singson (Fourth Grandson, 四孫), Gozon (Fifth Grandson, 五孫), Lacson (Sixth Grandson, 六孫) are examples of transliterations of designations that use the Hokkien suffix -son (孫) used as surnames for some Chinese Filipinos who trace their ancestry from Chinese immigrants to the Philippines during the Spanish Colonial Period. It should be noted as well that [[Sun (surname)|"Son/Sun"]] (孫) is a surname listed in the classic Chinese text [[Hundred Family Surnames]], perhaps shedding light on the Hokkien suffix -son used here as a surname alongside some sort of accompanying enumeration scheme.

Many Filipinos who have Hispanicized Chinese surnames are no longer full Chinese, but are Chinese mestizos.

==Food==
{{Main article|Filipino Chinese cuisine}}
[[File:Lumpiang shanghaijf4063.JPG|thumb|227x227px|[[Lumpia]] ([[Hokkien]]: 潤餅), a [[spring roll]] of [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] origin. ]]
Traditional ''Tsinoy'' cuisine, as Chinese Filipino home-based dishes are locally known, make use of recipes that are traditionally found in China's [[Fujian]] province and fuse them with locally available ingredients and recipes. These include unique foods such as ''hokkien chha-peng'' (Fujianese-style fried rice), ''si-nit mi-soa'' (birthday noodles), ''pansit canton'' (Fujianese-style e-fu noodles), ''hong ma'' or ''humba'' (braised pork belly), ''sibut'' (four-herb chicken soup), ''hototay'' (Fujianese egg drop soup), ''kiampeng'' (Fujianese beef fried rice), ''machang'' (glutinous rice with adobo), and ''taho'' (a dessert made of soft tofu, ''arnibal'' syrup, and pearl sago).

However, most Chinese restaurants in the Philippines, as in other places, feature [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Shanghainese cuisine|Shanghainese]] and Northern Chinese cuisines, rather than traditional [[Fujianese cuisine|Fujianese]] fare.

==Politics==

With the increasing number of Chinese with Philippine nationality, the number of political candidates of Chinese Filipino descent also started to increase. The most significant change within Chinese Filipino political life would be the citizenship decree promulgated by former President Ferdinand Marcos which opened the gates for thousands of Chinese Filipinos to formally adopt Philippine citizenship.

Chinese Filipino political participation largely began with the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 which toppled the Marcos dictatorship and ushered in the Aquino presidency. The Chinese have been known to vote in blocs in favor of political candidates who are favorable to the Chinese community.

Important Philippine political leaders with Chinese ancestry include the current and former presidents [[Rodrigo Duterte]], [[Benigno Aquino III]], [[Cory Aquino]], [[Sergio Osmeña]], and [[Ferdinand Marcos]], former senators [[Nikki Coseteng]], [[Alfredo Lim]], and [[Roseller Lim]], as well as several governors, congressmen, and mayors throughout the Philippines. Many ambassadors and recent appointees to the presidential cabinet are also Chinese Filipinos like [[Arthur Yap (politician)|Arthur Yap]].

The late Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]] and Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] also have Chinese ancestry.

; Society

The Chinese Filipinos are mostly business owners{{according to whom|date=October 2013}} and their life centers mostly in the family business. These mostly small or medium enterprises play a significant role in the Philippine economy. A handful of these entrepreneurs run large companies and are respected as some of the most prominent business tycoons in the Philippines.

Chinese Filipinos attribute their success in business to frugality and hard work, Confucian values and their traditional Chinese customs and traditions. They are very business-minded and entrepreneurship is highly valued and encouraged among the young.  Most Chinese Filipinos are urban dwellers. An estimated 50% of the Chinese Filipinos live within Metro Manila, with the rest in the other major [[cities of the Philippines]]. In contrast with the Chinese mestizos, few Chinese are plantation owners. This is partly due to the fact that until recently when the Chinese Filipinos became Filipino citizens, the law prohibited the non-citizens, which most Chinese were, from owning land.

; Culture
As with other Southeast Asian nations, the Chinese community in the Philippines has become a repository of traditional Chinese culture common to unassimilated ethnic minorities throughout the world. Whereas in mainland China many cultural traditions and customs were suppressed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] or simply regarded as old-fashioned nowadays, these traditions have remained largely untouched in the Philippines.

Many new cultural twists have evolved within the Chinese community in the Philippines, distinguishing it from other overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. These cultural variations are highly evident during festivals such as [[Chinese New Year]] and [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].  The Chinese Filipinos have developed unique customs pertaining to weddings, birthdays, and funerary rituals.

Wedding traditions of Chinese Filipinos, regardless of religious persuasion, usually involve identification of the dates of supplication/''pamamanhikan'' (''kiu-hun''), engagement (''ting-hun''), and wedding (''kan-chhiu'') adopted from Filipino customs, through ''feng shui'' based on the birthdates of the couple, as well as of their parents and grandparents. Certain customs found among Chinese Filipinos include the following: During supplication (''kiu-hun''), a solemn tea ceremony within the house of the groom ensues where the couple will be served tea, egg noodles (''misua''), and given ''ang-paos'' (red packets containing money). During the supplication ceremony, pregnant women and recently engaged couples are forbidden from attending the ceremony. Engagement (''ting-hun'') quickly follows, where the bride enters the ceremonial room walking backward and turned three times before being allowed to see the groom. A welcome drink consisting of red-colored juice is given to the couple, quickly followed by the exchange of gifts for both families and the Wedding tea ceremony, where the bride serves the groom's family, and vice versa. The engagement reception consists of sweet tea soup and misua, both of which symbolizes long-lasting relationship. Before the wedding, the groom is expected to provide the matrimonial bed in the future couple's new home. A baby born under the Chinese sign of the Dragon may be placed in the bed to ensure fertility. He is also tasked to deliver the wedding gown to his bride on the day prior to the wedding to the sister of the bride, as it is considered ill fortune for the groom to see the bride on that day. For the bride, she prepares an initial batch of personal belongings (''ke-chheng'') to the new home, all wrapped and labeled with the Chinese characters for ''sang-hi''. On the wedding date, the bride wears a red robe emblazoned with the emblem of a dragon prior to wearing the bridal gown, to which a pair of ''sang-hi'' (English: marital happiness) coin is sewn. Before leaving her home, the bride then throws a fan bearing the Chinese characters for ''sang-hi'' toward her mother to preserve harmony within the bride's family upon her departure. Most of the wedding ceremony then follows Catholic or Protestant traditions. Post-Wedding rituals include the two single brothers or relatives of the bride giving the couple a ''wa-hoe'' set, which is a bouquet of flowers with umbrella and sewing kit'', for which the bride gives an ''ang-pao'' in return. After three days, the couple then visits the bride's family, upon which a pair of sugar cane branch is given, which is a symbol of good luck and vitality among Hokkien people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kasal.com/html/philippine-wedding/wedding-article/filipino-chinese-wedding-rituals.html|title=A Guide to the Filipino-Chinese Wedding Rituals - Wedding Article - Kasal.com - The Essential Philippine Wedding Planning Guide|author=|date=|website=www.kasal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birthday traditions of Chinese Filipino involves large banquet receptions, always featuring noodles&lt;ref&gt;Filipinos usually cook and serve pansit noodles on birthdays to wish for long life.&lt;/ref&gt; and round-shaped desserts. All the relatives of the birthday celebrant are expected to wear red clothing which symbolize respect for the celebrant. Wearing clothes with a darker hue is forbidden and considered bad luck. During the reception, relatives offer ''ang paos'' (red packets containing money) to the birthday celebrant, especially if he is still unmarried. For older celebrants, boxes of egg noodles (''misua'') and eggs on which red paper is placed are given.

Births of babies are not celebrated and they are usually given pet names, which he keeps until he reaches first year of age. The Philippine custom of [[circumcision]] is widely practiced within the Chinese Filipino community regardless of religion, albeit at a lesser rate as compared to ethnic Filipinos .{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} First birthdays are celebrated with much pomp and pageantry, and grand receptions are hosted by the child's paternal grandparents.

Funerary traditions of Chinese Filipinos mirror those found in [[Fujian]]. A unique tradition of many Chinese Filipino families is the hiring of professional mourners which is alleged to hasten the ascent of a dead relative's soul into Heaven. This belief particularly mirrors the merger of traditional Chinese beliefs with the Catholic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megascene.net/?p=1480|title=Philippine Funeral Customs - MegaScene|author=|date=|website=www.megascene.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Subculture according to Acculturation
Chinese Filipinos, especially in Metro Manila, are also divided into several social types. These types are not universally accepted as a fact, but are nevertheless recognized by most Chinese Filipinos to be existent. These reflect an underlying generational gap within the community.:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cccowe.org/eng/content_epub.php?epubId=1&amp;issueId=6&amp;id=41&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Culturally-pure Chinese''—Consists of Chinese Filipinos who speaks fluent Hokkien and heavily accented Filipino and/or English. Characterized as the "traditional shop-keeper image", they hardly socialize outside the Chinese community and insist on promoting Chinese language and values over others, and acculturation as opposed to assimilation into the general Philippine community. Most of the older generation and many of the younger ones belong to this category.
* ''Binondo/Camanava Chinese''—Consists of Chinese Filipinos who speaks fluent Hokkien and good Filipino and/or English. Their social contacts are largely Chinese, but also maintain contacts with some Filipinos. Most of them own light or heavy industry manufacturing plants, or are into large-scale entrepreneurial trading and real estate. Most tycoons such as [[Henry Sy]], [[Lucio Tan]], and [[John Gokongwei]] would fall into this category, as well as most Chinese Filipinos residing in Binondo district of Manila, Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela, hence the term.
* ''Greenhills/Quezon City Chinese''—Consists of Chinese Filipinos who prefer to speak English (or [[Taglish]]) as their first language, but poor or passable Hokkien and Mandarin. Most belong to the younger generation of Manila-based Chinese. Culturally, they are influenced by Western/Filipino thought and culture. Many enter the banking, computer science, engineering, finance, and medical professions. Many live in the Greenhills area and in the La Loma, New Manila, Sta. Mesa Heights, and Corinthian Garden districts of Quezon City, hence the term.
* ''Probinsyanong Chinese''—Consists of Chinese Filipinos who largely reside outside of Metro Manila. They speak Tagalog, Cebuano, or a Philippine language, but are fluent in English, and mostly poor in Hokkien. They are known by other Chinese as the ''probinsyanong Intsik''.

; Subculture according to Period of arrivals
Most of the Chinese mestizos, especially the landed gentry trace their ancestry to the Spanish era. They are the "First Chinese" or [[Sangley]] whose descendants nowadays are mostly integrated into Philippine society. Most are from Guangdong province in China, with a minority coming from Fujian. They have embraced a Hispanized Filipino culture since the 17th century. After the end of Spanish rule, their descendants, the Chinese mestizos, managed to invent a cosmopolitan ''mestizo'' culture {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} coupled with an extravagant [[Sangley|Mestizo de Sangley]] lifestyle, intermarrying either with ethnic Filipinos or with Spanish mestizos.

The largest group of Chinese in the Philippines are the "Second Chinese," who are descendants of migrants in the first half of the 20th century, between the anti-Manchu [[1911 Revolution]] in China and the [[Chinese Civil War]]. This group accounts for most of the "full-blooded" Chinese. They are almost entirely from Fujian province.

The "Third Chinese" are the second largest group of Chinese, the recent immigrants from Mainland China, after the [[Chinese economic reform]] of the 1980s. Generally, the "Third Chinese" are the most entrepreneurial and have not totally lost their Chinese identity in its purest form and seen by some "Second Chinese" as a business threat. Meanwhile, continuing immigration from Mainland China further enlarge this group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcij.org/i-report/2007/chinese3.html Palanca, Carlos (11 July 2007). Beyond Binondo and Ma Ling.

;[[File:Yuchengco Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall]] at De La Salle University.]]Civic organizations
Aside from their family businesses, Chinese Filipinos are active in Chinese oriented civic organizations related to education, health care, public safety, social welfare and public charity. As most Chinese Filipinos are reluctant to participate in politics and government, they have instead turned to civic organizations as their primary means of contributing to the general welfare of the Chinese community. Beyond the traditional family and clan associations, Chinese Filipinos tend to be active members of numerous alumni associations holding annual reunions for the benefit of their Chinese-Filipino secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopealumniofamerica.org/15601.html|title=Official Website of Hope Christian High School Alumni Association of America|author=|date=|website=hopealumniofamerica.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326172336/http://www.hopealumniofamerica.org/15601.html|archivedate=2008-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St Lukes Medical Center BGC.JPG|thumb|St. Lukes Medical Center at [[Bonifacio Global City]].]]
Outside of secondary schools catering to Chinese Filipinos, some Chinese Filipino businessmen have established charitable foundations that aim to help others and at the same time minimize tax liabilities. Notable ones include the Gokongwei Brothers Foundation, Metrobank Foundation, Tan Yan Kee Foundation, Angelo King Foundation, Jollibee Foundation, Alfonso Yuchengco Foundation, Cityland Foundation, etc. Some Chinese-Filipino benefactors have also contributed to the creation of several centers of scholarship in prestigious Philippine Universities, including the John Gokongwei School of Management at Ateneo de Manila, the Yuchengco Center at [[De La Salle University]], and the Ricardo Leong Center of Chinese Studies at Ateneo de Manila. Coincidentally, both Ateneo and [[De La Salle University|La Salle]] enroll a large number of Chinese-Filipino students. In health care, Chinese Filipinos were instrumental in establishing and building medical centers that cater for the Chinese community such as the [[Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center]], the [[Metropolitan Medical Center]], [[Chong Hua Hospital]] and the [[St. Luke's Medical Center, Inc.]],{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} one of Asia's leading health care institutions. In public safety, Teresita Ang See's Kaisa, a Chinese-Filipino civil rights group, organized the Citizens Action Against Crime and the Movement for the Restoration of Peace and Order at the height of a wave of anti-Chinese kidnapping incidents in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcij.org/i-report/edsa20/teresita-ang-see.html|title=Teresita Ang See - Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism|author=|date=|website=www.pcij.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to fighting crime against Chinese, Chinese Filipinos have organized volunteer fire brigades all over the country, reportedly the best in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinefirefighter.org/members.php|title=Association Of Volunteer Fire Chiefs &amp; Fire Fighter|author=|date=|website=philippinefirefighter.org|access-date=2008-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308203117/http://www.philippinefirefighter.org/members.php|archive-date=2008-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cater to the Chinese community. In the arts and culture, the Bahay Tsinoy and the Yuchengco Museum were established by Chinese Filipinos to showcase the arts, culture and history of the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuchengcomuseum.org/ Yuchengco Museum - Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

; Ethnic Chinese perception of Filipinos
Filipinos were initially referred to as ''[[Huan Na|hoan-á]]'' (番仔) by ethnic Chinese in the Philippines. It is also used in other Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Singapore by Hokkien speaking ethnic Chinese to refer to peoples of [[Malay race|Malay]] ancestry. The term itself means "barbarian" since the Chinese people considered anyone beyond their borders as outsiders. Most older Chinese still use the term, while younger Chinese now use the term ''hui-li̍p-pin lâng'' (菲律宾人), which directly means, "Philippine person", or simply "Filipino".

Chinese Filipinos generally perceive the government and authorities to be unsympathetic to the plight of the ethnic Chinese, especially in terms of frequent kidnapping for ransom. While the vast majority of older generation Chinese Filipinos still remember the rabid anti-Chinese taunts and the anti-Chinese raids and searches done by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and Bureau of Immigration, most of the third or fourth generation Chinese Filipinos generally view the Philippine people and government positively, and have largely forgotten about the historical oppression of the ethnic Chinese. They are also most likely to consider themselves as "Filipino" and support the Philippines, rather than China or Taiwan.

Some Chinese Filipinos believe racism still exists toward their community among a minority of Filipinos, who the Chinese refer to as '''''pai-hua''''' (排華) in the local Minnan dialect. Organizations belonging to this category include the [[Laspip Movement]], headed by Adolfo Abadeza, as well as the [[Kadugong Liping Pilipino]], founded by [[Armando Ducat, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webspawner.com/users/laspipmovement2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200707/http://www.webspawner.com/users/laspipmovement2 |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|reason= no credible, or any, record of Laspip of KLP|date=October 2013}}

==Intermarriage==
Chinese [[mestizo]]s are persons of mixed Chinese and either Spanish or indigenous Filipino ancestry. They are thought to make up as much as 25% of the country's total population. A number of Chinese mestizos have surnames that reflect their heritage, mostly two or three syllables that have Chinese roots (e.g., the full name of a Chinese ancestor) with a Hispanized phonetic spelling.

During the Spanish colonial period, the Spanish authorities encouraged the Chinese male immigrants to convert to Catholicism. Those who converted got baptized and their names Hispanized, and were allowed to intermarry with indigenous women. They and their mestizo offspring became colonial subjects of the Spanish crown, and as such were granted several privileges and afforded numerous opportunities denied to the unconverted, non-citizen Chinese. Starting as traders, they branched out into landleasing, moneylending and later, landholding.

Chinese mestizo men and women were encouraged to marry Spanish and indigenous women and men,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} by means of dowries, {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} in a policy to mix the races of the Philippines so it would be impossible to expel the Spanish.&lt;ref name=blair-tpi-52 /&gt;{{rp|page=86}}

In these days however, blood purity is still of prime concern in most traditional Chinese-Filipino families especially pure-blooded ones. The Chinese believe that a Chinese must only be married to a fellow Chinese since the marriage to a Filipino or any outsider was considered taboo.

Chinese marriage to Filipinos and outsiders posts uncertainty on both parties. The Chinese family structure is patriarchal hence, it is the male that carries the last name of the family which also carries the legacy of the family itself. Male Chinese marriage to a Filipina or any outsider is more admissible than vice versa. In the case of the Chinese female marrying a Filipino or any outsider, it may cause several unwanted issues especially on the side of the Chinese family.

In some instances, a member of a traditional Chinese-Filipino family may be denied of his or her inheritance and likely to be disowned by his or her family by marrying an outsider without their consent. However, there some are exceptions in which intermarriage to a Filipino or any outsider is permissible provided the aforementioned's family is well-off and/or influential.

On the other hand, modern Chinese-Filipino families allow their children to marry a Filipino or any outsider. However, many of them would still prefer that the Filipino or any outsider would have some or little Chinese blood.

From small trade cooperatives clustered by hometown pawn brokers, Chinese Filipinos would go on to establish and incorporate the largest banking institutions in the country. Chinese Filipinos have dominated the Filipino financial services sector and have been in the banking sector since the early part of the 20th century.

Of the 500 real estate firms in the Philippines, 120 are Chinese-owned and mostly specialize in real estate development and construction and are concentrated in Metropolitan Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Chinese business in Malaysia |last=Gomez |first=Edmund |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=978-0415517379 | pages = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese dominated the Filipino real estate and property sectors which for a long time been controlled by the Spanish Filipinos. Initially, ethnic Chinese were not allowed to own land until acquiring Filipino citizenship in the 1970s. Presently, many of the biggest real estate developers in the Philippines are of Chinese lineage. Large projects such as the [[Shangri-La Plaza]] in Mandaluyong and the [[Tagaytay Highlands]] Golf Club and Resort development in Tagatay City were such joint projects. These partnerships were largely forged by ethnic Chinese tycoons such as the Chinese Indonesian business magnate [[Liem Sioe Liong]], Malaysian businessman [[Robert Kuok]], and Chinese Filipino tycoons [[Andrew Gotinun]], Henry Sy, George Ty, and Lucio Tan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Southeast Asia's Chinese Businesses in an Era of Globalization: Coping with the Rise of China |last=Suryadinata  |first= Leo  |publisher= Institute of Southeast Asian Studies  |year=2014 |publication-date=January 2, 2014 |page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese Filipinos also pioneered the shipping industry in the Philippines which eventually became a major industry sector as a means of transporting goods cheaply and quickly between the islands. The Chinese are dominant in the shipping industry and in sea transport as sea transport was one of the few efficient methods of transporting goods cheaply and quickly across a country, with the Philippines being an archipelago, comprising more than 1000 islands and inlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Overseas Chinese Entrepreneurship and Capitalist Development in Southeast Asia |last=Gambe |first=Annabelle |year= 2000 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=28 |isbn=978-0312234966}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 12 Chinese Filipino families engaged in inter-island transport and shipping, particularly with the shipping of food products requiring refrigeration with a capitalization of 10 billion pesos.

As ethnic Chinese economic might grew, much of the indigenous Filipino majority were gradually driven out into poorer land on the hills, on the outskirts of major Filipino cities or into the mountains.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Disenchantment grew among the displaced indigenous Filipinos who felt they were unable compete with ethnic Chinese businesses.&lt;ref name="auto21"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Chinese business in Malaysia |last=Gomez |first=Edmund |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=978-0415517379 | pages = 105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Underlying resentment and bitterness from the impoverished Filipino majority has been accumulating as there has been no existence of indigenous Filipino having any substantial business equity in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Decades of free market liberalization brought virtually no economic benefit to the indigenous Filipino majority but rather the opposite resulting a subjugated indigenous Filipino majority underclass, where the vast majority still engage in rural peasantry, menial labor, or [[Domestic worker|domestic service and squatting]].&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; The Filipino government has dealt with this wealth disparity by establishing socialist and communist dictatorships or authoritarian regimes while pursuing a systematic and ruthless affirmative action campaigns giving privileges to the indigenous Filipino majority during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="auto21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto22"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Overseas Chinese Entrepreneurship and Capitalist Development in Southeast Asia |last=Gambe |first=Annabelle |year= 2000 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=26-27 |isbn=978-0312234966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of economic nationalism among the impoverished indigenous Filipino majority prompted by the Filipino government resulted the passing of the Retail Trade Nationalization Law of 1954, where ethnic Chinese were barred and pressured to move out of the retail sector restricting engagement to Filipino citizens only.&lt;ref name="auto22"/&gt;  In addition, the Chinese were prevented from owning land by restricting land ownership to Filipinos only. Other restrictions on Chinese economic activities included limiting Chinese involvement in the import-export trade while trying to increase the indigenous Filipino involvement to gain a proportionate presence. In 1960, the Rice and Corn Nationalization Law was passed restricting trading, milling, and warehousing of rice and corn only to Filipinos while barring Chinese involvement, in which they initially had a significant presence.

==Future trends==
Most of the younger generations of ''pure'' Chinese Filipinos are descendants of Chinese who migrated during the 1800s onward - this group retains much of Chinese culture, customs, and work ethic (though not necessarily language), whereas almost all Chinese mestizos are descendants of Chinese who migrated even before the Spanish colonial period, and have been integrated and assimilated into the general Philippine society as a whole.

There are four trends that the Chinese Filipinos would probably undertake within a generation or so:

* assimilation and integration, as in the case of [[Chinese Thai]]s who eventually lost their "Chinese-ness" and adopted Thai culture and language as their own
* separation, which translates to the propagation of the status quo and reminiscent of most [[Chinese Malaysian]]s
* returning to the ancestral land, which is the current phenomenon of overseas Chinese returning to China
* emigration to North America and Australasia, as in the case of some [[Chinese Malaysian]]s and many Chinese Vietnamese ([[Hoa people]])

During the 1970s, Fr. Charles McCarthy, an expert in Philippine-Chinese relations, observed that "the peculiarly Chinese content of the Philippine-Chinese subculture is further diluted in succeeding generations", and he made a prediction that "the time will probably come, and it may not be far off, when, in this sense, there will no more 'Chinese' in the Philippines".

; Integration and assimilation
Assimilation is defined as the adoption of the cultural norms of the dominant or host culture, while integration is defined as the adoption of the cultural norms of the dominant or host culture while maintaining their culture of origin.

As of the present day, due to the effects of globalization in the Philippines, there has been a marked tendency to assimilate to Filipino lifestyles influenced by the US, among ethnic Chinese. This is especially true for younger Chinese Filipinos living in [[Metro Manila]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0119/p07s01-woap.html|title=Christians in Manila decry mall's Muslim prayer room|first=Simon|last=Montlake|date=19 January 2005|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are gradually shifting to English as their preferred language, thus identifying more with Western culture, at the same time speaking Chinese among themselves. Similarly, as the cultural divide between Chinese Filipinos and other Filipinos erode, there is a steady increase of intermarriages with ethnic Filipinos, with their children completely identifying with the Filipino culture and way of life. [[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]] is gradually taking place in the Philippines, albeit at a slower rate as compared to Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.chass.ncsu.edu/CIES/KeyesPaper.htm Keyes, Charles. (2003) Ethnicity and the Nation-State: Asian Perspectives. ''North Carolina State University CIES Spring 2003 Symposium: Contextualizing Ethnicity''. North Carolina.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030405095201/http://www2.chass.ncsu.edu/CIES/KeyesPaper.htm |date=2003-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the largest Chinese Filipino organization, the ''Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran'' openly espouses eventual integration but not assimilation of the Chinese Filipinos with the rest of Philippine society and clamors for maintaining Chinese language education and traditions.

Meanwhile, the general Philippine public is largely neutral regarding the role of the Chinese Filipinos in the Philippines, and many have embraced Chinese Filipinos as fellow Filipino citizens and even encouraged them to assimilate and participate in the formation of the Philippines' destiny.

; Separation

Separation is defined as the rejection of the dominant or host culture in favor of preserving their culture of origin, often characterized by the presence of [[ethnic enclave]]s. In status quo, the Filipino community is better described as a "separated community" in reference to the general Philippine society at large.

The recent rapid economic growth of both China and Taiwan as well as the successful business acumen of Overseas Chinese have fueled among many Chinese Filipinos a sense of pride through immersion and regaining interest in Chinese culture, customs, values, and language while remaining in the Philippines.

Despite the community's inherent ethnocentrism - there are no active proponents for political separation, such as autonomy or even independence, from the Philippines, partly due to the small size of the community relative to the general Philippine population, and the scattered distribution of the community throughout the archipelago, with only half residing in Metro Manila.

; Returning to the ancestral land
Many Chinese-Filipino entrepreneurs and professionals have flocked to their ancestral homeland to partake of business and employment opportunities opened up by China's emergence as a global economic superpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yong |first=Wu |title=Lucio C. Tan: Truly a man for all seasons |journal=China Daily |date=May 8, 2005 |series=General Bank and Trust Company |url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/fortune2005/ft050518p14n.pdf |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As above, the fast economic growth of China and the increasing popularity of Chinese culture has also helped fan pro-China patriotism among a majority of Chinese Filipinos who espouse 愛國愛鄉 (ài guó ài xiāng) sentiments (love of ancestral country and hometown). Some Chinese Filipinos, especially those belonging to the older generation, still demonstrate ''ài guó ài xiāng'' by donating money to fund clan halls, school buildings, Buddhist temples, and parks in their hometowns in China.

; Emigration to North America and Australasia
During the 1990s to the early 2000s, Philippine economic difficulties and more liberal immigration policies in destination countries have led to well-to-do Chinese Filipino families to acquire North American or Australasian passports and send their children abroad to attend prestigious North America or Australasian Universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/be/be002894.htm Lee Flores, Wilson. (27 July 2004). The New Breed of RP Businessmen. ''Philippine Star''. Manila.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these children are opting to remain after graduation to start professional careers in North America or Australasia, like their Chinese brethren from other parts of Asia.

Many Philippine-educated Chinese Filipinos from middle-class families are also migrating to North America and Australasia for economic advantages. Those who have family businesses regularly commute between North America (or Australasia) and the Philippines. In this way, they follow the well-known pattern of other Chinese immigrants to North America who lead "astronaut" lifestyles: family in North America, business in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiapacific.ca/analysis/pubs/pdfs/can_in_asia/cia_doing_business.pdf Chen, Wenhong and Wellman, Barry. (2007 April). Doing Business at Home and Away, Policy Implications of Chinese-Canadian Entrepreneurship. ''Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.'' Vancouver, British Columbia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409133215/http://www.asiapacific.ca/analysis/pubs/pdfs/can_in_asia/cia_doing_business.pdf |date=2008-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increase in political stability and economic growth in Asia, this trend is becoming significantly less popular for Chinese Filipinos.

Sydney was founded by the British government as a penal colony. Visitors described the English character of Sydney for at least the first 50 years after 1788, noting the traditional English appearance of the churches overlooking the convict barracks. First-generation colonial Sydney residents were predominantly English. 160,000 convicts came to Australia between 1788 and 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia's founding felons get a long-delayed pardon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/world/australia-s-founding-felons-get-a-long-delayed-pardon.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=19 November 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1788 and 1840, 80,000 English convicts were transported to New South Wales, with the greatest numbers coming between 1825 and 1835. The [[New South Wales]] Census of 1846 accounted for 57,349 born in England, 47,547 born in Ireland and 14,406 born in Scotland.&lt;ref name="dictionaryofsydney"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/english |title=Dictionary of Sydney: The English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1859, 2.2 million (73%) of the free settlers who immigrated were British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestryeurope.lu/press/press-releases/uk/2008/06/historical-records-reveal-oz-ancestors-of-16-million-brits/|title=Ancestry Information Operations Unlimited Company - Press Releases|website=www.ancestryeurope.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many more English people immigrated to Victoria by the gold rush of the 1850s. By 1854 there were 97,943 England-born people in Victoria. Immigration policies and assistance schemes helped maintain high levels of immigration from England. Of the 1 million immigrants who arrived between 1860 and 1900, just over half came from England.&lt;ref name="museumvictoria"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://museumvictoria.com.au/origins/history.aspx?pid=17| title = History of immigration from England, Immigration Museum, Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When transportation ended, convicts made up 40 percent of Australia's English-speaking population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.ancestry.com/press/press-releases/2007/07/ancestry.com-launches-largest-online-collection-of-records-documenting-australias-convicted-founding-fathers/|title=Ancestry.com Launches Largest Online Collection of Records Documenting Australia's Convicted 'Founding Fathers'|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1840 and 1870 there were more Irish than English assisted migrants which did not change until the 1870s, when there were more English.&lt;ref name="dictionaryofsydney"/&gt;

At least 75 per cent of all overseas-born people in Australia during the 19th century were from the [[British Isles]]. The proportion who had been born in [[England and Wales|England or Wales]] remained quite stable (at about 47 per cent) from 1861 to 1911, as did the proportion born in
[[Scotland]] (about 12 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/4EA385D5CD149175CA2574CF00176C6D/$File/25050_1986_Multicultural_Australia.pdf CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 30 JUNE 1986 CENSUS 86 MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA] (Page: 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians born in England or of English ancestry made up more than 50 percent of the population at the time of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] (1901).&lt;ref name="jupp"/&gt; From 1922 the Empire Settlement Act assisted thousands of migrants from England. After the Second World War, even as immigration from other countries expanded dramatically, English citizens had almost unrestricted entry into Australia. Arthur Calwell, Minister for Immigration, wanted nine out of ten new immigrants to be UK-born.&lt;ref name="museumvictoria"/&gt; 
The majority of England-born migrants received assisted passages until the scheme was abolished in 1982. In 2006 the English were still the largest group of overseas-born in Victoria, with over 3% of Victorians born in England.&lt;ref name="museumvictoria"/&gt;

Among the notable English-born were politicians such as [[Henry Parkes]], and [[Joseph Cook]]; in retailing and media: [[John Norton (journalist)|John Norton]], [[Anthony Hordern]] and [[John Fairfax]].&lt;ref name="dictionaryofsydney"/&gt;

Surges of English immigration in the 1880s, between 1910 and 1914, again in the 1920s and, most of all, in the 1950s and 1960s, sustained the English-born as the largest single immigrant group.&lt;ref name="dictionaryofsydney"/&gt;
In 1978 Australians born in England or Australians of predominantly English ancestry made up over 45 per cent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;The Australian encyclopaedia, Volume 4, Grolier Society of Australia, 1983, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
English ancestry was reported by 6.6 million people (46%) in 1986, and 6.4 million (37%) in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument|title=Chapter - Population characteristics: Ancestry of Australia's population|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|last=Statistics|website=www.abs.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English continue to be well-represented among immigrants to Australia, the overall decline of English immigration to Australia since the 1980s has meant that the England-born component of the population as a whole is falling. With over 200 years of English settlement, however, Australian society continues to be influenced by its strong English heritage.&lt;ref name="History of immigration from England"/&gt;

==Cultural influence==
People of English descent were by far the single most influential ethnic group in colonial Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Mike, and David Mayall, eds. Sporting Nationalisms: Identity, Ethnicity, Immigration and Assimilation. Routledge, 2005, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of Australia by English people is still evident in place names, buildings and street layouts, and that 80 percent of the population speak English as their mother tongue and the [[Low Church]] hegemony in the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]], the biggest in the country.

In Sydney, at least 50 suburban names are derived directly from 20 [[English counties]], of which the largest numbers are from [[Kent]], [[Surrey]] and [[London]]. Among the best known are [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]], [[Croydon, New South Wales|Croydon]], [[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]], [[Chipping Norton, New South Wales|Chipping Norton]], [[Brighton-le-Sands, New South Wales|Brighton-le-Sands]], [[Bexley, New South Wales|Bexley]], [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]], [[Ryde, New South Wales|Ryde]], [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]] and [[Penshurst, New South Wales|Penshurst]].&lt;ref name="sydneyjournal"/&gt;

Many of the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Ministers of Australia]] have English ancestry. The extent of English Heritage varies, with earlier Prime Ministers being predominantly of [[English people|English]] stock. To date all Australian Prime Ministers have had whole or partial [[Anglo-Celtic Australians|Anglo-Celtic]] background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3838">The term '''Family Economy''' can be used to describe the family as an economic unit. The early stages of development in many economies are characterized by family based production.&lt;ref name=Parente&gt;Parente, S.L., Rogerson, R. &amp; Wright, R., (2000). Homework in Development Economics: Household Production and the Wealth of Nations. Journal of Political Economy, 108, 680-687.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early, pre-industrial stage, technology was limited and unchanging. Most [[economic]] activity took place within the household, and production and distribution were organized by custom and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. L. , Sawhill, I.V.(1977).The Family as an Economic Unit.
The Wilson Quarterly,1,2.Retrieved from: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40255183&lt;/ref&gt; High mortality rates and low productivity meant that on the farms and in the towns life was short and living conditions were harsh&amp;nbsp;– an existence which was accepted fatalistically. In this society the family played a central role, since economic and social status was defined by birth, family ties, and local custom. Most importantly, the family was a productive unit, and physical strength&amp;nbsp;– typically a male attribute&amp;nbsp;– was an essential element in survival.&lt;ref name="Parente"/&gt;

The [[family]] economic unit has always been dependent on specialized labor done by family members. The family was a multi-generational producer with capital and land provided by older generations and labor provided by younger generations. Goods were produced not only for home [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] but to sell and trade in the market as well. Family production was not only  limited to agricultural products but they also produced manufacturing goods and provided services.&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, C.(1991). The Market Revolution: Jacksonian America, 1815-1846 Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to sustain a viable family economy during the pre-industrial era  labor was needed. The labor needed to operate the farm and provide old-age support came from family members, fertility was high. High fertility and guaranteed employment on the family farm made education, beyond the basic literacy needed to read the bible, expensive and unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, S.B., Ransom, R.L., &amp; Sutch, R.(2003). Family Matters: The Life-Cycle Transition and the Unparalleled Fertility Decline in Antebellum America. In Craig, L.(Ed.), To Sow One Acre More(pp. 107-113)Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore&lt;/ref&gt;

During the post industrial stage the family as an economic unit changed.The family transformed from being a unit of production to being a unit of consumption. This new era of [[industrialization]] brought changes where farming can be done with less persons, therefore children were no longer to be viewed as economic assets but rather as liabilities. Industrialization further contributed to the demise of the family economy where the capitalist market encouraged production in large scale factories, farms and mines. Wage labor became common and family members no longer worked together but rather used the wages they had earned to buy goods which they consumed as a family unit.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, S. (2001). Living Arrangements and the Well-being of Older Persons in the Past, Population Bulletin of the United Nations, 42/43, 111-161&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial revolution, starting in the nineteenth and going into the twentieth century, is seen as the force that changed the economic family and is basically responsible for the "modern family."

'''''Flowers in a glass vase on a partly draped stone ledge''''' is a circa 1667 floral painting by [[Nicolaes van Verendael]] in the collection of the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url={{#if: {{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P350}} | https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/{{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P350}} | {{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P973}} }}|title={{wikidata|label|Q29882478}}|publisher={{wikidata|property|linked|Q29882478|P195}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
[[File:Nicolaes van Verendael - Garland surrounding the Virgin Mary.jpg|thumb|Garland painting in the Prado]]
Nicolaes van Verendael was a respected flower painter in Antwerp who worked with [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], among others. The early provenance of this painting is unknown but it can be dated based on other works by Van Verendael, such as his garland painting in the [[Prado]] which was long attributed to [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], who began floral painting in Antwerp a half-century beforehand.
==Description and interpretation==
This painting dates to the period in Antwerp when hothouses became popular among the nobility and patrons ordered paintings to record their personal hothouse triumphs. Not all of the blooms would have bloomed at the same time, and the painting was meant more for decoration than for botanical accuracy. The work shows the following flower species: [[Rosa × alba|Rosa alba]], [[Tropaeolum majus]], [[Anemone hepatica|Hepatica nobilis]], [[rosemary]], [[Tulip|Tulipa]], [[Delphinium]], [[Aquilegia]], [[Pomegranate|Punica granatum]], [[Rosa × centifolia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/images/198239 Painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history and influence==
This painting was stored for safe-keeping during WWII in the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]], from whence it was found and taken by marauding Soviet troops in 1945. Somehow it ended up in the possession of a German citizen who later migrated to Canada and it appeared on the art market in the 1970s, whereupon it was returned to the museum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.codart.nl/museums/after-70-years-in-exile-nicolaes-van-verendael-s-flower-still-life-returns-to-the-suermondt-ludwig-museum-in-aachen/ After 70 years in exile Nicolaes van Verendael’s Flower Still Life returns to the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen], article 4 March 2015 on codart&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26686">'''Gender typing''' is the process by which a child becomes aware of their [[gender]] and thus behaves accordingly by adopting values and attributes of members of the sex that they identify as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, D. R. (2009). Social and personality development (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt; This process is extremely important for a child's social and personality development because it largely impacts the child's understanding of expected social behaviour and influences social judgments.

==Gender identity==
Given the definition, once the child is aware of their gender they will start to behave in [[gender roles]] that their same-sex models would normally adopt. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards.&lt;ref&gt;Pentony, C.G. (1980). Gender, sex typing, and gender identity. 941–942.&lt;/ref&gt; The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or [[androgyny]], their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for who they are and how they should behave.

==Theories==

===Freud’s [[psychoanalytic theory]]===
[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that as a child progresses through each of the different stages in [[psychosexual development]], during the third year of the child's life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a [[castration complex]] (in boys) or [[penis envy]] (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the [[Oedipus complex]] occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother ([[Electra complex]] in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able to let go of the rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.&lt;ref name="Mullahy"&gt;Mullahy. P. (1948). ''Oedipus myth and complex: A Review of Psychoanalytic Theory''. New York, NY: Grove Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The girl's development, Freud argued, is more complicated. Generally, as with males, the first object of interest is also the mother figure and for the first four years and beyond a girl remains attached to her mother. However, when the female child learns about “[[castration]]” it sparks disappointment and she blames her mother for her lack of a penis. Because of this, the girl gives up masturbation and in turn shifts focus from her mother to her father. By abandoning [[masturbation]] the girl can no longer be active, thus displaying a passive nature. The father then assists her by smoothly transitioning her towards a more feminine path. Furthermore, the girl's affection towards her father will also influence her to emulate her mother's feminine qualities and eventually adopt more gender-typed behaviours.&lt;ref name="Mullahy"/&gt;

===Kohlberg’s cognitive-developmental theory===
The cognitive-developmental theory is also closely linked to [[Jean Piaget]]’s analysis for the age-related cognitive changes a child goes through. [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] suggested that cognition comes before action and behavior (“I am a boy so I do boy-like things”). This emphasizes the importance of a child's understanding about [[gender roles]] and their permanent placement in it. After a child can fully grasp this concept, gender-specific information will become more relevant. This idea of gender consistency, similar to Piaget's concrete-operational stage, is represented by three stages:
# gender identity: the child recognizes that they are either a boy or a girl and possesses the ability to label others.
# gender stability: the identity in which they recognizes themselves as does not change
# gender consistency: the acceptance that gender does not change regardless of changes in gender-typed appearance, activities, and traits.

When the child is able to fully grasp gender stable understanding about themselves, usually between the ages of five and seven, the motivation to master their orientation and to socialize themselves allows them to seek out same-sexed models to learn more about gender-stereotypic behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. L., Ruble, D. N., &amp; Szkrykablo, J. (2002). Cognitive theories of early gender development. American psychological association. 4(23), 544–557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bussey, K. (2011). Gender identity development. ''Handbook of Identity Theory and Research.'' 603-628.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender schema theory===
A [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is a cognitively organized network of associations that is readily available to help guide an individual's perception. Gender schema acts as a guide or standard for consistent behavior in a given scenario. Labels such as “girls are weak and boys are strong,” classifies what stereotypically acceptable actions for the gender groups are. Therefore, the theory proposes the idea that once the child has developed basic knowledge on gender behaviors they will begin to construct gender schemas. This is acquired first through the basic understanding of gender-specific roles. In order words, the child learns the contents of the society, things that are related to their own and the opposite sex, and incorporates it into their gender schemas. The child then learns to apply the appropriate attributes respectively to the right gender by selectively using this knowledge to conceptualize their own actions. Hence, categorizing how they should perform in various situations by molding their capabilities to match the schematic labels.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (1981) Gender schema theory: a cognitive account of sex typing. ''Psychological Review.''88(4), 354–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social-learning theory ([[Albert Bandura]])===
Social learning theorists, like Albert Bandura, suggest that adults not only provide models for children to imitate, but that they also are actively involved in influencing a child's gender-role identification. The [[Social learning theory]] proposes that gender-identities and gender-role preferences are acquired through two concepts.

# Direct tuition (differential reinforcement): The first concept is represented through direct tuition, also known as differential reinforcement. Early in a child's development, parents are already encouraging gender-appropriate activities and discouraging cross-gender activities. Adults reward children when they display gender-appropriate behavior and punish children when they display cross-gender behavior. The idea of direct tuition expresses that gender-typed behavior begins with the child adopting views they learn from their parents. Therefore, parents reinforce the developmental of gender stereotypes by providing gender-appropriate toys and activities. Adults influence a child's gender identification when they encourage gender-typed behaviors like teaching “boys how to be boys and girls how to be girls”.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. R. 2009"&gt;Shaffer, D. R. (2009). ''Social and Personality Development (6th ed.)''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Observational learning]]: The second concept is represented through observational learning in where children imitate and follow the behaviors of individuals who are of the same sex. Children become increasingly aware of gender stereotypes in preschool and acknowledge these “same-sex models” when they begin to exercise their preferences for “gender-typed” toys or activities. These same-sex models may include any individual from teachers and older siblings to media personalities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. R. 2009"/&gt;

==Social models==
There are many opportunities for a child to learn and develop their own understanding of what “[[gender]]” is. Thus as children progresses from childhood into [[adolescence]] they will already have been exposed to many factors that will influence their ideas and attitudes for normative social behaviors regarding gender roles. Social models, such as parents, siblings, and the media become extremely important during different stages of the child's development.

'''Parents:'''
Parents play a vital part in a child's early life, for they are the first group of people that a child meets and learns from. The information that surrounds a child at home becomes reinforcements for desired behaviors of a male or female. Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a child is born most parents have already engaged in gender [[Stereotype|stereotypic]] expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these parent-child interactions have long lasting influence on how a child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, S. D. (1997). Parental influence on children’s socialization to gender roles. ''Adolescence.'' 32(126). 253-259.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, various evidence suggest that certain household differences affecting how a child is raised can influence how similar (or different) a child is to the opposite sex, therefore how “feminine” or “masculine” the child can potentially become. For instance, as certain research demonstrates, in the absence of a father figure boys are generally more “feminine” than those living with a father. This demonstrates the significance of father-son modeling. The same research reveals that boyhood femininity is more strongly correlated with parental reinforcement such as a father or mother's desire for a girl and/or their approval for feminine behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, C. W., Green, R. &amp; Williams, K., Goodman, M. (1987). Boyhood gender identity development: a statistical contrast of two family groups. ''Developmental Psychlology.'' 23(4), 544-557.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siblings:'''
Apart from parents, children also seek reinforcement from their older siblings. Therefore, inconsistencies for gender behaviors can also be as a result of children emulating their siblings of opposite sex.
Sibling's influence is often most effective when the sibling is of an age that is more advanced than the child himself, therefore increasing the motivation for the child to model after their brother or sister. The impact of older siblings are power predictors for the younger sibling's gender role attitudes, sex-typed personality qualities, and masculine leisure activities. Findings suggest that girls develop less traditional attitudes than boys, thus, relative to stereotypically traditional development, older male siblings are more conscientious towards masculine activities, which are evidently modeled after by younger siblings more than feminine activities.&lt;ref name="McHale, S. M. 2001"&gt;McHale, S. M., Updegraff, K. A., Helms-Erikson, H. (2001). Sibling influences on gender development in middle childhood and early adolescence: a longitudinal study. ''Developmental Psychology.'' 37(1). 115-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, older brothers tend to have stronger influence over a younger sibling's sexual development. There is evidence that the relationship between older brother and younger sister can, in fact, influence the sister to become more feminine, abiding to more stereotypical gender-typed development than girls with older sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Kornreich, J. L., Hearn, K. D., Rodrigues, G. &amp; O’Sullivan, L. F. (2003). Sibling influence, gender roles, and the sexual socialization of urban early adolescent girls. ''The Journal of Sex Research.'' 40(1). 101-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Biological studies show that dizygotic twins with the opposite- sex co-twin gender show more sex-typed behaviors than same-sex twins.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta, C. M., Strough, J. (2010). Gender segregation and gender-typing in adolescence. ''Sex Role.''&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, this can also develop in an opposite direction in which children may try to diverge themselves from their siblings as much as possible, making their differences more salient; however, this may be more evident in first-borns possibly due to the birth order.&lt;ref name="McHale, S. M. 2001"/&gt;

'''Peers:'''
At a young age, children can already utilize their knowledge of different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people's behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An example of this is the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Van Beijsterveldt, C. E. M., Hudziak, J. J., Boomsama, D. I. (2006). Genetic and environmental influences on cross-gender behavior to problems: a study of dutch twins at ages 7 and 10 years. ''Arch Sex. Behav.'' 648-658.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. L. (1989). Children’s use of gender-related information in making social judgment. ''Developmental Psychology.'' 25(1), 80-88.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.

'''Media:'''
Children learn about different gender categories by observing various forms of [[media (communication)|media]]. They often look for gender roles, with whom they can relate to, from books and television. Conversely, these sources of media will also stereotypically shape a child's understanding for gender acceptable behaviors. Studies examining the effects of gender stereotyping in children's literature describe that, most often than not, gender views are affiliated with stereotypes which are both culturally and individually constructed. In children's literature, male characters appear to be more central as well as less emotional and stronger. Female characters on the other hand worked out their feelings through expression, they are more dependent and usually adopt the roles of more domesticated characters.&lt;ref&gt;Turner-Bowker, D. M. (1996). Gender stereotyped descriptors in children’s picture books: does “curious Jane” exist in the literature? ''Sex Roles.'' 35(7/8), 461-488.&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, these characteristics are also seen in [[television]] programing. For example, in most prime-time television shows women receive twice as many comments about her appearance than men. Similarly, a study investigating the cartoon “[[Pokémon]]” and gender role expresses the differences in “good” and “bad” characters. Jesse and James (villains of the story) are portrayed to have adopted counter-stereotypical portrayal. While Jesse is seen as more aggressive and James as more feminine, it subtly teaches children that nontraditional or nonstereotypical gender role behaviors are bad. Furthermore, children in the story have difficultly recalling a male Pokémon revealing that there is an imbalance in which prominence is given to male characters.&lt;ref&gt;Ogletree, S. M., Martinez, C. N., Turner, T. R., Mason, B. (2004). Pokémon: exploring the role of gender. ''Sex Roles.'' 50(11/12), 851-859.&lt;/ref&gt;
These depictions of male and female character roles can potentially become unconsciously influential in the way a child constructs gender views.

==Atypical gender development and controversies==
It is expected for children to develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related information to make judgments. Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment. Therefore, when children undergo atypical gender development, due to both genetic and environmental contributors, it can drastically alter normal development from a person's sense of self-worth, self-esteem, to feelings of acceptance. When the child identifies as the opposite sex, he or she is then diagnosed with [[gender dysphoria]] (often termed ''gender identity disorder'' or GID).&lt;ref&gt;nafo, A., Iervolino, A. C., Plomin, R. (2005). Masculine girls and feminine boys: genetic and environmental contributions to atypical gender development in early childhood. ''Journal of Personality and Psychology.'' 88(2), 400-412.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetics vs. environmental contributors:'''
The development of gender roles has been associated with both [[genetics|genetic]] and [[social]] factors.
Current biological research has suggested that [[testosterone]] differences can affect sexual orientation, gender identity, and personality. For example, girls with increased prenatal testosterone levels, due to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), show more male-typed behaviors than the average female. This may cause a decrease in [[empathy]] levels, which is proven to be higher in the average women than men, and an increase in physical aggression, typically higher in men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, M. (2011). Gender development and the human brain. ''Annual Review of Neuroscience''.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, multiple twin studies have also shown that [[homosexual]] traits displayed greater congruence in [[Monozygotic twins|monozygotic (MZ) twins]] than [[Dizygotic twins|dizygotic (DZ) twins]] displaying genetic contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Knafo, A., Iervolino, A. C., Plomin, R. (2005). Masculine girls and feminine boys: genetic and environmental contributions to atypical gender development in early childhood. ''Journal of Personality and Psychology.'' 88(2), 400-412.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies reveal that this is especially true for girls' gender-typed values.&lt;ref name="Knafo, A. 2011"&gt;Knafo, A., Spinath, F. M. (2011). Genetic and environmental influences on girl’s and boy’s gender-typed and gender-neutral values. ''Developmental Psychology''. 47(3), 726-731.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other studies have summarized that the prevalence of cross-gender behavior a highly heritable trait where MZ twins display the same cross-gender behaviors more so than DZ twins.&lt;ref name="Moller, B. 2009"&gt;Moller, B., Schreier, H., Li, A., Romer, G. (2009). Gender identity disorder in children and adolescents. ''Curr probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care''. 117–143.&lt;/ref&gt;
While atypical gender role development may be heritable, this does not mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is more accepting of male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet),{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} society's negativity typically forces males to try to stay within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys than girls in terms of atypical development.&lt;ref name="Knafo, A. 2011"/&gt;

'''Gender dysphoria:'''
[[Gender dysphoria]] or gender identity disorder (GID) occurs when the child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as [[transsexualism]], occurs when a person has a strong desire to be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid of their physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.&lt;ref name="Moller, B. 2009"/&gt;

'''Controversies about gender in [[DSM-5]]:'''
For the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]), there has been a tremendous amount{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} of debate around whether the sexual and gender identity, which includes the GID, qualifies as a [[mental disorder]]. One of the most notable discussions for this occurred in 2003 during the annual APA meeting, where Darryl B. Hill, Ph.D., argued that the GID should not be considered a mental disorder. He explains that due to the limited amount of reliable and valid evidence, given the role of parents and therapies, for whether GID meets the conditions as a mental disorder among children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Kamens, S.R. (2011). On the proposed sexual and gender identity diagnoses for DSM-5: history and controversies. ''The Humanistic Psychologist.'' 37–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, other researchers have stated that the diagnosis does not give recognition to the individual's discomfort with their biological sex which is completely detached from their gender assignment. This leaves patients susceptible to social changes for what acceptably feminine or masculine. Lastly, it does not provide evidence for nonconformity to traditional gender behaviours which varies between cultures, life stages, genders, and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, K., Carroll, K., Denboske, K. Gender identity disorder – concerns and controversies. (2010). ''Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology''. 111-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Androgyny]]:'''
Recent studies have shown that androgynous people are able to enhance performance cross-situationally because they can alter their behaviors appropriately to becoming more “masculine” or “feminine” in the given context. According to a study, a person's activity preference in games and interests are purely based on their gender-typed stereotypes, making the person significantly more stereotyped than androgynous people. In a self-esteem test, when individuals were given opposite-sex activities, gender-typed individuals generally felt more uncomfortable, leading to decreased levels of self-esteem. However, androgynous subjects did not feel discomfort or pessimism about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L., Lenney, E. (1976). Sex typing and the avoidance of cross-sex behavior. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.'' 33(1), 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, gender typing can often lead to specific gender-rule stereotypes to better facilitate decision making which can adhere to certain benefits as well as limitations. Therefore, parents who foster more non-traditional views in sex role orientation tend to encourage a less discriminatory environment. The child can then freely engage in more choices that are not affected by gender limitations. Androgynous children have been found to have higher [[self-esteem]] and higher [[self-worth]].&lt;ref&gt;Witt, S. D. (1997). Parental influence on children’s socialization to gender roles. ''Adolescence.'' 253-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drawbacks'''
Recent{{When|date=April 2013}} studies have shown that gender typing is, in fact, not just related to gender-related characteristics that is congruous with the person's biological sex, but rather holds different dimensions. Several studies have also revealed the perks of androgynous individuals such as having more adaptability towards gender-specific situations as well as more flexible attitudes about sex roles. Therefore, while there appear to be many benefits for a gender-congruent identity, it can also result in limitations. Because gender typing often reinforces stereotypes, it tends to attract negative and rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics, activities, and interests.&lt;ref&gt;DiDonato, M.D., Berenbaum, S.A. (2011). The benefits and drawbacks of gender typing: How different dimensions are related to psychological adjustment. ''Arch Sex Behavior.'' 40. 457-463&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the idea that gender-typing does result in certain limitations towards the construction of one's identity.

==Examples of atypical development==
'''Boy Raised as Girl'''
After a circumcision accident, Bruce's parents turned to Psychologist Dr. [[John Money]] who suggested they raise the boy as a girl. Money believes that [[biology]] does not determine our gender identification; our environment does. At 17 months old, Bruce was renamed "Brenda". However, at age 13, "Brenda" became unhappy, lonely, and refused to pursue anything female-typed. Brenda's parents chose to tell Brenda the truth, and from then on he named himself David. This story ended in tragedy; [[David Reimer|David]] committed suicide after his wife left him and he lost his job.&lt;ref&gt;Health Check: the boy who was raised as a girl. (2010). https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11814300&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kate:'''
Ben had never shown interest in “boy” toys, they wanted to wear girl's clothing and grow long hair. Soon they started to make their gender clear: they talked about being a girl and their identity not matching anatomy. Finally, Ben told family they would go by Kate. In the beginning, the child lived a double life. In school, she was “Ben”; at home, she was Kate. Characteristics between the two identities drastically varied. Ben was quiet, shy and withdrawn, while Kate was extroverted and happy. Her parents could see that this was taking a toll on Kate and so they changed to a school where Kate could attend as herself. As the parent learned through this experience, supporting a child's gender identity is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, C. Parent power: raising Kate: one mom’s fight for her child’s identity. http://www.greatschools.org/parenting/5085-raising-transgender-child.gs&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pop:'''
In [[Sweden]], there is a couple who raised their child, Pop, by keeping the child's gender a secret, despite a few people who changed the baby's diaper. The parents stated that they wanted the baby to grow up free and without a gender mold. Pop's wardrobe contains everything from pants to dresses. Pop's parents avoid using pronouns and just refer to their child as “Pop.”&lt;ref&gt;Parafianowicz, L. Swedish parents keep 2-year-old’s gender secret. (2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12380">The '''Icelandic census of 1703''' was the first [[census]] ({{lang-is|manntal}}) of [[Iceland]] and the first complete census of any country.

==Procedure of the census==
The census recorded the name, age, residence, and social standing of every inhabitant; it was the first such complete census.&lt;ref name=Gunnar162&gt;Gunnar Karlsson, ''The History of Iceland'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8166-3588-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLk_Ox4pPTAC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Icelandic+census+1703&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jAYuTbCWFYnnrAeB3_iDCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nowhere%20in%20the%20world%20has%20a%20register%20of%20a%20whole%20people%20down%20to%20the%20last%20man%20been%20preserved%20that%20is%20older&amp;f=false p. 162].&lt;/ref&gt; Those without fixed address were recorded under the place where they spent the night before Easter.&lt;ref name=Tomasson72&gt;Richard F. Tomasson, ''Iceland, the First New Society'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1980, {{ISBN|0-8166-0913-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sng_nK6ji6sC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Icelandic+census+1703&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7_UtTa7lCsmqrAefncjfCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=497%20persons&amp;f=false p. 72].&lt;/ref&gt;

The census was assembled and organized by two Icelanders, [[Árni Magnússon]], who had just been appointed a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]], and [[Páll Vídalín]], sheriff and vice-lawman. They were commissioned in 1702 by King [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] to perform a complete survey of Iceland, then a Danish possession, in order to inventory its economic resources and propose improvements; this included the census as well as the ''[[Jarðabók]]'' or land register.&lt;ref name=Gunnar161&gt;Gunnar Karlsson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLk_Ox4pPTAC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Icelandic+census+1703&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jAYuTbCWFYnnrAeB3_iDCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20commissioners%20were%20two%20Icelandic%20theologians&amp;f=false p. 161].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sng_nK6ji6sC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Icelandic+census+1703&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7_UtTa7lCsmqrAefncjfCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=who%20in%201702%20commissioned%20two%20leading%20Icelanders&amp;f=false p. 71].&lt;/ref&gt; The royal commission, dated 22 May 1702, listed the census in its Paragraph 8 and also required a count of [[livestock]].&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;[http://www.archives.is/index.php?node=125 Um manntalið 1703], [[Icelandic National Archives]] {{is icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1702, Árni and Páll wrote to the sheriffs of all the districts in Iceland with specifics of how the census survey was to be conducted. The instructions are more detailed than in the royal commission, showing that they had developed the idea.  Árni's draft of this letter made in the spring states the census task as:&lt;blockquote&gt;to assemble a true accounting of all families in that country, from the best to the lowest person, in which shall be specified and explained the husband's and the wife's name, their children, and friends' names who&lt;!--Yes, the Danish elides a verb--&gt; at their home, also all servantmen, servant youths servantwomen and girls, ''in summa'' no one omitted great and small, young and old, who are to be found in the whole country, wherewith the large number of poor at each location must be precisely observed and described.&lt;ref&gt;Danish original: ''paa at samle et rigtig mandtall ofver alle familierne der i landet, fra beste til ringeste mand, hvorudi de skulle specificere og forklare hosbondens og hustruens nafn, deres börn, og frenders nafn som hos dem, item alle tieneste karle, tieneste drenge tieneste quinder og piger, in summa ingen undtagen store og smaa, unge og gamle, som i det helle land findes, hvorved dend store mengde af fattige ved hver sted nöie skal observeris og beskifves''. - cited in Um manntalið 1703, Icelandic National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The district sheriffs delegated the task to the overseers of each poor-law district or commune (''hreppr''), of whom there were 3&amp;ndash;5 in each of the 163 communes, and they therefore performed the count.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Karlsson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLk_Ox4pPTAC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Icelandic+census+1703&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jAYuTbCWFYnnrAeB3_iDCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=and%20the%20sheriffs%20in%20turn%20instructed%20their%20communal%20overseers&amp;f=false pp. 161-62].&lt;/ref&gt; This diverged from the instructions of the king, who had stated that the parish priests were to perform the census, but Árni and Páll presumably thought it would be more efficient to use the secular administration and to present the task to the magistrates in the [[Althing]], and the magistrates then decided to pass it to the communes, the next level of government.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

The count was made between December 1702 and June 1703, in most places in March and April. Icelanders were aware of the uniqueness of the census, and referred to the winter of 1702/03 as "census winter".&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt; The census record for each district has been preserved, although in some cases the original document has been lost.

The census report was presented in the Althing in June 1703 and then sent by Árni and Páll to [[Copenhagen]], where it was largely ignored until 1777, when the king's representative, [[Skúli Magnússon]], decided to use it to derive a land survey. The documents were loaned to Iceland in 1921 to be prepared for publication, and in 1927 under the terms of an agreement between Iceland and Denmark became the property of Iceland. They are preserved at the [[Icelandic National Archives]]. The livestock survey is also preserved, but is incomplete, although Skúli Magnússon's description of Iceland includes figures for each district.&lt;ref name=Gunnar162/&gt; The livestock register has not been published.

In 2003, [[Statistics Iceland]] and the National Archives organised a conference to mark the 300th anniversary of the 1703 census.

==Iceland's population in 1703==
In association with the publication of the census, Statistics Iceland derived the following information about the population of Iceland at that time:
* Total population: 50,358
:* Males: 22,867
:* Females: 27,491&lt;ref name=Tomasson72/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Iceland gives different figures on [http://manntal.is/Tolfraedi/ its summary statistics page]: Total population 50,958; Males 23,126; Females 27,831.&lt;/ref&gt;
* South [[Farthings of Iceland|farthing]]: 15,564
* Westfjord farthing: 17,831
* North farthing: 11,777
* Eastfjord farthing: 5,186&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

The census is almost completely accurate; only 497 people are registered twice,&lt;ref name=Tomasson72/&gt; and no commune is missing,&lt;ref name=Gunnar162/&gt; although later studies have shown some small omissions, for example the island of [[Viðey]] in Kollafjörður Bay, which definitely had residents at the time. It is also suspected that some young children were omitted, although it is conceivable that the lack of children under 8 is due to difficult years preceding the taking of the census; the overall age distribution of the census is very uneven.&lt;ref name=Tomasson73&gt;Tomasson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sng_nK6ji6sC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Icelandic+census+1703&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7_UtTa7lCsmqrAefncjfCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Another%20inadequacy%20of%20the%201703%20census%20is%20that%20some%20of%20the%20separated%20and%20widowed&amp;f=false p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt; The large difference between the numbers of males and females is notable. Research shows that men fared worse in [[famine]]s,&lt;ref name=Tomasson74&gt;Tomasson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sng_nK6ji6sC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Icelandic+census+1703&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7_UtTa7lCsmqrAefncjfCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=mortality%20fell%20much%20more%20heavily%20on%20males%20than%20females%20at%20all%20ages&amp;f=false p. 74].&lt;/ref&gt; partly because they carried a heavier burden of physical work.

[[File:Jean dunand, piatto in nichel argentato con decoro a piume di pavone, francia 1914.JPG|thumb|Jean Dunand, ''Peacock tray'', 1914, Musée d'Orsay, Paris]]
'''Jean Dunand''' (1877–1942) was a French lacquer, sculptor, dinandier (copper manufacturer) and interior designer. He is considered the greatest lacquer artist of the Art Deco period.&lt;ref&gt;Félix Marcilhac, ''Jean Dunand: His Life and Work'', Thames and Hudson, London, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born on the twentieth of May in 1877, in [[Lancy]], Switzerland, as Jules-John Dunand, he later adopted the Frenchified first name of Jean (he is naturalized French in 1922).  At the age of fourteen, he began studying sculpture at the Geneva School of Industrial Arts, where he won several prizes.  After five years study, he was awarded his diploma. In 1897, he moved to Paris to continue his studies at the National School of Decorative Arts. 1905, was elected to the Société Nationale des Beaux Arts after completing an interior for the Comtess de Bearn. Dunand along with Angst, Fraysee and Collet worked under the direction of [[Jean Dampt]]. Few years later, he began working with Seizo Sugawara, a Japanese laquerist who had recently emigrated to France, to learn the seemingly lost technique of lacquer.

The decorations, of infinite variety, are sometimes geometric, cubist, but full of originality and invention, sometimes naturalists. He himself drew in large numbers. Other supplied to him by friends painters such as Jean Lambert-Rucki and Gustave Miklos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4486">The '''Kanembu''' are an [[ethnic group]] of [[Chad]], generally considered the modern descendants of the [[Kanem-Borno Empire]].&lt;ref name=USCountryStudies&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/chad/6.htm US Country Studies: Chad]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kanembu number an estimated 655,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=CD Joshua Project website]&lt;/ref&gt; located primarily in Chad's [[Lac Prefecture]] but also in [[Chari-Baguirmi Prefecture|Chari-Baguirmi]] and [[Kanem Prefecture|Kanem]] prefectures.&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kbl Ethnologue entry on Kanembu]&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Kanembu language]], from which is derived the Kanuri language, with many speaking [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as a second language.

==History==
[[File:Travels and discoveries in North and Central Africa. From the journal of an expedition undertaken under the auspices of H.B.M.'s government, in the years 1849-1855 (1859) (14780757662).jpg|thumb|Kanembu chief, ca. 1851]]
For over a thousand years the Kanem-Bornu Empire exerted its influence over central North Africa. Its influence covered eastern Nigeria and Niger, the northern half of Chad and Cameroon, and Libya. It traded with Egypt and sponsored Islamic schools as far as Alexandria.  It's camel caravans reached the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Until the beginning of the 1900s and the French conquest of this area, the Kanem-Bornu Empire was the major power in the heart of north central Africa.

At the end of the twelfth century, the Kanembu moved into what is today [[Kanem Prefecture]].  They gradually became sedentary and established a capital at [[Njimi]]; at the same time, they continued to expand militarily establishing the [[Kanem Empire]]. The peak of this early kingdom came with the rule of Mai (King) [[Dunama Dabbalemi]] of the [[Sayfawa dynasty]], who reigned from 1221 to 1259.  He was the first of the Kanembu to convert to Islam and he declared [[jihad]] against the surrounding tribes and initiated an extended period of conquest.  After consolidating their territory around Lake Chad they struck north at the [[Fezzan]] and west at the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] lands.    

By the end of the fourteenth century, however, internal division had severely weakened the Kanem empire, forcing the Sayfawa dynasty to relocate to [[Borno State|Borno]] on the western shore of [[Lake Chad]].  The intermarriage of the Kanem with the local people of this area created a new ethnic group, the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]]; the Kanembu retain close family ties with the Kanuri to this day.&lt;ref name=USCountryStudies /&gt;

Today the Kanembu people are one group of the descendants of this once great empire, and their sultans and traditional rulers are still more influential than government authorities. Along with the related language group Kanuri, they make up the majority population found in a band between the northern shores of Lake Chad and the Sahara Desert. Living in mud brick houses, their culture, and clothing much the same as in ancient times.

==Economy==
The Kanembu are Chad's merchant tribe. 75 to 80% of all merchants in Chad are Kanembu, making them, in a relative way, one of Chad's wealthiest groups.  They are a sedentary group who also engage in agriculture and raising livestock. Wheat, millet and corn are raised near the lake, but with the country being landlocked and having a poor road system, little agricultural trade has developed. Living on the edge of the Sahara, famine is also a frequent threat with rain only coming during July, August and part of September.

==Religion==
For most of its history the Kanem-Bornu Empire has been Muslim, adhering to the laws of Islam. Today, this has mixed with traditional African beliefs and has become a ritual conformity to Islamic worship, but depending on spiritism to meet daily problems. Men, women, and especially infants can be seen wearing small leather pouches or amulets containing special verses of the Koran or cowry shells to ward off evil. Marabous, spiritual teachers, are often sought for their healing power or for their ability to communicate with the spirits.

== Etymology ==
The word "Karaiyar" is derived from the [[Tamil language]] words ''karai'' ("coast" or "shore") and ''yar'' ("people").&lt;ref name="SS_ethno"/&gt; The term ''Kareoi'' mentioned by 2nd century AD writer [[Ptolemy]], is identified with the Tamil word "Karaiyar".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vhIAAAAIAAJ|title=The History of the Pearl Fishery of the Tamil Coast|last=Arunachalam|first=S.|date=1952|publisher=Ananamalai University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese and Dutch sources mentions them under the term ''Careas'' or ''Careaz'', a corrupted form of "Karaiyar".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

They were historically also known as ''Kurukulam'', meaning clan of the ''Kuru'', following their origin from [[Coromandel Coast|Kurumandalam]] (meaning "realm of Kuru's") of [[Southern India]].&lt;ref name="SS_ethno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb4LAAAAIAAJ|title=Tamil culture in Ceylon: a general introduction|last=Raghavan|first=M.

=== Ancient era ===
The Karaiyar, are among the old coastal communities who inhabited the ''Neithal'' [[Sangam landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vp_la9QMGIQC|title=The New Wind: Changing Identities in South Asia|last=David|first=Kenneth|date=1977-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110807752|location=|pages=203|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sangam literature|ancient Tamil literature]] mentions several coastal populations, but does not contain any direct references to the Karaiyars. 

Migration of Karaiyars from [[South India]] to [[Sri Lanka]] started from around second century BCE.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The earliest reference to them could be the 1st century BCE [[Abhayagiri vihāra|Tamil Householders Terrace]], [[Pali]] inscription in [[Anuradhapura]] referring to several Tamil chiefs including one named "''Dameda navika Karava''", translated as "''Tamil Karayar sailor''".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb4LAAAAIAAJ|title=Tamil culture in Ceylon: a general introduction|last=Raghavan|first=M.

[[Ptolemy]] mentions [[Korkai]], the capital [[port]] of the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan kings]], as the chief seat of the Karaiyars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SFmAAAAMAAJ|title=Marine Archaeology of Indian Ocean Countries: Proceedings of the First Indian Conference on Marine Archaeology of Indian Ocean Countries, Oct. 1987|last=Rao|first=S.

According to another account given in the ''[[Mukkara Hatana]]'' manuscript, a battalion of 7740 Karaiyar soldiers came from [[Coromandel Coast|Kurumandalam]] in Southern India, and defeated the [[Mukkuvar]]s (another coastal community) and [[Sri Lankan Moors|Sonakars]] (Tamil Muslims).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXdAAAAAIAAJ|title=A Short History of Hinduism in Ceylon: And Three Essays on the Tamils|last=Navaratnam|first=C.

== History ==
Buddhism and Hinduism religions had been prevalent in Kashmir at various points of time. Islam started making inroads in the 12th and 13th centuries. The earliest copy of Quran in Kashmir dates back to 1237 AD and was calligraphed by Fateh Ullah Kashmiri who is believed to be a then Kashmiri Islamic scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/archives/archives2012/kashmir20120721a.html|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Muslim missionary in Kashmir was Syed Sharaf-ud-Din Abdur Rahman Suhrawardi popularly known as Bulbul Shah to common masses. He was an extensively travelled preacher and came to Kashmir during the reign of Raja Suhadeva (1301–20). Impressed by Bulbul Shah's simplicity and noble character, [[Rinchan]] the ruler of Kashmir accepted Islam and came to be known as Sultan Saddrudin Shah. He was the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir.

Following Rinchan's conversion his brother-in-law who was the army commander in chief also became Muslim. In 1339 Kashmir throne was captured by Sultan Shahmir who founded Shahmiri dynasty in Kashmir. Subsequently, according to some traditions ten thousand Kashmiris adopted Islam and hence the seeds of Islam in Kashmir were sown. The spread of Islam among Kashmiris was further boosted by arrival of a host of other [[Sayyid]]s, most prominent among them being Sayyid Jalal-ud-Din, Sayyid Taj-ud-Din and Sayyid Hussain Simanani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.com/articles/printarticles.asp?ref=IC1202-5019&amp;p=2|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the greatest missionary whose personality wielded the most extraordinary influence in the spread of Islam in Kashmir was [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani]] of Hamadan (Persia) popularly known as Shah-i-Hamadan. He belonged to the Kubrawi order of Sufis and came to Kashmir along with seven hundred disciples and helpers. His emphasis was on the Islamization of royal family and the court as a pre-requisite for Islamizing people. This was an important modus operandi adopted by Syed Ali and his disciples. He was of the firm belief that the common masses followed the conduct and culture of their rulers. His disciples established shrines with lodging and langar at many places in Kashmir which served as centres for propagation of Islam. His preaching resulted in a colossal number of Kashmiri people and priests of the aforementioned religions along with thousands of their followers converting to Islam which became the vastly dominant religion of the Kashmiri masses by the fourteenth century. Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani's impact in Kashmir was not only confined to religion but had a great say on culture, industry and economy of Kashmir. Spread of shawl making, carpet manufacturing, cloth weaving, etc. gained great prominence by his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myasa.net/sufindia/hazrat%20amir-e-kabir%20shah-e-hamdan.html|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kashmirfirst.com/articles/history/070520_shah-i-hamadan.htm|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikh Empire ===
In 1819 Kashmir came under [[Maharajah Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Maharajah Ranjit Singh]]'s Sikh Empire and [[Sikh Empire|Sikh rule]] over Kashmir lasted for 27 years till 1846. These 27 years of Sikh rule saw 10 Governors in Kashmir. Of these 10 Governors five were Hindus, three were Sikhs and two were Muslims. Due to the fact that Kashmiris had suffered under the Afghan rulers, they initially welcomed the Sikh rule. However the Sikhs turned out to be hard taskmasters and their rule was generally considered oppressive.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=35mhDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Kashmir+famine+muslims+punjab&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKleaMjuTQAhUT8mMKHWNXAow4FBDoAQgnMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Kashmir%20famine%20muslims%20punjab&amp;f=false|title=Deadly Peaks: Mountaineering's Greatest Triumphs and Tragedies|last=Hauptman|first=Robert|last2=V.

Kashmir had also now begum to attract European visitors, several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast Muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs.

The Sikhs enacted a number of anti-Muslim policies, subjecting the Muslim majority population of the Valley to a number of hardships in the practice of their religion. The central mosque, [[Jama Masjid, Srinagar|Jama Masjid]], was closed for 20 years and Muslims were prohibited from issuing the ''azan'' (call to prayer).

Out of these, five were Hindus, three Sikhs, and two Muslims. Sikhs consistently followed anti-Muslim policies in Kashmir, subjecting the majority population of the Kashmir valley to severe hardship in relation to the practice of religion. It was also during this phase that the central mosque of Srinagar, the Jama Masjid was ordered to be closed and Muslims of Kashmir were not allowed to say azan (call to prayer). Sikhs tried to establish a 'Hindu' state where cow slaughter was declared a crime and a complete ban was passed against cow slaughter, lands attached to several shrines were also resumed on state orders...With the battle of Subraon, the Sikhs lost their independence.

== Diaspora ==
{{Further|Kashmiri diaspora}}In the early twentieth century, famines and the policies of the Dogra rulers drove many Kashmiri Muslims to flee their native land to [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]].

The '''Khalaj people''' (also spelt '''Xalaj''' or '''Khaladzh'''; {{lang-fa|خلج‌ها|Xalajhâ}}) are primarily classified as a [[Turkic people]] likely of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] origin&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/khalaj-i-tribe-turkistan ḴALAJ i. TRIBE]" - ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], December 15, 2010 (Pierre Oberling)''&lt;/ref&gt; that speak the [[Khalaj language]]. They can be classified as [[Persian people]] as well, due to becoming largely Persianized in the mid 20th century and also identifying as such.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/khalaj-ii-language ḴALAJ ii. Ḵalaji Language]" - ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], September 15, 2010 (Michael Knüppel)''&lt;/ref&gt; Their local language has preserved some features of [[Old Turkic]] lost in other Turkic languages. The language also has much Persian influence.  

==History==
According to [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]], the Khalaj people were mentioned at Divânu Lügati't-Türk:

"Twenty twos call them "Kal aç" in Turkish. This means "Stay hungry". Later, they were called "Xalac". Their origins are these."&lt;ref&gt;Divanü Lügat-it – Türk, translation by Atalay Besim, TDK Press 523, Ankara, 1992, Volume III, page 415&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Oghuz Turks|Oguzs]] and [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] translate "x" to k". They are a group of "Xalac"s. They say "xızım", whereas Turks say "kızım" (my daughter). And again other Turks say "kande erdinğ", whereas they say "xanda erdinğ", this means "where were you ?" &lt;ref&gt;Divanü Lügat-it – Türk, translation by Atalay Besim, TDK Press 523, Ankara, 1992, Volume III, page 218&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zemarcos' Syriac chronicle, Khalajes would be remnants of [[Hephthalite]]s, an Iranic people. He was ambassador of [[Byzantine Empire]] to Western [[Gokturk]] Khanate in 568. According to [[Al Khwarizmi]], was [[Samanid]] officer, they were considered as descendants of Hepthtalithes. [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] mentioned Khalajes lived beyond [[Syr Darya]] of the [[Talas Valley|Talas]] region in his book [[Book of Roads and Kingdoms (ibn Khordadbeh)|Kitāb al-Masālik w’al- Mamālik]] with [[Karluks]]. But the information comes into contradictions that make it unreliable. The similarity between Khalaj and Karluk is difficult to determine the truth.

They ruled [[Zabulistan]] as vassals of [[Tahirids]] with title of Zunbil. They were subjugated by [[Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari]], was founder of [[Saffarid]]s in 879. According to Saffarid sources they were inhabitants of [[Zabulistan]], this meant they lived in present [[Afghanistan]] and among [[Ghazni]] and [[Zamindawar]]. Later, they were successively ruled by [[Samanids]] and [[Ghaznavids]].

In 1040, they revolted against [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]], was sultan of [[Ghaznavids]]. He sent a [[punitive expedition]] but he was defeated and later dethroned and executed by [[Mohammad Ghaznavi]]. During the Ghaznavid and [[Ghurid]] rules, some of Khalaj gradually become [[Ghilzai]] tribe of [[Afghan]]. Ghurid Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud came to power at [[Firuzkuh]] with support of them. Later they were subjected by [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmshahs]] in the 1210s. During the [[Mongol]] invasion of 1221, many Khalajes joined the Mongols but others continued to Sayf al-Din Ighrak, who formed an ephemeral independent state in the valley of Kabul. Many Khalajes then went to [[India]] and served the sultans of Delhi, in western India and in Bengal, its members were called Khalji and founded a [[Khalji dynasty|dynasty]] which ruled [[Delhi sultanate]] from 1290 to 1320 and other dynasties in various places as [[Malwa]].

Some of the Khalaj remained in present area of Afghanistan, in the fourteenth century are discussed in Khalaj [[Abiward]] in northern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], they should set the thirteenth century during the struggles between Ghurids and Khwarezmhsahs. An Uzbek tribe identified by the Russians in the 19th century with the name of Galachi, would originate from Khalaj. Other groups are indicated in [[Kerman]] and [[Fars Province|Fars]] as well as in [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Anatolia]]. A region of western Persia, the mountainous region southwest of [[Tehran]] towards [[Hamadan]] named traditional Khalajistan, especially living in the districts (shahristans) of [[Saveh|Sawa]] and Arak Province (ustan) of Markazi, and in territories inhabited by Bakhtiyaris including some close to the central mountains of Zagros.

Khalajes give their name to [[Halaç District]] at [[Lebap Province]] of [[Turkmenistan]]. Their inhabitants are [[Ersari]] tribe of [[Turkmens]], who originated from [[Seljuk Turks]].

==Origins==
The origin of the Khalaj people is subject to scholarly debate. It is said they originated as remnants of the [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalite]] Confederation, which indicates an [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] origin. Groups of the Khalaj people migrated into Persia beginning with the invasions of the Seljuq Turks, during the 11th century. From there, a branch of them migrated to the Azerbaijan region, where they supposedly picked up greater Turkic influence in their language. However, the Khalaj are very few in Iranian Azerbaijan today. Sometime shortly prior to the time of Timur (1336-1405), a branch of Khalaj migrated to the area southwest of [[Saveh]] in the [[Markazi Province]], which is where a large branch of the Khalaj are located today.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/khalaj-i-tribe-turkistan ḴALAJ i. TRIBE]" - ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], December 15, 2010 (Pierre Oberling)''&lt;/ref&gt; However, today, the Khalaj people also identify as [[Persian people|Persians]] despite still speaking their local Turkic language. This is due to undergoing processes of Persianization starting in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/khalaj-ii-language ḴALAJ ii. Ḵalaji Language]" - ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], September 15, 2010 (Michael Knüppel)''&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding their origins, however, it is also noted that: 
{{quote|text=The origin of the Khalaj is controversial. Arab geographers mentioned them already in the 9th and 10th centuries, and the Khalaj were listed among the Turkic people of the steppes of Central Asia. It is difficult to identify whether the Khalaj mentioned in those accounts are identical with the present people of the same name. Sometimes they were also considered as descendants of the [[Hephthalites]], or as those of turkisized Iranians, or precisely as the [[Sakas]] (cf. Bosworth and Clauson, pp. 8 ff.). According to the Arab geographer Ebn Ḵordāḏbeh, their earliest known settlement was located in the Talas region beyond the [[Syr Darya River]] (Bosworth, p. 917). Based on the record of another Arab geographer, [[Moḥammad b. Najib Bakrān]], in the 13th century the Khalaj moved from the [[Karluks|Qarluq]] area, where they were involved in conflicts with the [[Ghurid dynasty|GHURIDS]], to [[Zabulistan|Zābolestān]] (cf. Minorsky, 1940-42, pp. 426-34; Idem, 1937, pp. 346-48). In the course of the [[Mongol conquests]], parts of the Khalaj migrated westwards. Moḥammad b. Najib Bakrān had already mentioned Khalaj settlements in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in the 13th century (Bosworth, p. 917). The remembrance of this former presence of the Khalaj is still kept in the form of several toponyms. In [[Kermān]] and [[Fārs]], the presence of the Khalaj is said to date back to the late [[Saljuq period]] (end of the 12th century).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/khalaj-ii-language ḴALAJ ii.

The traditional clothing worn in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] varies according to the area of the region.  The following outfits are generally worn in the area.

==Khat partug==
The traditional clothing for the lower region is the [[Khet partug|khat partug]] which is a [[shalwar kameez]] combination and is worn by men and women. The khat (also called khattaki or in Marwat Pashtu, kamis)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;NWFProvince. Gazetteer of Bannu District Part A 1907&lt;/ref&gt; is the shirt which fits closely to the body to the waist and then flares out, either to  the knees, or in the case of women, to the ankles.  The khat worn by women can be elaborately embroidered at the neck with needle work.

The partug (also called pardig) is a loose shalwar which has many folds and is loosely brought together at the ankles. Men also wear a turban and a scarf (called patkai),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  while women wear a head scarf.

==Firaq partug==
The female khat is also known as the firaq which forms the [[firaq partug]] outfit. The female khat is of two types:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; the jalana khat and the giradana khat. The jalana khat is worn by unmarried women which is loose and traditionally of print design. The giradana khat is worn by married women and is of dark colours, especially red. The female khat has many pleats. The styles are of the type also worn in [[Afghanistan]].

The tunban (lower garment) is worn loose and hanging.  Some versions of the tunban have the ample folds gathered into plaits at the lower part of the legs, below the knees to the ankles and the loose part above overhangs in loops.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The tunban therefore uses a lot of material so that it gathers around the waist and folds around the legs. Modern versions are less voluminous.

The dress in Kalash, [[Chitral District]] is the long robe. The robe can either be of wool or cotton,&lt;ref&gt;Horace Arthur Rose, IBBETSON, Maclagan (1996) A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province: Vol. 1 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1QmrSwFYe60C&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=chitral++dress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O4GXVYjgKueM7AbL_pmAAw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chitral%20%20dress&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and is referred to as the chugha or shoqa. This type of robe is also traditionally worn in the neighbouring [[Hunza Valley]] of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] where the garment is referred to as the choga.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=gdSYVa65HYTB7gaUmJDQAg&amp;id=42klAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=hunza+region+dress&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=choga Social Science Abstracts, Volume 2, Issues 1-6 (1930)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chitral, the men traditionally wear mid-calf-length straight-legged loose woollen trousers which are supplemented by woollen leggings in winter. This links the region to the Nuristani region in adjoining [[Afghanistan]] to its west where men traditionally wore white woollen trousers reaching to just below the knees, supplemented by black tight leggings, covered by a long tunic tied at the waist.&lt;ref&gt;Condrad, Jill (2013) Encyclopedia of National Dress: Traditional Clothing Around the World [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lazWAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=nuristani++region+dress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jNiYVfD0EYfj7QbAyJyQAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nuristani%20%20region%20dress&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Men of Chitral also wear loose shirts and woollen waistcoats or coats and the Chitrali cap with a sprig of juniper tucked into its brim.&lt;ref&gt;Claus,  Peter J.

The women wear very loose shalwars. Women's dresses are made with eight to ten yards of black cotton cloth, which is heavily embroidered around the neck, sleeves and bottom with skeins of yarn. A thick woollen or yarn belt is tied three or four times around the waist. Women wear beads around the neck. The headdress consists of 
two parts, the smaller susutr (woven woollen circle) which rest at the back of the head and has a long run down the back. The larger item is the kapas which rests above the susutr. Where the susutr is worn at all times, the kapas, which is highly decorated is worn on special occasions, or when visiting other valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi, Wynne (2001) Our Women are Free: Gender and Ethnicity in the Hindukus [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FVotcuQ1dvEC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=chitral+traditional+clothing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cMeXVZLqDIit7gab-KGQAw&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chitral%20traditional%20clothing&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kinnaraya''' or '''Kinnarayo'''  also '''Kinnara''' are a [[social group]] or [[caste]] amongst the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. Like the [[Burakumin]]  of Japan and [[Paraiyar]] of the [[Tamil Nadu]] state in [[South India]], they were segregated from the mainstream society yet played a vital role as mat weavers for the mainstream community.

==Origins==
As the mainstream Sinhalese speakers claim [[North Indian]] ethnic origins the presence of many South Indian type functional [[Jatis]] like the Kinnaraya indicate a complex migration history from India to Sri Lanka. But Kinnarayas do indicate vestiges of tribal origins like the other formerly [[untouchable caste]] of [[Rodiyas]]. Although they have become part and parcel of the caste structure albeit with a primary function associated with mat weaving. They are also used as agricultural workers, weavers and domestic help throughout the country.

==Roots==
Some [[anthropologists]] believe that the early society of Sri Lanka looked to neighboring South India for manpower to fulfill functional needs as land was cleared and many new villages found. Also the indigenous people of Sri Lanka known in the legends as [[Vedda people|Yakkas]] and Nagas also fused with the caste structure usually at the bottom as marginal people providing needed support services for survival as their habitats were cleared or simply taken over. Unlike other functional Sinhalese castes in Sri Lanka there is anecdotal evidence that along with [[Rodiyas]], that Kinnaras were an [[indigenous peoples of Asia|indigenous]] tribal group that eventually became a [[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalit]]-like caste.

==Etymology of Kinnaraya==
The etymology of the word [[Kinnara Kingdom|Kinnara]] is complex and number of theories abound. But it is not clear how this early [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] or [[Proto-Dravidian]] word or word similar to it came to describe this insignificant community. Most Hindu and Buddhist literature around the world have differing meaning for this word. 

==Sub divisions==
There used to be many [[totemic]] or clan likes subdivisions within the caste that are not attested in known literature.

==Role in folk religion==
Although great many Sinhalese purport to profess the conservative [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] there is a thriving belief in [[Demons]], [[Spirit]]s, [[Hindu]] [[deity|Gods]] and connected rituals such as [[spirit possession]], [[Curse|cursing]] ceremonies throughout the country also referred as the Spirit Religion or Folk Tradition.  As a marginal people, the role played by Kinnaraya in this folk tradition is not well documented. The community is noted for its performances of Sokari, the comic opera performed on the kamatha threshing floor in honor of goddess [[Pattini]] and god [[Kataragama]]. Despite harsh economic conditions, the Kinnarayas still preserve a sizable share of the island's indigenous heritage.

==Current status==
As a numerically small and culturally insignificant community they have not been able to upgrade their social position in the society. Many still languish at the bottom as agricultural workers, army recruits to the front line in the civil war since the [[Black July]] pogroms, domestic workers and as overseas [[maid]]s in the [[Middle East]] whose hard earned [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] is vital for the economic wellbeing  of the country.

'''Koryaks''' (or Koriak) are an indigenous people of the [[Russian Far East]], who live immediately north of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in [[Kamchatka Krai]] and inhabit the coastlands of the [[Bering Sea]]. The cultural borders of the Koryaks include [[Tigilsk, Russia|Tigilsk]] in the south and the [[Anadyr River|Anadyr]] basin in the north.

The Koryaks are culturally similar to the [[Chukchis]] of extreme northeast Siberia. The [[Koryak language]] and [[Alutor language|Alutor]] (which is often regarded as a dialect of Koryak), are linguistically close to the [[Chukchi language]]. All of these languages are members of the [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] [[Language families and languages|language family]]. They are more distantly related to the [[Itelmens]] on the Kamchatka Peninsula. All of these peoples and other, unrelated minorities in and around Kamchatka are known collectively as [[Kamchadals]].

Neighbors of the Koryaks include the [[Evens]] to the west, the [[Alutor]] to the south (on the [[isthmus]] of [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]), the [[Kereks|Kerek]] to the east, and the Chukchi to the northeast.

The Koryak are typically split into two groups:  the [[coastal]] people ''Nemelan'' (or ''Nymylan'') meaning 'village dwellers,' due to their living in villages. Their lifestyle is based on local [[fishing]] and marine mammal hunting. The inland Koryak, reindeer herders, are called ''Chaucu'' (or ''Chauchuven''), meaning 'rich in reindeer.' They are more [[nomad]]ic, following the herds as they graze with the seasons.&lt;ref name=ChaV/&gt;

According to the 2010 census, there were 7,953 Koryaks in Russia.

==Etymology==
The name Koryak was from the [[exonym]] word 'Korak,' meaning 'with the [[reindeer]] (kor)' in a nearby group [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan language]].&lt;ref name=KolM&gt;Kolga, pp.230-234&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest references to the name 'Koryak' were recorded in the writings of the [[Russians|Russian]] [[cossack]] [[Vladimir Atlasov]], who conquered Kamchatka for the [[Tsar]] in 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Al'kor, Ia P., and A. K. Dranen. (1935) ''Kolonial'naia politika tsarizzna na Kamchatke'', Leningrad: Tsentral'nyi istoricheskii arkhiv. Leningradskoe otdelenie.&lt;/ref&gt; The variant name was adopted by [[Russia]] in official state documents, hence popularizing it ever since.&lt;ref name=KolM/&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Koryaks in Russian Federation.png|thumb|270px|The Koryak in Russian Federation]]
The origin of the Koryak is unknown. [[Anthropologist]]s have speculated that a [[Beringia|land bridge]] connected the [[Eurasia]]n and [[North America]]n continent during [[Late Pleistocene]]. It is possible that migratory peoples crossed the modern-day Koryak land ''en route'' to [[North America]]. Scientists have suggested that people traveled back and forth between this area and [[Haida Gwaii]] before the [[Last glacial period|ice age]] receded. They theorize that the ancestors of the Koryak had returned to [[Siberia]]n [[Asia]] from North America during this time.&lt;ref name = ChaV/&gt; Cultural and some linguistic similarity exist between the [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]] and the Koryak.&lt;ref name=FreD&gt;Friedrich and Diamond,&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Koryak once occupied a much larger area of the Russian Far East. Their overlapping borders extended to the Nivkh areas in [[Khabarovsk Krai]] until the [[Evens]] arrived, and pushed them into their present region.&lt;ref name=FreD/&gt; A [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] in 1769-1770 and [[Conquest of Siberia#Genocides|warfare with Russian Cossacks]] reduced the Koryak population from 10-11,000 in 1700 to 4,800 in 1800.&lt;ref name=ANSI&gt;[http://www.npolar.no/ansipra/english/Indexpages/Ethnic_groups.html#19 "Indigenous Peoples of the Russian North, Siberia and Far East"],  Arctic Network for the Support of the Indigenous Peoples of the Russian Arctic&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Soviet Union]], a [[Koryak Autonomous Okrug]] was formed in 1931 and named for this people. Based on the local referendum in 2005, this was merged with [[Kamchatka Krai]] effective July 1, 2007.&lt;ref name=ChaV/&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Koryak armor.jpeg|thumb|[[Lamellar armour]] traditionally worn by Koryak people (1900-1901)]]
Families usually gathered into groups of six or seven, forming [[band society|bands]]. The nominal chief had no predominating authority, and the groups relied on consensus to make decisions, resembling common small group [[egalitarianism]].

The lives of the people in the interior revolved around [[reindeer]], their main source of food. They also used all the parts of its body to make sewing materials and clothing, tools and weapons. The [[meat]] was mostly eaten [[roasted]] and the [[blood]], [[Bone marrow|marrow]] and [[milk]] were drunk or eaten raw. The [[liver]], [[heart]], [[kidney]]s and [[tongue]] were considered delicacies. [[Salmon]] and other [[freshwater fish]] as well as [[berries]] and [[root]]s played a major part in the diet, as reindeer flesh did not contain some necessary [[vitamin]]s and [[mineral]]s, nor [[dietary fibre]], needed to survive in the harsh [[tundra]]. The people produced [[cheese]], [[butter]] and [[fermented milk]] from reindeer milk.

Today the Koryaks also buy processed food, such as [[bread]], [[cereal]] and [[canned fish]]. They sell some reindeer each year for money, but can build up their herds due to the large population of reindeer.

[[Clothing]] was made out of reindeer [[Hide (skin)|hides]], but nowadays men and women often have replaced that with [[cloth]]. The men wore baggy [[trousers|pants]] and a hide [[shirt]], which often had a [[hood (headgear)|hood]] attached to it, [[boots]] and traditional [[cap]]s made of reindeer skin. They still use the boots and caps. The women wore the same as the men, but with a longer shirt reaching to the calves. Today women often wear a head cloth and [[skirt]], but wear the reindeer skin [[robe]] in [[cold weather]].

The Koryak lived in conical shaped huts, called ''jajanga,'' similar to a [[tipi]] of the American Plains Indians, but less vertical. The framework was covered in many reindeer skins. Many families still use the chum as dwellings, but some live in [[log cabin]]s. The centre of the chum had a [[hearth]], which has been replaced by an iron [[stove]]. Reindeer hide [[bed]]s are placed to the east in the chum. They used small [[cupboard]]s to store the families' food, clothing and personal items.

==Transportation==
{{More footnotes|section|date=May 2013}}
The inland Koryak rode [[reindeer]] to get around, cutting off their antlers to prevent injuries. They also fitted a team of reindeer with harnesses and attached them to [[sled]]s to transport goods and people when moving camp.&lt;ref&gt;Jochelson, Waldemar. 1908. ''The Koryak'', Memoirs of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], vol. 10, parts 1–2: ''The Jesup North Pacific Expedition,'' Leiden: E. J. Brill&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the Koryak use [[snowmobiles]] more often than reindeer. Most inter-village transport is by air or boat, although tracked vehicles are used for travel to neighboring villages.&lt;ref&gt;King, Alexander D. (2011) ''Living with Koryak Traditions: Playing with Culture in Siberia'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

They developed [[snowshoes]], which they used in winter (and still do) when the snow is deep. Snowshoes are made by lashing reindeer [[sinew]] and hide strips to a [[tennis racket]]-shaped [[birch]] bark or willow hoop. The sinew straps are used to attach the shoe to the foot.

Children learned to ride a reindeer, sleigh, and use snowshoes at a very young age.

The other Koryak were skilled seafarers hunting whales and other marine mammals.

==Religion==
Koryaks believe in a Supreme Being whom they call by various names: ''Ñaíñinen'' (Universe/World), ''Ináhitela'n'' (Supervisor), ''Gichol-Eti'nvila'n'' (Master-of-the-Upper-World), ''Gi'chola'n'' (One-on-High), etc. He is considered to reside in Heaven with his family and when he wishes to punish mankind for immoral acts, he falls asleep and thus leaves man vulnerable to unsuccessful hunting and other ills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jochelson|first=Waldemar|date=1904|title=The Mythology of the Koryak|jstor=659272|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=6|pages=413–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koryak [[mythology]] centers on the supernatural shaman ''[[Kutkh|Quikil]]'' (Big-Raven), who was created by the Supreme Being as the first man and protector of the Koryak.&lt;ref name=ChaV/&gt; [[Raven in mythology|Big Raven myths]] are also found in Southeast Alaska in the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] culture, and among the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tsimshian]], and other natives of the Pacific Northwest Coast [[Amerindian]]s.&lt;ref name=ChaV&gt;Chaussonnet, p28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Koryak lands are [[mountain]]s and volcanic, covered in mostly Arctic tundra. [[Conifer]]ous trees lie near the southern regions along the coast of the Shelekhova Bay of the [[Sea of Okhotsk]].  The northern regions inland are much colder, where only various shrubs grow, but these are enough to sustain reindeer migration.&lt;ref name=ChaV/&gt; The mean temperature in [[winter]] is –25&amp;nbsp;°C (-13&amp;nbsp;°F) while short [[summer]]s are +12&amp;nbsp;°C (53&amp;nbsp;°F). The area they covered before Russian colonization was 301,500&amp;nbsp;km² (116,410&amp;nbsp;mi²), roughly corresponding to the [[Koryak Okrug]], of which the administrative centre is [[Palana]].&lt;ref name=KolM/&gt; Today the Koryak are the largest minority group with 8,743 people. The krai's population is now majority ethnic Russian, descendants of the Cossack colonizers.

The '''Kwama''' (also called '''Gwama''' and '''Komo'''), are a [[Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking community living in the Sudanese-Ethiopian borderland, mainly in the [[Mao-Komo special woreda]] of the [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region]] in [[Ethiopia]]. They belong, culturally and linguistically, to the [[Koman languages|Koman groups]], which include neighboring communities such as the [[Uduk people|Uduk]], [[Koma in Adamawa|Koma]], and [[Shita people|Opuuo]]. Although they traditionally occupied a larger territory, they have been forced to move to marginal, lowland areas by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] from the 18th century onwards. In some villages Kwama, Oromo and [[Berta people|Berta]] live together. The Kwama are often called "Mao" by other groups, especially by the Oromo. The people who live in the southern area and near the Sudanese borderland often call themselves "Gwama" and use the term "Kwama" to refer to those living further to the south and in Sudan. These other "Kwama" are usually known by anthropologists as Koma or Komo (Theis 1995). In recent years, many people belonging to this ethnic group have been resettled by the Ethiopian state in order to provide them with clinics and schools.

== Customs ==
The Kwama are [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] cultivators. Their staple food is [[sorghum]], with which they make beer (called ''shwe'' or ''shul'' depending on the dialect) and porridge (''pwash'' or ''fash''). They also hunt (mostly duiker and warthog), fish, and gather honey. They drink sorghum beer communally with drinking straws from a large pot. Marriage was traditionally by sister exchange, although this custom is now receding. The Kwama are divided into clans, some of which are also divided into sub-clans. It is not allowed to marry a woman or a man from one's own clan. [[Polygyny]] is widespread. They have ritual specialists and rainmakers (''sid mumun'' and ''sid bish''), who perform divination and healing ceremonies in huts called ''swal shwomo''. These often have a characteristic bee-hive shape, which is very typical of this ethnic group. For that reason, the Kwama refer to their traditional houses as ''swal kwama'', "swal" meaning "house". Vinigi Grotanelli describes some of them in his study of the Mao (Grottanelli 1940).

The '''Loloish languages''', also known as '''[[Nuosu language|Yi]]''' in China and occasionally '''Ngwi''' (Bradley 1997) or '''Nisoic''' (Lama 2012), are a family of fifty to a hundred [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken primarily in the [[Yunnan]] province of China. They are most closely related to [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and its relatives. Both the Loloish and [[Burmish languages|Burmish]] branches are well defined, as is their superior node, [[Lolo-Burmese languages|Lolo–Burmese]]. However, subclassification is more contentious.

[[SIL Ethnologue]] (2013 edition) estimated a total number of 9 million native speakers of Ngwi languages, the largest group being the speakers of [[Nuosu language|Nuosu (Northern Yi)]] at 2 million speakers (2000 PRC census).&lt;ref&gt;[hle] 15,000; [jiy] 1,000; [jiu] 10,000; [lkc] 46,870; [lhu] 530,350; [lhi] 196,200; [ywt] 213,000; [yik] 30,000; [yit] 38,000; [ywl] 38,000; [llh] 120; [yne] 2,000; [lwu] 50; [ylm] 29,000; [lpo] 250,000; [lis] 942,700; [ycl] 380,000; [ysp] 190,000; [ymh] 23,000; [yiq] 30,000; [nuf] 12,670; [ysn] 100,000; [yta] 13,600; [ytl] 950; [zal] 2,100; [yna] 25,000; [yiu] 20,000; [yyz] 50; [ych] 3,300; [ygp] 100,000; [kaf] 4,000; [ylo] 15,000; [ywu] 150,000; [yig] 500,000; [iii] 2,000,000; [ysd] 400; [smh] 20,000; [ysy] 8,000; [ywq] 250,000; [yif] 35,000; [aub] 3,500; [yix] 100,000; [aza] 53,000; [yiz] 54,000; [ybk] 10,000; [ykt] 5,000; [ykl] 21,000; [ykn] 5,000; [yku] 1,000; [lgh] 300; [nty] 1,100; [ymi] 2,000; [ymx] 9,000; [ymq] 1,500; [ymc] 26,000; [ymz] 10,000; [yso] 36,000; [nos] 75,000; [yiv] 160,000; [nsf] 24,000; [nsd] 210,000; [nsv] 15,000; [ypa] 12,000; [ypg] 13,000; [ypo] 500; [yip] 30,000; [ypn] 10,000; [yhl] 36,000; [ypb] 17,000; [phh] 10,000; [ypm] 8,000; [ypp] 3,000; [yph] 1,300; [ypz] 6,000; [ysg] 2,000; [ytp] 200; [yzk] 13,000; [qeu] 12,400; [ahk] 563,960; [bzi] 240; [byo] 120,000; [ycp] 2,000; [cnc] 2,030; [enu] 30,000; [hni] 758,620; [how] 140,000; [ktp] 185,000; [lwm] 1,600; [lov] ?

==Names==
''Loloish'' is the traditional name for the family. Some publications avoid the term under the misapprehension that ''Lolo'' is pejorative. ''Lolo'' is the Chinese rendition of the autonym of the [[Yi people]], and it is only pejorative when written with a particular Chinese character (one that uses a beast rather than human radical), a practice that was prohibited by the Chinese government in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Paul K. (1987). "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/benedict1987autonyms.pdf Autonyms: ought or ought not]." ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'' 10: 188. Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bradley (linguist)|David Bradley]] uses the name ''Ngwi'', which is also used by ''Ethnologue'', and Lama (2012) uses ''Nisoic''. [[Paul K. Benedict]] coined the term ''Yipho'', from ''Yi'' and a common autonym element (-''po'' or -''pho''), but it never gained wide usage.

==Internal classification==
===Bradley (2007)===
Loloish was traditionally divided into a northern branch, with [[Lisu language|Lisu]] and the numerous [[Yi people#Language|Yi languages]], and a southern branch, with everything else. However, per Bradley (1997) and Thurgood (2003:8) there is also a central branch, with languages from both northern and southern. Bradley (2002, 2007) adds a fourth, southeastern branch.

*'''[[Northern Loloish]]''': [[Nuosu language|Nuosu]], [[Nasu language|Nasu]], etc.
*'''[[Central Loloish]]''': [[Lisu language|Lisu]]–[[Lipho language|Lipho]] (incl. [[Lolopo language|Lolopo]], [[Lalo language|Lalo]]), [[Micha language|Micha]], [[Lahu language|Lahu]], [[Jinuo language|Jinuo]], etc.
*'''[[Southern Loloish]]''': [[Akha language|Akha]]–[[Hani language|Hani]], [[Phunoi language|Phunoi]]–[[Bisu language|Bisu]], [[Pholo language|Pholo]], and [[Ugong language|’Ugong]] (aberrant; removed in Bradley 1997)
*'''[[Southeastern Loloish]]''': [[Nisu language|Nisu]], [[Phula language|Phula]], [[Sani language|Sani]], [[Azha language|Azha]], [[Khlula language|Khlula]], [[Muji language|Muji]], [[Phowa language|Phowa]], etc.

Ugong is divergent; Bradley (1997) places it with the [[Burmish languages]]. The [[Tujia language]] is difficult to classify due to divergent vocabulary. Other unclassified Loloish languages are [[Gokhy language|Gokhy]] (Gɔkhý), [[Lopi language|Lopi]], and [[Ache Yi language|Ache]].

===Lama (2012)===
Lama (2012) classified 36 Lolo–Burmese languages based on a computational analysis of shared phonological and lexical innovations. He finds the [[Mondzish languages]] to be a separate branch of Lolo-Burmese, which Lama considers to have split off before [[Burmish languages|Burmish]] did. The rest of the Loloish languages are as follows:

The Nisoish, Lisoish, and Kazhuoish clusters are closely related, forming a clade ("Ni-Li-Ka") at about the same level as the other five branches of Loloish. Lama's Naxish clade has been classified as [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]] rather than Loloish by [[Guillaume Jacques]] &amp; Alexis Michaud (2011)&lt;ref name="Jacques"&gt;Jacques, Guillaume, and Alexis Michaud. 2011. "Approaching the historical phonology of three highly eroded Sino-Tibetan languages." ''Diachronica'' 28:468-498.&lt;/ref&gt; (''see [[Qiangic languages]]'').

'''Makyam Naga''' (Lasam, Macham Naga, Makyan, Pongnyun, Paungnyuan) is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken in [[Burma]]. It is closely related to other [[Konyak languages]].

==Classification==
Makyam belongs to the Khiamniungic subgroup within the [[Konyak languages|Konyak]]–Chang group of languages (Naw Sawu 2016:6). It is closely related to [[Htangan language|Leinong]] than to [[Khiamniungan language|Khiamniungan]].

==Distribution==
Makyam is spoken in 13 villages of northeast [[Lahe Township]] and [[Hkamti Township]], [[Sagaing Division]], Myanmar (''Ethnologue''). Main dialect variation is between the western Makyan villages and Kuku villages.

Makyam is spoken in the following 18 villages, which are located just to the east of Lahe town in [[Lahe Township]], [[Sagaing Division]], Myanmar. They add up to a total of 1,026 households and 4,994 persons (Naw Sawu 2016:8). Old village names are given in parentheses.

[[Marriage]] in [[Japan]] is a legal and social institution at the center of the [[Ie (Japanese family system)|household]]. Couples are legally married once they have made the change in status on their [[Koseki|family registration sheets]], without the need for a ceremony. Most weddings are held either according to [[Shinto]] traditions or in chapels according to [[Christian views on marriage|Christian marriage traditions]]. 

Traditionally, marriages were categorized into two types according to the method of finding a partner—''[[Miai|omiai]]'', meaning arranged or resulting from an arranged introduction, and ''ren'ai'', in which the husband and wife met and decided to marry on their own—although the distinction has grown less meaningful over postwar decades as [[Westernization|Western]] ideas of [[Romance (love)|love]] alter Japanese perceptions of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Modern Japan Through its Weddings''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The institution of marriage in Japan has changed radically over the last millennium. Indigenous practices adapted first to [[China|Chinese]] [[Confucianism]] during the [[History of Japan#Medieval Japan|medieval era]], and then to [[Westernization|Western]] concepts of [[individualism]], [[gender equality]], [[Romance (love)|romantic love]], and the [[nuclear family]] during the [[History of Japan#Modern Japan|modern era]]. Customs once exclusive to a small [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] gained mass popularity as the [[Japanese people|population]] became increasingly [[urbanization|urbanized]].

=== Heian period (794–1185) ===
[[File:Genji emaki 01003 009.jpg|thumb|[[Hikaru Genji|Genji's]] son {{Nihongo|Yūgiri|夕霧||"Evening Mist"}} reads a letter. ''[[Genji Monogatari|Genji Monogatari Emaki]]'', 12th century handscroll, Gotoh Museum.]]

The [[Heian period]] of Japanese history marked the culmination of its classical era, when the vast [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|imperial court]] established itself and its culture in [[Heian-kyō]] (modern [[Kyoto]]). Heian society was organized by an [[Japanese castes under the ritsuryō|elaborate system of rank]], and the purpose of marriage was to produce children who would inherit the highest possible rank from the best-placed [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. It was neither ceremonial nor necessarily permanent.&lt;ref name=JREF&gt;{{cite web|title=Society: Marriage in Japan|url=http://www.jref.com/articles/marriage-in-japan.223/|website=Japan Reference|accessdate=21 January 2016|date=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aristocrats exchanged letters and [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] for a period of months or years before arranging to meet after dark. If a man saw the same woman for a period of three nights, they were considered married, and the wife's parents held a banquet for the couple. Most members of the lower-class engaged in a permanent marriage with one partner, and husbands arranged to bring their wives into their own household, in order to ensure the [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]] of their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurihara|first1=Hiromu|title=Heian-jidai no Rikon no Kenkyu|date=1999|publisher=Kobundo|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-ranked noblemen sometimes kept multiple wives or [[Concubinage|concubines]]. Aristocratic wives could remain in their fathers' house, and the husband would recognize [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] with the formal presentation of a gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurihara|first1=Hiromu|title=Heian-jidai no Rikon no Kenkyu|date=1999|publisher=Kobundo|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of Heian [[courtship]], as well as the pitfalls of amorous intrigue, are well represented in the [[Heian literature|literature]] of the period, especially ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', ''[[Sarashina Nikki|The Sarashina Diary]]'', ''[[The Pillow Book]]'', and ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.

=== Edo period (1600–1868) ===
[[File:Japanese wedding. Before 1902.jpg|thumb|"Wedding." From the book ''Japan and Japanese'' (1902), p. 62.]]
[[File:Japanese at home. Before 1902.jpg|thumb|"Japanese at home." From the book ''Japan and Japanese'' (1902), p. 71.]] In pre-modern Japan, marriage was inextricable from the {{Nihongo|''[[Ie (Japanese family system)|ie]]''|家||"family" or "household"}}, the basic unit of society with a collective continuity independent of any individual life. Members of the household were expected to subordinate all their own interests to that of the ''ie'', with respect for an ideal of [[filial piety]] and [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]] that borrowed much from [[Confucian view of marriage|Confucianism]].&lt;ref name="Hendry, pp. 15-6"&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', pp. 15-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice to [[Bachelor|remain single]] was the greatest crime a man could commit, according to [[Hozumi Nobushige|Baron Hozumi]].&lt;ref&gt;Hozumi, Nobushige. ''Ancestor-Worship and Japanese Law.'' University Press of the Pacific, 2003. {{ISBN|1-4102-0838-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marriages were duly arranged by the head of the household, who represented it publicly and was legally responsible for its members, and any preference by either principal in a marital arrangement was considered improper. Property was regarded to belong to the ''ie'' rather than to individuals, and inheritance was strictly [[Primogeniture#Agnatic primogeniture|agnatic primogeniture]].  A woman (女) married the household (家) of her husband, hence the [[Kanji|logograms]] for {{Nihongo|''yome''|嫁||"wife"}} and {{Nihongo|''yomeiri''|嫁入り||"marriage," lit. "wife entering"}}.&lt;ref name="Hendry, pp. 15-6"/&gt; 

In the absence of sons, some households would adopt a {{Nihongo|[[Mukoyōshi|male heir]]|養子||or yōshi}} to maintain the dynasty, a practice which continues in corporate Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kapur|first1=Roshni|title=Welcome to the family: Adult adoptions in corporate Japan|url=http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/119305-japan-adult-male-adoption|accessdate=19 January 2016|work=Rappler|date=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all adoptions are of adult men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartson|first1=William|title=Top 10 facts about Japan|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/top10facts/642958/top-facts-Japan-National-Foundation-Day|accessdate=17 February 2016|work=Express|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage was restricted to households of equal social standing (分限), which made selection a crucial, painstaking process. Although Confucian ethics encouraged people to marry outside their own group, limiting the search to a local community remained the easiest way to ensure an honorable match. Approximately one-in-five marriages in pre-modern Japan occurred between households that were already related.&lt;ref name=JREF/&gt; 

Outcast communities such as the [[Burakumin]] could not marry outside of their [[caste]], and marriage discrimination continued even after an 1871 edict abolished the caste system, well into the twentieth century. Marriage [[International marriage (Japan)|between a Japanese and non-Japanese person]] was not officially permitted until 14 March 1873, a date now commemorated as [[White Day]]. Marriage with a foreigner required the Japanese national to surrender his or her social standing.

[[File:Kanbun Master - 'Lovers Surprised', late 1660s, Honolulu Academy of Arts.jpg|thumb|''Caught in the Act'', a hanging scroll by the [[Kanbun Master]], late 1660s, [[Honolulu Museum of Art]].]] 
The purposes of marriage in the [[History of Japan#Medieval Japan|medieval]] and [[Edo period]]s was to form alliances between families, to relieve the family of its female dependents, to perpetuate the family line, and, especially for the lower classes, to add new members to the family's workforce. The seventeenth-century treatise ''Onna Daigaku'' ("Greater Learning for Women") instructed wives honor their parents-in-law before their own parents, and to be "courteous, humble, and conciliatory" towards their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', pp. 18, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Husbands were also encouraged to place the needs of their parents and children before those of their wives. One British observer remarked, "If you love your wife you spoil your mother's servant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sladen|first1=Douglas|last2=Lorimer|first2=Norma|title=More Queer Things About Japan|date=1904|publisher=Anthony Treherne|location=London|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tension between a [[housewife]] and her [[Parent-in-law#Mothers-in-law|mother-in-law]] has been a keynote of [[Japanese television drama|Japanese drama]] ever since.

{{Nihongo|[[Romance (love)|Romantic love]]|愛情||''aijō''}} played little part in medieval marriages, as emotional attachment was considered inconsistent with filial piety. A proverb said, "Those who come together in passion stay together in tears."&lt;ref&gt;Tamura, ''The Japanese Bride'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For men, sexual gratification was seen as separate from conjugal relations with one's wife, where the purpose was [[Reproduction|procreation]]. The genre called {{Nihongo|''[[Ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵||lit. "floating world pictures"}} celebrated the luxury and hedonism of the era, typically with depictions of beautiful [[oiran|courtesans]] and [[geisha]] of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]]. [[Concubinage]] and [[Prostitution in Japan|prostitution]] were common, public, relatively respectable, until the social upheaval of the [[Meiji Restoration]] put an end to [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[Edo society|society]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', pp. 19-21. Fukutake, ''Japanese Rural Society'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meiji Restoration and modernization (1868–1912) ===
[[File:Showa-family1941 12 7.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Hirohito|Shōwa Emperor]] (Hirohito) with his wife [[Empress Kōjun]] and their children in 1941.]]
During the [[Meiji period]], upper class and [[samurai]] customs of [[arranged marriage]] steadily replaced the unions of choice and mutual attraction that rural commoners had once enjoyed. Rapid [[urbanization]] and [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] brought more of the population into the cities, ending the isolation of rural life. [[State school|Public education]] became almost universal between 1872 and the early 1900s, and schools stressed the traditional concept of filial piety, first toward the [[Empire of Japan|nation]], second toward the household, and last of all toward a person's own private interests. Marriage under the Meiji Civil Code required the permission of the head of a household (Article 750) and of the parents for men under 30 and women under 25 (Article 772).&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', pp. 14, 16-7, 22-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In arranged marriages, most couples met beforehand at a formal introduction called an {{Nihongo|''[[Miai|omiai]]''|お見合い||lit. "looking at one another"}}, although some would meet for the first time at the wedding ceremony. A visitor to Japan described the ''omiai'' as "a meeting at which the lovers (if persons unknown to each other may be so styled) are allowed to see, sometimes even to speak to each other, and thus estimate each others' merits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Basil Hall|title=Things Japanese|date=1902|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=309|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their objections carried little weight. The meeting was originally a samurai custom which became widespread during the early twentieth century, when commoners began to arrange marriages for their children through a {{Nihongo|go-between|仲人|, nakōdo}} or [[Matchmaking|matchmaker]]. The word ''omiai'' is still used to distinguish arranged marriages, even when no formal meeting takes place, from {{Nihongo|''ren'ai''|恋愛||a "love match"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', pp. 18, 22-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Courtship]] remained rare in Japan at this period. Boys and girls were separated in [[Single-sex education|schools]], in cinemas, and at social gatherings. Colleagues who began a romantic relationship could be dismissed, and during the [[Pacific War|Second World War]] traveling couples could be arrested. Parents sometimes staged an arranged marriage to legitimize a "love match," but many others resulted in separation and sometimes [[Shinjū|suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', pp. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Love was thought to be inessential to marriage. A proposal by Baron Hozumi, who had studied abroad, that the absence of love be made a grounds for divorce failed to pass during debates on the Meiji Civil Code of 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Mark D.|title=Lovesick Japan: Sex, Marriage, Romance, Law|date=2011|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; One writer observed in 1930, "According to the traditional moral ideas, it is deemed a sign of mental and moral weakness to '[[Falling in love|fall in love]].'"&lt;ref&gt;Kawashima, ''Kekkon'', pp. 143f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage, like other social institutions of this period, emphasized the subordinate inferiority of women to men. Women learned that as a daughter they ought to obey their father, as a wife their husband, as a widow their sons. [[Chastity]] in marriage was expected for women, and a law not repealed until 1908 allowed a husband to kill his wife and her lover if he found them in an [[Adultery|adulterous act]]. The prostitution of women survived the periodic intrusion of [[Religion and sexuality#Christianity|puritanical ideals]] on Japan's less restrictive [[Sexuality in Japan|sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Family law in Japan#Divorce|Divorce laws]] become more equal over time. During the Edo period, a husband could [[divorce]] his wife by writing a letter of his intent to do so, but a wife's only recourse was to flee to a [[convent]]. The laws of the early Meiji period established several grounds on which a man could divorce: [[Sterility (physiology)|sterility]], adultery, disobedience to parents-in-law, loquacity, [[larceny]], jealousy, and disease. A wife, accompanied by a close male relative, could appeal for divorce if she had been deserted or imprisoned by her husband, or if he was profligate or [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]]. The 1898 Civil Code established the principle of mutual consent, although the consent of women was still likely to be forced until the early twentieth century, as women gradually gained access to education and financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', pp. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt; The fight for divorce rights marked the beginning of [[Feminism in Japan|Japanese feminism]].

=== Post-war period (1945–present) ===
Signed after the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender]] and [[occupation of Japan]] by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]], Article 24 of the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution of 1947]] reestablished marriage on grounds of [[Gender equality|equality]] and choice: "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a base. With regard to choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters pertaining to marriage and the family, all laws shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes."

[[File:Japanese family meal in 1950s.jpg|thumb|A family meal in the 1950s.]]
The Constitution abolished the foundations of the ''ie'' system and the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] authority at its heart. Each [[nuclear family]] retained, and still retains, a separate [[Koseki|family registration sheet]], initiated on marriage under the [[surname]] of the husband or wife, but the head of each household no longer had any special legal prerogatives over his or her dependents. All legitimate children, male or female, gained an equal right to [[inheritance]], putting an end to primogeniture succession and the obsession with lineage. Women received the [[Women's suffrage in Japan|right to vote]] and the right to request a divorce on the basis of infidelity. The Meiji emphasis on Confucian values and [[Kokutai|national mythology]] disappeared from education.&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, ''Marriage in Changing Japan'', pp. 26-8&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional model of the ''ie'' was replaced with a new convention, the {{Nihongo|''kazoku''|家族||family}} and the {{Nihongo|''kakukazoku''|核家族||nuclear family}}, as the fundamental unit of society.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, William. "Finding a Place in Metropolitan Japan: Transpositions of Everyday Life." Ed. Andrew Gordon. ''Postwar Japan as History''. University of California Press, 1993. P. 208-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

New demographic trends emerged, including a later [[Age at first marriage|age of marriage]] and a smaller difference in age between groom and bride,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=E-Stat|title=Trends in mean age of bride and groom at marriage and difference in mean age between bride and groom|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/GL38020103.do?_toGL38020103_&amp;listID=000001137969&amp;requestSender=estat|website=Vital Statistics of Japan|accessdate=21 January 2016|location=Table 9-12|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the birth of two children in quick succession, few children born out of wedlock, and a low [[divorce rate]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Samuel. "The Tempo of Family Formation." Ed. David W. Plath. ''Work and Lifecourse in Japan''. Albany: SUNY Press, 1983. P. 183-214.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shūshin koyō|Lifetime employment]] became the norm for Japanese men, especially during the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|post-war economic boom]] of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. A [[middle class]] ideology established a [[Gender role|gendered family pattern]] with separate social spheres: a [[Salaryman|salaried husband]] to provide the family income, a [[housewife]] to manage the home and nurture the children, and a commitment by the children to education.&lt;ref name=Cengage&gt;Schirokauer, Conrad, Miranda Brown, David Lurie, and Suzanne Gay. ''A Brief History of Chinese and Japanese Civilizations''. 4th ed. Boston: Cengage Learning, 2013. P. 609-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Better health and nutrition meant a rapid extension of [[life expectancy]], and government policies have encouraged people to form {{Nihongo|''sansedai kazoku''|三世代家族||"three-generation families"}} to manage a [[Aging of Japan|rapidly aging society]].&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

''Omiai'' marriages, arranged by the parents or a matchmaker, remained the norm immediately after the war, although the decades which followed saw a steady rise in the number of ''ren'ai'' "love matches." The distinction between the two has blurred: parents almost always consulted young people before "arranging" a marriage, and many young people asked an employer or teacher to serve as matchmaker for their "love match."&lt;ref name=Cengage/&gt; Today only one in 20 married couples describe their formation as arranged, and a courtship of several years has become the norm even for relationships that begin with an ''omiai''. Three in five couples meet in the workplace or through friends or siblings.&lt;ref&gt;IPSS, "Marriage Process and Fertility of Japanese Married Couples" (2011), table 1.1, 1.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online dating service]]s in Japan gained a reputation as platforms for soliciting sex, often from [[Minor (law)|underage girls]], for [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault|assault]], and for using decoy accounts (called ''otori'' or ''sakura'' in Japanese) to string along users in order to extend their [[subscription business model|subscriptions]]. Newer services like Pairs, with 8 million users, or Omiai have introduced ID checks, age limits, strict [[moderation]], and use of [[artificial intelligence]] to arrange matches for serious seekers. Profiles typically include age, location, height, career, and salary, but can also include interests, hobbies, and familial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=安楽 |first1=由紀子 |title=シリーズ・現代ニッポンの結婚事情：（2）婚活を効率化するマッチングサービス事情 |url=https://www.nippon.com/ja/features/c05602/ |accessdate=20 October 2018 |work=Nippon.com |date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "marriage hunting" (''kekkon katsudo'', or ''konkatsu''), has become popular since 2007.&lt;ref name=paradox&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paradox of Harmony|last=Hirata|first=Keiko|last2=Warschauer|first2=Mark|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780300186079|location=New Haven|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} It reflects a professional class of matchmaking services which arrange meetings between potential partners, typically through social events, and often includes the exchange of resumes.&lt;ref name="paradox" /&gt;{{rp|83}}

According to the 2010 census, 58.9% of Japan's adult population is married, 13.9% of women and 3.1% of men are widowed, and 5.9% of women and 3.8% of men are divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Populations and Households of Japan 2010|location=Table 3.1|page=33|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/2010/poj/pdf/2010ch03.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2016|format=PDF|chapter=Chapter 3: Marital Status}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual number of marriages has dropped since the early 1970s, while divorces have shown a general upward trend.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{cite web|author1=Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan|title=Statistical Handbook of Japan 2014|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/handbook/c0117.htm|accessdate=18 January 2016|location=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of marriage in Japan, as fewer people marry and do so later in life, is a widely cited explanation for the [[Aging of Japan|plummeting birth rate]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamada&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yamada|first1=Masahiro|title=Japan’s Deepening Social Divides: Last Days for the "Parasite Singles"|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/a01002/|accessdate=14 January 2016|work=Nippon.com|date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sudo|first1=Yoko|title=Japan's Low Marriage Rate Concerns Minister|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-low-marriage-rate-concerns-minister-1405669862|accessdate=12 April 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Japanese are having so few babies|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/07/economist-explains-16|accessdate=14 January 2016|work=The Economist|date=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[total fertility rate]] has dropped since the 1970s (to 1.43 in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Statistical Yearbook, Chapter 2: Population and Households|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/nenkan/1431-02.htm|author=Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication, Statistics Bureau|accessdate=13 January 2016|location=Table 2-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;), birth statistics for married women have remained fairly constant (at around 2.1) and most married couples have two or more children.

The number of single-child or childless couples has increased since 2002 (to 23.3 percent in 2010) even as the desire for larger families remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;IPSS, "Marriage Process and Fertility of Japanese Married Couples" (2011), pp. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 2% of births occur [[Legitimacy (family law)#Extramarital births|outside of marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=人口動態調査（平成26年）|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/GL02020101.do?method=csvDownload&amp;fileId=000007464055&amp;releaseCount=1|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 30-60% of births in Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; This is due to social taboos, [[Family law in Japan#Children|legal pressure]], and financial hurdles.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

=== International marriages ===
Of the 660,613 marriages registered in 2013, 21,488 (or about 1 in 30) were between a Japanese and a foreign national, according to the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]]. The number of international unions rose rapidly in the 1980s and 90s, peaked in 2006 at 44,701 (about 1 in 16), and has declined since then.&lt;ref name=VitalStats&gt;{{cite book|title=Vital Statistics in Japan: The Latest Trends|date=2013|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|page=32|url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/database/db-hw/dl/81-1a2en.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the Immigration Control Act in 2005, which made it more difficult for [[Philippines|Philippine]] nationals to work in Japan, are one cause of the decline.

The nationality of foreign spouses differs by gender, and Japanese women are more likely to marry partners from outside [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] than Japanese men. Of the 15,442 non-Japanese brides in 2013, most came from [[China]] (40.4%), followed by the Philippines (20.1%), [[South Korea]] (17.7%), and [[Thailand]] (6.3%). The 6,046 grooms came from Korea (27.9%), the [[United States]] (19.1%), China (11.8%), and Brazil (4.7%).&lt;ref name=VitalStats/&gt; Many of the [[Chinese people in Japan|Chinese]] and [[Koreans in Japan|Korean (Zainichi)]] nationals included in these statistics have lived in Japan for generations without becoming naturalized citizens.

Of the 1 million children born in Japan in 2013, 2.2% had one or more non-Japanese parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trends in live births by nationality of father and mother, 1995, 2000 and 2005-2013|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/GL38020103.do?_toGL38020103_&amp;listID=000001128913&amp;requestSender=estat|website=e-Stat|accessdate=19 January 2016|location=Table 9|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in international households has sometimes led to [[International child abduction in Japan|conflicts over custody]]. Biracial Japanese children are often called {{nihongo|''[[hāfu]]''|ハーフ}}, although the term has its discontents.

=== Domestic violence ===
According to a summary of surveys by Japan's [[Gender Equality Bureau]] in 2006, 33.2% of wives and 17.4% of husbands have experienced either threats, physical violence, or [[Marital rape|rape]], more than 10% of women repeatedly. This violence almost always occurred after marriage. [[Dating abuse]] has also been reported by 13.5% of women and 5.2% of men.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Equality Bureau, Cabinet Office, Survey on Domestic Violence (Tokyo: Gender Equality Bureau, 2006) page 3, 9.

== Marriage law ==
{{main article|Family law in Japan}}
A marriage is legally recognized once a couple has successfully submitted the required documents to the [[city hall]] [[Civil registration|registrar]] to change their status in their {{nihongo|''koseki''|戸籍}} [[Family register|family registration sheet]]. No ceremony is required under [[Law of Japan|Japanese law]].&lt;ref name=USEmbassy&gt;[[Embassy of the United States in Tokyo|Embassy of the United States: Japan]], [http://tokyo.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-7114a.html Marriage in Japan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527101216/http://tokyo.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-7114a.html |date=27 May 2010 }}.

Accessed 29 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The family registration sheet serves as [[birth certificate]], proof of citizenship, [[marriage license]], and [[death certificate]]. A register is kept for each nuclear family, under the name of the {{nihongo|head of the household|筆頭者||''hittousya''}}, with the spouse and unmarried children who are registered as dependents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan's Family Registry System|url=http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-family-registry.html|publisher=Embassy of the United States: Tokyo, Japan|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple who marries must file a {{nihongo|marriage registration form|婚姻届||''konin todoke''}} to create a {{nihongo|new registration sheet|新戸籍||''shinkoseki''}} under a common [[surname]]. Since 1947, couples have been permitted to choose either the surname of the husband or wife, consistent with a ban on separate surnames first imposed in 1898. Married couples are estimated to choose the man's surname 95% of the time, although some women continue to use their [[Maiden and married names|maiden name]] informally. The ban has survived several legal challenges on the basis of [[gender inequality]], most recently in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soble|first1=Jonathan|title=Japan’s Top Court Upholds Law Requiring Spouses to Share Surname|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/world/asia/japan-court-ruling-women-surnames.html|accessdate=19 January 2016|work=The New York Times|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When marriage is used to adopt a [[Mukoyōshi|male heir]], the husband takes his wife's family name.

[[Transnational marriage|International marriages]] are subject to [[International marriage (Japan)|separate rules]] within Japan.

==Wedding ceremonies==
[[File:Bride at meiji shrine.jpg|thumb|250px|A bride in ''Tsunokakushi'' and ''shiromuku'' at [[Tokyo]]'s [[Meiji Shrine]].]]
A common description of Japan's [[Syncretism|religious syncretism]] says: "Born [[Shinto]], married [[Christianity in Japan|Christian]], die [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kisala|first1=R|editor1-last=Swanson|editor1-first=P|editor2-last=Chilson|editor2-first=C|title=Nanzan Guide to Japanese Religions|date=2006|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=3|edition=3-13|chapter=Japanese Religions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, elements of all three major traditions tend to be practiced side-by-side. Japanese weddings usually begin with a Shinto or Christian-style ceremony for family members and very close friends before a reception dinner and after-party at a restaurant or hotel banquet hall. There the couple's extended families and friends make speeches and offer {{nihongo|''[[Shūgi-bukuro|goshūgi]]''|ご祝儀||"gift money"}} in a special envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wedding Ceremonies in Japan|url=http://www.hiraganatimes.com/past-articles/society/1017/|accessdate=18 January 2016|work=Hiragana Times|issue=June 2010 Issue|date=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close family pay about twice as much as friends.&lt;ref name="nippon-weddings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Weddings in Japan|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/features/jg00016/|accessdate=27 March 2016|work=Nippon.com|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese Shinto ceremonies===
{{main article|Shinto wedding}}
Traditional {{Nihongo|Shinto ceremonies|神前式||'shinzen shiki'}}, which account for around one in six of Japanese weddings, are held in the main building of a [[Shinto shrine|shrine]]. A [[kannushi|priest]] performs a ritual purification for the couple, then announces their marriage to the {{Nihongo|''kami''|神||"gods" or "spirits"}} of the shrine and asks for their blessing. The bride and groom take three sips each from three cups of [[sake]], a ritual called {{Nihongo|''sansankudo''|三三九度}}.

Japanese brides, sometimes painted white as a sign of purity before the gods, wear a kimono which is either {{Nihongo|''shiromuku''|白無垢||"pure white dress"}}, {{Nihongo|''iro uchikake''|色打掛||"colorful outer robe"}}, or {{Nihongo|''kurobiki furisode''|黒引き振袖}}, the black and patterned kimono once worn at weddings of the nobility during the Edo period (1603–1868), with either an open white {{Nihongo|''watabōshi''|綿帽子||}} or a {{nihongo|''[[tsunokakushi]]''|角隠し}}. Grooms wear a black crested {{nihongo|''haori''|羽織}} jacket and loose, skirt-like {{nihongo|''hakama''|袴}} with a vertical stripe.&lt;ref name="nippon-weddings"/&gt;

===Christian chapel ceremonies===
[[File:St Mary's Church, Kyoto.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Christianity in Japan|Christian]] wedding in [[Kyoto]].]]
Christian wedding ceremonies have since the mid-1990s displaced the Shinto rite and continue to remain Japan’s wedding ceremony of choice.&lt;ref&gt;LeFebvre, J. (2015). Christian wedding ceremonies: “Nonreligiousness” in contemporary Japan. Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, 42(2), 185-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian wedding ceremonies have in the last thirty years moved from the sideline to the mainstream of Japanese society. The popularity of Christian wedding ceremonies represents new widespread acceptance, commercialization, and popularity of a religious ceremony. The postwar history of Christian wedding ceremonies is best understood in light of the efforts made by traditional Christian churches and the bridal industry to meet the religious needs and demands of Japan’s largely “nonreligious” (mushūkyō) constituency.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;LeFebvre, "Christian Wedding Ceremonies-- 'Nonreligiousness" in Contemporary Japan".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statistically speaking, the vast majority of contemporary Japanese self-identify as nonreligious. However, this self-identification is far from a wholesale rejection of religion, and often employed both to reject and affirm religious behaviors and identities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Most typically, nonreligious attitudes reject religious dispositions that are perceived as deviant, unhealthy, or foreign while simultaneously affirming religion’s importance. 

Nonreligious individuals tend to rely on religious professionals and vicariously entrust specialized acts of prayer and ritual to religious authorities when desirable and appropriate. Along with various Buddhist and Shinto rites, Christian wedding ceremonies are now one of the occasions where nonreligious Japanese rely on religious professionals. Nonreligious attitudes are responsible for significant transformations in Japanese Christianity and the bridal industry and the successful response of the Christian churches and the bridal industry to consumer demand has led to an explosion in Christian wedding ceremonies.

The story of contemporary Japanese Christianity is one of success and failure in the face of overwhelming “nonreligiousness.” The story of failure depicts the inability of Christian churches to acquire Japanese converts; both transplant and domestic Japanese churches face aging membership and dwindling baptism numbers. In 2006, Christians accounted for 1.2 percent of the Japanese population. Similarly, Christian religious organizations accounted for a mere 2.3 percent of Japan’s 182,468 religious juridical persons. This data, along with an aging church population, led researchers to suggest that a marginal Christian population is headed for rapid decline.

However, these statistics on Christian affiliation do not account for the unprecedented popularity of Christian wedding ceremonies or address how nonreligiousness has altered Japanese Christianity. The growing popularity of Christian weddings dates back to two events in the 1980s. The first was [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|the wedding]] of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] to [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and the second—among the Japanese—was the televised wedding of the [[Japanese idol]] [[Momoe Yamaguchi]]. By the mid-1990s, Christian weddings surpassed Shinto weddings and, since 1999, continue to be the wedding ceremony of choice among sixty to seventy percent of Tokyo couples with similar trends in popularity throughout the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Christian wedding ceremonies have attracted and sustained the interest of a majority of Japanese—the majority of whom are nonreligious. In short, the majority of Japanese are not only “Born Shinto, Die Buddhist,” but they also “Identify nonreligious, Wed Christian.”

Nonreligiousness has transformed the traditional Japanese Christian churches and the bridal industry. Although frequently dismissed as bridal-industry activity, Christian churches and personnel were essential in the rise of Christian weddings and their popularity. On 1 March 1975, the Vatican granted the Japanese Catholic Church special permission to conduct wedding ceremonies for non-affiliated, non-Christian couples. Nonreligious Japanese have access to this Catholic sacrament in a manner on par with baptized church members. These forms of access were instrumental in popularizing the Christian wedding in the late 1980s and the 1990s. The Catholic Church used in Kanda Masaki and Matsuda Seiko’s “wedding ceremony of sacred shining (seiki no kekkon)” became the setting of the 1991 Japanese television series Itsu ka, sarejio kyōkai de and one of the most popular venues in the early years of Christian weddings.

In addition to new policies and approaches, the nonreligious demand for Christian weddings has given rise to new religious institutions and powerful partnerships between commercial and religious groups—occasionally blurring the lines between the two. One successful example of religious and commercial partnership is the Christian Bridal Mission (kirisutokyō buraidaru senkyōdan), which was founded in 1980 and incorporated as a religious juridical person in 1986. From humble beginnings, this non-denominational Evangelical Protestant Church—the first Christian organization devoted exclusively to the production of weddings—grew to national proportions. Currently, the Christian Bridal Mission has over one thousand ministers—making it one of the largest Christian organizations in Japan.

Where the active majority of people are nonreligious, mechanisms for establishing a convincing reference to Christianity takes on a sensual character. Visual cues—minister’s race, architectural style, musical talent, etc.—have become the primary way not only to generate a connection to Christian tradition but to verify that a connection does exist.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The bridal industry relies on sensory experience in almost every conceivable manner with the result that venues of commercial institutions now play a crucial role in the success and continued popularity of Christian weddings as new Protestant churches.

Although the Japanese have unprecedented access to the Catholic Church, the majority of weddings in Japan follow the Protestant liturgy. As such the ceremony includes elements typical to a traditional Protestant wedding including hymns, benedictions, prayers, bible readings, an exchange of rings, wedding kiss, and vows before God. It is typical for a bride to enter with her father and then be "given away" to her husband—an exchange that usually involves bowing and shaking hands. In recent years, the custom of lowering the veil has also become popular. During the veil lowering the mother of the bride lowers the veil for her daughter before she continues down the "virgin road" with her father toward her husband. In the case of a non-Japanese wedding minister, the ceremony is commonly performed in a mix of Japanese and a western language (typically, English).

===Non-religious or civil ceremonies===
Non-religious or civil ceremonies often take place in a banquet hall, before or during the reception party, with a Master of Ceremonies officiating and guests seated around tables. Although these ceremonies often adopt Western elements, especially a [[wedding dress]] for the bride and a [[tuxedo]] for the groom, they forego any religious connotations.&lt;ref name="BBC-priest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Faking it as a priest in Japan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6067002.stm|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=BBC|date=2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some younger couples choose to abandon formality entirely for a "no host party" wedding, which emphasizes celebration rather than ceremony. The guests consist primarily of the couple's friends, who pay an attendance fee.&lt;ref&gt;Lebra, T, Sugiyama (1984). Japanese women: constraint and fulfillment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3970">'''Mortgage burning''' is a twentieth-century [[United States|American]] custom that is the ritual burning of a paid off [[mortgage]] document by homeowners. It is done as a celebratory event, and is sometimes accompanied by a party in which extended family and friends are invited.

==History==

Home mortgage burnings, and particularly home mortgage burning parties, are nearly unheard of in the present-day United States for a few reasons. American families are increasingly mobile, so it is now much less likely that a homeowner will be in a home long enough to make enough monthly payments to fully satisfy a mortgage. Also, starting in the late twentieth century and until the [[Late 2000s Recession|housing bubble]] burst, it was fairly common to get an over-leveraged mortgage, and possibly even an interest-only mortgage, that was intended to eventually be flipped to another mortgage by presumed increasing home value as opposed paying it off via a long series of payments. That, and the refinancing of homes to take advantage of fluctuating interest rates, often leads to refinancing and “resetting the clock” on a mortgage period, lengthening the time that one is subject to a mortgage beyond the period of the original mortgage taken upon purchase of the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106242731 |title=Mortgage-Burning Parties Almost Extinct |publisher=NPR  |date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/695204_Mortgage-burning-parties-still-happen.html |title=Mortgage-Burning Parties Still Happen |publisher=Lancaster Online  |date=2012-07-25 |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when a personal mortgage is paid off at the conclusion of payments, throwing a party to celebrate is now generally considered gauche since the traditional paying off of a mortgage is no longer a standard rite of passage. It is now seen as bragging about one’s secure financial condition.  Modern advice columnists and etiquette experts generally advise against having mortgage burning parties attended by anyone other than immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/10/AR2010091005903.html |title=Miss Manners: Modesty is the best party policy |publisher=Washington Post |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortgage burning parties are still held by [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] entities such as churches. In those cases, the attendees are generally those who helped to pay the mortgage off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tri-countybulletin.com/community/orange-county/2903-cor-church-mortgage-burning-party |title=COR Church Mortgage Burning Party |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The concept of a mortgage burning party was immortalized in a 1975 episode of ''[[All In The Family]]'', “Mike Makes His Move”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzYgrBELU5I |title=All In The Family: Mike Makes His Move |date=1975-03-08 |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortgage burnings were also the premise of a 1977 episode of ''[[Eight Is Enough]]'', "Mortgage Burnin' Blues", and a 1982 episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', "Settling Debts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/eight-is-enough-1977/episode-5-season-2/mortgage-burning-blues/201121 |title=Eight Is Enough Episodes on ABC |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharetv.org/shows/mash/episodes/287489 |title=M*A*S*H Episode Guide |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1571">The '''Pavlovo Posad shawl''' ({{lang-ru|Павловопосадский латок}}),  '''Pavlovsky shawl''' or '''Povlovo Posad scarf''' is a Russian clothing and handicraft. 
[[File:Pavlovo Posad shawl Павловопосадский платок.jpg|thumb|Pavlovo Posad shawl|alt=]]
In the beginning of the 19 century it became fashionable to wear woolen shawls in Russia. The first shawls were produced in the small town [[Pavlovsky Posad]] in the [[Moscow Oblast]] in the middle of 19th century. The basic tone of the woolen shawls is usually black while the composition of the motives is a mixture of large and small floral ornaments. Mostly roses are the motives on the scarfs. The shawls were often worn to traditional Russian folk costumes. 
The predominant color on the shawls has always been red, as this color means beautiful in Russian culture. Furthermore, Oriental and Turkish ornaments on the scarves had also been popular. The scarves are still enjoying a great popularity in Russia and it's surrounding countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artrusse.ca/Pavlovsky_Posad_en.htm|title=Pavlovsky Posad shawls|website=www.artrusse.ca|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46072753|title=Die Volkskunst der Sowjetunion|last=Tat'jana.|first=Razina,|date=1990|publisher=DuMont-Buchverl|others=Čerkasova, Natalija., Kancedikas, Aleksandr.|isbn=3770121961|location=Köln|oclc=46072753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Records of guidelines related to "people skills" have been found as early as the New Testament. Five examples of early human guidelines appear in the [[Bible]]. [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 4:8-9 advises: "Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaining."; and [[Solomon]]'s wisdom in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:1 includes: "A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.", along similar lines in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 16:21 includes: "The wise of heart is called perceptive, and pleasant speech increases persuasiveness."; [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] 5:14 dictates: "And we urge you, beloved, to discourage the idlers, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all of them."; [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:2 advises: " To speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone."; and in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:2 encourages: "Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the [[Golden Rule|law]] of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-NRSV-Bible/ "New Revised Standard Version"] Retrieved on 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[human relations|Human-relations]] studies emerged in the 1920s when companies became more interested in "[[soft skills]]" and interpersonal skills of employees.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In organizations, improving people skills became a specialized role of the [[corporate trainer]]. By the mid-1930s, [[Dale Carnegie]] popularized people skills in ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'' and ''[[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living]]'' worldwide.

In the 1960s, US schools introduced people-skills topics and methods—often as a way to promote better [[self-esteem]], communication and social interaction. These encompassed psychologist [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]]'s "Effectiveness Training" variations as well as many other training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Schaps, E.; Cohen, A.Y.; and Resnik, H.S.: [http://www.pire.org/detail.asp?detayl=y&amp;core=11989 "Balancing Head and Heart"] PIRE.

The first documented use of the phrase "people skills" was around 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=People+skills&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CPeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bpeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPeople%20Skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPEOPLE%20SKILLS%3B%2Cc0 Ngram for people skills]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business impact ==
The SCANS report states that business, labor and government authorities agree that having a wide range of people skills are necessary for 20th-century work success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr.doleta.gov/SCANS/ "Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS)"] US Dept. of Labor. Retrieved on 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt; Skills like customer service, building effective relationships, and teamwork are among the abilities most requested by employers in job postings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/baseline-skills/ "The Human Factor: The Hard Time Employers Have Finding Soft Skills,"] Burning Glass Technologies, November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Lack of these skills is considered a serious psychological handicap. Constructive leadership based companies engage in helping individuals to grow, and through that growth employees take more responsibility and discharge it effectively. This in-turn will enhance the basic attitude of the individual; and that will reflect the general level of performance in workplace.  Studies indicate that many people who have difficulty in obtaining or holding a job possess the needed technical competence but lack interpersonal competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/human-relations|title=Human Relations facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Human Relations|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence A. Appley]] of American Management Association, reflected on these trainings as a responsibility to "increase the knowledge, sharpen and add to the skills, improve the habits, and change the attitudes of many of those for whose development we are responsible."&lt;ref&gt;Harwood F Merrill &amp; Elizabeth Marting (1952). Developing Executive Skills, American Management Association, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of people skills among upper echelons&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palgraveconnect.com/esm/doifinder/10.1057/9781137294678.0713&lt;/ref&gt; (top management) can result in [[bullying]] and/or [[harassment]], which is not uncommon in the modern workplace due to changing values. The causes that are most identified with the situation are lack of necessary motivation, communication, influencing skills and [[empathy gap]] among upper echelons (Gilbert and Thompson, 2002). Training company staff in people skills and interpersonal skills increases the morale and dignity at work (Best, 2010). Employers that do not take steps to prevent harassment can face major costs in decreased productivity, low morale, increased absenteeism and health care costs, and potential legal expenses.

'''''Pitar (Hysteroconcha) dione''''', or the '''elegant Venus clam''', formerly known as '''''Venus dione''''', is a species of [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Veneridae]], the Venus clams. The shell is whitish pink, with a row of long curved spines on each valve.

The species was named in ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist [[Linnaeus]]. Both there and in his 1771 ''Fundamenta Testaceologiae'', he described the shell in "disquieting[ly]"&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt; sexual terms.

==Etymology==
The species was named in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist [[Linnaeus]] as ''Venus dione'', [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] being the name of the Roman goddess of love, and especially of sex.&lt;ref name=Grout&gt;{{cite web| url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/dacosta.html | title=Da Costa and the Venus dione: The Obscenity of Shell Description | accessdate=19 May 2015}} From the ''Encyclopædia Romana'' by James Grout.&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific epithet ''dione'' is the name of [[Dione (mythology)|the mother of Venus]] in Roman mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bronze statuette of Venus or her mother, Dione |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/b/bronze_of_venus_or_dione.aspx |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later generic name ''Hysteroconcha'' is from Greek ''hyster'', [[womb]], and Latin ''concha'', shell.

==In human culture: the Venus shell==
[[File:Venus dione Linnaeus.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Linnaeus's drawing of ''Venus dione'' in his ''Fundamenta Testaceologiae'', 1771, labelled with overtly sexual descriptors]]
In his 1758 ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', and then in his 1771 ''Fundamenta Testaceologiae'', Linnaeus used a series of "disquieting[ly]"&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt; sexual terms to describe the shell: ''[[vulva]]'', ''[[anus]]'', ''nates'' ([[buttocks]]), ''[[pubis (bone)|pubis]]'', ''[[mons veneris]]'', ''[[labia]]'', ''[[hymen]]''.&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Linnaeus |title=Systema Naturae |date=1758 |pages=684–685 |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Linnaeus |title=Systema Naturae |date=1767 |pages=1128–1129 |edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] called Linnaeus's description "one of the most remarkable paragraphs in the history of systematics".&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=The Anatomy Lesson: The Teachings of Naturalist Mendes da Costa, a Sephardic Jew in King George's Court |journal=Natural History |date=1995 |volume=104 |issue=12 |pages=10–15, 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some later naturalists found the terms used by Linnaeus uncomfortable; an 1803 review commented that "a few of these terms however strongly they may be warranted by the similitudes and analogies which they express, ... are not altogether reconcilable with the delicacy proper to be observed in ordinary discourse",&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt; while the 1824 ''Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica'' criticised Linnaeus for "indulg[ing] in obscene allusions."&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt;

==Description==
The shells of ''Pitar dione'' can reach a length of about {{convert|72|mm}}.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt; The color of the whole shell is very pale or whitish pink, with whitish interior. The anterior end is broadly rounded, while the posterior is lightly sloping.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt; The surface of each valve is characterized by several sharpened concentric and prominent ribs.&lt;ref&gt;Baron Georges Cuvier, Edward Griffith, and Edward Pidgeon - The Mollusca and Radiata (1834) - The Naturalist's Miscellany: or Coloured Figures of Natural Objects&lt;/ref&gt; This rare species is unusual in that it has a double series of long, curved spines on the posterior slope of each valve. A closely related species from the Eastern Pacific is ''[[Pitar lupanaria]]''.

'''Quebec Sign Language''', known in French as '''Langue des signes québécoise''' or '''Langue des signes du Québec''' ('''LSQ'''), is the predominant [[sign language]] of [[deaf communities]] used in francophone Canada, primarily in [[Quebec]]. Although named Quebec sign, LSQ can be found within communities in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] as well as certain other regions across Canada. Being a member of the [[French Sign Language family]], it is most closely related to [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), being a result of mixing between [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and LSF. As LSQ can be found near and within francophone communities, there is a high level of borrowing of words and phrases from [[French language|French]], but it is far from creating a [[creole language]]. However, alongside LSQ, [[signed French]] and Pidgin LSQ French exist, where both mix LSQ and French more heavily to varying degrees.

LSQ was developed around 1850&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribune : La langue des signes québécoise|url=http://anciennes.college.marcelline.qc.ca/tribune_sept07.html|language=French|first=Agathe|last=Frenette|date=1 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311221104/http://anciennes.college.marcelline.qc.ca/tribune_sept07.html|archivedate=11 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by certain religious communities to help teach children and adolescents in Quebec from a situation of [[language contact]]. Since then, after a period of forced oralism, LSQ has become a strong language amongst Deaf communities within Quebec and across Canada. However, due to the [[Gloss (annotation)#Glossing sign languages|glossing]] of LSQ in French and a lack of curriculum within hearing primary and secondary education, there still exist large misconceptions amongst hearing communities about the nature of LSQ and sign languages as a whole, which negatively impacts policy making on a larger scale.

==History==
In the mid-1800s, Catholic priests took the existing LSF and ASL and combined the two to promote education of deaf children and adolescents. Several decades later, under the influence of Western thought, oralism became the primary mode of instruction in Quebec and the rest of North America. There, students were subjected to environments that discouraged and often outright banned LSQ use, instead promoting the use of whatever residual hearing the student had if any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Schools|url=https://my.gallaudet.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/Deaf%20Eyes%20Exhibit/Language-06oralschool.htm|author=Gallaudet University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach had varying effects where [[audism]] lead to lower literacy rates as well as lower rates of language acquisition seen in children sent to residential schools at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential Schools for the Deaf|url=http://www.deaflinx.com/DeafEd/OptionsGuide/LearningEnvironments.html|author=Jinx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educational Abuse in Residential Schools for the Deaf|url=http://www.reach.ca/shared_future/eng/lucas.htm|author=Reach Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 1960s, several schools for the Deaf were established in [[Montreal]] in response to the failed audistic education: [[Montreal Institute for the Deaf and Mute|Institution des Sourds de Montréal]], Institution des Sourdes-Muettes, Institut des Sourds de Charlesbourg, none of which exist any longer. However, the [[MacKay School for the Deaf]] has existed since 1869 serving the anglophone and ASL-speaking communities in Montreal. Since the 1960s, there has been a growing population of LSQ speakers in Quebec and spreading across Canada. Due to the close nature of French and LSQ, Deaf members of francophone communities tend to learn LSQ even though ASL tends to be the majority language around those communities.&lt;ref name=QCdoc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ophq.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/centre_documentaire/Etudes__analyses_et_rapports/RAP_reconnaissance_langues_signes.pdf|title=La reconnaissance officielle des langues des signes : état de la situation dans le monde et ses implications|language=French|author=Office des personnes handicapées du Québec|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario has passed legislation making it the only region in Canada that recognizes LSQ in any capacity, noting that "The Government of Ontario shall ensure that [ASL, LSQ and [[Plains Sign Talk|First Nations Sign Language]]] may be used in the courts, in education and in the Legislative Assembly." &lt;ref name=Ontario/&gt;

There have been calls to modify Quebec's [[Charter of the French Language]] to include provisions for LSQ. However, all bills have been rejected for one reason or another leaving the status of LSQ up in the air for Quebec and the rest of Canada.

==Official status==
LSQ is recognized as an official language in Ontario only in domains of education, legislation and judicial activities after the passing of Bill 213 within the Ontario Legislative Assembly. Across the rest of Canada, there is no protection or oversight for the language as neither federal, provincial nor territorial governments recognize LSQ as a language other than Ontario.

In Quebec in 2002 following the passing of Bill 104, recommendations presented to [[Estates-General on the Situation and Future of the French Language in Quebec|Commission of the Estates-General]] were rejected. In 2013, the Québec Cultural Society for the Deaf presented additional recommendations during discussions on the update of Bill 14 which would ultimately modify the Charter of the French Language. Three recommendations were proposed modifying the Charter such that LSQ is recognized along the same lines as done for the language and culture of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American Aboriginal Peoples]] and the [[Inuit]] of Quebec. The first was noting that LSQ is the primary language of communication for Deaf Quebecois, the second that deaf youths be taught bilingually (French/LSQ) in all cadres of education and the third that French be rendered accessible to all d/Deaf people within the province. Bill 14 was never voted on by the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] due to the minority party being unable to amass enough support from other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-14-40-1.html|title=Projet de loi n°14 : Loi modifiant la Charte de la langue française, la Charte des droits et libertés de la personne et d’autres dispositions législatives|author=Assemblée Nationale du Québec|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
The population of any sign-language-speaking community is difficult to ascertain due to a variety of factors, namely imprecise census data and lack of connection with the communities themselves. The same is true in Canada with LSQ speakers where census data through StatsCan captures basic information that renders comprehension of the situation difficult as the numbers do not accurately portray the language population. StatsCan reports as of 2011 just 455 speakers of LSQ, however it is estimated that 2.6% (or 5,030 people) of Quebec’s population possessed hearing deficiency. That is not to say that every person with hearing loss signs LSQ, but it also misses the many people who use LSQ daily who are also hearing: [[Child of Deaf Adult|Children of Deaf Adult]]s, interpreters, etc.

==Geographic distribution==
LSQ is used primarily within Quebec. Outside, the largest communities of LSQ users is in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Toronto]] with smaller notable communities in parts of New Brunswick. Additionally, LSQ can be found in francophone communities across the country, but no real data has been collected on hard numbers.

In Montreal, LSQ is displaced in certain areas by ASL where it co-habitates. Generally, ASL can be found in anglophone communities, however it is not uncommon to meet people bilingual in ASL and LSQ in much the same way one would meet a bilingual English-French person. While ASL is growing within Montreal, LSQ is still a strong language in the city, supported by speakers from across the province.

==Prevalence==
The first target of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] was to decrease the extent of extreme poverty by one-half by the year 2015, which could not be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations.

==Contributing factors==

===Lack of infrastructure===
Rural poverty is often a product of poor [[infrastructure]] that hinders [[Economic development|development]] and [[Economic mobility|mobility]]. Rural areas tend to lack sufficient roads that would increase access to agricultural inputs and [[markets]]. Without roads, the rural poor are cut off from technological development and emerging markets in more urban areas. Poor infrastructure hinders [[communication]], resulting in social isolation among the rural poor, many of whom have limited access to [[media (communication)|media]] and news outlets. Such isolation hinders integration with urban society and established markets, which could result in greater development and economic security. Moreover, poor or nonexistent irrigation systems threaten agricultural yields because of uncertainty in the supply of water for crop production. Many poor rural areas lack any irrigation to store or pump water, resulting in fewer crops, fewer days of employment and less productivity. Both a lack of roads and insufficient irrigation systems result in greater [[Work Intensity]] in many rural communities.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute|ODI]] conducted a literature review to assess the relationship between all types of roads and both their security impacts and the effects of road building on access to for example health and education (service delivery) particularly in fragile, sparsely populated and/or ill-served [[rural areas]] in [[developing countries]].
	
They found no direct evidence relating to the security impact of road [[infrastructure]], and that only theoretical linkages of infrastructure development are discussed in studies. There are various direct and indirect channels through which transport infrastructure may affect security and peace building. They agree that [[infrastructure]] programmes can potentially play three roles in a fragile context: as an engine of economic recovery and improved service provision, as part of a process of strengthening institutions, and in stabilisation and peace-building.

They claim the state of evidence regarding these causal links is weak but some aspects of infrastructure development, including but not exclusive to road construction, has been shown to be effective in [[fragile state|fragile country]] contexts. Quick Impact has not yet proven to be effective in enhancing peace building and security in [[fragile state|Fragile and Conflict Affected States]].

Their literature search presented some evidence of road development resulting in employment sometimes for the most vulnerable and/or poor groups. They found  case studies show road development programmes can produce short-term employment opportunities in fragile and conflict affected regions particularly applying to programmes where rural road development is carried out through community-driven development or with special emphasis on inclusion through participatory methods. Evidence is mostly limited to number of hours of employment generated or individuals employed and include little rigorous [[impact evaluation]].

There was also some evidence that rural road construction reduced isolation for minority groups and provided more opportunities for inclusion in wider economic activity. However, this evidence did not relate directly to reducing conflict or improving security. [[Poverty]] and isolation literature defines this as access to inputs and output markets, access to education and health services, and access to labour opportunities through which road access contributes to reduced poverty.

Mostly qualitative evidence found suggests that rural road construction or maintenance has a positive impact on [[public service]] delivery. In general rural road development leads to improved access of both users and suppliers. This occurs due to a reduction in commuting time, as well transport costs but these benefits tend to accrue disproportionately to the influential and well-educated. [[Rural communities]] tend to ascribe great importance to road development and perceive it to improve access to markets, health and education facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Farhat, M. Hayes, J. January 2013, Impact of roads on security and service delivery, EPS-PEAKS (Economic and Private Sector - Professional Evidence and Applied Knowledge Services) http://partnerplatform.org/?c5380566&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic barriers===
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
Major geographic barriers like remote and/or small islands and archipelagoes in a large ocean, low population, very rugged and/or especially high elevation mountainous terrain such as the Himalayas and Andes present formidable barriers to development even beyond the typical rural poverty situation.

===Insufficient access to markets===
A lack of access to [[markets]] - whether due to poor infrastructure or [[productivity]], limited education, or insufficient information - prevents access to both labor and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. In many rural societies, there are few job opportunities outside of agriculture, often resulting in food and income insecurity due to the precarious nature of farming. Rural workers are largely concentrated in jobs such as owners-cultivators, tenant farmers, [[sharecroppers]], informal care workers, agricultural day-laborers, and livestock herders. Without access to other labor markets, rural workers continue to work for extremely low wages in agricultural jobs that tend to have seasonal fluctuations and thus little income security. In addition to labor, the rural poor often lack access to capital markets and financial institutions, hindering their ability to establish savings and obtain credit that could be used to purchase working capital or increase their supply of raw materials. When coupled with scarce job opportunities, poor access to credit and capital perpetuates rural poverty.&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt;

===Lack of non-motorised load-carrying wheeled vehicles (handcarts and wheelbarrows)===
Numerous international development organisations have studied, reported, recommended and agreed that lack of mobility impedes human progress and development. Yet there is very little evidence of anyone attempting to actually address and alleviate the problem by introducing handcarts and wheelbarrows into remote and rural areas where they would be most beneficial.

====Rural versus Urban Poverty--United States====
In the [[United States]], where rural poverty rates are higher and more persistent than in urban areas, rural workers are disadvantaged by lower wages and less access to better paying labor markets.&lt;ref name=Mosely /&gt; As a result, underemployment and informal work are more prevalent in rural areas, and where [[informal sector|formal employment]] is found, it acts as less of a buffer against poverty.&lt;ref name=Mosely /&gt; As a result, rural poverty in the U.S. is more persistent than urban poverty – 95 percent of persistent poverty counties in the U.S. are rural, while only 2 percent of persistent poverty counties are urban.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

===Opening up of economies to international trade===
Some macro-level economic changes have been associated with an increase in spatial inequalities.&lt;ref name=Kanbur /&gt; There have been numerous studies showing a link between more open trade, accompanied by other [[neoliberal]] policies, and higher incidences of rural poverty and spatial inequalities&lt;ref name=KanburR&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Xiaobo | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | title = Fifty years of regional inequality in China: a journey through central planning, reform, and openness | journal = Review of Development Economics | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–106 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9361.2005.00265.x | date = February 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9361.2005.00265.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-last1 = Rodriguez-Pose | author-first1 = Andres | author-last2 = Sanchez-Reaza | author-first2 = Javier | contribution = Economic polarization through trade: trade liberalization and regional inequality in Mexico | editor-last1 = Kanbur | editor-first1 = Ravi | editor-last2 = Venables | editor-first2 = Anthony J. | editor-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | editor-link2 = Anthony Venables | title = Spatial inequality and development | pages = 237–259 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780199278633 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://oecd.academia.edu/JavierSanchezReaza/Papers/1052652/Economic_polarization_through_trade Online version.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-last1 = te Velde | author-first1 = Dirk Willem | author-last2 = Morrissey | author-first2 = Oliver | contribution = Spatial inequality for manufacturing wages in five African countries | editor-last1 = Kanbur | editor-first1 = Ravi | editor-last2 = Venables | editor-first2 = Anthony J. | editor-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | editor-link2 = Anthony Venables | title = Spatial inequality and development | pages = 292–310 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780199278633 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/discussion-papers/2003/en_GB/dp2003-066/ Online version.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jensen, Henning Tarp 2005. pp 69-86"&gt;Jensen, Henning Tarp, and Finn Tarp. 2005.

Volume 9, Number 1, February, pp 69-86.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[China]], for example, greater trade openness provides at least partial explanation for more pronounced rural-urban disparities,&lt;ref name=KanburR /&gt; and in [[Vietnam]], [[trade liberalization]] has resulted in higher poverty rates in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Jensen, Henning Tarp 2005. pp 69-86"/&gt; Both of these nations demonstrate that despite greater openness and growth, spatial inequalities do not necessarily decrease accordingly with overall economic growth. Moreover, the promotion of export-oriented agriculture has been linked to decreased food security for rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;Wagao, J.

===Education and social service inadequacies===
In many rural societies, a lack of access to [[education]] and limited opportunities to increase and improve one’s skillset inhibit [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt; Low levels of education and few skills result in much of the rural poor working as subsistence farmers or in insecure, informal employment, perpetuating the state of rural poverty. Inadequate education regarding health and nutritional needs often results in under-nutrition or [[malnutrition]] among the rural poor. Social isolation due to inadequate roads and poor access to information makes acquiring [[health care]] (and affording it) particularly difficult for the rural poor, resulting in worse health and higher rates of [[infant mortality]]. There have been noted disparities in both Asia and Africa between rural and urban areas in terms of the allocation of public education and health services.&lt;ref name=Otuska /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sahn&gt;Sahn, D., and D. Stifel. 2003. [http://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v12y2003i4p564-597.html “Urban–Rural Inequality in Living Standards in Africa.”] Journal of African Economies 12(1):564–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case study: Africa====
A study of 24 [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] countries found that “standards of living in rural areas almost universally lag behind urban areas.” &lt;ref name=Sahn /&gt; In terms of education, school enrollments and the ratio of girl-to-boy enrollments is much lower in rural areas than in urban areas. A similar trend is found in access to neonatal care, as those living in rural areas had far less access to care than their urban counterparts. There are also far more malnourished children in rural areas of Africa than in urban areas. In [[Zimbabwe]], for example, more than twice the share of children are malnourished in rural areas (34 percent rate of malnourishment) than in urban areas (15 percent rate of malnourishment). Inequality between urban and rural areas, and where rural poverty is most prevalent, is in countries where the adult population has the lowest amount of education. This was found in the Sahelian countries of [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]] and [[Niger]] where regional inequality is 33 percent, 19.4 percent, and 21.3 percent, respectively.  In each of these countries, more than 74 percent of the adults have no education. Overall, in much of Africa, those living in rural areas experience more poverty and less access to health care and education.&lt;ref name=Sahn /&gt;

==Women and rural poverty==
Rural women are particularly disadvantaged, both as poor and as women.&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt; Women in both rural and urban areas face a higher risk of poverty and more limited economic opportunities than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Haynie, Dana L. and Gorman,  Bridget K. 1999. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4121230 “A Gendered Context of Opportunity: Determinants of Poverty across Urban and Rural Labor Markets”] The Sociological Quarterly , Vol. 40, No. 2, pp. 177-197.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of rural women living in extreme poverty rose by about 50 percent over the past twenty years.&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt; Women in rural poverty live under the same harsh conditions as their male counterparts, but experience additional cultural and policy biases which undervalue their work in both the informal, and if accessible, formal labor markets.&lt;ref name=WorldSurvey&gt;World Survey. 2009.  “Access to Land, Housing and Other Productive Resources.” Chapter 3, pp. 27–40, and Chapter 4, pp. 41-46&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 World Survey states that “women play an active role in agriculture and rural livelihoods as unpaid family labour, independent farmers and wage labour, often without access to land, credit and other productive assets.” &lt;ref name=WorldSurvey /&gt; Women’s contribution to the rural economy is generally underestimated, as women perform a disproportionate amount of [[care work]], work that often goes unrecognized because it is not seen as economically productive.&lt;ref name=UNICEF&gt;UNICEF. 2007. “Equality in Employment,” in The State of the World’s Children. New York: United Nations Children’s Fund. Chapter 3, pp. 37–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Though in some nations, cultural and societal norms prevent women from working outside the home, in other countries, especially in rural communities in Africa, women work as major food producers, improving household food and income security.&lt;ref name=WorldSurvey /&gt;&lt;ref name=UNICEF /&gt; Families in extreme poverty are even more dependent on women’s work both inside and outside the home, resulting in longer days and more intense work for women &lt;ref name=UNICEF /&gt; The [[feminization of poverty]] is a concept that is applicable in both urban and rural settings.

==Policies to combat rural poverty==

===Land reform===
Access to [[land (economics)|land]] can alleviate rural poverty by providing households a productive and relatively reliable way to make an income.&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt; The rural poor often have less access to land, which contributes to their poverty. The rural poor’s access to land can be improved by redistributing land from large farms above a certain size, government legislation that challenges some traditional land systems that keep land concentrated in the hands of a few, and settlement schemes which involves providing poor rural families parcels of newly developed or government owned land. Achieving legislative reform and implementing redistributive policies, however, is a difficult task in many countries because land ownership is a sensitive cultural and political issue. Yet in China, for example, land redistribution policies have found some success and are associated with a reduction in rural poverty and increased agricultural growth.&lt;ref name=Dercon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravallion /&gt;

====Women and land reform====
The development of legal measures to improve women’s access to land is linked with achieving greater gender parity.&lt;ref name=WorldSurvey /&gt; This requires women to have the legal right to own land, as well as designating women as individual or joint owners of land parcels redistributed during reform. It also involves allowing women to have separate tenancy rights and granting women the right to claim an equal share of family land and resources upon [[divorce]], abandonment, [[widowhood]], and for [[inheritance]] purposes.&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt; A lack of access to land and property is linked to [[poverty]], [[Human migration|migration]], [[violence]], and [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name=WorldSurvey /&gt; Increasing a woman’s access to land not only benefits herself, but also benefits her family and community both in terms of increased productivity and improved welfare for her children.&lt;ref name=UNICEF /&gt; Beyond just legislative reform, for laws to actually guarantee women the right to land and equal inheritance, they need to be enforced; in numerous countries, despite women achieving equal land rights, long-standing social and cultural norms continue to bias policy implementation.&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldSurvey /&gt;

====Case study: Bangladesh====
Improved infrastructure in [[Bangladesh]] increased agricultural production by 32 percent through its effect on prices and access to inputs and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Raisuddin, Ahmed and Mahabub, Hossain. 1990. [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/developmental-impact-rural-infrastructure-bangladesh Developmental Impact of Rural Infrastructure in Bangladesh.] BIDS Research Report 83. Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute in collaboration with the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; Improving roads and transportation systems also resulted in a 33 percent increase in the household income of the poor through the ability to diversify production, as well as an increase in savings and investment and better access to financial credit. Moreover, because of increased mobility among rural households, a rise in access to social services was noted, as well as an increase in overall health.

===Technology===
The development of appropriate [[technology]] can raise a farm’s [[productivity]].&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt; Successful technological developments that aid the rural poor are achieved through bottom-up policies that involve technological [[innovations]] that require few external inputs and little monetary investment. The most effective innovations are based on the active participation of small farmers, who are involved in both defining the problems and implementing and evaluating solutions. Smallholder technological developments have focused on processes such as nutrient recycling, integrated pest management, integration of crop agriculture and livestock, use of inland and marine water sources, soil conservation, and use of genetic engineering and biotechnology to reduce fertilizer requirements.

===Access to credit===
Providing access to [[credit (finance)|credit]] and financial services provides an entry point to improve rural productivity as well as stimulating small-scale trading and manufacturing.&lt;ref name=Janvry /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt; With credit, rural farmers are able to purchase capital that increases their productivity and income. Increased credit helps expand markets to rural areas, thus promoting rural development. The ability to acquire credit also combats systems of bonded or exploitative labor by encouraging self-employment. Credit policy is most effective when provided in conjunction with other services such as technology and marketing training.

===Diversification===
[[Agricultural diversification]] can provide rural families with higher [[income]] and greater [[food security]].&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt; Diversification, or a reallocation of some of a farm’s productive resources, reduces farming risk, especially risk related to unpredictable or extreme weather that may be due to climate change. Policies related to diversification have also focused on crop rotation to increase productivity, as well as improving the production of traditional food crops such as cassava, cowpeas, plantains, and bananas rather than promoting the growth of more precarious cash crops. These crops tend to be at the core of farming systems among the rural poor and are generally more drought resistant and can survive under poor soil conditions. Improving the productivity and marketing of these crops promotes food and income security among rural households.&lt;ref name=Jazairy /&gt;

==Rural poverty in Canada==

===Access to Care===

====Nursing Government====

Nurses have been [[self governing]] within the province of Ontario since 1963.&lt;ref name="CNO, 2012"&gt;CNO, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The College of Nurses (CNO) assure that all nurses within the province are registered through the CNO and that all nurses meet the requirements established by them. Requirements are based on knowledge and expertise of practice and that all nurses work within their [[scope of practice]].&lt;ref name="CNO, 2012"/&gt; [[Self governing]] occurs when the body of professionals are governed by members of its own profession.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Nurses Association, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Nurses in Ontario have the responsibility to work according to [[professional standards]] and Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name="CNA, 2007"&gt;CNA, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;   Nurses can contribute to the making of regulations and standards by providing knowledge from [[evidence based practice]], as well as theoretical knowledge to help ensure best practice when providing quality care.&lt;ref name="CNA, 2007"/&gt;  Regulatory bodies are responsible for ensuring that all who practice nursing are competent and continue to build on their skills through continuity of education and skill development.&lt;ref name="CNA, 2007"/&gt;  “Regulatory bodies develop and maintain standards of nursing practice that specify the level of performance expected of registered nurses to provide safe, competent and ethical care".&lt;ref&gt;CNA, 2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Nursing Practice standards are put in place to provide the public the same quality of care despite location.  The CNO is responsible for providing quality care to the public including making healthcare accessible.

====Barriers to Accessing Health Care====

For those living in rural Canada, they may face various challenges when trying to access health care.  Difficulties which rural areas experience when accessing health care include long distances between health services, lack of transportation, increase amount of elderly, fewer [[health care providers]], and limited awareness of resources available.&lt;ref name="Crosato &amp; Leipert, 2006"&gt;Crosato &amp; Leipert, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  To receive Federal funding from the government, the [[Canada Health Act]] acknowledges that five principles must be met, these include universality, [[accessibility]], comprehensiveness, [[portability (social security)|portability]], and [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Rosenberg, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  For those living in rural communities, these five principles are not always met.  With 90% of Canada identified as geographically rural, and approximately a quarter of the population are dwelling within rural areas with fewer than 10,000 people, this is a concern when identify health barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Crosato &amp; Leipert&lt;/ref&gt;

	 Health care is considered accessible when within a 30-60 minute drive in rural settings, and emergency vehicles are considered accessible when there is less than a thirty-minute drive.&lt;ref&gt;Glazier, Gozdyra, Yeritsyan, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This is a concern in emergency situations as an individual has a long wait time before being provided medical attention.  Transportation is a significant factor that is a barrier to accessing health care.  In rural areas an individual may have to travel great distances to seek medical attention, road quality may be very poor, weather conditions effecting driving, and rural areas seldom have access to public transportation.&lt;ref name="Arcury, T. A. 2005"&gt;Arcury, T. A., Preisser, J. S., Gesler, W. M., &amp; Powers, J. M. (2005). Access to transportation and health care utilization in a rural region. The Journal of Rural Health, 21(1), 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  The elderly have the greatest need for transportation services, a challenge to this is services is they may have to be booked a week in advance.&lt;ref name="Arcury, T. A. 2005"/&gt;  Also, with the baby boom generation, there will be an increasing number of elderly needing access to health care.  A large percentage of people over 65 have a number of [[comorbidities]], and need regular visits to a family doctor, the cost of regular transportation to a healthcare provider can be substantial.  For many living in rural poverty, financial difficulties impede a person from being able to own a vehicle.&lt;ref name="Halseth &amp; Ryser, 2010"&gt;Halseth &amp; Ryser, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The need for transportation to health care will only decrease when there is greater availability to health care programs, this involves bringing more health care providers to rural areas.&lt;ref name="Arcury, T. A. 2005"/&gt;

Other factors affecting rural poverty and accessing health care are lower socioeconomic status. Although the [[Canada Health Act]] provides everyone with access to health care without financial obligation, people of lower [[socioeconomic status]] typically had lower education level and were less likely to seek medical advice from a [[health care professional]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Wilson, Rosenberg, Bell, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Other health risks associated with low income and low education are an increase in high risk behaviors leading to poor health including smoking, obesity, and substance abuse specifically alcohol.&lt;ref name="Cutler &amp; Llera-Muney, 2009"&gt;Cutler &amp; Llera-Muney, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  People of higher income have means to pay for resources which could improve health, such as weight loss programs, gym memberships, [[smoking cessation]] programs, rehabilitation facilities where as people of lesser income are unable to pay for privately owned health enhancing programs.&lt;ref name="Cutler &amp; Llera-Muney, 2009"/&gt;  The low income families continue with the high risk behaviour despite limited finances this includes smoking and the price of cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Cutler &amp; Llera-Muney, 2009"/&gt;  People of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to look long term at their health compared to higher income families who would be more likely to contribute to program to benefit their health.&lt;ref name="Cutler &amp; Llera-Muney, 2009"/&gt;  Those of higher socioeconomic status are more likely to think of long term health and take preventative measures to promote good health.&lt;ref name="Cutler &amp; Llera-Muney, 2009"/&gt;

====Resource Accessibility====

Rural areas struggle with being able to provide resources to people within their community to help reduce the challenges of social poverty.  Many living within poverty need assistance from food shelters, homeless shelters, drug and alcohol abuse programs, counseling programs, and women’s shelters.&lt;ref name="Halseth &amp; Ryser, 2010"/&gt;  Many of these programs in rural communities are organized by volunteers which may have little or no training, and the buildings which the programs are run from may be lacking in suitable infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Halseth &amp; Ryser, 2010"/&gt;  There may be limited funding available to these programs which effects staffing and resources which can be provided to those seeking assistance.   Individuals at risk for living in poverty are those with [[mental health]] issues, [[disabilities]], single mothers, individuals suffering from [[addiction]], and immigrants unable to speak English.&lt;ref name="Halseth &amp; Ryser, 2010"/&gt;  This is challenging as resources established to support disadvantaged groups are closing as a result of little funding and inability to effectively support these groups. The individuals seeking the assistance are left to cope on their own.  Community donations and volunteers play a large role in community support remaining open to the public in rural setting.

====Physician Accessibility====

The Canadian public feel that accessing health care is perceived as poor, people wait longer periods of time to see physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp;Rosenberg, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There are increasing number of health practices being privatized which decreases the accessibility for those living in rural poverty.  There a few physicians available to support this population.  With around 20% of Canadians residing in rural Canada, only 8% of the physicians practice within this area.&lt;ref name="Crosato &amp; Leipert, 2006"/&gt;   Lacking in rural areas is the number of health specialists accessible to Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Jennissen, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  An average of 4 million Canadians go without a family physician.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Crooks, &amp; Goldsmith, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a high physician turnover rate in rural areas due to increased workload, geographic and [[social isolation]].&lt;ref name="Randall et al., 2012"&gt;Randall et al., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be challenging as many individuals who seek specialized care need to have a referral from a family physician.&lt;ref name="Randall et al., 2012"/&gt;   When there is a high physician turnover rate then individuals are having to develop a trusting relationship and provide previous medical history to a new family physician.  This beings challenges as some relationships take years to develop trust with a family physician, and a bad experience with one can bring challenges when having to transfer to a new physician.

“Rural communities are understood as places with small populations, limited material and financial resources, and a heightened vulnerability to health service and health human resources shortages as a consequence of their distance from urban centres”.&lt;ref&gt;Randall et al., 2012, pg.2&lt;/ref&gt;  With rural areas having a high population of elderly an increasing number of individuals living with one or more chronic illness, the need for rural area physicians and specialists are rising.&lt;ref name="Randall et al., 2012"/&gt;   Chronically ill patients account for over half of family physicians visits.&lt;ref name="Randall et al., 2012"/&gt;  In Canada, individuals who need to see a specialist wait an average of four weeks to three months.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Wilson, Rosenber &amp; Bell, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  This increases health risk for those living in rural poverty, as there is a greater difficulty accessing health care. There is an increase in number of those living with chronic illness, greater elder population, and fewer health care professionals available in rural communities.&lt;ref name="Randall et al., 2012"/&gt;  For those living in rural poverty, the Canada Health Act ensures that health care is provided at no financial expense including hospital care, surgical procedures, dental surgeries, primary care doctors, and specialists are covered through provincial health insurance plans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Harrington, Wilson, Rosenberg, &amp; Bell, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  This enables individuals to receive care despite being unable to pay for care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Vulnerable Populations===

[[Poverty]] among [[rural]] Canadians is a continuing issue within [[Canada]]. Although [[rural]] living can be challenging for any population, there are several groups in which are considered more vulnerable to [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p[a].58&lt;/ref&gt;  Several contributing factors such as [[employment]], [[education]], [[geographical location]], [[cost of living]] and [[low income]] are definite issues among these specific groups.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.58"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;  With that being said, many of these populations are finding themselves struggling to keep above the [[poverty]] line.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.58"/&gt;

====Single Parent Families====

Lone families or single parent families are incredibly susceptible to [[poverty in Canada]], especially those who reside in rural areas. Although single male parent families are at risk, families with  a woman as the only parent are at a much greater risk.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.17"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;  Women who are raising their families on their own are at a huge risk for [[poverty]] among Canada.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.23"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Women in [[rural Canada]] are at disadvantage for employment opportunities due to the lack of jobs within the [[community]]. Formal education is also a challenge for rural women because of the general low income status and high cost of education. Without formal education, rural women often cannot find good paying jobs that provide stability and benefits to support their families. In order to find affordable housing for a single parent income, one must often look outside of town to more remote areas. Although housing is cheaper, the employment opportunities decrease; causing women to look for employment closer to town or within the community.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.21"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; By having to travel to work, vehicle costs or alternative transportation costs are increased. Wages in [[rural Canada]] are lower than those in [[urban areas]], which contributes to the overall lower income and poor income status among these families. For women supporting a family, the poor wages, low employment rate, high [[cost of living]] and lack of [[financial support]] are the risk factors in which increase the incidence of [[poverty]] among this population.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.21"/&gt;  This creates a huge expense for travel and transportation, as well as [[child care]]. If the children in the family attend school, transportation to school is often limited to those residing in remote areas. Providing or paying for alternative transportation for children to attend school is also an additional cost.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.21"/&gt;

====The Elderly====

[[Elderly]] people living in [[rural]] areas are at an increased risk for [[poverty]] in [[rural]] areas in Canada.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.17"/&gt;  [[Elderly]] individuals, especially one family women, in [[rural Canada]] are at a great risk for [[poverty]] and low economical status. With a more direct focus on elderly poverty, rural women over the age of 65, are found to have a much lower annual income than adults living in non-rural communities. Over 19% of women over the age of 65 were living in [[poverty in Canada]], as opposed to 10% of [[elderly]] males. There are several factors that put the rural elderly, especially women, at risk of [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; 
Annual income for the [[elderly]] in [[rural]] areas is much lower than those in urban areas. Rural women over the age of 65 had the least amount of public sector funding and government support out of all of the Canadian populations.&lt;ref&gt;Barns, Bern-Klug 1999, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Only 41% of their annual income was through [[financial support]], meaning that they are required to rely on their [[pension]] or personal savings to support themselves. For many, this is not enough to meet their daily living needs,  let alone health care expenses and additional cost of living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Barns, Bern-Klug 1999, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the decreased [[population density]] in [[rural]] areas in Canada, there is a mass shortage of [[public services]] that are offered to individuals. Although all populations are affected, the [[elderly]] experience a major negative impact.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.19"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;   For example, transportation becomes a major issue. More than 25% of the [[elderly]] living in [[rural]] areas did not own or have access to a car. This means that other means of transportation is required; however there are very limited [[public transportation]] services available, especially for individuals living in extreme remote areas.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.19"/&gt; Finding methods of transportation can become expensive and often discouraging for elders.
The [[elderly]] in [[rural]] Canada often live in older, single family homes that often have larger property sizes. Maintaining a home is costly.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.19"/&gt; Maintenance such as cutting the grass or shoveling snow can be too much for the elderly to complete, therefore help is needed in order to keep up. In [[rural]] areas, [[public services]] are often hard to find and can be expensive.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.19"/&gt;    Maintaining their homes can create an added cost to individuals, whereas in previous year they would have been able to perform these tasks themselves. With the lack of services, the elderly often find they are unable to maintain their homes or perform maintenance duties.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.19"/&gt;

====Children and Young Adults====

Children living in [[rural Canada]] are negatively affected by [[poverty]] and low income situations; especially children from single parent families. Single parent families in [[rural communities]] are more likely to have a [[low income]] and poor economical status.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.19"/&gt; [[Child poverty]] is an issue in [[rural Canada]] due to the decreased job opportunities and stability for families in [[low income]] situations. In addition, [[financial support]] is often not enough to ensure the children are provided with the basic essential of daily living.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Children who grow up in [[poverty]] are less likely to improve their economical status as they grow older. Children of [[poverty]] are less likely to achieve a [[high school diploma]] or a [[post secondary education]], due to the financial strain of the family and inability to afford to get to school or to move away.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.19"/&gt; This same idea ties into the issues of young adults and [[rural]] areas. Young adults in [[rural Canada]] are extremely susceptible to [[poverty]] for many additional reasons. Jobs are incredibly hard to find for young adults because of their lack of experience. Employers will often require experience in order to be a successful candidate. With the huge shortage of jobs already existing, young [[rural]] Canadians find it challenging to start their careers.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.22"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, [[formal education]] or [[post secondary]] is often set aside because of the lack of funding and affordability to leave their [[community]]. There are very few post secondary institutions located in remote and [[rural Canada]], meaning that most people would have to travel or relocate in order to attend.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.22"/&gt; This is often impossible for those living in these [[communities]]. Furthermore, [[Welfare (financial aid)|financial assistance]] or [[employment insurance]] is not always an option because in order to be eligible, one must obtain a specific amount of working hours. If a young adult is unable to find work, this type of assistance would be denied due to the lack of worked hours and employment.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.23"/&gt;

====Aboriginals====

Canadian aboriginal people living in [[rural]] areas are considered among the poorest populations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several factors in which contributes to [[poverty]] among [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginals]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.6"&gt;Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Despite many beliefs, poverty risk factors continue to exist for aboriginals living on and off the [[Indian reserve|reserve]]s &lt;ref name="Burns 2013 1–89"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burns|first=Austra |author2=Bruce, David |author3=Marlin, Amanda|title=Rural Poverty: Discussion Paper|year=2013|pages=1–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the Canadian aboriginal population living off of the reserves are at risk of [[poverty]], individuals living on the reserves demonstrate a much greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of employment, poor paying jobs,  [[alcohol abuse]], poor access to [[health care]] and low education levels are all areas in which contribute to the increased risk of [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall earnings of aboriginal Canadians living in [[rural]] areas in significantly lower than non-aboriginals living in more urban areas.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.6"/&gt; Many Canadian aboriginals reside on reserves where their families grow and their [[communities]] develop. There is a massive job shortage among these reserves. With that being said, many attempt to seek employment outside of the reserves within the rural community.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to the remote and isolated geographical location of many aboriginal communities,  jobs are scarce even off of the reserves. Within the Algonquin native reserves,  approximately 90% of the residents are unemployed. For aboriginal’s who are employed and living in [[rural]] areas, they are paid much less than those living in more urban areas.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.11"&gt;Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Wages in rural Canada are typically much lower than those in urban areas, simply because the economical status of rural communities are often lower and small businesses cannot afford to pay large [[wages]] to their employees.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.11"/&gt;  Also, many of the [[rural]] jobs are [[seasonal]] or temporary for these individuals, meaning that they may be out of work for many months of the year.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.11"/&gt;  In addition, the cost of living is a major contributor to aboriginal poverty in rural Canada. The cost of food and daily living supplies are more expensive in [[rural]] areas than in urban cities.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.11"/&gt;  This is because the cost to transport these supplies to [[rural]] distributors is much more. Although some rural housing and land may come at a lower cost than urban areas, the maintenance and up-keep of the housing is a costly factor that contributes to [[poverty]] among aboriginals.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.11"/&gt;
While the [[education]] rate among Aboriginals living in rural Canada is much lower than urban areas, there is vicious cycle that occurs when examining the correlations.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.17"/&gt;  Among aboriginal Canadians, on and off the reserve, 32% have not achieved their [[high school diploma]], as opposed to 15% of non-aboriginal Canadians.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.15"&gt;Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, approximately 8% of aboriginal men in Canada have a [[university degree]], as opposed to 25% of non-aboriginal men.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.15"/&gt;  There are several reasons in which contribute to the gap in educational levels. For rural aboriginals in Canada, [[poverty]] can affect the availability as well as eliminate educational options. Some individuals find that they have to leave [[high school]] in attempt to find a job to help support their struggling families.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.17"&gt;Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Post secondary school is incredibly expensive, and for people living in [[poverty]], [[college]] or [[university]] is not a realistic goal.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.17"/&gt; Therefore, the vicious cycle takes place. People cannot find jobs because they do not have the educational background, but in yet their families cannot afford the cost of education.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.17"/&gt;
In terms of [[gender]] and aboriginal poverty in Canada, there does tend to be a gap between aboriginal men and women when it comes to [[income]] and economical status.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.20"&gt;Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Among aboriginal individuals living in rural Canada, women are less likely to have employment and often have a much lower annual income.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.20"/&gt; In many cases, aboriginal women are the primary caregivers for their children and the [[elderly]] in their families.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.20"/&gt; Women who are able to seek employment often have difficulty due to the job shortages,  as well as requirements for education and experience.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.21"&gt;Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause a serious financial strain on the families, especially for single parent families trying to manage all of their expenses.&lt;ref name="Wilson, MacDonald 2010, p.21"/&gt;

====Individuals with Disabilities====

Individuals with [[disabilities]] living in [[rural Canada]] are at high risk of living in [[poverty]]. [[Disability]] is defined as a long term difficulty with daily living activities such as mobility, [[learning]], [[hearing]] or [[communicating]].&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.58"/&gt; People living with a [[disability]] may find it challenging to work, depending on their condition. Among the rural jobs, many of which involve [[physical labor]] and less than ideal [[working conditions]].&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.41"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals with [[disabilities]] would be unable to work in these conditions. This contributes to the risk of [[poverty]] among rural residents, because the inability to work has a significant impact on their income.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.41"/&gt; Disability support services are available; however the cost of living is incredibly high. Especially for those living in [[rural]] areas, [[home care]] and [[home services]] are limited which creates a challenge for some. In addition, [[rural]] living has an increased risk of injury due to the remote locations and few health services. This also because a challenge for individuals with a [[disability]].&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.58"/&gt;

===Lack of Resources===

===Health Conditions===

===Health Outcomes===

====Effect on health outcomes====
People in rural areas experiencing poverty are having poorer health outcomes than their urban counterparts as evidenced by admission rates, recovery length and complications, and lack of social and nursing supports.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

=====Admissions=====
Canadians living in rural poverty are facing poorer [[hospital]] outcomes. When looking at Canadians diagnosed with congestive [[heart failure]] being admitted to hospital, lower admission rates were found in metropolitan areas than non metropolitan areas. A visit to a metropolitan hospital costs more as they are more services such as angiography available to metropolitan citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Jin et al. 2003, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Hospital admissions are also greater at the end of life for rural Canadians living in [[poverty]] relative to their urban counterparts due to lack of end of life outpatient services &lt;ref&gt;Menec, Nowicki, Kalishuk 2010, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Recovery=====
The recovery process of Canadians after surgery and risk of infection can be increased by a short length of hospital stay, alcoholism, diabetes, obesity, and living in a rural residency. Rural poverty potentiates the risk of post-op infection as well. [[Alcoholism]], [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]] are often health outcomes related to rural poverty  which makes recovering from any illness of surgery more difficult for Canadians living in rural poverty&lt;ref&gt;Daneman, Hu, Redelmeier 2010, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Social supplementary=====
Rural Canadians who live in poverty have a difficult time accessing care and social supports. This includes the availability of health care resources and number of health care professionals that are accessible to these citizens. The lack of access and available supports directly affect the health of rural Canadians living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Menes, Nonstick, Salish 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social Determinants of Health and Health Outcomes====
The poor health outcomes mentioned seem to be a product of the impact of [[social determinants of health]] in a rural setting for a person living in poverty. Social determinants of health are strong contributors of respective health outcomes education.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p. 30"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of poverty in rural areas includes low income, lack of employment, the high costs of new housing construction, poor quality of   housing (leading to higher costs for heating), poor health and lack of healthcare within a reasonable traveling distance, and low levels of education.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p. 30"/&gt; All of which are related to social determinants of health and impact health outcomes for those living in poverty. Specific social determinants of health that contribute to rural poverty and poor health outcomes include: income, employment and working conditions, economy, population demographics, housing, health, education, child and youth development, gender, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Social determinants of health are extremely relevant to the cause and effect of rural poverty and health. For example, those living in lower-income households tend to live in older, poor quality housing units which are often inadequately insulated and have high heat and utility costs.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; This poor heating can affect health, and the high utility costs are often unrealistic for Canadians living in rural poverty. Also, the cause and effect element of rural poverty is certainly evident when looking at food as a critical component to health and a product of income. Many Canadians living in poverty find themselves without adequate food, or are unable to afford the appropriate groceries to support their family and their own nutritional and developmental needs.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.35"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; It can be even more difficult for rural Canadians living in poverty as they have less access to social supports because of the greater distances between rural and urban centres, and cannot spend the money on gas and transportation to seek [[food security]] within urban areas where supports are often located &lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.35"/&gt;

====Health Disparities====
Poverty in Canada has extensive influence on the quality of many aspects of life for rural citizens. With social determinants of health in mind, poverty in rural areas can cause out-migration and population decline, poorer education outcomes, poorer employment opportunities due to transportation costs and child care costs, poorer living and eating conditions.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.44"&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; All of which directly affect health. The lack of education, employment and then income levels affect a rural Canadian’s ability to travel for work, or afford groceries. When the necessary social determinants of health are not being met, it has a direct effect on health outcomes for rural Canadians, and creates a strain or the few social supports available within rural communities.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.44"/&gt;
Poverty also influences the personal life choices of those living in rural areas as they develop coping methods to face daily challenges which affect health as which creates the recognition that  personal life “choices” are greatly influenced by the financial circumstance that people live with.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recognizing the Gap====
There is clearly a difference between rural and urban poverty in Canada and their respective health outcomes. When comparing rural and urban residents, rural Canadians tend to have lower education levels, lower levels of literacy, lower incomes, fewer job opportunities, fewer higher paying job opportunities, more seasonal employment, more housing that is in need of repairs,
poorer health, and poorer access to health care services than urban Canadians.&lt;ref name="Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.44"/&gt; In regards to health outcomes, and health care services related to [[stroke]] specifically, an association has been linked between low income, low hospital volume, and poorer stroke outcome.&lt;ref name="Saposnik et al 2008, p. 3363"&gt;Saposnik et al 2008, p. 3363&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that Canadians of different socio-economic groups may have equal access to health care facilities, but the quality of said facilities is often reflection of financial status of the residents of the area. The high-volume, urban hospitals are often not easily accessible to Canadians who live in rural poverty, magnifying the gap between rural and urban stroke outcomes, and overall health status &lt;ref name="Saposnik et al 2008, p. 3363"/&gt;

====Closing the Gap====
In a response to the poor health outcomes and health disparities specific to rural poverty in Canada, there have been many coalitions and initiatives that nurses, physicians and researchers are attempting to implement in order to close the gap between rural and urban health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in research are being called for as there is an evident lack of research that focuses on rural poverty, but plenty of studies done for urban [[poverty]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses and organizations are recognizing areas for further research in areas such as rural immigrants, foreign migrant workers, rural family violence, [[labour force]] mobility of low income households, barriers specific to rural health settings, rural aboriginal homeless, rural adolescents, and more longitudinal studies measuring long-term outcomes related to health care gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; More information on rural poverty in Canada would aid in the evolution of much needed interventions towards ending the long-term poverty found in rural Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have illustrated the need for rural networks and supports to address a broad spectrum of personal and social needs. Unfortunately many of these “solutions” only provide short term fixes and are not able to work long term to assist rural Canadians in their journey out of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Bruce, Marlin 2013, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; One successful group “The Nurse-Physician Collaborative Partnership” was developed to provide improved access and quality of services to chronically ill elderly living in rural areas by sharing the care between the two professions. The partnership found that interdisciplinary homecare was beneficial, reduced cost and improved health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Mitton et al., 2007 p. 214"&gt;Mitton et al., 2007 p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; This approach also reported high levels of patient satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Mitton et al., 2007 p. 214"/&gt; Patients favoured the in-home interventions implemented by the nurse and physician collaboration as it decreased cost expenses of traveling and made receiving care possible if a lack of transportation was available. The collaborative partnership reduced patient anxiety about their health concerns and increased their confidence in managing their own health issues.&lt;ref name="Mitton et al. 2007,p. 215"&gt;Mitton et al. 2007,p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The program addressed several common health outcomes of rural Canadians living in poverty as it reduced the number of hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, the number of emergency room and ambulatory care visits, and the number of tests needed &lt;ref name="Mitton et al. 2007,p. 215"/&gt;

{{Serbs}}}}
The '''Serbs in Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyarországi szerbek}}, {{lang-sr|Срби у Мађарској}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|Srbi u Mađarskoj}}) are recognized as an [[Minority group|ethnic minority]], numbering 7,210 people or 0.1% of the total population (2011 census).&lt;ref name=2011census/&gt; The number of Serbs in Hungary has drastically diminished; in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries large Serb communities existed throughout Hungary, notably in [[Buda]] (western [[Budapest]]), [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]], [[Szentendre]] and [[Szeged]]. The Serb community in the territory of present-day Hungary has its origin in migrations from the territory of medieval Serbian states during and after the Ottoman conquest of these states. [[Matthias Corvinus]] and his successors are known to have welcomed Serbs from the other side of the Danube, giving the exiled military commanders fiefdoms to rule and defend from the Ottomans. After the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918 and after new borders were defined by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920, only a small fraction of ethnic Serbs remained within the borders of post-Trianon [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smedia.rs/spress/vest/43/Srbi-u-Madjarskoj-Ljubomir-Aleksov-Miodrag-Jaksic-Ministarstvo-za-dijasporu-srpski-nacionalni-interes-Manje-od-pet-hiljada-Srba-u-Madjarskoj.html|title=Najnovije vesti, Beograd, Srbija, Smedia|website=Smedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The presence of Serbs in the territory of present-day Hungary date from the [[Middle Ages]]. The mother of the Hungarian king [[Géza II of Hungary|Géza II]] (1141-1162) was [[Helena of Raška]], a daughter of the great župan of [[Raška (state)|Raška]], [[Uroš I of Raška|Uroš I]]. During the rule of Géza II, her brother [[Beloš Vukanović]] was a [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. It is to be noted that when the Magyars arrived to the Pannonian Basin under Arpad in 896, they met there with the already well established Slavic population. This Slavic population however was quickly assimilated or otherwise exterminated. The Serbs who later migrated into the Pannonian Basin from the Balkans, were the descendants of  those Slavs who in the 7th century migrated from the Pannonian Basin southwards into the Balkan peninsula. 

Since the 14th century, escaping from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] threat, a large number of [[Serbs]] migrated to the Kingdom of Hungary where many of them served as soldiers. After the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, much of the territory of present-day Hungary came under Ottoman administration. During Ottoman administration towns in the territory of present-day Hungary began decaying and the former Hungarian and German population left them. In that time, especially in the 17th century, many Serb, and other Southern Slavic migrants settled in the territory of present-day Hungary. It is interesting that most of the Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary were [[South Slavs]] (mostly Serbs and Bosniaks).

[[File:Frontiersman from Pomorišje, by Martin Engelbrecht.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Frontiersman from [[Pomorišje]], first half of the 18th century.]]
After territory of present-day Hungary came under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] administration, a new wave of Serb refugees migrated to the area in 1690, as a consequence of the Habsburg-Ottoman war. In the first half of the 18th century, Serbs and South Slavs were ethnic majority in several cities in the territory of present-day Hungary, including [[Buda]], [[Szentendre]], [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]], [[Pécs]], [[Szeged]], etc. After the devastating Ottoman wars these cities had a very low population.

In 1698, more than a half of population of [[Pécs]] were South Slavs (including Serbs). In 1715, the population of [[Buda]] numbered 1,539 houses, of which 769 were South Slavic (mostly Serb), 701 German, and 68 Hungarian. In 1715, the population of [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] numbered 237 houses, of which 216 were South Slavic (Serb and [[Bunjevci|Bunjevac]]), 16 Hungarian, and 5 German. In 1720, 88% of population of [[Szentendre]] were South Slavs (mostly Serbs). In 1720, the population of [[Szeged]] numbered 193 houses, of which 99 were Serb.

[[File:Serb Orthodox Museum and Church IMG 0492 serb museum szentendre.JPG|thumb|right|170px|Serbian Orthodox Museum and Church in [[Szentendre]]]]
During the 18th and 19th century, the Hungarian-Serb ethnic border moved southward and fixed in the territory of present-day [[Vojvodina]]. Following the dissolution of [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] in 1918, the Serbian army and [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja|South Slavic People's Administration]] from [[Novi Sad]] controlled not only present-day Vojvodina, but also southern parts of present-day Hungary.

The [[Treaty of Trianon]] from 1920 defined the border between Hungary and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and assigned most of [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] and the northern part of [[Bácska]] (around city of [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]]) to Hungary. As a response to this, a short-lived Serb-Hungarian [[Baranya-Baja Republic]] was formed in this area in 1921. The president of the republic was Serb, [[Petar Dobrović]].

After the Serb-Croat-Slovene army evacuated the territory of the ''Baranya-Baja Republic'' the two countries signed a citizenship treaty. According to that treaty, members of the Serb minority in Hungary gained right to opt for citizenship of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. About two-thirds of the Serbs (called ''optants'') left Hungary in the following decade. Almost the whole Serb population of [[Sárok]], [[Deszk]], [[Újszentiván]], [[Szőreg]], [[Majs]] and [[Dunaszekcső]] became optants.

In 1910, 26,248 people in the territory of present-day Hungary spoke [[Serbian language]]. In 1920, number of Serbian speakers was 17,132, in 1930 7,031, in 1941 5,442, in 1970 11,177, in 1980 3,426, in 1990 2,953, 2001 3,388  and in 2011 3,708(compared with 7,210 declared Serbs in the same year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepszamlalas.hu/eng/volumes/24/tables/load1_3_1.html|title=Központi Statisztikai Hivatal|website=www.nepszamlalas.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2011census/&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Cornerhouse. Cafe - 74, Váci Street, Budapest District V, Hungary (Szerb St. cnr).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Serbian Street (“''Szerb utca''”) in [[Budapest]]]]
Small Serb communities are scattered in the southern part of the country. There are also some Serbs who live in the central part of the country - in bigger towns like [[Budapest]], [[Szentendre]], etc. The only settlement with an ethnic Serb majority in Hungary is [[Lórév]] (Serbian: Lovra / Ловра) on [[Csepel Island]]. This small village of 307 people had 180 Serb inhabitants (and 202 people with a Serb "cultural heritage"). But there are other small Serb settlements in the town of [[Ráckeve]] and the village of [[Szigetcsép]], also on Csepel Island. Not far to the north the [[Bunjevci]] settlement of [[Tököl]] is to be found. A tradition of mutual weddings between [[Lórév]] and [[Tököl]] existed as well as strong connections with Serbs from the villages of [[Medina]] in the south, three villages north of [[Budapest]] -- [[Budakalasz]], [[Pomáz]] and [[Csobánka]]. We also find Serbs and Bunjevci living together in other Hungarian towns, [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]], [[Gara]] and [[Katymár]], and in the following villages, [[Csávoly]], [[Felsőszentiván]], [[Bácsalmás]], [[Csikéria]], [[Bácsbokod]], [[Mátételke]] and [[Vaskút]].

==Heritage==
[[File:Serbian Orthodox Church, 2005 Rackeve05 036.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Serbian Orthodox Church]] built in 1487]]
Serbs left a valuable architectural heritage in [[Hungary]]. The number of [[Serbian Orthodox]] churches is higher than we should expect by the small number of present-day Serb population. These [[Baroque]] churches were mostly built in the 18-19th centuries when Serb merchants formed rich and influential communities in Hungarian towns. Village churches show the historical presence of Serbs in places from where they absolutely disappeared by now.

Towns, cultural institutions, churches and monasteries:

* The most complex example of Serb architectural heritage in Hungary is the old town of [[Szentendre]] (Serbian: ''Sentandreja''), next to the [[Danube]], with 7 Orthodox Churches (two of which have been sold), brightly coloured merchant houses and the [[Museum of Serbian Orthodox Heritage]].
* In [[Budapest]], the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in the [[Tabán]] district was damaged in WWII and later demolished. There is an old Serbian Orthodox Church in Serb Street, [[Pest (city)|Pest]] and the famous Serb college, [[Thökölyanum]] (Serbian: ''Tekelijanum'').
* Churches in [[Vác]] (''Vac''), [[Székesfehérvár]] (''Stoni Beograd'') with a Serbian open-air village museum, [[Szeged]] (''Segedin''), [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] (''Baja'') with two churches, [[Mohács]] (''Mohač''), [[Siklós]] (''Šikloš''), [[Eger]] (''Jegra''), [[Győr]] (''Đur''), [[Esztergom]] (''Ostrogon''), [[Hódmezővásárhely]] (''Vašarhelj''), [[Adony]] (''Džuntaran'', demolished after World War II).
*Village churches in [[Pomáz]] (''Pomaz''), [[Csobánka]] (''Čobanac''), [[Izbég]], [[Ráckeve]] (''Srpski Kovin'', rare example of Serb [[Gothic architecture]] from the 15th century), [[Lórév]] (''Lovra''), [[Szigetcsép]] (''Čip''), [[Budakalász]] (''Kalaz''), [[Magyarcsanád]] (''Čanad''), [[Battonya]] (''Batanja''), [[Deszk]] (''Deska''), [[Szőreg]] (''Sirig''), [[Dunapentele]] (''Pantelija'', now [[Dunaújváros]]), [[Százhalombatta]] (''Bata''), [[Dunaföldvár]] (''Feldvar''), [[Alsónána]] (''Donja Nana''), [[Bátaszék]] (''Batsek'', demolished in the 1960s), [[Medina, Hungary|Medina]] (''Medina''), [[Illocska]] (''Iločac''), [[Magyarbóly]] (''Madžarboja''), [[Dunaszekcső]] (''Sečuj''), [[Villány]] (''Viljan''), [[Sárok]] (''Šarok''), [[Majs]] (''Majš''), [[Lippó]] (''Lipova''), [[Beremend]] (''Breme''), [[Erdősmecske]] (''Racmečka''), [[Somberek]] (''Šumberak''), [[Véménd]] (''Vemend'', demolished in 1964), [[Nagybudmér]] (''Veliki Budmir'', demolished in 2001), [[Hercegszántó]] (''Santovo''), [[Újszentiván]] (''Novi Sentivan''), [[Pécsvárad]] (''Pečvar'', demolished in 1925), [[Liptód]] (''Litoba'', demolished in 1951).
*The Serbian Orthodox Monastery of [[Grábóc]] (''Grabovac'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">'''La Società del Whist''', modelled broadly on the [[gentleman's club]]s of [[London]] and their [[Paris]]ian analogues, was founded in March 1841 in the fashionable [[Caffè Fiorio]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], by [[Count Cavour]] and a number of his friends.&lt;ref name="whist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comune"/&gt;

By contrast to previous clubs formed among [[Turin]]’s social elite, the Whist Club admitted upper middle class professionals—bankers, lawyers and academics—alongside the titled aristocracy. Nevertheless, at least ten of the forty founding members had ancestors who had belonged to the city’s [[Patriottica Nobile Società del Casino]]: a club which had been not only strictly limited to the nobility but in effect to its more exclusive echelons, virtually excluding those whose titles post-dated 1722.&lt;ref name="Cardoza"/&gt;

In 1947 it merged with the Accademia Filarmonica.

'''Sukkot''' ({{lang-he|סוכות}} or {{lang|he|סֻכּוֹת}}, ''{{transl|he|sukkōt}}''), commonly translated as '''Feast of Tabernacles''', traditional [[Ashkenazi]] pronunciation '''Sukkos''' or '''Succos'''; also known as ''Chag HaAsif'' (חג האסיף), the '''Feast of Ingathering''', is a [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] [[Jewish holiday]] celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month, [[Tishrei]] (varies from late September to late October). During the existence of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]], it was one of the [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]] ({{lang-he|שלוש רגלים}}, ''{{transl|he|shalosh regalim}}'') on which the [[Israelites]] were commanded to perform a pilgrimage to the Temple.

The names used in the [[Torah]] are ''Chag HaAsif'', translated to "Feast of Ingathering" or "Harvest Festival", and ''Chag HaSukkot'', translated to "Festival of Booths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Sukkot? |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4784/jewish/What-Is-Sukkot.htm |website=Chabad.org |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to the double significance of Sukkot. The one mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]] is agricultural in nature—"Feast of Ingathering at the year's end" ({{Bibleref2|Exodus 34:22}})—and marks the end of the harvest time and thus of the agricultural year in the [[Land of Israel]]. The more elaborate religious significance from the [[Book of Leviticus]] is that of commemorating [[the Exodus]] and the dependence of the [[Israelites|People of Israel]] on the will of God ({{Bibleref2|Leviticus 23:42-43}}).

The holiday lasts seven days in Israel and eight in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]. The first day (and second day in the diaspora) is a [[Shabbat]]-like [[Jewish holiday|holiday]] when [[melacha|work]] is forbidden. This is followed by intermediate days called [[Chol Hamoed]], when certain work is permitted. The festival is closed with another Shabbat-like holiday called [[Shemini Atzeret]] (one day in Israel, two days in the diaspora, where the second day is called [[Simchat Torah]]). Shemini Atzeret coincides with the eighth day of Sukkot outside Israel.

The Hebrew word ''{{transl|he|sukkōt}}'' is the plural of ''[[sukkah]]'', "[[:wikt:booth|booth]]" or "[[:wikt:tabernacle|tabernacle]]", which is a walled structure covered with ''[[s'chach]]'' (plant material such as overgrowth or palm leaves). A sukkah is the name of the temporary dwelling in which farmers would live during harvesting, a fact connecting to the agricultural significance of the holiday stressed by the Book of Exodus. As stated in Leviticus, it is also intended as a reminiscence of the type of fragile dwellings in which the Israelites dwelt during their 40 years of travel in the desert after the Exodus from slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Throughout the holiday, meals are eaten inside the sukkah and many people sleep there as well.

On each day of the holiday it is mandatory to perform a waving ceremony with the [[Four Species]].

==Origins==

[[File:A Pleasant Sukka.JPG|thumb|Sukkah in [[New Hampshire]]]]

In the Book of Leviticus, God told Moses to command the people: "On the first day you shall take the product of ''hadar'' trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and [[willow]]s of the brook" ({{Bibleref2|Lev. 23:40}}), and "You shall live in booths seven days; all citizens in Israel shall live in booths, in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelite people live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt" ({{Bibleref2|Lev. 23:42–43}}).

The origins of Sukkot are both historical and agricultural. Historically, Sukkot commemorates the forty-year period during which the children of Israel were wandering in the desert, living in temporary shelters. Agriculturally, Sukkot is a [[harvest festival]] and is sometimes referred to as ''{{transl|he|Chag HaAsif}}'' ({{lang|he|חג האסיף}}, the "Festival of Ingathering"), as it celebrates the gathering of the harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday5.htm |title=Sukkot |publisher=Judaism 101 |access-date=7 October 2018 |website=JewFAQ.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sukkot – The Festival of Booths |url=https://www.neot-kedumim.org.il/index-jewish-holidays/sukkot-the-festival-of-booths/ |publisher=Neot Kedumim Park |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws and customs==
Sukkot is a seven-day holiday, with the first day celebrated as a full festival with special prayer services and holiday meals. The seventh day of Sukkot is called ''{{transl|he|[[Hoshana Rabbah]]}}'' ("Great Hoshana", referring to the tradition that worshippers in the [[synagogue]] walk around the perimeter of the sanctuary during morning services) and has a special observance of its own. Outside Israel, the first and last two days are celebrated as full festivals. The intermediate days are known as ''Chol HaMoed'' ("festival weekdays"). According to [[Halakha]], some types of work are forbidden during ''Chol HaMoed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Pesach: Its observance, Laws and Significance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZL9RW6q22wC |editor1-last=Scherman |editor1-first=Nosson |editor2-last=Zlotowitz |editor2-first=Meir |editor3-first=Shimon |editor3-last=Finkelman |editor4-first=Mosheh Dov |editor4-last=Shṭain |publisher=Mesorah Publications |date=1994 |page=88 |accessdate=7 October 2018 |isbn=9780899064475}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Israel]] many businesses are closed during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/15795#.VEEjc1eGffY |title=True Chol Hamoed Celebration is only in Israel |publisher=Arutz Sheva |first=Dr. Chaim Charles |last=Cohen |date=12 October 2014 |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the week of Sukkot, meals are eaten in the sukkah. If a [[brit milah]] (circumcision ceremony) or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] rises during Sukkot, the [[seudat mitzvah]] (obligatory festive meal) is served in the sukkah. Similarly, the father of a newborn boy greets guests to his Friday-night [[Shalom Zachar]] in the sukkah. Males awaken there, although the requirement is waived in case of [[drought]]. Every day, a blessing is recited over the [[Lulav]] and the [[Etrog]].

Observance of Sukkot is detailed in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{Bibleref2|Nehemiah 8:13-18}}, {{Bibleverse||Zechariah|14:16-19|HE}} and {{Bibleref2|Leviticus 23:34-44}}); the [[Mishnah]] (Sukkah 1:1–5:8); the [[Tosefta]] (Sukkah 1:1–4:28); and the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Sukkah 1a–) and Babylonian [[Talmud]] ([[Sukkah (Talmud)|Sukkah]] 2a–56b).

==Building a sukkah==

{{Main|Sukkah}}
The sukkah walls can be constructed of any material (wood, canvas, aluminum siding, sheets). The walls can be free-standing or include the sides of a building or porch. The roof must be of organic material, known as [[s'chach]], such as leafy tree overgrowth, schach mats or palm fronds.&lt;ref name="build"&gt;{{cite web |title=How do we make a Sukkah? |url=http://www.beingjewish.com/yomtov/sukkos/build.html |website=BeingJewish.com |date=20 December 2017 |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary to decorate the interior of the sukkah with hanging decorations of the [[four species]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judaica101.ajudaica.com/sukkot/ |title=Sukkot |website=ajudaica.com |first=Yossi |last=Belz |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with attractive artwork.{{clear left}}

==Special prayers==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 14882 Western Wall in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Sukkot prayers at the [[Western Wall]] or ''Kotel'']]

Prayers during Sukkot include the reading of the Torah every day, reciting the [[Jewish services|Mussaf]] (additional) service after morning prayers, reciting [[Hallel]], and adding special additions to the [[Amidah]] and [[Birkat HaMazon|Grace after Meals]]. In addition, the service includes rituals involving the Four Species. The lulav and etrog are not brought to the synagogue on Shabbat.&lt;ref name=sackssiddur&gt;{{cite book |first=Lord Jonathan |last=Sacks |title=The Koren Siddur |edition=Nusaḥ Ashkenaz, 1st Hebrew/English |year=2009 |publisher=Koren Publishers |location=Jerusalem |isbn=9789653010673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hoshanot''===
On each day of the festival, worshippers walk around the synagogue carrying their Four species while reciting special prayers known as ''Hoshanot''.&lt;ref name=sackssiddur /&gt;{{rp|852}} This takes place either after the morning's Torah reading or at the end of Mussaf. This ceremony commemorates the [[Aravah (Sukkot)|willow]] ceremony at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], in which willow branches were piled beside the altar with worshippers parading around the altar reciting prayers.&lt;ref name="chabad-hoshana"&gt;{{cite web |title=Honshana Rabbah |url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/757453/jewish/Hoshana-Rabbah.htm |website=chabad.org |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ushpizin''===

A custom originating with [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] is to recite the ''ushpizin'' prayer to "invite" one of seven "exalted guests" into the sukkah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Judaica |volume=19 |page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ''ushpizin'' ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|he|אושפיזין}} 'guests'), represent the seven shepherds of Israel: [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], [[Moses]], [[Aaron]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[David]]. According to tradition, each night a different guest enters the sukkah followed by the other six. Each of the ''ushpizin'' has a unique lesson which teaches the parallels of the spiritual focus of the day on which they visit.

==''Chol HaMoed'' intermediate days==
{{Main article|Chol HaMoed}}
[[File:He wiki sucot.jpg|thumb|left|Decorations hanging from the [[s'chach]] (top or "ceiling") on the inside of a [[sukkah]]]]

The second through seventh days of Sukkot (third through seventh days outside Israel) are called [[Chol HaMoed]] ({{lang|he|חול המועד}} - {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "festival weekdays"). These days are considered by [[halakha]] to be more than regular weekdays but less than festival days. In practice, this means that all activities that are needed for the holiday—such as buying and preparing food, cleaning the house in honor of the holiday, or traveling to visit other people's sukkot or on family outings—are permitted by Jewish law. Activities that will interfere with relaxation and enjoyment of the holiday—such as laundering, mending clothes, engaging in labor-intensive activities—are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', ''[[Orach Chayim]]'', 530&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ou-moed"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krakowski |first1=Rabbi Y. Dov |title=Hilchos Chol HaMoed |url=https://www.ou.org/holidays/sukkot/hilchos-chol-hamoed/ |publisher=Orthodox Union |date=10 April 2014 |access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious Jews often treat Chol HaMoed as a vacation period, eating nicer than usual meals in their sukkah, entertaining guests, visiting other families in their sukkot, and taking family outings. Many synagogues and Jewish centers also offer events and meals in their sukkot during this time to foster community and goodwill.

On the [[Shabbat]] which falls during the week of Sukkot (or in the event when the first day of Sukkot is on Shabbat), the [[Ecclesiastes|Book of Ecclesiastes]] is read during morning [[synagogue]] services in Israel. (Diaspora communities read it the second Shabbat {eighth day} when the first day of sukkot is on Shabbat.) This Book's emphasis on the ephemeralness of life ("Vanity of vanities, all is vanity...") echoes the theme of the sukkah, while its emphasis on death reflects the time of year in which Sukkot occurs (the "autumn" of life). The penultimate verse reinforces the message that adherence to God and His [[Torah]] is the only worthwhile pursuit. (Cf. [[Ecclesiastes|Ecclesiastes 12:13,14]].)&lt;ref name="Kohelet"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schlesinger |first1=Hanan |title=Ecclesiastes (Kohelet) |url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ecclesiastes-kohelet/ |website=MyJewishLearning.org |date=15 September 2002 |access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hakhel'' assembly==
{{Main article|Hakhel}}

In the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], all Israelite, and later Jewish men, women, and children on pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]] for the festival would gather in the Temple courtyard on the first day of Chol HaMoed Sukkot to hear the Jewish king read selections from the [[Torah]]. This ceremony, which was mandated in [[Deuteronomy]] 31:10-13, was held every seven years, in the year following the [[Shmita]] (Sabbatical) year. This ceremony was discontinued after the destruction of the Temple, but it has been revived in Israel since 1952 on a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Appel |first1=Gershion |title=A Revival of the Ancient Assembly of Hakhel |journal=Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought |date=Fall 1959 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=119-127 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23255504 |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Simchat Beit HaShoevah'' water-drawing celebration==
{{Main article|Simchat Beit HaShoeivah}}

During the intermediate days of Sukkot, gatherings of music and dance, known as ''Simchat Beit HaShoeivah'' (Celebration of the Place of Water-Drawing), take place. This commemorates the drawing of the water for the water-libation on the Altar, an offering unique to Sukkot, when water was carried up the [[Jerusalem pilgrim road]] from the [[Pool of Siloam]] to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="shoeva"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prero |first1=Rabbi Yehudah |title=Simchas Bais HaShoeva – A Happiness of Oneness |url=https://torah.org/learning/yomtov-sukkos-vol3no21/ |website=Torah.org |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hoshana Rabbah'' (Great Supplication)==
{{Main article|Hoshana Rabbah}}

The seventh day of Sukkot is known as ''Hoshana Rabbah'' (Great Supplication). This day is marked by a special synagogue service in which seven circuits are made by worshippers holding their Four Species, reciting additional prayers. In addition, a bundle of five [[Aravah (Sukkot)|willow branches]] is beaten on the ground.&lt;ref name=sackssiddur /&gt;{{rp|859}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="chabad-hoshana" /&gt;

==Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah==
{{Main article|Shemini Atzeret|Simchat Torah}}

The holiday immediately following Sukkot is known as ''Shemini Atzeret'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "Eighth [Day] of Assembly"). Shemini Atzeret is usually viewed as a separate holiday.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|Rosh Hashanah]]'' 4b for rare cases where it is viewed as part of the Sukkot holiday.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Diaspora]] a second additional holiday, ''Simchat Torah'' ("Joy of the Torah"), is celebrated. In the Land of Israel, Simchat Torah is celebrated on Shemini Atzeret. On Shemini Atzeret people leave their sukkah and eat their meals inside the house. Outside Israel, many eat in the sukkah without making the blessing. The sukkah is not used on Simchat Torah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Deeper Look at Shemini Atzeret / Simchat Torah |url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/1288162/jewish/A-Deeper-Look-at-Shemini-Atzeret-Simchat-Torah.htm |website=Chabad.org |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jeroboam's feast==
According to {{bibleverse|1|Kings|12:32-33|NKJV}}, King [[Jeroboam]], first king of the rebellious [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern kingdom]], instituted a feast on the fifteenth day of the [[Cheshvan|eighth month]] in imitation of the feast of Sukkot in Judah, and pilgrims went to [[Bethel]] instead of Jerusalem to make thanksgiving offerings. Jeroboam feared that continued pilgrimages from the northern kingdom to Jerusalem could lead to pressure for reunion with Judah:
:''If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|12:27|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christianity==
{{Further|Christian observances of Jewish holidays}}

Sukkot is celebrated by a number of [[Christian denominations]] that observe holidays from the [[Old Testament]]. These groups base this on the fact that [[Jesus]] celebrated Sukkot (see the [[Gospel of John]] 7). The holiday is celebrated according to its [[Hebrew calendar]] dates. The first mention of observing the holiday by Christian groups dates to the 17th century, among the sect of the [[Subbotniks]] in [[Russia]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} In the [[Orthodox Church]], the holiday is said to correspond to the new covenant [[Feast of the Transfiguration]].

==Academic views==
De Moor has suggested that there are links between Sukkot and the [[Ugarit|Ugaritic]] New Year festival, in particular the Ugaritic custom of erecting two rows of huts built of branches on the temple roof as temporary dwelling houses for their gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Year with Canaanites and Israelites |first=Johannes Cornelis |last=De Moor |year=1972 |publisher=Kok |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origin and Transformation of the Ancient Israelite Festival Calendar |first=Jan A. |last=Wagenaar |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |year=2005 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have pointed out that the original [[Thanksgiving]] holiday had many similarities with Sukkot in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thanksgiving's Sukkot Roots |url=https://jewishjournal.com/culture/lifestyle/celebrations_simchas/8736/ |date=20 November 2003 |access-date=8 October 2018 |first=Linda |last=Morel |publisher=Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Did Sukkot Shape Thanksgiving? |url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2013/09/17/did-sukkot-shape-thanksgiving/ |date=17 September 2013 |access-date=8 October 2018 |first=Robert |last=Gluck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban informatics''' refers to the study of people creating, applying and using [[information and communication technology]] and [[data]] in the context of [[cities]] and [[urban environments]]. Various definitions are available, some provided in the [[#Definitions|Definitions]] section. Urban informatics is a trans-disciplinary field of research and practice that draws on three broad domains: people, place and technology.&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011" /&gt;

* People can refer to city residents, [[citizens]], [[community groups]], from various socio-cultural backgrounds, as well as the social dimensions of non-profit organisations and businesses. The social research domains that urban informatics draws from include [[urban sociology]], [[media studies]], [[communication studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[city planning]] and others.
* Place can refer to distinct urban sites, [[Locale (geographic)|locales]] and [[habitats]], as well as to larger scale geographic entities such as [[neighbourhoods]], [[public space]], [[suburbs]], [[regions]], or peri-urban areas. The place or spatial research domains entail [[urban studies]], [[architecture]], [[urban design]], [[urban planning]], [[geography]], and others.
* Technology can refer to various types of [[information and communication technology]] and [[ubiquitous computing]] / [[urban computing]] technology such as [[mobile phones]], [[wearable devices]], urban screens, media façades, [[sensors]], and other [[Internet of Things]] devices. The technology research domains span [[informatics]], [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], [[human-computer interaction]], and others.

In addition to [[geographic data]] / [[spatial data]], most common sources of data relevant to urban informatics can be divided into three broad categories: government data ([[census]] data, [[open data]], etc.); personal data ([[social media]], [[quantified self]] data, etc.), and; sensor data ([[transport]], [[surveillance]], [[CCTV]], Internet of Things devices, etc.).&lt;ref name="kitchin2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Street Computing 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Ricky|last2=Rittenbruch|first2=Markus|last3=Foth|first3=Marcus|last4=Filonik|first4=Daniel|last5=Viller|first5=Stephen|title=Street Computing: Towards an Integrated Open Data Application Programming Interface (API) for Cities|journal=Journal of Urban Technology|date=April 2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/10630732.2012.698064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although first mentions of the term date back as early as 1987, urban informatics did not emerge as a notable field of research and practice until 2006 (see [[#History|History]] section). Since then, the emergence and growing popularity of ubiquitous computing, open data and [[big data analytics]], as well as [[smart cities]] contributed to a surge in interest in urban informatics, not just from academics but also from industry and city governments seeking to explore and apply the possibilities and opportunities of urban informatics.

== Definitions ==

Many definitions of urban informatics have been published and can be found online. The descriptions provided by Townsend in his foreword and by Foth in his preface to the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics"&lt;ref name="foth2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|title=Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics: The Practice and Promise of the Real-Time City|date=2009|publisher=Information Science Reference|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-60566-152-0|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/13308/}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize two key aspects: (1) the new possibilities (including real-time data) for both citizens and city administrations afforded by [[ubiquitous computing]], and (2) the convergence of physical and digital aspects of the city.

{{Quotation|"Urban informatics is the study, design, and practice of urban experiences across different urban contexts that are created by new opportunities of real-time, ubiquitous technology and the augmentation that mediates the physical and digital layers of people networks and urban infrastructures."|Foth, Choi, Satchell, 2011|Urban Informatics&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011"&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Marcus|last1=Foth|first2=Jaz Hee-jeong|last2=Choi|first3=Christine|last3=Satchell|title=Urban Informatics|conference=Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|pages=1–8|date=2011|location=Hangzhou, China|doi=10.1145/1958824.1958826}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although closely related, Foth differentiates urban informatics from the field of [[urban computing]] by suggesting that the former focusses more on the social and human implications of technology in cities (similar to the community and social emphases of how [[community informatics]] and [[social informatics]] are defined), and the latter focusses more on technology and computing.&lt;ref name="foth2009" /&gt; Urban informatics emphasises the relationship between urbanity, as expressed through the many dimensions of urban life, and technology.

Later, with the increasing popularity of commercial opportunities under the label of [[smart city]] and [[big data]], subsequent definitions became narrow and limited in defining urban informatics mainly as [[big data analytics]] for efficiency and productivity gains in city contexts – unless the arts and social sciences are added to the interdisciplinary mix.&lt;ref name="thrift"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrift|first1=Nigel|title=The Promise of Urban Informatics: Some Speculations|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=2014|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1263–1266|doi=10.1068/a472c}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specialisation within urban informatics is sometimes referred to as 'data-driven, [[Urbanism#Network-based theories|networked urbanism]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitchin|first1=Rob|title=Data-Driven, Networked Urbanism|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2015|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2641802|ssrn=2641802}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[urban science]].&lt;ref name="batty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batty|first1=Michael|title=The New Science of Cities|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262019521|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-science-cities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

One of the first occurrences of the term can be found in Mark E. Hepworth's 1987 article "The Information City",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hepworth|first1=Mark E.|title=The Information City|journal=Cities|date=August 1987|volume=4|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1016/0264-2751(87)90033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mentions the term "urban informatics" on page 261, however, Hepworth's overall discussion is more concerned with the broader notion of "informatics planning." Considering the article pre-dates the advent of ubiquitous computing and urban computing, it does contain some visionary thoughts about major changes on the horizon brought about by [[information and communication technology]] and the impact on cities.

The Urban Informatics Research Lab was founded at [[Queensland University of Technology]] in 2006, the first research group explicitly named to reflect its dedication to the study of urban informatics.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The first edited book on the topic, the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics", published in 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, brought together researchers and scholars from three broad domains: people, place, and technology, or; the social, the spatial, and the technical.

There were many precursors to this [[transdisciplinarity]] of "people, place, and technology."&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011" /&gt; From an [[architecture]], [[planning]] and [[design]] background, there is the work of the late [[William J. Mitchell]], Dean of the [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning]], and author of the 1995 book "City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=William J.|title=City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-13309-8|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/city-bits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell was influential in suggesting a profound relationship between place and technology at a time when mainstream interest was focused on the promise of the [[Information Superhighway]] and what [[Frances Cairncross]] called the "Death of Distance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cairncross|first1=Frances|title=The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution will Change our Lives|date=1997|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-0-87584-806-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a decline in the significance of place through services such as [[telecommuting]], [[distance education]], [[e-commerce]], the physical / tangible layers of the city started to mix with the digital layers of the internet and online communications. Aspects of this trend have been studied under the terms community informatics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gurstein|first1=Michael|title=Community Informatics: Enabling Communities with Information and Communications Technologies|date=2000|publisher=Idea Group Publishing|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-878289-69-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[community network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuler|first1=Douglas|title=Community Networks: New Community Networks: Wired for Change|date=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Mass.|isbn=978-0-201-59553-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first texts that systematically examined the impact of information technologies on the spatial and social evolution of cities is Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|last2=Marvin|first2=Simon|title=Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places.|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stephen Graham and Simon Marvin. The relationship between cities and the internet was further expanded upon in a volume edited by Stephen Graham entitled "Cybercities Reader"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|title=The Cybercities Reader|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-27956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by various authors in the 2006 book "Networked Neighbourhoods: The Connected Community in Context"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Patrick|title=Networked Neighbourhoods: The Connected Community in Context|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=978-1-84628-267-6|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846282676}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Patrick Purcell. Additionally, contributions from architecture, design and planning scholars are contained in the 2007 journal special issue on "Space, Sociality, and Pervasive Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dave|first1=Bharat|title=Space, Sociality, and Pervasive Computing|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design|date=2007|volume=34|issue=3|pages=381–382|doi=10.1068/b3403ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 34(3), guest edited by the late Bharat Dave, as well as in the 2008 book "Augmented Urban Spaces: Articulating the Physical and Electronic City"&lt;ref name="aurigi2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aurigi|first1=Alessandro|last2=De Cindio|first2=Fiorella|title=Augmented Urban Spaces: Articulating the Physical and Electronic City|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=978-0-7546-7149-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Alessandro Aurigi and Fiorella De Cindio, based on contributions to the Digital Cities 4 workshop held in conjunction with the Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T) conference 2005 in Milan, Italy.

The first prominent and explicit use of the term urban informatics in the [[sociology]] and [[media studies]] literature appears in the 2007 special issue "Urban Informatics: Software, Cities and the New Cartographies of Knowing Capitalism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellison|first1=Nick|last2=Burrows|first2=Roger|last3=Parker|first3=Simon|title=Urban Informatics: Software, Cities and the New Cartographies of Knowing Capitalism|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|date=December 2007|volume=10|issue=6|pages=785–788|doi=10.1080/13691180701750975}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal Information, Communication &amp; Society, 10(6), guest edited by Ellison, Burrows, &amp; Parker. Later on, in 2013, Burrows and Beer argued that the socio-technical transformations described by research studies conducted in the field of urban informatics give reason for sociologists more broadly to not only question epistemological and methodological norms and practices but also to rethink spatial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Roger|last2=Beer|first2=David|editor1-last=Orton-Johnson|editor1-first=Kate|editor2-last=Prior|editor2-first=Nick|title=Digital Sociology: Critical Perspectives|chapter=Rethinking Space: Urban Informatics and the Sociological Imagination|date=2013| pages=61–78|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-230-22283-0|doi=10.1057/9781137297792_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], the sub-domains of [[human-computer interaction]], ubiquitous computing, and urban computing, provided early contributions that influenced the emerging field of urban informatics. Examples include the Digital Cities workshop series (see below), Greenfield’s 2006 book "Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing|last=Greenfield|first=Adam|publisher=New Riders|year=2006|isbn=0321384016|location=San Francisco, US|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2006 special issue "Urban Computing: Navigating Space and Context"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shklovski|first1=Irina|last2=Chang|first2=M. F.|title=Urban Computing: Navigating Space and Context|journal=Computer|date=September 2006|volume=39|issue=9|pages=36–37|doi=10.1109/MC.2006.308}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the IEEE journal Computer, 39(9), guest edited by Shklovski &amp; Chang, and the 2007 special issue "Urban Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kindberg|first1=Tim|last2=Chalmers|first2=Matthew|last3=Paulos|first3=Eric|title=Urban Computing|journal=IEEE Pervasive Computing|date=July 2007|volume=6|issue=3|pages=18–20|doi=10.1109/MPRV.2007.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the IEEE journal Pervasive Computing, 6(3), guest edited by Kindberg, Chalmers, &amp; Paulos.

== Digital Cities Workshop Series ==

The Digital Cities Workshop Series started in 1999&lt;ref name="dc1" /&gt; and is the longest running academic workshop series that has focused on, and profoundly influenced the field of urban informatics.&lt;ref name="foth2015" /&gt; The first two workshops in 1999 and 2001 were both held in Kyoto, Japan, with subsequent workshops since 2003 held in conjunction with the biennial International Conference on Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T).

Each Digital Cities workshop proceedings have become the basis for key anthologies listed below, which in turn have also been formative to a diverse set of emerging fields, including urban informatics, urban computing, smart cities, [[pervasive computing]], [[internet of things]], media architecture, urban [[interaction design]], and urban science.

== Methods ==

The diverse range of people, groups and organisations involved in urban informatics is reflective of the diversity of methods being used in its pursuit and practice. As a result, urban informatics borrows from a wide range of methodologies across the [[social sciences]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[design]], [[architecture]], [[planning]] (including [[geographic information systems]]), and [[technology]] (in particular [[computer science]], pervasive computing, and ubiquitous computing), and applies those to the urban domain. Examples include:

* [[action research]] and [[participatory action research]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearn|first1=Greg|last2=Tacchi|first2=Jo|last3=Foth|first3=Marcus|last4=Lennie|first4=June|title=Action Research and New Media: Concepts, Methods, and Cases|date=2009|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1-57273-866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|last2=Brynskov|first2=Martin|editor1-last=Gordon|editor1-first=Eric|editor2-last=Mihailidis|editor2-first=Paul|title=Civic Media: Technology, Design, Practice|chapter=Participatory Action Research for Civic Engagement|date=2016|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-03427-2|pages=563–580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wassef Ali Hassoun''' ({{lang-ar|واصف علي حسون}}; born January 1, 1980) was a [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] who was charged with [[desertion]] for leaving his unit and engaging with others in a hoax to make it appear that he had been captured by [[terrorists]] on June 19, 2004 while serving in [[Iraq]]. Originally listed as having deserted, the [[Lebanese American|Lebanese]]-born U.S. Marine was then thought to have been taken hostage by Iraqis who were thought to have befriended him.

==Career==
[[Al Jazeera]] broadcast a video of Hassoun on June 27, 2004, blindfolded and with a masked man holding a sword over his head, saying that he had been captured. His "kidnappers" identified themselves as part of "Islamic Response", the security wing of the "National Islamic Resistance" 1920 Revolution Brigades. 

On July 3, 2004, Al Jazeera reported that the terrorist group [[Jaish Ansar al-Sunna]] had released a statement declaring they had beheaded Hassoun, and their website confirmed this. On July 4 it was reported al-Sunna denied this, and on July 6, Al Jazeera reported receipt of a message he'd been "taken to a safe location" after he promised to desert from the U.S. Marine Corps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/06/international/middleeast/06CND-MARI.html?hp (NYT)]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7, [[CNN]] reported that Hassoun had contacted his family in [[West Jordan, Utah]] and Lebanon from the [[U.S. Embassy]] in [[Beirut]], asking to be picked up at an unspecified location. The ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' stated later that afternoon his family, as well as the embassy in question, deny that the telephone call had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/2667565 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] spokesman [[Richard A. Boucher]] announced that Hassoun had arrived at the embassy in Beirut at 11 am EDT, and was in good health.

A preliminary result of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] investigation into the activities of Hassoun concluded that he deserted the U.S. Marine Corps on June 21, 2004. In mid-July, he publicly denied desertion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3908701.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2004, [[The Pentagon]] announced that Hassoun would be charged with desertion, larceny and wrongful disposition of military property in connection with his service-issued [[M9 pistol]] that disappeared with him and never turned up. If convicted, he faced a [[dishonorable discharge]], forfeiture of all pay, and from five to ten years [[incarceration]] on each specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/12/09/hassoun.desert/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further development, on January 4, 2005, he was again labelled a deserter after failing to return to his base in [[North Carolina]] from authorized leave. He reportedly fled to Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/01/05/hassoun.case/&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2014, Hassoun was reported to have turned himself in to U.S. authorities on the two charges of desertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=LMartinezABC|author=luis martinez|number=483349095625416705|date=29 June 2014|title=Double Marine deserter Cpl.

On February 23, 2015, Hassoun was found guilty of deserting when he disappeared in 2004 and 2005, and was convicted of causing the loss of his service pistol. His sentence amounts to two years and five days after credit for approximately eight months he spent in pretrial confinement. Hassoun also will have his rank reduced, lose his pay and receive a dishonorable discharge as part of the sentence. He was discharged in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/marine-who-vanished-in-iraq-in-04-found-guilty-of-desertion/ar-BBhT9OI?ocid=ansnewsap11&lt;/ref&gt;
