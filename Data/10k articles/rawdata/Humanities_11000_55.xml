'''''A Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression''''' is a non-fiction book by the economist [[Richard Posner]]. The text was initially published on May 1, 2009 by [[Harvard University Press]]. Posner criticizes President [[George W. Bush]] and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 36-37, 113, 139-140, 190, 228-229, 238-239, 248, 271-280, 287, 293, 301, 304-306, 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt; and moves away from his past well-known advocacy of [[free-market capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Baram" /&gt;  The book has been primarily noted not for his criticism of [[progressivism|progressive]] government policies (which he attacks again for good measure), but rather his critique of [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and its ideologues.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

The book has been received with generally good reviews from the press, including ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="Rauch"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/books/review/Rauch-t.html | accessdate = September 1, 2009 | work=The New York Times | first=Jonathan | last=Rauch | title=Capitalism's Fault Lines | date=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the reception has not been universally positive.&lt;ref name="Solow" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The primary argument of the book is that we have gone from a [[recession]] into a [[Depression (economics)|depression]] (the "D" word, as one author calls it)&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt; in 2009, and Posner suggests several possible short-term and long-term solutions to this fiscal crisis.  His thesis is not that government, politicians, or even bankers primarily caused this depression, but rather that the capitalist system is to blame for its own faults.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;"Seven questions for Richard Posner," Interview with Richard Posner, ''[[The Economist]]'', 6 June 2009, found at [https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2009/06/seven_questions_for_richard_po.cfm ''The Economist'' website]. Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt;

Some of the causes of the depression that Posner cites are the lack of enforceable [[usury]] laws, which would discourage risky loans,&lt;ref name="Posner, p. 291"&gt;Posner, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) and central banks taking risks,&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 45-46, 130"&gt;Posner, pp. 45-46, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; securitization of [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; illiquidity and insolvency of the banking system,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 41, 63-70, 128, 133, 201 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt; the housing bubble,&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 77-78"&gt;Posner, pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; blindness to warning signs of a crisis,&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 118-138"&gt;Posner, pp. 118-138.&lt;/ref&gt; and the preconceptions of ideology.&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 134-136, 310-316"&gt;Posner, pp. 134-136, 310-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner wraps up the book with a chapter containing several suggestions, including eventual re-regulation of the banking industry,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 289-291.&lt;/ref&gt; but warns that "this is not the time" to do so — a long-term solution after the economy recovers&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 291, see also pp. 291, 283-296.&lt;/ref&gt; — that can "wait calmer days."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also suggests putting off reorganization of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve until a later time.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 291-293, 302-303.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meanwhile, he writes, "piecemeal reforms may be feasible and helpful."&lt;ref name="Posner, p. 296"&gt;Posner, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;  These include a halt on government marketing of home ownership,&lt;ref name="Posner, p. 296"/&gt; requiring banks and financial institutions to "disclose the ''full'' compensation of all senior executives",&lt;ref&gt;(''Emphasis in the text'') Posner, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; backloading of compensation,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; increasing marginal [[income tax]] rates on the highest incomes,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[usury]] laws to discourage risky loans.&lt;ref name="Baram" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Posner, p. 291"/&gt;

==Criticism of George W. Bush==
The book is significant in Posner's criticism of President [[George W. Bush]] and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 36-37, 113, 139-141, 190, 228-229, 238-239, 248, 271-280, 287, 293, 301, 304-306, 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the shock is due to Posner's longtime "conservative" views.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/01/AR2009050101339.html | accessdate = September 8, 2009 | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul M. | last=Barrett | title=It's Not Your Fault. It's Theirs | date=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;  Judge Posner was nominated to the Seventh Circuit by [[Ronald Reagan]], but is "no party man."&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

Posner starts his criticism of Bush with a broad attack on his behavior in his final months as President:
{{quote|The lame-duck president seemed uninterested and uninformed about economic matters and was unable to project an image of leadership and instead spent his final months in office in frequent trips abroad and in legacy-polishing while the domestic economy melted away.|Richard Posner&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Posner blames Bush for pushing policies, such as the "ownership society",&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; a $10 trillion [[national debt]] and "the huge budget deficits run by the Bush administration",&lt;ref&gt;Posner, P. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; "prop[ping] up stock prices by keeping interest rates low,"&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt; which were underlying causes of the crisis, as well as "Dithering" in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the ''ownership society'', Posner referred to the [[American Dream Down Payment Act of 2003]] and other laws that made ownership easier.

Posner points out that Bush's proposed [[privatization]] of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] would have made the depression even more harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 228-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Posner states that one of the "lessons learned" is that the "blurred" line between "the government and the private sector ... in the Bush Administration" contributed to a lack of insight into the underlying problems.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even more so, "the emphatically pro-business philosophy of the Bush administration made the SEC too trusting of the securities industry."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bottom line is that "there might not have been a depression had it not been for the Bush administration's mismanagement of the economy."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of capitalism and mainstream economists==
Posner, famous for his advocacy of free markets, turns on free-market capitalism in this book: "the financial crisis is indeed a crisis of capitalism rather than a failure of government."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 240, bottom line.&lt;/ref&gt;  Posner explicitly states that he has changed his mind, that in the words of economist [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], "that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt;  Posner states that:
{{Quote|What [[Benjamin Bernanke|Bernanke]] and [[Alan Greenspan|Greenspan]] and the academy can be blamed for is overconfidence in their understanding of how to prevent a depression and, as a result, a failure to attend to warning signs and a lack of preparedness.|Posner&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Posner points out that one of the causes of the depression was "blindness to warning signs" of a crisis.&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 118-138"/&gt;  A few people had warned of problems, including [[Nouriel Roubini]],&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 124-125, 132-133, 138-139, 142-143, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brooksley Born]],&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; but they were ignored.  He asserts that the "depression is a failure of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the second and most powerful shock.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;  The ''New York Times'' points out that:
{{quote|It comes as something of a surprise that Posner, a doyen of the market-oriented law-and-economics movement, should deliver a roundhouse punch to the proposition that markets are self-correcting. It might also seem odd that a federal appellate judge (and University of Chicago law lecturer) would be among the first out of the gate with a comprehensive book on the financial crisis — if, that is, the judge were any other judge. But Posner is the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s successor as the country’s most omnivorous and independent-minded public intellectual.|Jonathan Rauch, ''New York Times''&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;}}

==Spreading the blame: Critiques of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, ''et al.''==
Posner also assigns part of the blame for the recession on the administration of [[Bill Clinton]].  He says they were to blame for pushing policies that created the [[housing bubble]].&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 77-78"/&gt;  The training and experience of several Clinton advisors, notably [[Robert Rubin]], were tilted towards [[Wall Street]], which he found to be ultimately dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 81, 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Alan Greenspan]], Clinton's appointee as chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], gets a special blame for pushing low [[interest rate]]s, which increased stock prices and led, in turn, to the bubbles in banking, stocks, and housing.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

Posner sweeps a wide swath in assigning portions of blame for causing the underlying recession on a variety of factors and persons.  He praises the use of specific deterrence in shaming debtors, which, in his mind, has not been used enough recently.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;  He faults the concept of [[limited liability]] for increasing risk.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 85-86, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  He points out the harmful focus on short-term profits at the expenses of long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 80, 94-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bad credit was, in Posner's words, given a "so what?" attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 101-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress encouraged home ownership by people who had bad credit and should have, in Posner's view, remained tenants.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 77-78, 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Competition in the banking industry led to deregulation in Clinton's administration, and enactment of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], which increased risk to the system.&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 45-46, 130"/&gt;  Posner is not alone in criticizing the ''Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act''; some economists, including Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]] also believe it helped create the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2007 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Baram, "Who's Whining Now? Gramm Slammed By Economists: 'Nation of Whiners' Comments Criticized by Finance Experts in Light of Current Crisis," [[ABC News]], September 19, 2008.  Found at [http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5835269 ABC News website].  Accessed March 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123665023774979341 | accessdate = March 29, 2010 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Damian | last=Paletta | title=Ten Questions for Those Fixing the Financial Mess | date=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Encouraging the practice of "sweeps" by large [[investor]]s (removing money from [[demand deposit]]s into [[money market fund]]s overnight) exacerbated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 20, 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preconceptions and [[ideology]] held by both sides of the spectrum, argues the book, prevented novel challenges to changing fiscal realities.&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 134-136, 310-316"/&gt;  [[Macroeconomics]] has not made use of [[chaos theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 131-134, 261 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and thus says Posner, the ''[[signal-noise ratio]]'' prevented a clear analysis and even created "blindness" and "misinformation" for policy analysts.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 118-138, 141-142, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner went on the record against ''how'' [[Barack Obama]]'s administration's [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] stimulus in the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA]] "could have been better designed," and specifically demurs against some of Obama's statements:
{{quote|But the harassment of business over compensation policies, and the impending federal takeover of General Motors, are negatives: they increase the uncertainty of the business environment, which dampens the incentive to invest, and shift the balance between government and business in the management of economic activity too far in favour of the government.|Richard A. Posner &lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;}}

Nonetheless, Posner points out that what is rational for an individual corporation may not be rational for the industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 107, 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Jonathan Rauch]] wrote that:
{{quote|By the last page, not a single lazy generalization has survived Posner’s merciless scrutiny, not one populist cliché remains standing. “A Failure of Capitalism” clears away whole forests of cant but leaves readers at a loss as to where to go from here. In other words, it is only a starting point — but an indispensable one.|Jonathan Rauch &lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;}}

The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' gave a long review, noting with a bit of ''[[schadenfreude]]'' that Posner had changed his views.&lt;ref name="Baram"&gt;Marcus Baram, "Judge Richard Posner Questions His Free-Market Faith In "A Failure Of Capitalism"," The ''[[Huffington Post]]'', April 20, 2009, found at [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/20/judge-richard-posner-disc_n_188950.html Huffington Post website].  Accessed September 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Casey, in a  review published in the ''[[Irish Times]]'', writes "Blaming the system is a cop-out.... Posner’s approach is far too deterministic", and further calls the book "[a]n incomplete analysis of a floundering social system."&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;Michael Casey, "An incomplete analysis of a floundering social system," August 24, 2009, found at [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/innovation/2009/0824/1224253135875.html Irish Times website].  Accessed September 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[Paul M. Barrett]], an assistant managing editor of ''[[Business Week]]'',  writes that Posner seems to spread the blame too much, denigrates mere stupidity and "greed" as causes, and lacks "constructive proposals for reform...."&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;  Barrett points out how notable this book is, which is that "his critique is bracing, all the more so because it comes from a right-leaning thinker normally hostile to the ministrations of government bureaucrats."&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

The ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' said that "it is at best a partial success; it gets some things right and some things wrong, and the items on both sides of the ledger are important."&lt;ref name="Solow"&gt;Robert M. Solow, "How to Understand the Disaster," ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' Volume 56, Number 8: May 14, 2009, found at [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22655 New York Review of Books website].  Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''Review'', Nobel Prize–winning economist [[Robert Solow]] praises the author quite faintly:

{{quote|I have to say that the prose in this book often reads as if it were written, or maybe dictated, in a great hurry. There is some unnecessary repetition, and many paragraphs spend more time than they should on digressions that seem to have occurred to the author in mid-thought. If not exactly chiseled, the prose is nevertheless lively, readable, and plainspoken. The haste may have been justified by the pace of the events he aims to describe and explain. Posner has an extraordinarily sharp mind, and what I take to be a lawyerly skill in argument. But I also have to say that, in some respects, his grasp of economic ideas is precarious.|Robert M. Solow&lt;ref name="Solow" /&gt;}}

Solow's review itself was notable to some degree, according to [[Brad DeLong]], who critiqued Posner's logic along the way:

{{quote|Yet while Posner insists on saving the appearance of individual rationality, he is willing to jettison the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]]'s conclusion that markets are everywhere and always perfect. As Robert Solow observed: "If I had written that, it would not be news. From Richard Posner, it is." Abandoning the conclusion of market perfection opens the door to the idea that government needs to properly check, balance, and regulate markets in order to help them function as well as possible. But clinging to the assumption of individual rationality forces Posner’s view of what regulation is appropriate into a very awkward straightjacket.&lt;ref name="DeLong"&gt;Brad DeLong, "The Chicago School is eclipsed," ''[[The Week]]'', May 29, 2009, found at [http://www.theweek.com/article/index/97134/The_Chicago_School_is_eclipsed]. Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an interview with ''[[The Economist]]'', Posner was forced to defend his use of the term "[[Depression (economics)|depression]]" and his move "to the centre..."&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine printed the preface of the book as a measure of its importance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2009/05/13/posner-preface-capitalism-opinions-business-visionaires-depression.html Forbes.com website].  September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' revisited ''A Failure of Capitalism'', noting that by September 2009, Posner had become a confirmed [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]: "As acts of betrayal go, this was roughly akin to [[Johnny Damon]]'s shaving off his beard, forsaking the [[Red Sox Nation]], and joining the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]."&lt;ref&gt;

It can denote a process (also called '''object abstraction''') in the development of language, whereby terms become used for concepts further removed from the objects to which they were originally attached. It can also denote a process applied by linguists themselves, whereby phenomena are considered without the details that are not relevant to the desired level of analysis.

==Object abstraction==
Object abstraction, or simply ''[[abstraction]]'', is a concept wherein terms for objects become used for more abstract concepts, which in some languages develop into further abstractions such as verbs and grammatical words ([[grammaticalisation]]). 
Abstraction is common in human language, though it manifests in different ways for different languages. In language acquisition, children typically learn object words first, and then develop from that vocabulary an understanding of the alternate uses of such words.

For example, the word "book" refers objectively to a physical object constructed with bound pages, but in abstraction refers to a particular literary creation &amp;mdash;regardless of how many physical copies of the "book" there are, it is one "book."&lt;ref&gt;Example taken from [[Chomsky]], [[BBC]] interview titled: "Silent Children, New Language"&lt;/ref&gt; The word "book" then developed more abstract uses, such as in keeping a record (bookkeeping), or to keep a record of betting (booking), or as a verb for entering persons into a record ("to book"). Words may then be further abstracted and even have  [[embedded pun]]s, such as in 'to make history of oneself' ("he booked").

An early example of this kind of study came from [[John Horne Tooke]], who in his [[conversational writing|conversational]] ''[[The Diversions of Purley]]'' (1786), proposed that the abstract word [[wikt:through|through]] came to English through both [[sound change]] and [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] from the [[Gothic language|Gothic]]:
:"For as the French peculiar preposition CHEZ is no other than the Italian substantive CASA or CA, so is the English preposition THOROUGH no other than the Gothic substantive ''dauro'', or the Teutonic substantive ''thuruh'': and like them, means door, gate, passage. I am persuaded that Door and Through have one and the same Gothic origin dauro, mean one and the same thing, and are in fact one and the same word."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[John McWhorter]], ''Understanding Linguistics,'' lecture series.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tooke was incorrect about "through," but his insights about the way words migrated via geography, language, sound change, and meaning were innovative, and fundamentally correct.

==Abstraction used by linguists==

===Syntax, semantics, and pragmatics===
The relation among [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]] has also been cashed out in terms of what could be called an "abstraction hierarchy." For instance, [[Rudolf Carnap]] in his ''Introduction to Semantics'' (1942, Harvard University Press) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If… explicit reference is made to the speaker, or, to put it in more general terms, to the user of a language, then we assign it to the field of pragmatics. (Whether in this case reference to designata is made or not makes no difference for this classification.) If we abstract from the user of the language and analyze only the expressions and their designata, we are in the field of semantics. And if, finally, we abstract from the designata also and analyze only the relations between the expressions, we are in (logical) syntax. The whole science of language, consisting of the three parts mentioned, is called semiotic. (p. 9)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A related statement was made a few years earlier by Carnap's fellow American philosopher [[Charles W. Morris]], PhD student of the sociologist and pragmatist philosopher [[George Herbert Mead]], and heavily influenced by the pragmatist and founder of (analytical) [[semiotics]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Syntactics, as the study of the syntactical relations of signs to one another in abstraction from the relations of signs to objects [i.e., semantics] or to interpreters [i.e., pragmatics], is the best developed of all the branches of semiotic." (p. 13)&lt;ref&gt;Morris CW. 1938. ''Foundations of the Theory of Signs''. (Volume 1, #2 of ''Foundations of the Unity of Science. Toward an International Encyclopedia of Unified Science''). University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The relation between abstraction and Morris' influential trichotomy is a matter of ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Korta, K, Perry, J, "Pragmatics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pragmatics/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emic units===
A kind of abstraction commonly considered in linguistics is the ''[[phoneme]]'', which abstracts [[speech sound]]s in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called "[[emic unit]]s") include [[morpheme]]s, [[grapheme]]s and [[lexeme]]s.

'''Amelia Ann Blanford Edwards''' (7 June 1831&amp;nbsp;– 15 April 1892), also known as '''Amelia B. Edwards''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Author Profile |website=Goodreads |url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/edit/62851.Amelia_B_Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English novelist, journalist, traveller and [[Egyptologist]]. Her most successful literary works included the ghost story "The Phantom Coach" (1864), the novels ''Barbara's History'' (1864) and ''Lord Brackenbury'' (1880), and the Egyptian travelogue ''A Thousand Miles up the Nile'' (1877). In 1882, she co-founded the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]]. She also edited a poetry anthology &lt;ref&gt;Entitled ''[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011157746 A Poetry-book of modern poets]''.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1878. Her address in London was 19 Wharton Street, [[Islington]].

==Early life==
[[File:Bust of Amelia Edwards, Petrie Museum, University College, London.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Amelia Edwards, [[Petrie Museum]], University College, London]][[File:Titian's_Birthplace.gif|thumb|Titian's Birthplace, drawn by Amelia Edwards in her book ''Untrodden Peaks and Unfrequented Valleys.''

Born in London to an Irish mother and a father who had been a [[British Army]] officer before becoming a banker, Edwards was educated at home by her mother and showed early promise as a writer. She published her first poem at the age of seven and her first story at the age of twelve. Thereafter came a variety of poetry, stories, and articles in several periodicals, including ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|Chambers's Journal]]'', ''[[Household Words]]'', and ''[[All the Year Round]]''. She also wrote for the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' and the ''[[Morning Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Bleiler 1986 140"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=E. F. Bleiler |last=Bleiler |first=E. F. |title=Edwards, Amelia B. |editor-last=Sullivan |editor-first=Jack |encyclopedia=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural |page=140 |publisher=Viking |location=New York |year=1986 |isbn=0-670-80902-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin F. Fisher IV 1985 255–260"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Benjamin F. Fisher IV |title=Amelia B. Edwards |editor-first=E. F. |editor-last=Bleiler |encyclopedia=Supernatural Fiction Writers |location=New York |publisher=Scribner's |year=1985 |pages=255–260 |isbn=0-684-17808-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Edwards became an artist and would illustrate some of her own writings. She would also paint scenes from other books she had read.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=8529|title=Edwards, Amelia Ann Blanford}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was talented enough at the age of 12 to catch the eye of [[George Cruikshank]], who went as far to offer to teach her, but this talent was not supported by Edwards's parents, who saw it as a lesser profession and the artist way of life as scandalous.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jenkins |first=Ruth Y. |date=2007 |title=More Usefully Employed: Amelia B. Edwards, Writer, Traveler and Campaigner for Ancient Egypt |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218898 |journal=Victorian Studies |volume=49 |pages=365–367 |via=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This negative decision haunted Edwards through her early life. She would wonder frequently whether art would not have been her true calling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly, Edwards took up composing and performing music for some years, until she suffered a bout of [[Typhus]] in 1849 that was followed by a frequently sore throat, which made it hard for her to sing, caused her to lose interest in music and even regret the time she had spent on opera.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; Other interests she pursued included pistol shooting, riding, and mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Fiction==
Early in the 1850s, Edwards began to focus more exclusively on being a writer.&lt;ref name="WomenStudies"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O'Neill |first=Patricia |date=2009 |title=Destination as Destiny|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/315516 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |volume=30 |pages=52–53 |via=Project MUSE |doi=10.1353/fro.0.0048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first full-length novel was ''My Brother's Wife'' (1855). Her early novels were well received, but it was ''Barbara's History'' (1864), a novel involving [[Polygamy|bigamy]], that established her reputation as a novelist. She spent much time and effort on the settings and backgrounds of her books, estimating that it took her about two years to complete the research and writing of each. This paid off when her last novel, ''Lord Brackenbury'' (1880), became a runaway success that went to 15 editions.

Edwards wrote several [[ghost stories]], including the frequently anthologised "The Phantom Coach" (1864).&lt;ref name="Bleiler 1986 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin F. Fisher IV 1985 255–260"/&gt; The background and characters in many of Edwards's writings are influenced by her own experiences. For example, ''Barbara's History'' (1864) uses [[Suffolk]] as the background, which she had visited for a few enjoyable summer holidays as a child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Dolomites==
[[File:The Monte Pelmo.jpg|left|thumb|The Monte Pelmo, as drawn by Edwards during her expedition to the Dolomites]]
Edwards first heard about the [[Dolomites]] in 1853, through sketches which had been brought back to England from Italy. On 27 June 1872, she embarked on a trip through the mountains with her friend Lucy Renshawe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Amelia Edwards Traveller, Novelist &amp; Egyptologist |last=Rees |first=Joan |publisher=The Rubicon Press |year=1998 |isbn= |location=London |pages=25–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Untrodden Peaks and Unfrequented Valleys |last=Edwards |first=Amellia |publisher=George Routledge and Sons|year=1890 |isbn= |location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day they left [[Monte Generoso]] for [[Venice]], one of the three known ways to enter the Dolomites, but not before they had parted from Renshawe's maid and courtier, who disapproved such a journey.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Instead the two women hired mountain guides from the region.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On 1 July 1872, after a three-day stay in Venice, Edwards and Renshawe left for [[Longarone]], [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Pieve di Cadore]], [[Auronzo di Cadore]], Val Buona, [[Caprile]], [[Agordo]], [[Primiero]], [[Predazzo]], [[Fassa Valley]], [[Passo Fedaia]], Sasso Bianco, [[Forno di Zoldo]], [[Zoppè di Cadore]] and Caprile, and ended their journey in [[Bolzano]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At the time of Edwards's visit, the Dolomites were described as being [[terra incognita]], and even educated persons had never heard of them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This journey was described in her book ''A Midsummer Ramble in the Dolomites (1873),'' later renamed ''Untrodden Peaks and Infrequent Valleys (1873)''.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; During the expedition, Edwards also searched for the works of [[Titian]], finding a Madonna and Child in [[Serravalle (Vittorio Veneto)]] and two other paintings at a village church in [[Cadore]].&lt;ref name="WomenStudies" /&gt; After her descent from the mountains, Edwards described civilized life as a "dead-level World of Commonplace".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the summer of 1873, dissatisfied by the end of their journey, Edwards and Renshawe took to a walking tour of France.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, this was interrupted by torrential rains, a factor that influenced them in looking towards Egypt.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

==Egypt==

[[File:Philæ from the South (1890) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philae]] (illustration from ''A Thousand Miles up the Nile'')]]

Edwards, accompanied by several friends, toured Egypt in the winter of 1873–1874, discovering a fascination with the land and its cultures, ancient and modern. Journeying southwards from [[Cairo]] in a hired [[dahabeah|dahabiyeh]] (manned houseboat), the party visited [[Philae]] and ultimately reached [[Abu Simbel]], where they remained for six weeks. Renshawe remained among her travelling companions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O'Neill |first=Patricia |date=2009 |title=Destination as Destiny|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.libproxy.mst.edu/article/315516 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |volume=30 |pages=52–53 |via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another party member was the English painter Andrew McCallum, who discovered an unknown sanctuary that came to bear his name for some time afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, Amelia B. |title=A Thousand Miles Up the Nile |location=London |publisher=G. Routledge &amp; Sons |date= 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their boat joined in a flotilla with another female English traveller, [[Marianne Brocklehurst]], also travelling with a female companion. Brocklehurst and Edwards remained friends and Brocklehurst later supported her Egypt Exploration fund. 

Edwards wrote a vivid description of her [[Nile]] voyage entitled ''A Thousand Miles up the Nile'' (1877).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Edwards, Amelia B.|title=A Thousand Miles up the Nile|location= London|publisher= Longmans|date= 1877 |edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nortoncreekpress.com/a_thousand_miles_up_the_nile.html |title=A Thousand Miles up the Nile |author=Edwards, Amelia B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enhanced with her own illustrations, this travelogue was an immediate best-seller.

Edwards' travels in Egypt made her aware of increasing threats to ancient monuments from tourism and modern development. She set out to hinder these through public awareness and scientific endeavour, becoming a tireless advocate for research and preservation of them. In 1882, she co-founded the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] with [[Reginald Stuart Poole]], Curator of the Department of Coins and Medals at the [[British Museum]]. Edwards became joint Honorary Secretary of the Fund until her death.

[[File:Great Rock-Cut Temple, Abou Simbel, Nubia (1890) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|Great Temple at [[Abu Simbel]] (from ''A Thousand Miles up the Nile'')]]

To advance the Fund's work, Edwards largely abandoned other writing in favour of [[Egyptology]]. She contributed to the ninth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/M/MUM/mummy.html |title=Mummy |author=Edwards, Amelia B. |work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition= 9th |volume=XVII |date=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the American supplement of that work, and to the ''[[Standard Dictionary]]''. In addition, Edwards embarked on an strenuous lecture tour in the United States in 1889–1890. These lectures were later published as ''Pharaohs, Fellahs and Explorers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, Amelia b. |url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/edwards/pharaohs/pharaohs.html |title=Pharaohs, Fellahs and Explorers |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |date=1891 |edition=online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After catching [[influenza]], Edwards died on 15 April 1892 at [[Weston-super-Mare]], having lived at [[Westbury-on-Trym]], Bristol since 1864.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Matthew, H.C.G &amp; Harrison, Brian, eds. |date=2004 |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |pages= 908–909 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |isbn= 0-19-861367-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rees, Joan |date=1998 |title=Amelia Edwards: Traveller, Novelist and Egyptologist |pages=19 and 66 |publisher=Rubicon Press |location=London |isbn=0-948695-61-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in the churchyard of [[St Mary the Virgin, Henbury|St Mary the Virgin]], [[Henbury]], Bristol, where her grave is marked by an [[obelisk]], with a stone [[ankh]] at the foot. Alongside is the graves of her companion, Ellen Drew Braysher (9 April 1804 – 9 January 1892), with whom she had lived in Westbury-on-Trym, and of Ellen's daughter, Sarah Harriet Braysher (1832–1864). In September 2016, [[Historic England]] designated the grave as [[Grade II listed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num=1439170 |desc=Grave of Amelia Edwards |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating it as a landmark in English [[LGBT]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37438800 |title='Queer history' landmarks celebrated by Historic England |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=23 September 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards bequeathed her collection of Egyptian antiquities and her library to [[University College London]], together with a sum of £2,500 to found an [[Edwards Professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology|Edwards Chair of Egyptology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rees, Joan |date=1998 |title=Amelia Edwards: Traveller, Novelist and Egyptologist |page=69 |publisher=Rubicon Press |location=London |isbn=0-948695-61-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards was also a benefactor of [[Somerville College Library]], having left many books, papers and watercolours to [[Somerville College, Oxford]], along with a small collection of Greek and Roman pots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/special-collections/ |website=some.ox.ac.uk |title=Special Collections |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48329">'''American civil religion''' is a [[sociological theory]] that a nonsectarian quasi-[[religious]] faith exists within the [[United States]] with sacred symbols drawn from national history. Scholars have portrayed it as a cohesive force, a common set of values that foster social and cultural integration. The very heavy emphasis on nondenominational religious themes is quite distinctively American and the theory is designed to explain this. The concept goes back to the 19th century, but in current form, the theory was developed by sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] in 1967 in his article, "Civil Religion in America". The topic soon became the major focus at [[sociology of religion|religious sociology]] conferences and numerous articles and books were written on the subject. The debate reached its peak with the [[American Bicentennial]] celebration in 1976.&lt;ref name = "RB"&gt;{{cite journal

|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/american.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the document of the [[United States Constitution]], along with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as cornerstones of a type of civic or [[civil religion]] or [[political religion]]. Political sociologist Anthony Squiers argues that these texts act as the sacred writ of the American civil religion because they are used as authoritative symbols in what he calls the politics of the sacred. The Politics of the Sacred, according to Squiers are "the attempt to define and dictate what is in accord with the civil religious sacred and what is not. It is a battle to define what can and cannot be and what should and should not be tolerated and accepted in the community, based on its relation to that which is sacred for that community."&lt;ref&gt;Squiers, A. (2018). The Politics of the Sacred in America: The Role of Civil Religion in Political Practice. New York: Springer. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-319-68870-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bellah, Americans embrace a common "civil religion" with certain fundamental beliefs, values, holidays, and rituals, parallel to, or independent of, their chosen religion.&lt;ref name = "jew" /&gt; Presidents have often served in central roles in civil religion, and the nation provides quasi-religious honors to its martyrs—such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the soldiers killed in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry S. Stout, ''Upon the Altar of the Nation: A Moral History of the Civil War'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have noted presidential level use of civil religion rhetoric in profoundly moving episodes such as [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael A. Genovese|title=Encyclopedia of the American Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaVozO5RyNwC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2010|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|page=89|isbn=9781438126388}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Civil Rights Movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Michael Manis|title=Southern Civil Religions in Conflict: Civil Rights and the Culture Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oq2d_TFALAEC&amp;pg=PA184|year=2002|publisher=[[Mercer University Press]]|page=184|isbn=9780865547858}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[September 11th attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George C. Edwards|author2=Desmond S. King|title=The Polarized Presidency of George W. Bush|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ahH0DRaFw0C&amp;pg=PA152|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=152|isbn=9780199217977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of more than fifty years of American civil religion scholarship, Squiers identifies fourteen principal tenets of the American civil religion:

# Filial piety
# Reference to certain sacred texts and symbols of the ACR (The Constitution, The Declaration of independence, the flag, etc.)
# The sanctity of American institutions 
# The belief in God or a deity
# The idea that rights are divinely given
# The notion that freedom comes from God through government
# Governmental authority comes from God or a higher transcendent authority 
# The conviction that God can be known through the American experience
# God is the supreme judge
# God is sovereign 
# America’s prosperity results from God’s providence 
# America is a ‘city on a hill’ or a beacon of hope and righteousness 
# The principle of sacrificial death and rebirth 
# America serves a higher purpose than self-interests

In an examination of over fifty years of political discourse, Squiers finds that Filial piety, Reference to certain sacred texts and symbols of the ACR, The belief in God or a deity, America is a ‘city on a hill’ or a beacon of hope and righteousness, and America serves a higher purpose than self-interests are the most frequently referenced. He further found that there are no statistically significant differences in the amount of American civil religious language between Democrats and Republicans, incumbents and non-incumbents nor Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Squiers, A. (2018). The Politics of the Sacred in America: The Role of Civil Religion in Political Practice. New York: Springer. p. 51-74. {{ISBN|978-3-319-68870-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief system has historically been used to reject nonconformist ideas and groups.&lt;ref name = "RB" /&gt; Theorists such as Bellah hold that American civil religion can perform the religious functions of integration, legitimation, and prophecy, while other theorists, such as Richard Fenn, disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Gehrig, "The American Civil Religion Debate: A Source for Theory Construction," ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', (March 1981) 20#1 pp. 51–63 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1385338 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of concept==
{{See also|Political religion|Civil religion}}
[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] believed that Christianity was the source of the basic principles of liberal democracy, and the only religion capable of maintaining liberty in a democratic era. He was keenly aware of the mutual hatred between Christians and [[French liberalism|liberals]] in 19th-century France, rooted in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]]. In France, Christianity was allied with the Old Regime before 1789 and the reactionary [[Bourbon Restoration]] of 1815-30. However he said Christianity was not antagonistic to democracy in the United States, where it was a bulwark against dangerous tendencies toward [[individualism]] and [[materialism]], which would lead to [[atheism]] and tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Kessler, "Tocqueville on Civil Religion and Liberal Democracy," ''[[Journal of Politics]],'' 39#1 (1977), pp. 119–46 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2129689 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important were the contributions of French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) and French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).

===The American case===
Most students of American civil religion follow the basic Bellah/Durkheimian interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Marcela Cristi, ''From civil to political religion: the intersection of culture, religion and politics'' (2001) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of this idea include philosopher [[John Dewey]] who spoke of "common faith" (1934); sociologist Robin Murphy Williams' ''American Society: A Sociological Interpretation'' (1951) which stated there was a "common religion" in America; sociologist [[Lloyd Warner]]'s analysis of the [[Memorial Day]] celebrations in "Yankee City" (1953 [1974]); historian [[Martin Marty]]'s "religion in general" (1959); theologian [[Will Herberg]] who spoke of "the [[American Way of Life]]" (1960, 1974); historian [[Sidney Mead]]'s "religion of the Republic" (1963); and British writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], who said that the United States was "the only nation ... founded on a creed" and also coined the phrase "a nation with a soul of a church".&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "e" /&gt;

In the same period, several distinguished historians such as Yehoshua Arieli, [[Daniel Boorstin]], and Ralph Gabriel "assessed the religious dimension of '[[nationalism]]', the 'American creed', 'cultural religion' and the 'democratic faith'".&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;

Premier sociologist [[Seymour Lipset]] (1963) referred to "Americanism" and the "American Creed" to characterize a distinct set of values that Americans hold with a quasi-religious fervor.&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;

Today, according to social scientist Ronald Wimberley and William Swatos, there seems to be a firm consensus among social scientists that there is a part of Americanism that is especially religious in nature, which may be termed civil religion. But this religious nature is less significant than the "transcendent universal religion of the nation" which late eighteenth century French intellectuals such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] wrote about.&lt;ref name = "e" /&gt;

===Evidence supporting Bellah===
Ronald Wimberley (1976) and other researchers collected large surveys and factor analytic studies which gave support to Bellah's argument that civil religion is a distinct cultural phenomenon within American society which is not embodied in American politics or denominational religion.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Examples of civil religious beliefs are reflected in statements used in the research such as the following:
* "America is God's [[New Jerusalem#Puritan|chosen nation]] today."
* "A president's authority ... is from God."
* "Social justice cannot only be based on laws; it must also come from religion."
* "God can be known through the experiences of the American people."
* "Holidays like the [[Fourth of July]] are religious as well as patriotic."&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;
* "God Bless America"
Later research sought to determine who is civil religious. In a 1978 study by James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley, the researchers found that a wide cross section of American citizens have civil religious beliefs. In general though, college graduates and political or religious liberals appear to be somewhat less civil religious. [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Catholicism|Catholics]] have the same level of civil religiosity. Religions that were created in the United States, the [[Latter Day Saints movement]], [[Adventism|Adventists]], and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], have the highest civil religiosity. Jews, Unitarians and those with no religious preference have the lowest civil religion. Even though there is variation in the scores, the "great majority" of Americans are found to share the types of civil religious beliefs which Bellah wrote about.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Further research found that civil religion plays a role in people's preferences for political candidates and policy positions. In 1980 Ronald Wimberley found that civil religious beliefs were more important than loyalties to a political party in predicting support for Nixon over McGovern with a sample of Sunday morning church goers who were surveyed near the election date and a general group of residents in the same community. In 1982 James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley found that civil religion was second only to occupation in predicting a person's political policy views.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Coleman has argued that civil religion is a widespread theme in history. He says it typically evolves in three phases: undifferentiation, state sponsorship in the period of modernization, differentiation. He supports his argument with comparative historical data from Japan, Imperial Rome, the Soviet Union, Turkey, France and The United States.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Coleman, "Civil Religion," ''Sociological Analysis,'' Summer 1970, 31#2 pp. 67–77 {{doi|10.2307/3710057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil religion in practice==

===American Revolution===

The [[American Revolution]] was the main source of civil religion. It produced a [[Moses]]-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]]), apostles ([[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]]), rituals (raising the [[Liberty Tree]]), flags (the [[Betsy Ross flag]]), sacred holidays ([[Independence Day (United States)|July 4th]]) and a holy scripture (The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]).&lt;ref&gt;Catherine L. Albanese, ''Sons of the Fathers: The Civil Religion of the American Revolution'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonies in the early Republic===
[[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|right|thumbnail|upright=1.3|''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'', as seen looking up from the capitol rotunda]]
The elitists who ran the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party.&lt;ref&gt;David Waldstreicher, ''In the midst of perpetual fetes: The making of American nationalism, 1776–1820'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Elections remained of central importance but for the rest of the political year celebrations, parades, festivals, and visual sensationalism were used. They employed multiple festivities, exciting parades, and even quasi-religious pilgrimages and "sacred" days that became incorporated into the American civil religion. George Washington was always its hero, and after his death he became a sort of [[demigod]] looking down from heaven to instill his blessings on the party.&lt;ref&gt;John Ferling, ''The ascent of George Washington: The hidden political genius of an American Icon'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the Federalists focused on commemoration of the ratification of the Constitution;  they organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers, incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation's new civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Heideking, "The federal processions of 1788 and the origins of American civil religion." ''[[Soundings (journal)|Soundings]]'' (1994): 367–87. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41178897 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth of July became a semi-sacred day—a status it maintains in the 21st century. Its celebration  in Boston proclaimed national over local patriotism, and included orations, dinners, [[Militia (United States)|militia]] musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks. By 1800, the Fourth was closely identified with the Federalist party. Republicans were annoyed, and stage their own celebrations on the fourth—with rival parades sometimes clashing with each other. That generated even more excitement and larger crowds. After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth became a nonpartisan holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Len Travers, "Hurrah for the Fourth: Patriotism, Politics, and Independence Day in Federalist Boston, 1783–1818." ''[[Essex Institute]] Historical Collections'' 125: 129–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Coe, et al. ''The Rhetoric of American Civil Religion: Symbols, Sinners, and Saints'' ([[Lexington Books]], 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===President as leader of civil religion===
Since the days of George Washington presidents have assumed one of several roles in American civil religion, and that role has helped shape the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G., Hutcheson, Jr., ''God in the White House: How Religion Has Changed the Modern Presidency'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James David Fairbanks, "The Priestly Functions of the Presidency: A Discussion of the Literature on Civil Religion and Its Implications for the Study of Presidential Leadership," ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (1981) 11:214–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Linder argues that:

{{quote|Throughout American history, the president has provided the leadership in the public faith. Sometimes he has functioned primarily as a national prophet, as did Abraham Lincoln. Occasionally he has served primarily as the nation's pastor, as did Dwight Eisenhower. At other times he has performed primarily as the high priest of the civil religion, as did Ronald Reagan. In prophetic civil religion, the president assesses the nation's actions in relation to transcendent values and calls upon the people to make sacrifices in times of crisis and to repent of their corporate sins when their behavior falls short of the national ideals. As the national pastor, he provides spiritual inspiration to the people by affirming American core values and urging them to appropriate those values, and by comforting them in their afflictions. In the priestly role, the president makes America itself the ultimate reference point. He leads the citizenry in affirming and celebrating the nation, and reminds them of the national mission, while at the same time glorifying and praising his political flock.&lt;ref name="Robert D. Linder 1996, pp 733-49"&gt;Robert D. Linder, "Universal pastor: President Bill Clinton's civil religion," ''[[Journal of Church and State]],'' Autumn 1996, 38#4 pp 733–49&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charles W. Calhoun]] argues that in the 1880s the speeches of [[Benjamin Harrison]] display a rhetorical style that embraced American civic religion; indeed, Harrison was one of the credo's most adept presidential practitioners. Harrison was a leader whose application of Christian ethics to social and economic matters paved the way for the [[Social Gospel]], the [[Progressive Movement]] and a national climate of acceptance regarding government action to resolve social problems.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Calhoun, "Civil religion and the gilded age presidency: The case of Benjamin Harrison," ''Presidential Studies Quarterly,'' Fall 1993, 23#4 pp. 651–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Linder argues that President Bill Clinton's sense of civil religion was based on his [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] background in [[Arkansas]]. Commentator [[William Safire]] noted of the 1992 presidential campaign that, "Never has the name of God been so frequently invoked, and never has this or any nation been so thoroughly and systematically blessed."&lt;ref&gt;Barry A. Kosmin and Seymour Lachman, ''One Nation Under God: Religion in Contemporary American Society'' (1994) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton speeches incorporated religious terminology that suggests the role of pastor rather than prophet or priest. With a universalistic outlook, he made no sharp distinction between the domestic and the foreign in presenting his vision of a world community of civil faith.&lt;ref name="Robert D. Linder 1996, pp 733-49"/&gt;

Brocker argues that Europeans have often mischaracterized the politics of President [[George W. Bush]] (2001–2009) as directly inspired by [[Protestant fundamentalism]]. However, in his speeches Bush mostly actually used civil religious metaphors and images and rarely used language specific to any Christian denomination. [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|His foreign policy]], says Bocker, was based on American security interests and not on any fundamentalist teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Brocker, "Civil Religion, Fundamentalism, and the Politics and Policies of George W. Bush," ''Journal of Political Science,'' Jan 2004, Vol. 32, pp. 95–124&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammer says that in his 2008 campaign speeches candidate [[Barack Obama]] portrays the American nation as a people unified by a shared belief in the American Creed and sanctified by the symbolism of an American civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie. Hammer, "The role of narrative in political campaigning: An analysis of speeches by Barack Obama," ''[[National Identities]],'' Sept 2010, 12#3, pp. 269–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Would-be presidents likewise contributed to the rhetorical history of civil religion. The speeches of [[Daniel Webster]] were often memorized by student debaters, and his 1830 endorsement of "Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable" was iconic.&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Smith, ''Daniel Webster and the Oratory of Civil Religion'' (2005) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism of the American flag===
According to Adam Goodheart, the modern meaning of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], and the reverence of many Americans towards it, was forged by Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]]'s fight in defense of the flag at the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], which opened the [[American Civil War]] in April 1861. During the war the flag was used throughout the Union to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism. Goodheart explains the flag was transformed into a sacred symbol of patriotism:

{{quote|Before that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory ... and displayed on special occasions like the Fourth of July. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flew ... from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. ... [T]hat old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Goodheart|title=1861: The Civil War Awakening|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCPbnsUPhB0C&amp;pg=PA22|year=2011|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|page=22|isbn=9781400032198}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Soldiers and veterans===
An important dimension is the role of the soldiers, ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. They are memorialized in many monuments and semi-sacred days, such as [[Veterans Day]] and [[Memorial Day]]. Historian Jonathan Ebel argues that the "soldier-savior" is a sort of Messiah, who embodies the synthesis of civil religion, and the Christian ideals of sacrifice and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan H. Ebel, ''G.I. Messiahs: Soldiering, War, and American Civil Religion'' (2015) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, there are numerous cemeteries exclusively for American soldiers who fought in world wars. They have become American sacred spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan H. Ebel, "Overseas military cemeteries As american sacred space: mine eyes have seen la gloire." ''Material Religion'' 8#2 (2012): 183–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacifists have made some sharp criticisms. For example, Kelly Denton-Borhaug, writing from the [[Moravian College|Moravian]] peace tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Denton-Borhaug,  "Sharing Peace: Mennonites and Catholics in Conversation eds. by Gerald W. Schlabach and Margaret Pfeil," ''American Catholic Studies'' 125#2 (2014): 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  argues that the theme of "sacrifice" has fueled the rise of what she calls "U.S. war culture." The result is a diversion of attention from what she considers the militarism and the immoral, oppressive, sometimes barbaric conduct in the global American war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Denton-Borhaug, ''U.S. War-Culture, Sacrifice and Salvation'' (2011) pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Protestant denominations such as the [[Churches of Christ]], have largely turned away from [[pacifism]] to give greater support to patriotism and civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Casey, "From Pacifism to Patriotism: The Emergence of Civil Religion in the Churches of Christ During World War I." ''[[Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'' 66#3 (1992): 376–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pledge of Allegiance===
Kao and Copulsky argue the concept of civil religion illuminates the popular constitutional debate over the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. The function of the pledge has aspects: preservationist, pluralist, priestly, and prophetic. The debate is not between those who believe in God and those who do not, but it is a dispute on the meaning and place of civil religion in America.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Y. Kao and Jerome E. Copulsky, "The Pledge of Allegiance and the Meanings and Limits of Civil Religion," ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]],'' March 2007, 75#1, pp. 121–49 {{doi|10.1093/jaarel/lfl065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud explores political oaths since 1787 and traces the tension between a need for national unity and a desire to affirm religious faith. He reviews major [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions involving the Pledge of Allegiance, including the contradictory ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'' (1940) and ''[[West Virginia v. Barnette]]'' (1943) decisions. He argues that the Pledge was changed in 1954 during the Cold War to encourage school children to reject communism's atheistic philosophy by affirming belief in God.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew W. Cloud, "'One Nation, Under God': Tolerable Acknowledgement of Religion or Unconstitutional Cold War Propaganda Cloaked in American Civil Religion?" ''[[Journal of Church and State]],'' Spring 2004, 46#2 pp. 311–40, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jchs46&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page= online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===School rituals===
[[Adam Gamoran]] (1990) argues that civil religion in public schools can be seen in such daily rituals as the pledge of allegiance; in holiday observances, with activities such as music and art; and in the social studies, history and English curricula. Civil religion in schools plays a dual role: it socializes youth to a common set of understandings, but it also sets off subgroups of Americans whose backgrounds or beliefs prevent them from participating fully in civil religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gamoran, "Civil Religion in American Schools," ''SA: Sociological Analysis,'' Fall 1990, 51#3 pp. 235–56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic minorities===
The Bellah argument deals with mainstream beliefs, but other scholars have looked at minorities outside the mainstream, and typically distrusted or disparaged by the mainstream, which have developed their own version of U.S. civil religion.

====White Southerners====
Wilson, noting the historic centrality of religion in [[Southern United States|Southern]] identity, argues that when the [[White Southerners|White South]] was outside the national mainstream in the late 19th century, it created its own pervasive common civil religion heavy with mythology, ritual, and organization. Wilson says the "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]"—that is, defeat in a holy war—has left some southerners to face guilt, doubt, and the triumph of what they perceive as evil: in other words, to form a tragic sense of life.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reagan Wilson, "The Religion of the Lost Cause: Ritual and the Organization of the Southern Civil Religion, 1865–1920," ''Journal of Southern History,'' May 1980, 46#2 pp. 219–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reagan Wilson, ''Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865–1920'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Black and African Americans====
Woodrum and Bell argue that [[African Americans|black people]] demonstrate less civil religiosity than [[White Americans|white people]] and that different predictors of civil religion operate among black and white people. For example, conventional religion positively influences white people's civil religion but negatively influences black peoples' civil religion. Woodrum and Bell interpret these results as a product of black American religious ethnogenesis and separatism.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Woodrum, and Arnold Bell, "Race, Politics, and Religion in Civil Religion Among Blacks," ''SA: Sociological Analysis,'' Winter 1989, 49#4 pp. 353–67&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese Americans====
Iwamura argues that the pilgrimages made by [[Japanese Americans]] to the sites of World War II-era [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] have formed a Japanese American version of civil religion. Starting in 1969 the Reverend Sentoku Maeda and Reverend Soichi Wakahiro began pilgrimages to [[Manzanar|Manzanar National Historic Site]] in California. These pilgrimages included poetry readings, music, cultural events, a roll call of former internees, and a nondenominational ceremony with Protestant and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ministers and Catholic and [[Shinto]] priests. The event is designed to reinforce Japanese American cultural ties and to ensure that such injustices will never occur again.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Naomi Iwamura, "Critical Faith: Japanese Americans and the Birth of a New Civil Religion," ''[[American Quarterly]],'' Sept 2007, 59#3, pp. 937–968, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/aq/summary/v059/59.3iwamura.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hispanic and Latino Americans====
[[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] labor leader [[César Chávez]], by virtue of having holidays, stamps, and other commemorations of his actions, has practically become a "saint" in American civil religion, according to León. He was raised in the Catholic tradition and using Catholic rhetoric. His "sacred acts," his political practices couched in Christian teachings, became influential to the burgeoning Chicano movement and strengthened his appeal. By acting on his moral convictions through nonviolent means, Chávez became sanctified in the national consciousness, says León.&lt;ref&gt;Luis D. León, "Cesar Chavez in American Religious Politics: Mapping the New Global Spiritual Line." ''[[American Quarterly]],'' Sep 2007, 59#3 pp. 857–81, {{doi|10.1353/aq.2007.0060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enshrined texts==
[[File:Archives of the United States of America 1.jpg|thumb|The [[National Archives Building]] in [[Washington, DC]].]]

Christian language, rhetoric, and values helped colonists to perceive their political system as superior to the corrupt British monarchy. Ministers' sermons were instrumental in promoting patriotism and in motivating the colonists to take action against the evils and corruption of the British government. Together with the semi-religious tone sometimes adopted by preachers and such leaders as George Washington,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Scott Smith, "The American Moses," ''Christian History and Biography,'' Summer 2008, Issue 99, pp. 8–13&lt;/ref&gt; and the notion that God favored the patriot cause, this made the documents of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] suitable as almost-sacred texts.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kidd, ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp. 4, 37, 59, 112, 115,&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Archives Building]] in Washington preserves and displays the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. [[Pauline Maier]] describes these texts as enshrined in massive, bronze-framed display cases.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Gordon S. Wood, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/aug/14/dusting-off-the-declaration/ "Dusting off the Declaration]," ''The New York Review of Books,'' Aug 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; While political scientists, sociologists, and legal scholars study the Constitution and how it is used in American society, on the other hand, historians are concerned with putting themselves back into a time and place, in context. It would be anachronistic for them to look at the documents of the "Charters of Freedom" and see America's modern "civic religion" because of "how much Americans have transformed very secular and temporal documents into sacred scriptures".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; The whole business of erecting a shrine for the worship of the Declaration of Independence strikes some academic critics looking from point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as "idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution." It was suspicious of religious iconographic practices. At the beginning, in 1776, it was not meant to be that at all.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gordon S., op.cit., Aug 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 1782 [[Great Seal of the United States]], the date of the Declaration of Independence and the words under it signify the beginning of the "new American Era" on earth. Though the inscription, ''Novus ordo seclorum'', does not translate from the Latin as "secular", it also does not refer to a new order of heaven. It is a reference to generations of society in the western hemisphere, the millions of generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatseal.com/mottoes/seclorum.html Great Seal] webpage. Viewed August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even from the vantage point of a new nation only ten to twenty years after the drafting of the Constitution, the Framers themselves differed in their assessments of its significance. Washington in his Farewell Address pleaded that "the Constitution be sacredly maintained."' He echoed Madison in "[[Federalist No. 49]]", that citizen "veneration" of the Constitution might generate the intellectual stability needed to maintain even the "wisest and freest governments" amidst conflicting loyalties. But there is also a rich tradition of dissent from "Constitution worship". By 1816, Jefferson could write that "some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the [[ark of the covenant]], too sacred to be touched." But he saw imperfections and imagined that potentially, there could be others, believing as he did that "institutions must advance also".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=115}}

Regarding the [[United States Constitution]], the position of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is that it is a [[divinely inspired]] document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1992/02/the-divinely-inspired-constitution?lang=eng |title=The Divinely Inspired Constitution |author=Dallin H. Oaks |date=Feb 1992 |publisher=''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.77-80#p76 D&amp;C 101:77–80]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh-Day Adventists===
While the civil religion has been widely accepted by practically all denominations, one group has always stood against it. [[Seventh-day Adventism|Seventh-Day Adventists]] deliberately pose as "heretics", so to speak, and refuse to perform in the sacred ceremonies like the Pledge of Allegiance or saluting the flag or treating Sundays as special. Indeed, says Bull, the denomination has defined its identity in contradistinction to precisely those elements of the host culture that have constituted civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bull, "The Seventh-Day Adventists: Heretics of American Civil Religion'' ''Sociological Analysis,'' April 1989, 50#2, pp. 177–87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making a nation==
The American identity has an ideological connection to these "Charters of Freedom". [[Samuel P. Huntington]] discusses common connections for most peoples in nation-states, a national identity as product of common ethnicity, ancestry and experience, common language, culture and religion. Levinson argues:

{{quote|It is the fate of the United States, however, to be different from "most peoples," for here national identity is based not on shared Proustian remembrances, but rather on the willed affirmation of what Huntington refers to as the "American creed," a set of overt political commitments that includes an emphasis on individual rights, majority rule, and a constitutional order limiting governmental power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sanford Levinson|title=Constitutional Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VhWFCJ4sQa8C&amp;pg=PA95|year=2011|publisher=Princeton UP|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The creed, according to Huntington,  is made up of (a) individual rights, (b) majority rule, and (c) a constitutional order of limited government power. American independence from Britain was not based on cultural difference, but on the adoption of principles found in the Declaration. Whittle Johnson in ''[[The Yale Review]]'' sees a sort of "covenanting community" of freedom under law, which, "transcending the 'natural' bonds of race, religion and class, itself takes on transcendent importance".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=118}}

Becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States requires passing a test covering a basic understanding of the Declaration, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and taking an oath to support the U.S. Constitution. [[Hans Kohn]] described the United States Constitution as "unlike any other: it represents the lifeblood of the American nation, its supreme symbol and manifestation. It is so intimately welded with the national existence itself that the two have become inseparable." Indeed, abolishing the Constitution in Huntington's view would abolish the United States, it would "destroy the basis of community, eliminating the nation, [effecting] ... a return to nature."{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=119}}

As if to emphasize the lack of any alternative "faith" to the American nation, Thomas Grey in his article "The Constitution as scripture", contrasted those traditional societies with divinely appointed rulers enjoying heavenly mandates for social cohesion with that of the United States. He pointed out that Article VI, third clause, requires all political figures, both federal and state, "be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution, but no religious test shall ever be required ..." This was a major break not only with past British practice commingling authority of state and religion, but also with that of most American states when the Constitution was written.{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=120}}

'''Escape clause.''' Whatever the oversights and evils the modern reader may see in the original Constitution, the Declaration that "all men are created equal"—in their rights—informed the Constitution in such a way that [[Frederick Douglass]] in 1860 could label the Constitution, if properly understood, as an antislavery document.&lt;ref name="slavenorth1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=http://www.slavenorth.com/massemancip.htm |title=Emancipation in Massachusetts |work=Slavery in the North |date=January 2004 |accessdate=January 28, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040128112051/http://www.slavenorth.com/massemancip.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that "the constitutionality of slavery can be made out only by disregarding the plain and common-sense reading to the Constitution itself. [T]he Constitution will afford slavery no protection when it shall cease to be administered by slaveholders," a reference to the Supreme Court majority at the time.&lt;!-- ref name=autogenerated6 --&gt;{{sfn|Levinson|1987|pp=129–30, 133}} With a change of that majority, there was American precedent for judicial activism in Constitutional interpretation, including the Massachusetts Supreme Court, which had ended slavery there in 1783.&lt;ref name="slavenorth1"/&gt;

Accumulations of Amendments under Article V of the Constitution and judicial review of Congressional and state law have fundamentally altered the relationship between U.S. citizens and their governments. Some scholars refer to the coming of a "second Constitution" with the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], we are all free, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]], we are all citizens, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], men vote, and the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]], women vote. The Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted so as to require States to respect citizen rights in the same way that the Constitution has required the Federal government to respect them. So much so, that in 1972, the U.S. Representative from Texas, [[Barbara Jordan]], could affirm, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total ...".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|pp=129–30, 133}}

After discussion of the [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] provision for change in the Constitution as a political stimulus to serious national consensus building, [[Sanford Levinson]] performed a thought experiment which was suggested at the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution in Philadelphia. If one were to sign the Constitution today,&lt;ref&gt;The visitor to the National Archives website today is invited to sign the Constitution online. Viewed September 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; whatever our reservations might be, knowing what we do now, and transported back in time to its original shortcomings, great and small, "signing the Constitution commits one not to closure but only to a process of becoming, and to taking responsibility for the political vision toward which I, joined I hope, with others, strive."{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=144}}

{{about||the broader meaning of "bar" in [[law|legal]] contexts|Bar (law)|the ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' episode|Bar Association (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)}}

A '''bar association''' is a [[professional association]] of [[lawyer]]s. Some bar associations are responsible for the regulation of the legal profession in their [[jurisdiction]]; others are professional organizations dedicated to serving their members; in many cases, they are both. In many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, the bar association comprises lawyers who are qualified as [[barrister]]s or [[advocate]]s in particular, versus [[solicitor]]s (see ''[[bar council]]''). Membership in bar associations may be mandatory or optional for practicing attorneys, depending on [[jurisdiction]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Bar (law)}}
The use of the term ''[[bar (law)|bar]]'' to mean "the whole body of lawyers, the legal profession" comes ultimately from [[England|English]] custom. In the early 16th century, a [[wikt:railing|railing]] divided the hall in the [[Inns of Court]], with students occupying the body of the hall and readers or [[bencher]]s on the other side. Students who officially became lawyers crossed the [[symbol]]ic physical barrier and were "admitted to the bar".&lt;ref name=etymologyonline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bar|title=Etymology: Bar |accessdate=December 11, 2006|publisher=EtymologyOnline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this was popularly assumed to mean the wooden railing marking off the area around the judge's seat in a courtroom, where prisoners stood for arraignment and where a [[barrister]] stood to plead.  In modern courtrooms, a railing may still be in place to enclose the space which is occupied by legal [[counsel]] as well as the [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[defendant]]s and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[litigant]]s who have business pending before the court.

==In Commonwealth jurisdictions==
{{main|Bar council}}
In many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, including [[Barristers in England and Wales|in England and Wales]], the "bar association" comprises lawyers who are qualified as [[barrister]]s or [[advocate]]s (collectively known as "the bar", or "members of the bar"), while the "[[law society]]" comprises [[solicitor]]s. These bodies are sometimes mutually exclusive, while in other jurisdictions, the "bar" may refer to the entire community of persons engaged in the [[practice of law]].

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], one is ''[[Call to the bar|called to the bar]]'' after undertaking a post-[[Law school|law-school]] training in a [[province|provincial]] law society program, and undergoing an [[apprenticeship]] or ''taking articles''. Legal communities are called ''provincial [[Law society|law societies]]'', except for [[Nova Scotia]], where it is called the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, and [[Quebec]], where it is called the ''[[Barreau du Quebec]]''.

The Canadian Bar Association (and its provincial and territorial branches) is a professional association of barristers, solicitors and avocats that serves the roles of advocates for the profession, provides continuing legal education and member benefits. It does not play a part in the regulation of the profession, however.

===India===
In [[India]] under the legal framework set established under the Advocates Act, 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ADVOCATES ACT, 1961 |url=http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=''[[Bar Council of India]]'' |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a law graduate is required to be enrolled with the [[Bar Council of India]]. The process of enrollment is delegated by the Bar Council of India to the state Bar Councils wherein almost each [[States of india|state]] has a Bar Council of its own. Once enrolled with a State Bar Council, the law graduate is recognized as an [[Advocate#Advocates_in_India|Advocate]]  provisionally for a period of two years, within which they must clear the All India Bar Examination (AIBE) conducted by the Bar Council of India. Once the advocate clears the AIBE test, they are entitled to appear and practice before any court of law in India. There is no formal requirement for further membership of any Bar Association. However, Advocates do become members of various local or national bar associations for reasons of recognition and facilities which these associations offer. Some well-known Bar Associations in India include the [http://www.scbaindia.org/ Supreme Court Bar Association], [http://dhcba.com/ Delhi High Court Bar Association], [http://bombaybar.com/ Bombay Bar Association], [http://delhibarassociation.com/ Delhi Bar Association], National Bar Association of India, All India Bar Association, etc.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], a person becomes a licensee of a Provincial Bar Council after fulfilling certain requirements. He must have a valid law degree [[LL.B]] from a recognized university by the Pakistan Bar council, must offer certain undertakings, and pay the Provincial Bar Council fees. Furthermore, he shall  join any bar association as a member. Tehsil bar associations work under the umbrella  of District Bar Association, District Bar Association under Provincial Bar councils, such as the [[Punjab Bar Council]] and [[Sindh Bar Council]]. To become an advocate, one must first complete six months [[pupillage]] with a practising advocate of High Court, whom they must assist on at least ten cases during a six-month pupillage.

==In the United States==
:''Membership in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions.''
::—[[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], ''In re Rouss'', 221 N.Y. 81, 84 (1917)
[[Image:Massbar.jpg|thumb|right|Sign outside the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts]]
In the United States, [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] is permission granted by a particular court system to a lawyer to practice law in that system. This is to be distinguished from membership in a bar association. In the United States, some states require membership in the [[state bar association]] for all attorneys, while others do not.

Although bar associations historically existed as unincorporated [[voluntary association]]s, nearly all bar associations have since been organized (or reorganized) as [[corporation]]s.  Furthermore, membership in some of them (see the next section below) is no longer voluntary, which is why some of them have omitted the word "association" and merely call themselves the "state bar" to indicate that they ''are'' the incorporated body that constitutes the entire admitted legal profession of a state.

===Mandatory, integrated, or unified bar associations===
Some states require membership in the state's bar association to practice law there. Such an organization is called a mandatory, integrated, or unified bar,&lt;ref&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul: Thomson West, 2006), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The concept of the integrated bar was discussed in ''[[Keller v. State Bar of California]],'' {{ussc|496|1|1990}}, in which the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] agreed with the [[Supreme Court of California]] that the state could force lawyers to join the [[State Bar of California]] and pay fees as a condition of practicing law in the state. However, the Court then went on to hold that the state bar could not force lawyers to pay for political and ideological activities with which they did not agree.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a type of [[government-granted monopoly]].  They exist at present in a slight majority of [[U.S. state]]s: [[Alabama State Bar|Alabama]], [[Alaska Bar Association|Alaska]], [[State Bar of Arizona|Arizona]], [[State Bar of California|California]], [[The Florida Bar|Florida]], [[State Bar of Georgia|Georgia]], [[Hawaii State Bar Association|Hawaii]], [[Idaho State Bar|Idaho]], [[Kentucky Bar Association|Kentucky]], [[Louisiana State Bar Association|Louisiana]], [[Maine State Bar Association|Maine]], [[State Bar of Michigan|Michigan]], [[The Mississippi Bar|Mississippi]], [[The Missouri Bar|Missouri]], [[State Bar of Montana|Montana]], [[Nebraska State Bar Association|Nebraska]], [[State Bar of Nevada|Nevada]], [[New Hampshire Bar Association|New Hampshire]], [[State Bar of New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[State Bar Association of North Dakota|North Dakota]], [[Oklahoma Bar Association|Oklahoma]], [[Oregon State Bar|Oregon]], [[Rhode Island Bar Association|Rhode Island]], [[South Carolina Bar|South Carolina]], [[State Bar of South Dakota|South Dakota]], [[State Bar of Texas|Texas]], [[Utah State Bar|Utah]], [[Virginia State Bar|Virginia]], [[Washington State Bar Association|Washington State]], [[State Bar of West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[State Bar of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming State Bar|Wyoming]].  The [[District of Columbia Bar|District of Columbia]], the [[Bar of the U.S. Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam Bar Association|Guam]] and the [[CNMI Bar Association|Northern Mariana Islands]] also have unified bars. The mandatory status of the [[Puerto Rico Bar Association]] was eliminated in 2009 by an act of the legislature, ratified by recently appointed majority of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. By act of the Puerto Rico legislature, the mandatory status was reinstated in June, 2014.  The [[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico]] struck down this act in October, 2014, finding that it unconstitutionally usurped its powers.  

In some states, like Wisconsin, the mandatory membership requirement is implemented through an order of the [[state supreme court]], which can be revoked or canceled at any time at the court's discretion. In others, like Oregon, the state legislature passed a law and created a government agency. California went farther than any other state and wrote the State Bar of California into [[California Constitution|its constitution]].

The first state to have an integrated bar association was North Dakota in 1921.&lt;ref name=fried&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Lawrence M.|authorlink1=Lawrence M. Friedman|title=American Law in the Twentieth Century|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0300102994|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUNjxn3RvVAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary bar associations===
A [[Voluntary association|voluntary]] bar association is a private organization of lawyers. However, the membership may not be restricted only to registered lawyers. The membership can extend to people interested in goals and purpose of the Association. Each Association chooses its own purposes (e.g., social, educational, and lobbying functions), but does not regulate the practice of law or admit lawyers to practice.

There is a statewide voluntary bar association in every state that has no mandatory or integrated bar association. There are also many voluntary bar associations organized by city, county, or other community. Such associations are often focused on common professional interests (such as [[bankruptcy]] lawyers or in-house counsel) or common [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] interests (such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], or [[nation]]al heritage), such as the [[Hispanic National Bar Association]]. The [[American Bar Association]] is the voluntary bar association with the largest membership. Such associations often advocate for law reform and provide information in [[bar journals]], [[pro bono]] services or a [[lawyer referral service]] to the general public. In 2017, the [[California State Legislature]] split off the education, lobbying, and young lawyers sections of that state's Bar in order to create the voluntary California Lawyers Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calawyers.org|title=California Lawyers Association|author=|date=|website=calawyers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no mandatory federal bar association. The [[Federal Bar Association]] is a private, voluntary group. 

There are also a number of subject-specific private associations, which are not ''officially'' denominated as bar associations but which serve similar functions in terms of providing their members with useful publications, networking opportunities, and [[continuing legal education]]. The largest association of defense counsel is the [[Defense Research Institute]] (the "Voice of the Defense Bar"), while the largest association of plaintiffs' counsel is the [[American Association for Justice]] (formerly Association of Trial Lawyers of America). The [[National Lawyers Guild]] (NLG) is an association of progressive attorneys and legal workers, founded as the first national lawyer's association with membership open to all races and religions.  

Most American law schools have a [[student bar association]], which is a [[student organization]] that fulfills various functions, including sometimes serving as the [[Students' union|student government]].

===Judges===
[[Judge]]s may or may not be members of the bar. Etymologically, they sit "on the bench", and the [[Legal case|cases]] which come before them are "at bar" or "at bench".  Many states in the United States require that some or all judges be members of the bar; typically these limit or completely prohibit the judges from practicing law while serving as a judge.

The [[U.S. Constitution]] contains no requirement that Federal judges or [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices be members of the bar. However, there are no modern instances of the President nominating or the Congress approving any candidate who is not a member of any bar. There are various professional associations of judges, such as the American Judges Association,  that perform some of the educational and other service functions of bar associations.

The '''Buffett Rule''' is part of a tax plan proposed by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Carrie Budoff Brown. [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63756.html "Obama's 'Buffett Rule' to call for higher tax rate for millionaires".] ''[[Politico]]'', September 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The tax plan would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on individuals making more than one million dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buffett Rule: a Basic Principle of Tax Fairness |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/Buffett_Rule_Report_Final.pdf|publisher=[[United States National Economic Council]] |date=April 2012|accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s2059is/pdf/BILLS-112s2059is.pdf|title=S.2059 - Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a White House official, the new tax rate would directly affect 0.3 percent of taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Distribution of Average Tax Rates (Individual Income Tax and Employee Payroll Tax) Buffett Rule.JPG|thumb|Distribution of average tax rates including individual income tax and employee payroll tax.]]

The Buffett Rule is named after American investor [[Warren Buffett]], who publicly stated in early 2011 that he believed it was wrong that rich people, like himself, could pay less in federal taxes, as a portion of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased income taxes on the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html|title=Stop Coddling the Super-Rich|last=Buffett|first=Warren|date=August 14, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule would implement a higher minimum tax rate for taxpayers in the highest income bracket, to ensure that they do not pay a lower percentage of income in taxes than less-affluent Americans.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14962769 | title=US economy: New Obama plan to tax wealthiest | work=BBC News | date=September 18, 2011 | accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Senate leader [[Harry Reid]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]–[[Nevada|Nev.]]) proposed a 5.6 percent surtax on everyone making over a million dollars a year to pay for new stimulus provisions, but the change did not go through.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Tapper. [https://news.yahoo.com/buffett-rule-tax-set-30-percent-obama-speech-023903437.html "Buffett rule tax set at 30 percent: Obama speech’".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128110435/http://news.yahoo.com/buffett-rule-tax-set-30-percent-obama-speech-023903437.html |date=January 28, 2012 }} ''[[Yahoo News]]'', January 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A White House statement released in January 2012 defined the rule as part of "measures to ensure everyone making over a million dollars a year pays a minimum [[Tax rate#Effective|effective tax rate]] of at least 30 percent ... implemented in a way that is equitable, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions."&lt;ref name=ctj/&gt; The White House also stated that "no household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle-class family pays."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/economy/buffett-rule |title=The Buffett Rule &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buffett Rule was not in the President's 2012 budget proposal and the White House initially stressed it as a guideline rather than a legislative initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Lowrey. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/us/politics/white-house-sees-buffett-tax-rule-more-as-a-guide.html "The Buffett Tax Rule Is Really More of a Guideline".] ''[[New York Times]]'', February 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule, however, was later submitted for deliberation as [[US Senate]] Bill S. 2059, ''Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012''.&lt;ref name="gpo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2230:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status  -  112th Congress (2011 - 2012)  - S.2230 - THOMAS (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2012, the bill received 51 affirmative votes, but was stopped by a Republican [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] that required 60 votes to proceed to debate and a vote on final passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerist.com/2012/04/senate-blocks-buffett-rule-with-51-45-vote.html|title=Senate Blocks Buffett Rule With 51-45 Vote|work=Consumerist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehouse2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-04-16/senate-fails-to-pass-buffett-rule/54324786/1 |title= Bill defeat | work=USA Today | date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible effects==

If enacted, the rule change would result in $36.7 billion per year in additional tax revenue ($367 billion over the next decade), according to a January 2012 analysis by the [[Tax Foundation]], a [[think tank]].&lt;ref name=boak&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=3B1556AF-A13F-476F-AD68-42FA17D5C0CA|title=Buffett Rule's impact?

If the 2001-2010 tax cuts do not expire as scheduled, estimated Buffett Rule revenues would total $162 billion over the decade.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2012/05/02/why-the-buffett-rule-would-raise-more-revenue-than-critics-say/|title=Why The Buffett Rule Would Raise More Revenue Than Critics Say|first=Roberton|last=Williams|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|accessdate=May 6, 2012|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative study released that same month by the [[Citizens for Tax Justice]], a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[think tank]] which favors the change, stated that the change would add $50 billion per year in tax revenue ($500 billion over the decade).&lt;ref name=ctj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctj.org/taxjusticedigest/archive/2012/01/ctj_calculates_buffett_rule_wo.php|title=CTJ Calculates Buffett Rule Would Raise $50 Billion in One Year and Affect Only the Richest 0.08 Percent of Taxpayers|publisher=[[Citizens for Tax Justice]]|date=January 27, 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation]] released a letter in March 2012 estimating that the Buffett Rule would raise $46.7 billion over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|title=Memo On "Buffett Rule" Revenue Estimates|url=http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/joint-committee.pdf|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divergent estimates come about because of different assumptions about the details of the Buffett Rule. For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation assumes that many high-income taxpayers would reduce the amount of capital gains realized in one year to fall beneath the Buffett Rule threshold.

The estimated $47 billion would offset by 0.7% the $6.4 trillion increase in spending over the next decade estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, based on President Obama's 2013 budget plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buffett Rule Tax Bill Would Raise $47 Billion Over 10 Years |author=Richard Rubin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-20/buffett-rule-tax-bill-would-raise-31-billion-over-10-years |work=Businessweek |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the higher estimate from the Tax Foundation, the estimated $367 billion would offset by 5.7% the $6.4 trillion spending over the next decade.

The 2013 budget proposed by the Obama administration stated that the Buffett Rule should replace the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=

Part of the reason for the inequality in taxation is that revenue from long-term [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains]] is taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Government Subsidizes Wealth Inequality |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/tax-reform/report/2014/06/25/92656/how-the-government-subsidizes-wealth-inequality/|work=Center for American Progress |date=June 25, 2014 |accessdate=Aug 1, 2014 |first=Harry |last=Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's not entirely clear how many individuals would be affected by the change. An October 2011 study by the [[Congressional Research Service]] found that a 30% minimum tax rate rule would mean up to 200,000 taxpayers, equivalent to 0.06% of all U.S. citizens, paying more.&lt;ref name=boak/&gt;

==Reactions and public opinion==

===Support===
[[Paul Krugman]], a ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist and [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist, wrote in January 2012 that "such low taxes on the very rich are indefensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/politics-policy-and-public-interest/2012/apr/30/case-buffett-rule/
|title=The Case for the Buffett Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "the economic record certainly doesn’t support the notion that superlow taxes on the superrich are the key to prosperity" asserting that since the U.S. economy added 11.5 million jobs during President Bill Clinton's first term, when the capital gains tax rate was over 29 percent, he thinks there's no real reason to keep from raising the tax rate.&lt;ref name=krugman&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Paul Krugman]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/opinion/krugman-taxes-at-the-top.html|title=Taxes at the Top|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[CBS News]]/''[[New York Times]]'' poll released in January 2012 found that 52 percent of Americans agreed that investments should be taxed at the same rate as income.&lt;ref name=caldwell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57365416-503544/obama-details-buffett-rule-says-millionaires-should-pay-at-least-30-percent-tax-rate/|title=Obama details "Buffett Rule," says millionaires should pay at least 30 percent tax rate|publisher=[[CBS News]]|first=Leigh Ann|last=Caldwell|date=January 25, 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll released in April 2012 also found that 60 percent of Americans support the rule. A similar poll released later that month by [[CNN]] found that 72 percent of Americans support the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/13/news/la-pn-gallup-poll-buffett-rule-20120413 |title=Gallup poll: 60% back Obama's 'Buffett Rule' - Los Angeles Times |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times''|date=April 13, 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-17 |first=Michael A. |last=Memoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geiger |first=Kim |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-polls-americans-divided-over-taxes-but-support-buffett-rule-20120416,0,433493.story |title=Polls: Americans divided over taxes but support 'Buffett Rule' |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times''|date= April 16, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Byzantium: The Early Centuries''''' (1989) is a [[popular history]] book written by English historian [[John Julius Norwich]], published by [[Viking Press|Viking]].

== Content ==
In the book, Norwich covers the period 286-802 AD, from the establishment of the [[Tetrarchy]] by [[Diocletian]] and the beginning of the [[Dominate]] in the [[Roman Empire]] to the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] and the deposition of the Empress [[Irene of Athens]]. Norwich progresses through the demise of the tetrarchic system and the rise of [[Constantine the Great]] as sole emperor, the foundation of [[Constantinople]] at the site of ancient [[Byzantium]] and the declaration of [[Christianity]] as state religion and the failure of [[Julian the Apostate]]'s pagan reaction. Norwich then describes the period when the empire was split into two entities, one in the [[Western Roman Empire|west]] and one in the east, which became known as the East Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]]. Norwich narrates the fall of the western empire and the era of [[Justinian I]], the wars with the Persians under [[Heraclius]], the beginning of the [[Muslim conquests]] and the eastern empire's fight for survival in the 7th century. The reaction to [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] and the fall of the [[Isaurian dynasty]] lead to the ascension of Irene of Athens, and in turn to the coronation of the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Charlemagne]] as emperor in Christmas 800 in Rome by the Pope. Norwich chooses this event, which marks the end of the Byzantines' sole claim to imperial status and the unquestioned acceptance by the West of the emperor at Constantinople as sole head of all Christendom, as the decisive moment which defines the end of the early Byzantine period.

== Reviews ==
"The reader is conveyed in comfort, as it were in a very superior hovercraft, which glides smoothly over all the unevennes of the ground, to the regular, melodious sound of the author's prose." (''[[Sunday Times]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on cover of Penguin edition, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

"He is brilliant... He writes like the most cultivated modern diplomat, attached by a freak of time to the Byzantine court, with intimate knowledge, tactful judgement and a consciousness of the surviving monuments." (''[[The Independent]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on cover of Penguin edition, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received a lukewarm review from ''[[The New York Times]]''. Norwich's writing was described as "plummy" and the historical detail he brings to the period is praised, but the reviewer thought at times the narrative was distant and the descriptions overly ornate.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, G.W. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/books/when-istanbul-was-constantinople.html "When Istanbul was Constantinople"]. ''The New York Times'' (April 16, 1989). Retrieved March 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The book became a ''New York Times'' bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/books/best-sellers-april-23-1989.html "New York Times Bestsellers: April 23, 1989"] ''The New York Times'' (April 23, 1989) Retrieved March 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6067">The '''Chicago Cultural Alliance''' is a consortium of community-based ethnic [[museums]], [[cultural center]]s, and [[historical societies]] in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].

Incorporated in 2006, the mission of the Alliance is to "effect social change and public understanding of cultural diversity through first voice perspectives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoculturalalliance.org/about/mission.asp CCA | Our Mission | Chicago Cultural Alliance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030233745/http://www.chicagoculturalalliance.org/about/mission.asp |date=October 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Alliance began through partnerships with [[ethnic]] and cultural organizations established at the ''Cultural Connections'' program at the [[Field Museum]] in The Center for Cultural Understanding and Change (CCUC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/culturalconnections/partners_chicago.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318032603/http://www.fieldmuseum.org/culturalconnections/partners_chicago.asp |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance brings together ethnically grounded organizations in order to build relationships amongst the ethnic communities in [[Chicago]], as well as asserting their existence to the wider public. Kerstin Lane, the first Alliance Board President, described the reasoning behind the creation of the organization: "a lot of people in Chicago have no idea there are little jewels of ethnic museums all over the city. When these museums can go out and tell the city, state and others, 'We exist,' then each of them will be strengthened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/feb/13/news/chi-0213culturalfeb13 |title=Featured Articles From The Chicago Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2009-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708100339/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/ |archive-date=2011-07-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17137">The '''conservation and restoration of clocks''' refers to the care given to a clock to either prevent or resolve issues faced during its life cycle. The variety of materials from which a clock may be constructed and the complexity of [[clockwork]] warrant such care to be taken by a clock owner so that a clock can continue to function.

== Preventive conservation ==
Proper handling, suitable storage and display environments, and regular maintenance can together prevent issues from arising and impacting a clock’s sustainability. Such controls can extend the life of a clock.

=== Handling ===
Certain precautionary measures taken by a clock handler can deny opportunities for damage to occur:
[[File:Pendulum_removed_from_clockwork.jpg|thumb|right|150x300px|Pendulum removed from clockwork.]]
* Loose items worn by a handler have the potential to come into contact with and cause damage to a clock. Removal of these items prior to clock handling can lower the risk of damage. 
* Wearing “[...] cotton or rubber gloves when handling the metal portions of the clock” &lt;ref name=Fahey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Mary M.|title=The Care and Preservation of Clocks|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/clocks.aspx|website=Benson Ford Research Center|publisher=The Henry Ford|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; can limit opportunities for transfer of contaminants from hands to clock surfaces. 
* [[Pendulum]] damage during clock movement can be prevented by either removing the pendulum or fixing it within the interior of the clock via a latch or padding prior to clock movement.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; This can also prevent damage to other interior components.
* A clock "[...] should always be grasped at its most sturdy area" &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; and moved from one location to the next on its back. 
* The correlation of the size of a clock with the number of people moving it can ensure the safety of the clock. A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.

=== Storage and display ===
Proper storage and display mechanisms can work to ensure a clock’s safety. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment "[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.” &lt;ref name=ICON&gt;{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-CareClocks.asp|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.

==== Humidity and temperature levels ====
The [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock’s condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.
:a. '''Wood clocks'''
:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:b. '''Metal clocks'''
:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Regular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation.

==== Condition checks ====
Visual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. 
:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''
:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock’s history, as “[...] various “dirt” or “salt” deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as “the abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of “sandpaper [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined “[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; 
:b. '''Winding and setting'''
:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.

== Typical types of damage ==
Damage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused.

=== Human interaction ===

:a. '''Mishandling'''
:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock’s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving “unsightly and potentially damaging marks.” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock “[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.
:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''
:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as “[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily”,&lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; as well as by turning the key one too many times. 
:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.&lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, “Rather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; 
:c. '''Unsuitable storage or display''' 
:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock’s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.
:d. '''Improper cleaning and polishing'''
:Many cleaners and polishers contain properties that “[...] have been proven to age poorly.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can “[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; 
:e. '''Improper lubrication'''
:Attempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in “[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or "Poor-quality oil" on clockwork, which "can become sticky leading to mechanical problems." &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to “the use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it “[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt;

=== Natural causes ===

:a. '''Humidity and temperature'''
:The amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. “[...] extremes in temperature and humidity” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near "a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements." &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; 
:b. '''Pests'''
:Clocks are as susceptible to pest damage as any other object constructed from organic materials. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:
:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such “[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:c. '''Light'''
:Over-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration “[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or “alligatored” appearance.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:d. '''Contaminants'''
[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]
:Contaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  
:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock’s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. 
:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.

=== Types of clock damage ===
Damage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.

==== Wood damage ====
Due to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Such changes in character from the wood’s original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include “[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives." &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

==== Metal damage ====
Similar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This “[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

==== Finish or paint damage ====
Finish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock’s surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products “can actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.

==== Interior or clockwork damage ====
Clockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.

== Conservation and restoration ==
Interventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.

=== Conservators ===

A [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to “[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as “Sometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].” &lt;ref name=NAWCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.

=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===
[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that "The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey’s Pagoda Clock|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. "After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criccieth Castle''' ({{lang-cy|Castell Cricieth}}) is a native [[Wales|Welsh]] [[castle]] situated on the headland between two beaches in [[Criccieth]], [[Gwynedd]], in [[North Wales]], on a rocky [[peninsula]] overlooking [[Tremadog Bay]]. It was built by [[Llywelyn the Great]] of the [[kingdom of Gwynedd]] but it was heavily modified following its capture by English forces of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in the late 13th century.

==Construction==
Although the stone castle was begun in the 1230s, there were three main building phases plus several periods of remodelling.  The earliest part of the masonry castle is the [[inner ward]] which was started by Llywelyn the Great. Unlike most other Welsh native strongholds, the inner ward at Criccieth was protected by a [[gatehouse]] with twin D-shaped towers that was protected by a gate and portcullis, with murder holes in the passage, and outward facing [[arrowslit]]s in each tower. This design might have been copied from English designs on the [[Marches]] at [[Beeston Castle]], [[Cheshire]] or [[Montgomery Castle]], [[Powys]]. The two towers of the gatehouse provided accommodation and their height was later increased in the Edwardian period.  The castle's well was also in the gatehouse passage which was supplied by a spring fed cistern.

In the 1260s or 1270s, an outer ward was added during the second building phase under [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]].  A new gateway was added in the outer [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain]] with a large two-storey rectangular tower.  The castle, although not a proper [[concentric castle|concentric]] design, now had two circuits of circular defences.

Criccieth was taken by English forces in 1283. Under [[James of Saint George]], another two storey rectangular tower connected to the rest of the castle by a curtain wall, the "Engine Tower" (now in ruins) might have been the foundation for a [[siege engine]]. The gatehouse had another storey added and several Welsh mural towers were strengthened. An outer [[barbican]] was added to the outer curtain wall.

Under Welsh stewardship, the principal residence was in the SW tower but when the castle was taken over by the English, accommodation was situated in the towers of the D-shaped gatehouse. Timber buildings, which included a [[great hall]], were erected within the inner ward.

==History==
A [[Motte and bailey]] stood at a different site in Criccieth before the masonry castle was built. In 1283 the castle was captured by English under the command of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. It was then remodelled by [[James of St George]].

In 1294, [[Madoc ap Llywelyn]], a distant relation of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], began an uprising against English rule that spread quickly through Wales.  Several English-held towns were razed and Criccieth (along with [[Harlech Castle]] and [[Aberystwyth Castle]]) were besieged that winter. Its residents survived until spring when the castle was resupplied.

In the 14th century the castle had a notable Welsh constable called [[Hywel ap Gruffydd]], known as Howell the Axe, who fought for [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] at the [[Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356.

The castle was used as a prison until 1404 when Welsh forces captured the castle during the rebellion of [[Owain Glyndŵr]]. The Welsh then tore down its walls and set the castle alight. Some stonework still show the scorch marks.

Criccieth was also one of several locations [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artist [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] used for his famous series of paintings depicting shipwrecked mariners.

==Present day==
The castle is maintained by [[Cadw]]. It includes exhibits and information on Welsh castles as well as the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] writer [[Gerald of Wales]].

==Constable==
The constable of the castle was ''ex officio'' also the Mayor of Criccieth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4628">The '''Croatian Language Corpus''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski jezični korpus}}, HJK) is a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] compiled at the [[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics]] ([[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics|IHJJ]]).

== Background ==
The CLC was initially funded as a sub-project of the research program ''Riznica'' (''Croatian Language Repository'') by the [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|Ministry of Science, Education, and Sports of the Republic of Croatia]] ([[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|MZOŠ]]) (project no. 0212010) from May 2005. In a second development phase, since 2007, the further extension and development of the CLC was embedded within the research program ''The Croatian Language Repository'' (CLR) that was granted by the [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|MZOŠ]] (cf. Ćavar and Brozović Rončević, 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://riznica.ihjj.hr/CLC-Slavicorp.pdf Ćavar and Brozović Rončević, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;). Being a research program (PI [[Dunja Brozović Rončević]]) with numerous subsumed independent research projects that make use of the CLC, the corpus is mainly developed as a by-product of those research projects within the CLR. Currently [[Dunja Brozović Rončević]] and [[Damir Ćavar]] are in charge of the corpus development.

== Goals ==
One of the main goals of the CLC project is to create a publicly available [[Croatian language|Croatian]] [[Text corpus|corpus]] that is annotated on multiple levels, i.e. [[Lemmatization|lemmatized]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] segmented and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morpho-syntactically]] annotated, [[phonemic]]ally transcribed and syllabified, and syntactically parsed. While the current version of the [[Text corpus|corpus]] provides resources from the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] language standard, several [[Text corpus|corpora]] from different development phases of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] are created as well, including the digitizations of manuscripts and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dictionaries.

== Format and Availability ==
From the outset, the collected and digitized texts in the CLC were annotated using the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] ([[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]]) P5 [[XML]] standard. Currently approx. 90 mil. tokens are available in the [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] P5 [[XML]] format. The [[Text corpus|corpus]] can be accessed online via the Philologic&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/philologic3/home Philologic]&lt;/ref&gt; interface (see The ARTFL Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ARTFL/ The ARTFL Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, [[University of Chicago|The University of Chicago]]). It is virtualized into various sub-corpora, and individual or specific definitions of sub-corpora can be provided on demand.

The CLC is assembled from selected text of [[Croatian language|Croatian]], covering various functional domains and genres. It includes literature and other written sources from the period of the beginning of the final shaping of the standardization of the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] language, i.e. from the second half of the 19th century on.

The CLC consists of:
* fundamental Croatian literature (e.g. novels, short stories, drama, poetry)
* non-fiction
* scientific publications from various domains and University textbooks
* school books
* translated literature from outstanding [[Croatian language|Croatian]] translators
* online journals and newspapers
* books from the pre-standardization period of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] that are adapted to nowadays standard [[Croatian language|Croatian]]

== Cooperation ==
The realization of the CLC was made possible in cooperation with:
* [[Školska knjiga|Školska knjiga d.d.]]
* [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (HAZU)]]
* Stoljeća hrvatske književnosti, [[Matica hrvatska]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22101">The '''First Congress on the French Language in Canada''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Premier Congrès de la langue française au Canada'') was held in [[Quebec City]] from June 24 to June 30, 1912. Its stated objective was to "examine the questions raised by the defence, the culture and the development of the French language and literature in  Canada.&lt;ref&gt;CLFC (1912). ''Premier Congrès de la langue française au Canada. Québec, 24-30 juin, 1912. Compte rendu'', Québec: Imprimerie de l'Action sociale, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;"

== Organization ==
[[File:Carte postale Congrès langue française.jpg|thumb|Post card in memory of the 1st Congress on the French Language in America]]On February 14, 1911, the executive office of the [[Société du parler français au Canada]] (SPFC) resolved to organize and convoke a Congress on the French Language in Canada to be held in the course of 1912, in Quebec City, under the patronage of [[Université Laval]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The SPFC set up an organizing committee composed of ten of its members,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul-Eugène Roy]], ''president''; [[N.-A. Belcourt]], [[Thomas Chapais]] and [[P.-A. Landry]], ''vice-presidents''; [[S.-A. Lortie]], ''treasurer''; [[Philéas Fillion]], ''deputy treasurer''; [[Adjutor Rivard]], ''secretary general''; [[Élie Auclair]], [[Joseph-Évariste Prince]], [[Camille Roy]] and [[Amédée Denault]], ''deputy secretaries'';&lt;/ref&gt; under the presidency of Mgr [[Paul-Eugène Roy]], in order to set the date of the congress and see to the preparation of the event.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Some two months later, on April 10, while the organizing was in progress, the committee sent a message "to all the [[French Canadian]]s and to all the [[Acadian]]s who have at heart the conservation of their language and their nationality&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;" to invite them to take part to this first congress from Monday June 24 to Sunday June 30. While the Congress's name mentions the French language "in Canada", the organizers explicitly addressed their invitation to all the French speakers of America. Regional committees were formed by the general organizing committee to recruit members as much in [[Quebec]] as in [[Ontario]], [[Western Canada]], in the [[Atlantic provinces]] or the [[United States]].

The organizing committee, wanting to make the congress a milestone event, sought the participation of civil society and the representatives of political and religious powers. The Quebec government, headed by [[Liberal Party of Quebec|Liberal]] [[premier of Quebec|premier]] [[Lomer Gouin]] was very favourable to holding the Congress in the historical capital of Quebec. In addition to the rooms of the Université Laval, the congress members were granted access to the rooms of the provincial [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]].

The opening of the Congress on June 24 was intended to associate the event with a great day of patriotism and confer to it a solemn, popular and festive character. On June 23 and 24, just before the official opening of the Congress, its members were invited to participate to the "[[National Holiday (Quebec)|National Day of the French Canadians]]" which was organized by the Saint-Sauveur de Québec chapter of the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society|Association Saint-Jean-Baptiste]] (ASJB) and other affiliated branches. As part of the programme were the traditional mass, procession, banquet, speeches, entertainment, etc.

At 8:00 PM on June 24, the opening session of the Congress held in the ''Salle des exercices militaires'' on [[Grande Allée]] street was the occasion of great pomp with music and speeches from the principal officers of the Congress, the [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec|Lieutenant Governor]] [[François Langelier]], members of the Catholic clergy, the former [[prime minister of Canada]] [[Wilfrid Laurier]], the premier of Quebec Lomer Gouin, [[Charles-Eudes Bonin]], of the [[general consulate of France]] in Quebec City, [[Étienne Lamy]], delegate of the [[Académie française]], the [[List of mayors of Quebec City|mayor of Quebec]] [[Napoléon Drouin]], ministers from the provinces of Ontario and the Maritimes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The room was decorated with the flags of [[British flag|Great Britain]], [[Red Ensign|Canada]], [[Blue Ensign|Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;It was the Quebec [[Blue Ensign]] since the present [[fleurdelisé]] was adopted only in 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French flag|France]], the [[American flag|United States]], and also the [[Flag of Quebec|Carillon Sacré-Cœur]]. The musicians played [[God Save the Queen]], the [[national anthem]] of both Great Britain and the Dominion of Canada, [[Ô Canada]], then the national anthem of French Canadians, as well as other patriotic or traditional airs such as ''[[Vive la Canadienne]]'', ''[[À la claire fontaine]]'', ''[[Ô Canada! mon pays, mes amours]]'', etc.

== Progression ==
The Congress was made of four study sections: scientific, pedagogical, literary and propaganda. It held eight general sessions in addition to the various sessions of each section which occurred independently under the direction of their own executive office. In the sessions held by the study sections, participants presented memoirs, gave speeches, deliberated and formulated "vows" and propositions related to their study field. In the general sessions, participants gave patriotic speeches on the French language and ''rapporteurs'' gave an account of the work done by the sections before all congress members. The assembly of all congress members ratified the reports and voted for or against the vows and propositions coming from the sections.

Individuals who became member of the congress received a 96-page ''Guide du congressiste'', and a medal badge crafted by [[Alexandre Morlon]]&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; on which were carved the words of French poet [[Gustave Zidler]]: ''C'est notre doux parler qui nous conserve frères.'' ("It is our gentle speech that keeps us brothers.")

[[File:Honore Mercier Quebec.JPG|thumb|Monument to [[Honoré Mercier]], north of the Grande Allée, in front of the Parliament of Quebec. Inaugurated on June 25, 1912.]]In addition to the serious work of the different study sections, the programme of the Congress included activities of a more symbolic character such as the inauguration, Tuesday June 25 at 3:00PM, of the monument to [[Honoré Mercier]] on the Quebec parliamentary hill, the awarding of honorific diplomas from the Université Laval, as well as other activities that today would be judged "touristic", such as the Wednesday June 26 morning expedition to the [[Petit-Cap]], the summer residence of the ''Messieurs'' of the [[Séminaire de Québec]], located in [[Saint-Joachim (Quebec)|Saint-Joachim de Montmorency]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott [[Charles Thellier de Poncheville]] and poet Gustave Zidler, who arrived on the morning of June 26, took part to this excursion where congress members feasted, sang songs, read poems, and gave more speeches.

Friday June 28 was reserved to the delegates of [[New England]], [[Armand Bédard]], president of the Boston [[Franco-American Historical Society]] and Mr. [[Henri-T. Ledoux]], president of the [[Union Saint-Jean-Baptiste d'Amérique]], who came to Quebec to give the right hour on the situation of the francophone communities in the United States.

On the morning of Saturday June 29, the plenary assembly of the congress unanimously adopted the proposition of MM. Jean-Baptiste Lagacé and Adjutor Rivard to set up a [[Permanent Committee of the Congresses on the French language in America]] whose purpose was "to defend, to cultivate, extend, and develop the French language and literature in Canada and in general among the Acadians and French Canadians of North America". In addition to this general mandate, the permanent committee was given the specific mandate to "ensure the publication of the acts, the realization of the vows, and the continuation of the work of the Congress on the French language in Canada&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;". At 9:00PM, at diner was held in the celebration room of the [[Château Frontenac]], which in 1912 was only 20 years old.

On Sunday June 30, at 9:00AM, a mass was given at the [[Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral]] and in the afternoon, a procession organized by the [[Association catholique de la jeunesse canadienne-française]] (ACJC) circulated in Quebec City.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 139 et 143&lt;/ref&gt; A closing general session was held at the ''Salle des exercices militaires'', and afterwards all members were invited to attend a fireworks show before the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memoirs ==

The four sections of the Congress received a total of 65 memoirs.

Of the 19 memoirs pertaining to scientific subjects, seven were concerned with the history of the French language in Canada, seven other pertained to the legal situation of French throughout the Canadian federation and in the United States, and the remaining five discussed the philological questions.

The 21 memoirs of the education section gave Congress members a statistical overview of the teaching of French in Canada and the United States.

The 10 memoirs presented to the literary section discussed the state and future of Canadian literature, its development and propagation, its place in schools, etc.

The 15 memoirs of the section on propaganda were concerned with the quality of French in the press, in the associations, at home, in industry, trade, sciences and public service.

== Vows ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5940">In [[art criticism]] of the 1960s and 1970s, '''flatness''' described the smoothness and absence of curvature or surface detail of a two-dimensional work of art.  Critic [[Clement Greenberg]] believed that flatness, or two-dimensional, was an essential and desirable quality in [[painting]], a criterion which implies rejection of [[painterliness]] and [[impasto]].  The valorization of flatness led to a number of art movements, including [[minimalism]] and [[post-painterly abstractionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artlex.com/ArtLex/Fi.html Art-Lex], "Flat"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wolfe]], ''The Painted Word'' (Bantam, 1975: {{ISBN|0-553-38065-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]] of the arts happened during the second half of the 19th century and extended into most of the 20th. This period of art is identified by art forms consisting of an image on a flat two-dimensional surface. This art evolution began in the 1860s and culminated 50 years later. By this time almost all three-dimensional works had been eliminated. This new approach to painting was to create a visual appearance of realism. Looking at a surface with only two-dimensions our perception of depth is an illusion. The reduction of depth in painting was the consequence of investigation. This new essence of self-analysis attempted to establish an experience or effect from the viewer of the painting.&lt;ref&gt; Stephen Croddy. “Explaining Modernism,” n.d. http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Aest/AestCrod.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''flatness''' can be used to describe much of the popular American art work of the 1950s and 1960s. The art of this period had a basic yet colorful design that held a degree of two dimensional form. Thus the term '''flatness''' is used to describe this medium. The ground work idea for [[Minimalism]] began in Russia in 1913 when [[Kazimir Malevich]] placed a black square on a white background claiming that: “Art no longer cares to serve the state and religion it no longer wishes to illustrate the history of manners, it wants to have nothing further to do with the object as such, and believes that it can exist in and for itself without things.”&lt;ref&gt; Nikos Stangos. Concepts of Modern Art. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first [[Minimalism]] artworks was created in 1964 by [[Dan Flavin]]. He produced a neon sculpture titled ''Monument for V. Tatlin''. This work was a simplistic assembly of neon tubes that were not carved or constructed in any way. The idea was that they were not supposed to symbolize anything but to just merely exist. The Minimalist approach to art was to conceive by the mind before execution. Traditional modes of art composition were looked away from in favor of improvisation, spontaneity and automatism. This new expressionist style consisted of improvised pattern making where every stroke of the brush was viewed as expression and subjective freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Nikos Stangos. Concepts of Modern Art. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept inspired a whole new art form called [[Pop Art]]. It retained the color scheme and simplicity of [[Minimalism]], but it borrowed images from pop culture to become relatable. The works now in question held a meaning for the viewer with familiar imagery but it still retained the [[avant-garde]] approach of [[Minimalism]]. [[Pop Art]] is a well-recognized movement for 1960s culture. This type of art was very free form fashionable and rebellious. It was wild and colorful but many works retained the idea of two dimensional '''flatness'''.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Sandler. American Art Of The 1960s. Harper and Row, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop Art]] fell out of fashion and a new movement came into being. [[Op Art]] or Optic Art was now the latest trend in home décor and fashion. This form of modern art shares a strong relationship with the culture thought and design of the 1960s. This new art form focused on non-objective painting that focused on design, color, form, and line. These paintings where hand drawn or created with a mechanical aid. They featured a flat looking two dimensional design that could appear to pop out in an almost three dimensional form. Some pieces look as if they are moving due to shape and line placement creating a trick of the eye. This form of art was created to test the limits of the conscious perception of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt; Houston, Joe. Optic Nerve Perceptual Art Of The 1960s. London, New York: Merrell Publishers Limited, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright colors were no longer favored as much of [[Op Art]] is black and white with little use of color. The designs presented migrated back to the Minimalist idea of art simply existing and not representing an ideal. A well noted artist of this style is [[Bridget Riley]] who shaped the contemporary art scene of the early 50s and 70s. Her works are designed to pull the eye in such a way to stretch and disorder the perceptual sense. She is considered a ground breaking artist in the realm of modern art. Her work mainly consists of detailed line and circle patterns to create an optical challenge for the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Robertson. Bridget Riley Paintings and Drawings 1951-1971. The Hayward Gallery, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley composes her art with the thought in mind; that we all have a narrow view on how we see things and our vision is rarely stretched to new abilities. Her work confronts the observer with new imaginative sensations, and the overall purpose of the artist’s disappears and is replaced with what the viewer conceives. This form of art has no clear outlined theme therefore it allows total freedom for one to compose their imagination. Riley’s work ignores object and instead focuses on movement to create a seemingly endless pattern. Riley’s art appeared in the fashion of that era. Similar patterns still remain popular in clothing today.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Robertson. Bridget Riley Paintings and Drawings 1951-1971. The Hayward Gallery, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender democracy''' is a [[normative]] idea related to [[gender mainstreaming]]. Its aim is to achieve democratic conditions between men and women within society as a whole, as well as specifically within companies, bureaucracies, and other organizations. Among other things, this is realized by means of [[gender training]]s that raise awareness of existing inequalities and develop methods to [[democratization|democratize]] relations between genders. The term gender democracy was first coined and developed by German [[sociology|sociologist]] Halina Bedkowski.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oi9aL8iX8NoC&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;ots=vm6Apettti&amp;dq=halina%20bendkowski&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=halina%20bendkowski&amp;f=false Jeffrey J. Anderson, Eric Langenbacher, From the Bonn to the Berlin Republic] {{ISBN|978-0-85745-221-4}} - see p. 228 (footnote 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==

[[File:GuentherZ 2012-06-05 0068 Wien06 Johanna-Dohnal-Platz Strassentafel enthuellt.jpg|thumb|Street sign marking Vienna's Johanna-Dohnal-Platz. In 1993, the term "Geschlechterdemokratie" (gender democracy) appeared on the title of a publication edited by Johanna Dohnal - a first]]
According to Halina Bendkowski she developed the term and concept of gender democracy in the early 1990s during a "research trip to the US, which had been commissioned by Austria's Minister for Women, [[Johanna Dohal]], with the aim of identifying innovative projects against domestic violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146. The original German quotation reads: "...im Auftrag der österreichischen Frauenministerin Johanna Dohnal in den USA nach innovativen Projekten gegen häusliche Gewalt recherchierte"&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 1993, the term appeared on the title of a publication edited by the [[Austrian Federal Ministry of Education and Women's Affairs]], "Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt" (Test the West: Gender Democracy and Violence).&lt;ref&gt;Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt (vol. 1 of "Gewalt gegen Frauen, Frauen gegen Gewalt"), ed. by Johanna Dohnal, Bundesministerin für Frauenangelegenheiten, Wien 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The pioneers of gender democracy refused to provide a fixed and static definition of the term. Bedkowski stated: "As soon as a term has been defined in a dictionary and recycled by other theorists, it will have lost most of its vitality. It is true, terms are alive - and this is especially true for terms that have been developed in the course of actual political conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146. The original German quotation reads: "Sobald Begriffe lexikalisch erfasst und theorierecycelt sind, haben sie ihr vitales Leben schon meist hinter sich. Ja, auch Begriffe leben, besonders die, die für und in politischen Realauseinandersetzungen gewonnen worden sind."&lt;/ref&gt; Gunda Werner, who in 1999 outlined the basic tenets of gender democracy for the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], explained: "Gender democracy has no ready-made theoretical or practical precepts. It is an exploratory movement in search of new outlooks and models."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/sites/default/files/uploads/2014/04/zehn_thesen_von_gunda_werner_zu_geschlechterdemokratie_1999.pdf Gunda Werner: Geschlechterdemokratie 2000. Zehn Thesen zur Diskussion], PDF, October 1999The original German quotation reads: "Die Geschlechterdemokratie hat weder fertige praktische noch theoretische Konzepte. Sie ist eine Suchbewegung nach neuen Orientierungen und Modellen."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some of the fundamentals of gender democracy can be defined:

* Gender democracy is a normative precept, that is, an absolute moral and ethical [[axiom|postulate]].
* Gender democracy posits that the principles of democracy should not be limited to the sphere of politics but equally apply to the workplace and to personal life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/2012/01/10/gender-democracy-goal-and-organisational-principle Gender democracy as a goal and an organisational principle], Gunda Werner Institute, January 2012. See the following statement: "Gender democracy must be realised on all levels of society: on a political, social and organisational level as well as on the level of everyday interactions. On a social and personal level this also means leaving behind structural patterns of hegemonic masculinity which continue to shape career paths and hierarchies in many companies and institutions."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and methods ==

Gender democracy aims to achieve the equal participation of women and men in politics, the corporate world, and in all parts of society by reforming and abolishing undemocratic structures and all forms of power that are based on oppression and violence. This approach is based on a broad definition of democracy - one that demands equal rights and opportunities for people in all their diversity. As there is a large number of [[gender identity|gender identities]], gender democracy rejects the male // female [[dichotomy]], arguing instead that each human being - female, male, or otherwise - must have the right and the ability to self-determine their lifestyles, type of relationships in ways that go beyond stereotypical notions and any type of [[essentialism]] about men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/2012/01/10/gender-democracy-goal-and-organisational-principle Gender democracy as a goal and an organisational principle], Gunda Werner Institute, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender democracy investigates and questions structures and contents of democratic systems that were developed by men in order to transform them in ways that provide for gender equality. A key tool for implementing gender democracy are the so-called "gender traings" that aim to question traditional gender roles, analyze the social framework, and develop methods that provide for greater gender equality within organizations.

== Gender democracy within organizations ==

The following are some examples for organizations that have made gender democracy part of their institutional structures:

* The statutes of the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] define gender democracy as a "joint task"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/de/1989/index-309.html Satzung der Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung] § 2(3) states: "Ein besonderes Anliegen ist ihr die Verwirklichung von Geschlechterdemokratie als ein von Abhängigkeit und Dominanz freies Verhältnis der Geschlechter. Diese Gemeinschaftsaufgabe ist sowohl für die interne Zusammenarbeit als auch für die öffentliche Tätigkeit aller Bereiche ein maßgebliches Leitbild." ('A prime objective is to make gender democracy a reality, that is, relations between the genders that are free of dependency and dominance. This joint task guides all aspects of our organizational development as well as our public activities.')&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German trade union [[ver.di]] has defined the "realization of gender democracy" as one of its aims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.verdi.de/++file++5073a207deb5011af9001810/download/ver.di-Satzung.pdf Satzung ver.di - Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft] PDF, September 2015. § 5.3(f) states: "Zur Erreichung dieser Ziele dienen insbesondere: Verwirklichung der Geschlechterdemokratie und der gleichberechtigten Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern in Betrieb, Wirtschaft, Gesellschaft und Politik, auch unter Anwendung des Gender Mainstreaming." ('To achieve these aims, gender democracy and the equitable participation of women and men in the workplace, the business world, society, and politics has to be put into practice, including through the use of gender mainstreaming.'&lt;/ref&gt;
* The statutes of the German political party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] contain a paragraph titled "gender democracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.die-linke.de/partei/dokumente/bundessatzung-der-partei-die-linke/2-die-basis-der-partei/10-geschlechterdemokratie/ Bundessatzung der Partei Die Linke. § 10 Geschlechterdemokratie]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Hikone Castle'''|彦根城|Hikone-jō}} is a Japanese [[Edo period|Edo-period]] castle in the city of [[Hikone, Shiga|Hikone]], in [[Shiga Prefecture]].  It is considered the most significant historical building in Shiga. Hikone is one of only 12 [[Japanese castle]]s with the original keep, and one of only five castles [[List of National Treasures of Japan (castles)|listed as a national treasure]].

==History==
Hikone Castle traces its origin to 1603 when [[Ii Naokatsu]], son of the former ''[[daimyō]]'' [[Ii Naomasa]], ordered its construction. The keep was originally built in 1575, as part of [[Ōtsu Castle]], and was moved to Hikone by the [[Ii clan]]. Other parts of the castle were moved from [[Nagahama Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcastle.info/castle/profile/55-Nagahama-Castle Nagahama Castle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229172518/http://www.jcastle.info/castle/profile/55-Nagahama-Castle |date=2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hikone Castle was completed in 1622. Naokatsu's lands had been taken from him in the interval by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and when his brother [[Ii Naotaka|Naotaka]] assumed control of the area around [[Ōmi Province]], he was able to complete the castle by collecting stones from the former [[Sawayama Castle]].

When the [[Meiji era]] began in 1868, many castles were scheduled to be dismantled, and only a request from [[Emperor Meiji|the emperor]] himself, touring the area, kept Hikone Castle intact. Today it remains one of the oldest original-construction castles in Japan. The main keep of Hikone Castle was designated a [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]] by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/shiga/hikonejou.html&lt;/ref&gt; Hikone Castle also has several parts which are designated Important National Cultural Assets:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gojapango.com/travel/shiga_hikone_castle.htm Hikone Castle]&lt;/ref&gt; Umaya (Stable), Tenbin Yagura (Balance Scale Turret), Taikomon Yagura (Drum Gate Turret) and Nishinomaru Sanju Yagura (West Bailey Three-story Turret).

'''Historicism''' or also '''historism''' ({{lang-de|Historismus}}) comprises artistic styles that draw their inspiration from recreating historic styles or imitating the work of historic artisans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward]]. ''The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1988, p. 100. {{ISBN|0-500-20222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in architecture, such as [[revival architecture]]. Through a combination of different styles or implementation of new elements, historicism can create completely different aesthetics than former styles. Thus it offers a great variety of possible designs.

In the [[history of art]], after [[Neoclassicism]] which in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] could itself be considered a historicist movement, the 19th century saw a new historicist phase marked by an interpretation not only of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[classicism]], but also of succeeding stylistic eras, which were increasingly considered equivalent. In particular in architecture and in the genre of [[history painting]], in which historical subjects were treated of with great attention to accurate period detail, the global influence of historicism was especially strong from the 1850s onwards. The change is often related to the rise of the [[bourgeoisie]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]]. By the end of the century, in the ''[[fin de siècle]]'', [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Art Nouveau]] followed by [[Expressionism (architecture)|Expressionism]] and [[Modernism]] acted to make Historicism look outdated, although many large public commissions continued in the 20th century. The [[Arts and Crafts]] movement managed to combine a looser vernacular historicism with elements of Art Nouveau and other contemporary styles.

Influences of historicism remained strong until the 1950s in many countries. When [[postmodern architecture]] became widely popular in the 1980s, a movement of [[Neo-Historism]] followed, that is still prominent and can be found around the world, especially in [[Representation (arts)|representative]] and upper-class buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">'''Holden Furber''' (13 March 1903 &amp;ndash; 19 January 1993) was a professor of South Asia Studies at the University of Pennsylvania from 1952 till 1973. He was the twenty-first president of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] and a scholar who specialized in the history of [[India]] during the time of the [[British Raj]].

Born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1903, Furber was almost entirely educated in the Boston area, where he attended [[Brookline High School]] before graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 1924. He received his doctorate from Harvard in 1929 and at the same time attended [[Oxford University]], where he completed a bachelor's degree in 1925 and a master's degree in 1930. In 1931, during his nine-year career as a lecturer at Harvard, he published his first book, ''Henry Dundas, First Viscount Melville'', followed within two years by his edition of ''The Correspondence of Sir John Shore, Governor General, with Henry Dundas, President of the Board of Control, 1793-1798''. Furber's potential as a young scholar was identified with the awarding of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1937&amp;ndash;38. He was appointed to the post of assistant professor at the [[University of Texas]] in 1940 but soon received an assignment to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (which later became the [[CIA]]) to work as a social science analyst after the United States entered the [[Second World War]]. From 1943 to 1945, Furber served the [[US State Department]] as a specialist on the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], before returning to the University of Texas, where he stayed until 1948.

It was at that point that Furber published what was regarded as his most creative book, ''John Company at Work''. For this study of the country trade in Asia, European trade from one point in Asia to another, Furber pored through [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[France|French]], and [[Denmark|Danish]], as well as British archives. He concluded that private British trading interests combined with Indian merchants to play a dynamic role in a network of trade which ultimately led to the establishment of the [[British Raj]] in India. The [[American Historical Association]] recognised the book with the [[Watumull Prize]] in 1949. In the meantime, Furber lectured at the [[University of Madras]] in 1948, before moving to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he served as Professor of History until 1973. It was at Pennsylvania that he formed a close working relationship with [[W. Norman Brown]] and significantly contributed to the building of a program for studying the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He traveled to India in 1962 to deliver the Heras Lectures at the [[University of Bombay]], which were published under the title ''The Bombay Presidency in the Mid-18th Century''. In 1965 co-edited the fifth volume of the series entitled ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke''. This volume documented the period between July 1782 and June 1789 during which Burke's constructive interest in Indian affairs yielded to an "implacable determination" to defeat Hastings in the latter's impeachment trial. Furber interpreted these letters as re-enforcement for the "view held in India today" that Burke was a "champion of [[Bengal]]'s downtrodden millions."

Furber was a member of the [[Royal Historical Society]] and was the president of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] from 1968 to 1969. In retirement, he published his ambitious survey, ''Rival Empires of Trade in the Orient 1600-1800'', which applied the themes elucidated in ''John Company at Work'' back to earlier times. Furber's last book was dedicated to Elizabeth Chapin Furber, his first wife and a scholar of medieval [[history of France|French history]], who died at the time of his retirement. His second wife Lucy Richardson was the classmate of a widow, whom he escorted to his 50th reunion at Harvard. They married seven years later and they periodically lived at his summer home at [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], and her family home in [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. He died during his sleep on January 19, 1993 in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10413">"'''In the Jailhouse Now'''" is an American [[Novelty song|novelty]] blues song originally found in [[vaudeville]] performances from the early 20th century,&lt;ref name="Neal-131"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers], p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; usually credited to [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].  The song's first two verses trace the exploits of Ramblin’ Bob, who cheats at cards and gets caught, while the final verse tells about taking a girl named Susie out on the town and winding up in jail together.&lt;ref name="Neal-119"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jimmie Rodgers recording ==
Rodgers version of "In the Jailhouse Now" was recorded February 15, 1928, in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[New Jersey]], and features Rodgers on vocals and guitar, with [[Ellsworth T. Cozzens]] playing [[banjo]].&lt;ref name="Porterfield-137"&gt;[http://www.upress.state.ms.us/books/877 ''Jimmie Rodgers: The Life and Times of America's Blue Yodeler''], pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodgers included his famous [[yodel]] throughout the song. He recorded a [[sequel]] titled "In the Jailhouse Now—No. 2" in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], in 1930, which follows the misadventures of a man named Campbell.&lt;ref name="Porterfield-258"&gt;[http://www.upress.state.ms.us/books/877 ''Jimmie Rodgers: The Life and Times of America's Blue Yodeler''], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

The song has been covered many times, most frequently with Jimmie Rodgers’ version. Artists who have sung it include [[Tommy Duncan]], [[Webb Pierce]], [[Pink Anderson]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Jim Jackson (musician)|Jim Jackson]], [[Leon Russell]], [[Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions]] (featuring [[Jerry Garcia]]), [[Merle Haggard]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Prism (band)|Prism]], [[Suzy Bogguss]] (with [[Chet Atkins]]), and [[Tim Blake Nelson]] with [[The Soggy Bottom Boys]] in the film and soundtrack for ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]''.  It was also one of the first songs learned by a teenage [[Joan Baez]]. The song shows up under different titles including "He's in the Jailhouse Now," and some versions use the line "She's in the graveyard now" in the chorus.&lt;ref name="Neal-141"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 141,163&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1930, several different versions of it were recorded and copyrighted.  The earliest is Davis and Stafford's 1915 version, which has verses about a man named Campbell cheating at a card game and a corrupt election.&lt;ref name="Neal-132"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, [[Whistler's Jug Band]] from [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], recorded it under the title "[[Jail House Blues]]," which was the same title as a famous blues tune by [[Bessie Smith]] but was, in fact, the same song as "In the Jailhouse Now".&lt;ref name="Neal-135"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, [[Earl McDonald]]'s [[Original Louisville Jug Band]] made another recording of the song.&lt;ref name="Neal-139"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Two African-American bluesmen also recorded the song prior to Rodgers:  [[Blind Blake]] (in 1927), and [[Jim Jackson (musician)|Jim Jackson]] (in January 1928).  Jackson also copyrighted the song before Rodgers.&lt;ref name="Neal-156"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, in 1930, the Memphis Sheiks (a pseudonym for the [[Memphis Jug Band]]) recorded it in a version that scholars have often claimed, [[albeit]] mistakenly, was a cover of Jimmie Rodgers.&lt;ref name="Neal-149"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;  The version of the melody and lyrics that they used, is clearly derived from the Louisville Jug Band performances, not Rodgers.  On some of the Memphis Sheiks' records, an African-American vaudeville performer named [[Bert Murphy]] is given credit for writing the song.&lt;ref name="Neal-291"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers], p. 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Rodgers recorded the song, three additional versions appeared that were decidedly not covers of Rodgers.  [[Boyd Senter]] and his [[Senterpedes]] did a [[jazz]] version in 1929 for [[Victor Records]] (issued on #22010, and later reissued on [[Bluebird Records]] #5545);&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Steven and Settlemier, Tyrone [http://www.78discography.com/vic22000.html Online Discographical Project: Victor 22000 - 22500] Retrieved September 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Kardos]] and His Orchestra also did a jazz version in 1932 for Victor; and [[Billy Mitchell (jazz musician)|Billy Mitchell]] did a [[stride piano]] and [[shouter]] version of it in 1936 for the Bluebird label.&lt;ref name="Neal-165"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], pp. 165-168&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rodgers, the best-known version of the song was by [[Webb Pierce]], who had a No. 1 country hit with the song in 1955.&lt;ref name="Neal-171"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce's version spent No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' country chart for 21 weeks, becoming the third song in the chart's history to spend as long on the chart; previously, [[Eddy Arnold]] ("[[I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms)]]," 1947) and [[Hank Snow]] ("[[I'm Moving On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]," 1950) achieved the feat. For 58 years, those three songs held the longevity record for most weeks at No. 1 with 21 weeks, with only a handful of songs coming within a month of matching the record into the early 1960s. Finally, on August 10, 2013, "[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]" by [[Florida Georgia Line]] surpassed Pierce's "In the Jailhouse Now" for most weeks at No. 1 when it spent its 22nd week at No. 1.

When [[Johnny Cash]] recorded the song in 1962, he used lyrics that are different from Jimmie Rodgers' versions which Cash learned from the African-American jug band musicians in Memphis.&lt;ref name="Neal-177"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], pp. 177-180&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of this, most writers claim that Cash was covering Jimmie Rodgers' song, which further obscures that the song originated with African-American performers and was kept alive in a vaudeville and jug band tradition for many decades.&lt;ref name="Neal-182"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The song regained popularity years later when [[Sonny James]] recorded a live version during a 1976 concert at [[Tennessee State Prison]]. James' version included backing by the Tennessee State Prison Band, and peaked at No. 15 on the Hot Country Singles chart in 1977.

The Jimmie Rodgers version was sung by Gene Autry in his 1941 movie "Back in the Saddle."

In ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', "Delmar" ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]) sings a rendition, with "Pete" ([[John Turturro]]) yodeling between the verses, prior to the Soggy Bottom Boys' main number, "[[Man of Constant Sorrow]]".  The other "Soggy Bottom Boys" songs are lip-synched, but Tim Blake Nelson sings his own vocals on this song, while Turturro's yodeling is actually performed by Pat Enright of the [[Nashville Bluegrass Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowell |first1=Erica |title=The Brothers Grim: The Films of Ethan and Joel Coen |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2007 |page=276 n.59 |isbn=978-0810858503 }}  [https://books.google.com/books?id=pWSw_p2pYvwC&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;ots=IO5WgFcRwR&amp;dq=in%20the%20jailhouse%20now%20john%20turturro&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20the%20jailhouse%20now%20john%20turturro&amp;f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the song was done in a blackface performance in the musical ''[[One Mo' Time]]'' by [[Vernel Bagneris]].&lt;ref name="Neal-187"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  The musical was revived on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2002.  The version of the song used in the show was the same as that recorded by the Louisville Jug Bands in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Neal-188"&gt;[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=96228 ''The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers''], p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brad Paisley]] used the chorus for the end of "Mr. Policeman," a song on his 2007 album ''[[5th Gear (album)|5th Gear]]''. New lyrics were written to provide an ending to the song's story.

[[File:John-O-Hart-1892--Irish-Pedigrees.png|thumb|right|300px|A sketch of John O'Hart first published in Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation (1892), by John O'Hart, - Volume: 1.]]
'''John O'Hart''' (1824&amp;ndash;1902) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[genealogy|genealogist]]. He was born in Crossmolina, [[County Mayo|Co. Mayo]], [[Ireland]]. A committed [[Roman Catholic]], O'Hart originally planned to become Catholic priest but instead spent 2 years as a police officer.  He was an [[Associate in Arts]] at the [[Queen's University of Belfast]]. He worked at the Commissioners of National Education during the years of the [[Great Irish Famine]].  He worked as a genealogist and took an interest in [[Irish history]].  He was an [[Irish nationalist]]. He died in 1902 in [[Clontarf (Ireland)|Clontarf]] near [[Dublin]], at the age of 78.

O'Hart's 800-page ''The Irish and Anglo-Irish landed gentry'' (Dublin 1884) was reprinted in 1969, with an introduction by [[Edward McLysaght|Edward MacLysaght]], the first [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. Another work, ''Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation'', first published in 1876, has come out in several subsequent editions.

To complete his genealogies he used the writings of [[Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh]], [[Duald Mac Firbis]] and O'Farrell, along with the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], for the medieval pedigrees. He used the works of [[Bernard Burke]], John Collins and others to extend his genealogies past the 17th century.

==Stem of the Irish nation==
In his ''Irish Pedigrees'', O'Hart presents the legendary origins of the Irish people, from the Biblical Adam and Eve through the kings of ancient [[Ireland]]. Irish tradition holds that every Irish person is descended from the king [[Milesius]] who emigrated from [[Spain]] in approximately 1700 BC, according to the [[Annals of the Four Masters]].  O'Hart started each of his genealogies with [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] recording Milesius as his 36th descendant.

From the start; &lt;br&gt;
(1) [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(2) [[Seth]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(3) [[Enos (Bible)|Enos]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(4) [[Kenan|Cainan]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(5) [[Mahalalel|Mahalaleel]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(6) [[Jared (Biblical figure)|Jared]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(7) [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(8) [[Methuselah]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(9) [[Lamech (father of Noah)|Lamech]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(10) [[Noah]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(11) [[Japhet]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(12) [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(13) [[Baath mac Magog|Baoth]] "to whom [[Scythia]] came has his lot," his son&lt;br&gt;
(14) [[Phoeniusa Farsaidh]] ([[Fenius Farsa]]) King of Scythia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(15) [[Niul]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(16) [[Gaodhal]] (Gathelus), his son&lt;br&gt;
(17) [[Asruth]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(18) [[Sruth]] (who fled [[Egypt]] to [[Creta]]), his son&lt;br&gt;
(19) [[Heber Scut]] (returned to Scythia), his son&lt;br&gt;
(20) [[Beouman]], King of Scythia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(21) [[Ogaman]] King of Scythia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(22) [[King Tait|Tait]] King of Scythia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(23) [[Agnon (Irish legend)|Agnon]] (who fled Scythia by sea with the majority of his people), his son&lt;br&gt;
(24) [[Lamhfionn]] (who led his people to [[Götaland|Gothia]] or [[Getulia]], where [[Carthage]] was afterwards built), his son&lt;br&gt;
(25) [[Heber Glunfionn]] King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(26) [[Agnan Fionn]] King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(27) [[Febric Glas]] King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(28) [[Nenuall]] King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(29) [[Nuadhad]] King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(30) [[Alladh]] King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(31) [[Arcadh]] King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(32) [[King Deag|Deag]] King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(33) [[King Brath|Brath]] King of Gothia (who left Gothia with a large band of his people and settled in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]), his son&lt;br&gt;
(34) [[Breoghan]] King of Galicia, [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], and [[Portugal]], his son&lt;br&gt;
(35) [[Bile (Irish legend)|Bile]] King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal, and his son&lt;br&gt;
(36) [[Galamh]] (also known as [[Milesius]] of Spain) King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal.

According to O'Hart's account, [[Milesius]] had four sons, [[Éber Finn|Heber]], Ir, [[Érimón|Heremon]], and [[Amergin Glúingel|Amergin]], who were involved, along with their uncle Ithe, in the invasion of ancient [[Ireland]]; [[Milesius]], himself, had died during the planning. Because Amergin died during the invasion, he died without issue. It is from the four other invaders--[[Éber Finn|Heber]], [[Ir (Irish mythology)|Ir]], [[Heremon]], and [[Ithe]]—that the Irish are alleged to descend. These, according to O'Hart, are the four lines from which all true Irish descend. [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]] was a descendant of Erimon, and [[Brian Boru]] was descended from both Heber and Conn.

'''''Khopesh''''' (''{{lang|egy-Latn|ḫpš}}''; also vocalized '''khepesh''') is an Egyptian [[sickle]]-sword that evolved from battle axes.&lt;ref name=Hamblin&gt;Hamblin, 2006. ''Warfare in the Ancient Near East,'' pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Terence|title=Ancient Armies of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCLoNSNX1JwC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1981|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-85045-384-3|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical khopesh is 50–60&amp;nbsp;cm (20–24&amp;nbsp;inches) in length, though smaller examples do also exist. The blunted edge of the weapon's tip also served as an effective bludgeon, as well as a hook. These weapons changed from bronze to iron in the New Kingdom period.&lt;ref name="Howard2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Dan|title=Bronze Age Military Equipment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=diOx0cfHegEC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2011|publisher=Casemate Publishers|isbn=978-1-84884-293-9|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known depiction of a khopesh is from the [[Stele of Vultures]], depicting [[Eannatum|King Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]] wielding the weapon; this would date the khopesh to at least 2500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Loades2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Loades|title=Swords and Swordsmen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLU-bwAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Military|isbn=978-1-84884-133-8|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'khopesh' may have derived from 'leg', as in 'leg of beef', because of their similarity in shape. The hieroglyph for ''ḫpš'' ('leg') is found as early as during the time of the [[Coffin Texts]] (the [[First Intermediate Period]]).&lt;ref&gt;Coffin Texts: CT V, 9c, B1C&lt;/ref&gt;

The blade is only sharpened on the outside portion of the curved end. The khopesh evolved from the [[Epsilon axe|epsilon]] or similar crescent-shaped axes that were used in warfare.&lt;ref name=Hamblin/&gt; The khopesh went out of use around 1300&amp;nbsp;BC. However, in the 196 BC [[Rosetta Stone]] it is referenced as the "sword" [[determinative]] in a [[quadrate (hieroglyph block)|hieroglyphic block]], with the spelled letters of [[sieve (hieroglyph)|kh]], [[stool-or-mat (hieroglyph)|p]], and [[pool-lake-basin (hieroglyph)|sh]] to say:

{{quote|Shall be set up a statue..., the [[cross-ndj (hieroglyph)|Avenger]] of Baq-t-(Egypt), the interpretation whereof is '[[Ptolemy V|Ptolemy]], the [[branch (hieroglyph)|strong one]] of [[km (hieroglyph)|Kam-t]]'-(Egypt), and a statue of the god of the city, giving to him a sword royal of [[branch (hieroglyph)|victory]], ...&lt;ref&gt;Budge, 1989, (1929). ''The Rosetta Stone,'' p. 155–156. ('''Rosetta line 6''')&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Various pharaohs are depicted with a khopesh, and some have been found in royal graves, such as the two examples found with [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name="Loades2010"/&gt;

Although some examples are clearly sharpened, many examples have dull edges that apparently were never intended to be sharp. It may therefore be possible that some khopeshes found in high status graves were ceremonial variants.&lt;ref name="Loades2010"/&gt;

'''Lauriston Sharp''' (March 24, 1907 &amp;ndash; December 31, 1993) was a [[Goldwin Smith]] Professor of [[Anthropology]] and [[Asian Studies]] at [[Cornell University]]. He was the first person appointed in anthropology at the university, and he created its [[Cornell Southeast Asia Program|Southeast Asia Program]], research centers in Asia and North and South America, a multidisciplinary faculty and strong language program. He was a founding member of the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] and a founding trustee of the [[Asia Society]].

== Early life and education ==
Sharp was born in 1907 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], where he grew up. His father was a professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Sharp attended this same institution, studying for a Bachelor of Arts (BA). While majoring in philosophy, Sharp went with friends [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] and John J. Hanks on summer treks to [[archaeological]] sites on the Kaiparowitz Plateau in [[Arizona]] and [[Utah]]. These expeditions sparked his interest in the concrete, culturally informed [[anthropologist]]'s perspective on human nature, in contrast to the more abstract, universalizing view of a philosopher.

After graduating with his BA in 1929, Sharp identified anthropology and [[Southeast Asian studies]] as his career focus. He encountered [[Berber mythology|Berber]] culture while on an expedition to [[Algeria]] in 1930 with the Beloit-Logan Museum. Sharp moved to [[Austria]] to study Southeast Asian Ethnology under [[Robert Heine-Geldern]], receiving the Certificate in Anthropology from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1931. He enrolled in the PhD program at [[Harvard University]] in 1932 and completed his thesis in 1937, after two years of fieldwork studying [[Australian Aborigines]].

==Marriage and family==
Sharp married Ruth Burdick, and they had a family. She contributed to the Bennington-Cornell Thailand Project with expertise in anthropology and ceramics. They had a son named Alexander and a daughter named Suki.

== Academic career ==
Professor Sharp began teaching at Cornell in 1936; he was the university's first appointment in anthropology. He remained devoted to Cornell, creating and directing programs, and teaching at and remaining connected with the university for 56 years. He remained active as the Goldwin Smith Professor Emeritus, even after his formal retirement in 1973.

During an appointment at the [[US State Department|State Department]] in 1945 and 1946, Sharp was an assistant division chief for Southeast Asian affairs. Upon returning to Cornell, Sharp oversaw the expansion of the anthropology program, making it a leading center for graduate training and research. His vision of anthropology was to emphasize an applied orientation and focus on area studies. He established Cornell research centers in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].

In 1947, Sharp began the Cornell-Thailand Project, a ground-breaking initiative to collate baseline data in a comprehensive study of a farming village (''Bang Chan'') on the outskirts of [[Bangkok]]. Sharp also founded and was the first director between 1950 and 1960 of Cornell's Southeast Asia Program, for which he recruited a multi-disciplinary faculty, developed a strong language program and started what become the foremost library resource on South East Asia.

Sharp provided for scholars from the areas studied to receive training in such programs, in addition to hundreds of Western scholars. He chaired the Cornell Faculty Committee, which in 1961 saw the creation of the university's Center for International Studies. Aside from realizing Sharp's longtime dream of Southeast Asian research, the Thailand project also marked the start of his collaboration with Lucien Hanks and Jane Hanks of [[Bennington College]]. This continued in the Bennington-Cornell Project started in 1963, which entailed a broad regional survey of the upland and lowland peoples of northern Thailand. His wife, Ruth Burdick Sharp, contributed her acquired expertise in anthropology and ceramics to this project.

Despite health problems which made field research difficult after retirement, Sharp maintained his activity at Cornell and abroad. He worked with his research documents on Thailand as well as on Australian Aborigines.

== Publications and organizations ==

Sharp's professional career spanned wide geographical areas. As a scholar-researcher, he studied  indigenous cultures on four continents. Several of his publications became classics in their fields: ''Steel Axes for Stone-Age Australians'' (1952), ''People Without Politics'' (1958), and ''Cultural Continuities and Discontinuities in Southeast Asia'' (1962). A number of his coauthored works exhibited his multidisciplinary research and interest in culture change, such as ''Siamese Rice Village'' (1953) and ''Bang Chan: Social History of A Rural Community in Thailand'' (1978). Sharp had a reputation for passion in passing on his experiences to future generations.

Sharp was president of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] from 1961 to 1962. He was a founding member of the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] and a founding trustee of the [[Asia Society]]. He served on the governing boards of the [[American Anthropological Association]] and the Siam Society.

He won Guggenheim, Fulbright, and National Endowment for the Humanities fellowships. Upon retiring, he was presented with a two-volume ''[[festschrift]]'', one celebrating his contributions to studies of cultural change and applied anthropology, the other recognizing his contributions to [[Thai studies]].

He died at the age of 86 at his [[Ithaca, New York]] home on December 31, 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2628">The '''Legal Education Eligibility Test''' ('''LEET''') is an examination which will be administered by the [[Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation]] (KICE), intended to provide [[law school]]s in the [[Republic of Korea]] an evaluation metric to measure reading and reasoning skills required for successful [[legal education]].  The exam is similar in goal and content with the [[Public Service Aptitude Test]] (PSAT) administered as a part of the Korean civil service exams.  The [[Law School Admission Test]] of the [[United States]] serves as the model for the test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.moe.go.kr/main.jsp?idx=070101&amp;brd_no=30&amp;cp=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;srchSel=&amp;srchVal=&amp;brd_mainno=519&amp;mode=v Welcome to the Ministry of Education &amp; Human Resources Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321095030/http://english.moe.go.kr/main.jsp?idx=070101 |date=2007-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Administration==
KICE will administer the first LEET in 2018.  KICE administers the [[Law School Admission Test|LSAT]] once a year in August.  The current bar exam will be in place for a few years.

== Test composition ==
The test currently has three 90-120 minute sections. Two are multiple choice sections and one section is a writing section. 

=== Reading Comprehension ===
The section contains several Korean reading passages and questions pertaining to the main idea and structure.   

=== Logical Reasoning ===
The section, like that of the [[Law School Admission Test|LSAT]] contains questions that test the logical reasoning skills.

=== Writing ===
The format is not finalized yet.

== Preparation ==
Since the test is not yet administered, no preparation guide or course is available yet. The KICE is expected to release more information and sample exam later this year.  No legal knowledge is required or tested in the LEET.

== Scoring ==
Not finalized yet.

== Latest Development ==
On January 24 2008, the first model test will be held in Seoul.  The model test is for research purpose and the score is not official.  The first actual test will be held in August 2008.

The '''Marx Brothers''' were an American family comedy act that was successful in [[vaudeville]], on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and in [[motion pictures]] from 1905 to 1949. Five of the Marx Brothers' thirteen feature films were selected by the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) as among the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|top 100 comedy films]], with two of them (''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' and ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'') in the top twelve. They are widely considered by critics, scholars, and fans to be among the greatest and most influential comedians of the 20th century. The brothers were included in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars]] list of the 25 greatest male stars of Classic Hollywood cinema, the only performers to be inducted collectively.

The group is almost universally known today by their [[stage name]]s: [[Chico Marx|Chico]], [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], [[Gummo Marx|Gummo]], and [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]]. There was a 6th brother, the first born, named Manfred (Mannie), who died aged 7 months; Zeppo was given the middle name Manfred in his memory.

The core of the act was the three elder brothers: Chico, Harpo, and Groucho, each of whom developed a highly distinctive stage persona. After the group essentially disbanded in 1950, Groucho went on to begin a successful second career in [[television]], while Harpo and Chico appeared less prominently. The two younger brothers, Gummo and Zeppo, never developed their stage characters to the same extent as the elder three. They each left the act to pursue business careers at which they were successful, and for a time ran a large theatrical agency through which they represented their brothers and others. Gummo was not in any of the movies; Zeppo appeared in the first five films in relatively straight (non-comedic) roles. The performing lives of the brothers owed much to their mother [[Minnie Marx]], who acted as their manager until her death in 1929.

The Marx Brothers were born in [[New York City]], the sons of [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Germany]] and [[France]]. Their mother [[Minnie Marx|Miene "Minnie" Schoenberg]] (professionally known as Minnie Palmer, later the brothers' manager) was from [[Dornum]] in [[East Frisia]], and their father [[Sam Marx|Samuel]] ("Sam"; born Simon) Marx was a native of [[Alsace]] and worked as a tailor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/marxbr/geneal.htm|title=La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers|website=Judaisme.sdv.fr|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Another brother, Manfred ("Mannie"), the first-born son of Sam and Minnie, was born in 1886 and died in infancy:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/biography/index.htm|title=Family and Friends - The Marx Brothers|website=Marx-brothers.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Adamson | first = Joe | authorlink = Joe Adamson | title = Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 1973 | location = New York | pages = 6–8 | isbn = 0-340-18807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Louvish | first = Simon | authorlink = Simon Louvish | title = Monkey Business | publisher = St. Martin's Press |date = June 2000| location = New York | pages = 10–11 | isbn = 0-312-25292-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Family [[Oral tradition|lore]] told privately of the firstborn son, Manny, born in 1886 but surviving for only three months, and carried off by tuberculosis. Even some members of the Marx family wondered if he was pure myth. But Manfred can be verified. A death certificate of the Borough of Manhattan reveals that he died, aged seven months, on 17 July 1886, of [[enterocolitis]], with '[[asthenia]]' contributing, i.e., probably a victim of influenza. He is buried at New York's Washington Cemetery, beside his grandmother, Fanny Sophie Schönberg (née Salomons), who died on 10 April 1901."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Marx Brothers also had an older sister, actually a cousin, born in January 1885 who had been adopted by Minnie and Frenchie. Her name was Pauline, or "Polly".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Louvish.

Minnie Marx came from a family of performers. Her mother was a [[yodeling]] harpist and her father a [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]]; both were [[funfair]] entertainers. Around 1880, the family emigrated to [[New York City]], where Minnie married Sam in 1884. During the early 20th century, Minnie helped her younger brother Abraham Elieser Adolf Schönberg ([[stage name]] [[Al Shean]]) to enter show business; he became highly successful on [[vaudeville]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as half of the [[musical comedy]] [[double act]] [[Gallagher and Shean]], and this gave the brothers an entree to musical comedy, vaudeville and Broadway at Minnie's instigation.&lt;ref name="marxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/biography/marxes.htm|title=Family - The Marx Brothers|website=Marx-brothers.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnie also acted as the brothers' manager, using the name Minnie Palmer so that agents did not realize that she was also their mother. All the brothers confirmed that Minnie Marx had been the head of the family and the driving force in getting the troupe launched, the only person who could keep them in order; she was said to be a hard bargainer with theatre management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CWdn5BCtHwYC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%22milton%20marx%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q=%22milton%20marx%22&amp;f=false|title=''The Marx Brothers : Their World, Their Movies, Their Lives, Their Humour and Their Legacy'' by Robert G.

==Stage beginnings==

[[Image:1911jeffers.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1911 newspaper advertisement for a Marx Brothers appearance (l–r: Harpo, Groucho, Gummo)]]
The brothers were from a family of artists, and their musical talent was encouraged from an early age. Harpo was particularly talented, learning to play an estimated six different instruments throughout his career. He became a dedicated harpist, which gave him his nickname.&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Barber.&lt;/ref&gt; Chico was an excellent pianist, Groucho a guitarist and singer, and Zeppo a vocalist.

They got their start in [[vaudeville]], where their uncle Albert Schönberg performed as [[Al Shean]] of [[Gallagher and Shean]]. Groucho's debut was in 1905, mainly as a singer. By 1907, he and Gummo were singing together as "The Three Nightingales" with Mabel O'Donnell. The next year, Harpo became the fourth Nightingale and by 1910, the group briefly expanded to include their mother Minnie and their Aunt Hannah. The troupe was renamed "The Six Mascots".

===Comedy===
One evening in 1912, a performance at the Opera House in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]], was interrupted by shouts from outside about a runaway mule. The audience hurried out to see what was happening. Groucho was angered by the interruption and, when the audience returned, he made snide comments at their expense, including "Nacogdoches is full of roaches" and "the jackass is the flower of Tex-ass". Instead of becoming angry, the audience laughed. The family then realized that it had potential as a comic troupe.&lt;ref&gt;Kanfer, pp.&amp;nbsp;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; (However, in his autobiography ''Harpo Speaks'', Harpo Marx stated that the runaway mule incident occurred in [[Ada, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Harpo|title=Harpo Speaks|year=1961|publisher=Limelight Editions|location=New York|isbn=0-87910-036-2|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1930 article in the ''[[San Antonio Express-News|San Antonio Express]]'' newspaper stated that the incident took place in Marshall, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= Mark Barron|title=Runaway Mules Gave Marx Bros. Cue to Comedy |url= |quote= |work=[[San Antonio Express]] |date=July 20, 1930 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The act slowly evolved from singing with comedy to comedy with music. The brothers' sketch "Fun in Hi Skule" featured Groucho as a German-accented teacher presiding over a classroom that included students Harpo, Gummo, and Chico. The last version of the school act was titled ''Home Again'' and was written by their uncle [[Al Shean]]. The ''Home Again'' tour reached [[Flint, Michigan]] in 1915, where 14-year-old Zeppo joined his four brothers for what is believed to be the only time that all five Marx Brothers appeared together on stage.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=LUDTxbB-ipoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=zeppo+%2B+flint+%2B+five&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6xogT6TkGujZ0QHLlukH&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gummo then left to serve in [[World War I]], reasoning that "anything is better than being an actor!"&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, p. ???.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeppo replaced him in their final vaudeville years and in the jump to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and then to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] films.

[[File:Sailing away on the Henry Clay.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sheet music (1917) for one of the songs from ''Home Again''; from left: Harpo, Groucho, Chico, Gummo]]
During World War I, anti-German sentiments were common, and the family tried to conceal its German origin. Mother Minnie learned that farmers were excluded from the draft rolls, so she purchased a {{convert|27|acre|m2|adj=on}} poultry farm near [[Countryside, Illinois]] — but the brothers soon found that chicken ranching was not in their blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/10552#more-10552|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220144216/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/10552#more-10552|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 December 2007|title=mental_floss Blog » Groucho’s Threat Against Nixon &amp; 9 More Marx Brothers Stories|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Groucho discontinued his "German" stage personality.

By this time, "The Four Marx Brothers" had begun to incorporate their unique style of comedy into their act and to develop their characters. Both Groucho's and Harpo's memoirs say that their now-famous on-stage personae were created by [[Al Shean]]. Groucho began to wear his trademark [[greasepaint]] mustache and to use a stooped walk. Harpo stopped speaking onstage and began to wear a red fright wig and carry a taxi-cab horn. Chico spoke with a fake Italian accent, developed off-stage to deal with neighborhood toughs, while Zeppo adopted the role of the romantic (and "peerlessly cheesy", according to [[James Agee]])&lt;ref name="Adamson"/&gt; [[Double act|straight man]].

The on-stage personalities of Groucho, Chico, and Harpo were said to have been based on their actual traits. Zeppo, on the other hand, was considered the funniest brother offstage, despite his straight stage roles. He was the youngest and had grown up watching his brothers, so he could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. "He was so good as Captain Spaulding [in ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]''] that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience," Groucho recalled. (Zeppo stood in for Groucho in the film version of ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]''. Groucho was unavailable to film the scene in which the Beaugard painting is stolen, so the script was contrived to include a power failure, which allowed Zeppo to play the Spaulding part in near-darkness.)&lt;ref&gt;Kanfer, pp.&amp;nbsp;139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1917 the Marx brothers were noted in an advertisement playing in a musical comedy act "Home Again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn78000395/1917-12-15/ed-1/seq-2/|title=The labor world. (Duluth, Minn.) 1896-current, December 15, 1917, Image 2|date=15 December 1917|accessdate=21 September 2018|website=Chroniclingamerica.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s, the Marx Brothers had become one of America's favorite theatrical acts, with their sharp and bizarre sense of humor. They satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous for their [[improvisational comedy]] in free-form scenarios. A famous early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing [[chorus girl]] across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audience's delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, "First time I ever saw a taxi hail a passenger". When Harpo chased the girl back in the other direction, Groucho calmly checked his watch and ad-libbed, "The 9:20's right on time. You can set your watch by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad|Lehigh Valley]]."

The brothers' vaudeville act had made them stars on Broadway under Chico's management and with Groucho's creative direction—first with the musical revue ''[[I'll Say She Is]]'' (1924–1925) and then with two musical comedies: ''[[The Cocoanuts (musical)|The Cocoanuts]]'' (1925–1926) and ''[[Animal Crackers (theatre)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1928–1929). Playwright [[George S. Kaufman]] worked on the last two and helped sharpen the brothers' characterizations.

Out of their distinctive costumes, the brothers looked alike, even down to their receding hairlines. Zeppo could pass for a younger Groucho, and played the role of his son in ''[[Horse Feathers]]''. A scene in ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' finds Groucho, Harpo, and Chico all appearing in the famous greasepaint eyebrows, mustache, and round glasses while wearing nightcaps. The three are indistinguishable, enabling them to carry off the "mirror scene" perfectly.

==Origin of the stage names==
The stage names of the brothers (except Zeppo) were coined by [[Stand up comedy|monologist]] Art Fisher&lt;ref name="Adamson"&gt;Joe Adamson, ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers '' New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; during a [[poker]] game in [[Galesburg, Illinois]], based both on the brothers' personalities and [[Gus Mager]]'s ''[[Sherlocko the Monk]]'', a popular [[Comic strips|comic strip]] of the day that included a supporting character named "[[Groucho the Monk|Groucho]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Groucho (1976). ''The Groucho Phile'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; As Fisher dealt each brother a card, he addressed him, for the very first time, by the names they kept for the rest of their lives.

The reasons behind Chico's and Harpo's stage names are undisputed, and Gummo's is fairly well established. Groucho's and Zeppo's are far less clear. Arthur was named Harpo because he played the [[harp]], and Leonard became Chico (pronounced "Chick-o") because he was, in the slang of the period, a "chicken chaser". ("Chickens"—later "chicks"—was period slang for women. "In England now," said Groucho, "they were called 'birds'.")&lt;ref name="Groucho Live At Carnegie Hall"&gt;Groucho Live At Carnegie Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Harpo explained that Milton became Gummo because he crept about the theater like a [[detective|gumshoe]] detective.&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Barber, p. ??.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources reported that Gummo was the family's hypochondriac, having been the sickliest of the brothers in childhood, and therefore wore [[galosh|rubber overshoes]], called gumshoes, in all kinds of weather. Still others reported that Milton was the troupe's best dancer, and dance shoes tended to have rubber soles.&lt;ref&gt;Louvish, S. (1999). 'Monkey business: The lives and legends of the Marx Brothers: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Zeppo with added Gummo.' London: Faber &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Groucho stated that the source of the name was Gummo wearing galoshes. Whatever the details, the name relates to rubber-soled shoes.

The reason that Julius was named Groucho is perhaps the most disputed. There are three explanations:

* Julius's temperament: Maxine, Chico's daughter and Groucho's niece, said in the documentary ''The Unknown Marx Brothers'' that Julius was named "Groucho" simply because he was grouchy most or all of the time. [[Robert B. Weide]], a director known for his knowledge of Marx Brothers history, said in ''Remarks On Marx'' (a documentary short included with the DVD of ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'') that, among the competing explanations, he found this one to be the most believable. [[Steve Allen]] said in ''Funny People'' that the name made no sense; Groucho might have been impudent and impertinent, but not grouchy—at least not around Allen. However, at the very end of his life, Groucho finally admitted that Fisher had named him Groucho because he was the "moody one".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, G. (1976). ''The Groucho Phile''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The grouch bag: This explanation appears in Harpo's biography; it was voiced by Chico in a TV appearance included on ''The Unknown Marx Brothers''; and it was offered by [[George Fenneman]], Groucho's sidekick on his TV [[game show]] ''[[You Bet Your Life]]''. A grouch bag was a small drawstring bag worn around the neck in which a traveler could keep money and other valuables so that it would be very difficult for anyone to steal them. Most of Groucho's friends and associates stated that Groucho was extremely stingy, especially after losing all his money in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]], so naming him for the grouch bag may have been a comment on this trait. Groucho insisted that this was not the case in chapter six of his first autobiography:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I kept my money in a 'grouch bag'. This was a small [[Chamois leather|chamois]] bag that actors used to wear around their neck to keep other hungry actors from pinching their dough. Naturally, you're going to think that's where I got my name from. But that's not so. Grouch bags were worn on manly chests long before there was a Groucho.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Groucho and Me''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Groucho's explanation: Groucho himself insisted that he was named for a character in the comic strip ''[[Knocko the Monk]]'', which inspired the craze for nicknames ending in "o"; in fact, there was a character in that strip named "Groucho". However, he is the ''only'' Marx or Marx associate who defended this theory, and as he is not an unbiased witness, few biographers take the claim seriously.

:Groucho himself was no help on this point; he was discussing the Brothers' names during his [[Carnegie Hall]] concert, and he said of his own, "My name, of course, I never did understand." He goes on to mention the possibility that he was named after his unemployed uncle Julius, who lived with his family. The family believed that he was a rich uncle hiding a fortune, and Groucho claimed that he may have been named after him by the family trying to get into the will. "And he finally died, and he left us his will, and in that will he left three razor blades, an 8-ball, a celluloid dicky, and he owed my father $85 beside."&lt;ref name="Groucho Live At Carnegie Hall"/&gt;

Herbert was not nicknamed by Art Fisher, since he did not join the act until Gummo had departed. As with Groucho, three explanations exist for Herbert's name "Zeppo":

* Harpo's explanation: Harpo said in ''Harpo Speaks!'' that the brothers had named Herbert for Mr. Zippo, a [[chimpanzee]] that was part of another performer's act. Herbert found the nickname very unflattering, and when it came time for him to join the act, he put his foot down and refused to be called "Zippo". The brothers compromised on "Zeppo".
* Chico's explanation: Chico never wrote an autobiography and gave fewer interviews than his brothers, but his daughter Maxine said in ''The Unknown Marx Brothers'' that, when the brothers lived in Chicago, a popular style of humor was the "[[Zeke and Zeb]]" joke, which made fun of slow-witted Midwesterners in much the same way that [[Boudreaux and Thibodeaux]] jokes mock [[Cajun]]s and [[Ole and Lena]] jokes mock [[Minnesotan]]s. One day, Chico returned home to find Herbert sitting on the fence. Herbert greeted him by saying "Hi, Zeke!" Chico responded with "Hi, Zeb!" and the name stuck. The brothers thereafter called him "Zeb" and, when he joined the act, they floated the idea of "Zebbo", eventually preferring "Zeppo".
* Groucho's explanation: In a tape-recorded interview excerpted on ''The Unknown Marx Brothers'', Groucho said that Zeppo was so named because he was born when the first [[zeppelin]]s started crossing the ocean. He stated this in his Carnegie Hall concert, around 1972. The first zeppelin flew in July 1900, and Herbert was [[Zeppo Marx|born seven months later]] in February 1901. However, [[Zeppelin#Renaissance|the first transatlantic zeppelin flight]] was not until 1924, long after Herbert's birth.

Maxine Marx reported in ''The Unknown Marx Brothers'' that the brothers listed their ''real'' names (Julius, Leonard, Adolph, Milton, and Herbert) on playbills and in programs, and only used the nicknames behind the scenes, until [[Alexander Woollcott]] overheard them calling one another by the nicknames. He asked them why they used their real names publicly when they had such wonderful nicknames, and they replied, "That wouldn't be dignified." Woollcott answered with a belly laugh. Woollcott did not meet the Marx Brothers until the premiere of ''[[I'll Say She Is]]'', which was their first Broadway show, so this would mean that they used their real names throughout their vaudeville days, and that the name "Gummo" never appeared in print during his time in the act. Other sources reported that the Marx Brothers went by their nicknames during their vaudeville era, but briefly listed themselves by their given names when ''I'll Say She Is'' opened because they were worried that a Broadway audience would reject a vaudeville act if they were perceived as low class.&lt;ref&gt;Kanfer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motion pictures==

===Paramount===
[[File:Marx Brothers 1921.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Humor Risk]]'' (1921), now long-lost, was the first [[Marx Brothers]] film.  Pictured in a photograph the same year, from (left to right), are [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]], [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], and [[Chico Marx|Chico]].]]

The Marx Brothers' stage shows became popular just as motion pictures were evolving to "[[History of cinema|talkies]]". They signed a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] and embarked on their film career at Paramount's studios in [[New York City]]'s [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] section. Their first two released films (after an unreleased short silent film titled ''[[Humor Risk]]'') were adaptations of the Broadway shows ''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' (1929) and ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1930). Both were written by [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Morrie Ryskind]]. Production then shifted to Hollywood, beginning with a [[short film]] that was included in Paramount's twentieth anniversary documentary, ''[[The House That Shadows Built]]'' (1931), in which they adapted a scene from ''I'll Say She Is''. Their third feature-length film, ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'' (1931), was their first movie not based on a stage production.
[[File:Time Magazine Cover Marx Brothers.jpg|thumb|px240|The Marx Brothers on the cover of [[Time Magazine]] Volume 20 Issue 7, August 15, 1932]]
''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932), in which the brothers satirized the American college system and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], was their most popular film yet, and won them the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19320815,00.html|title=TIME Magazine Cover: Groucho, Harpo, Chico &amp; Zeppo Marx - Aug. 15, 1932|website=Time.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included a running gag from their stage work, in which Harpo produces a ludicrous array of props from inside his coat, including a wooden mallet, a fish, a coiled rope, a tie, a poster of a woman in her underwear, a cup of hot coffee, a sword; and, just after Groucho warns him that he "can't burn the candle at both ends," a candle burning at both ends.

During this period Chico and Groucho starred in a [[radio]] comedy series, ''[[Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel]]''. Though the series was short lived, much of the material developed for it was used in subsequent films. The show's scripts and recordings were believed lost until copies of the scripts were found in the [[Library of Congress]] in the 1980s. After publication in a book they were performed with Marx Brothers impersonators for [[BBC Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dzvzc |title=BBC Radio 4 Extra - Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-05-31 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their last Paramount film, ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933), directed by the highly regarded [[Leo McCarey]], is the highest rated of the five Marx Brothers films on the [[American Film Institute]]'s "100 years ... 100 Movies" list. It did not do as well financially as ''Horse Feathers'', but was the sixth-highest grosser of 1933. The film sparked a dispute between the Marxes and the village of [[Fredonia, New York]]. "Freedonia" was the name of a fictional country in the script, and the city fathers wrote to Paramount and asked the studio to remove all references to Freedonia because "it is hurting our town's image". Groucho fired back a sarcastic retort asking them to change the name of their town, because "it's hurting our picture."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===MGM, RKO, and United Artists===
[[File:Marx Brothers 1946.jpg|thumb|px240|in ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946)]]
After expiration of the Paramount contract Zeppo left the act to become an agent. He and brother Gummo went on to build one of the biggest talent agencies in Hollywood, helping the likes of [[Jack Benny]] and [[Lana Turner]] get their starts. Groucho and Chico did radio, and there was talk of returning to Broadway. At a [[Contract bridge|bridge]] game with Chico, [[Irving Thalberg]] began discussing the possibility of the Marxes joining [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. They signed, now billed as "Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Marx Bros."&lt;ref&gt;Harpo was a very skillful bridge player, and a consistent winner in the highest circles.{{citation needed|date=December 2014|reason=So I've heard, though I can't lay my hand on a citation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the free-for-all scripts at Paramount, Thalberg insisted on a strong story structure that made the brothers more sympathetic characters, interweaving their comedy with romantic plots and non-comic musical numbers, and targeting their mischief-making at obvious villains. Thalberg was adamant that scripts include a "low point", where all seems lost for both the Marxes and the romantic leads. He instituted the innovation of testing the film's script before live audiences before filming began, to perfect the comic timing, and to retain jokes that earned laughs and replace those that did not. Thalberg restored Harpo's harp solos and Chico's piano solos, which had been omitted from ''Duck Soup''.

[[Image:Marx Brothers 1948.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Three Marx Brothers by [[Yousuf Karsh]], 1948]]

The first Marx Brothers/Thalberg film was ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935), a [[satire]] on the world of [[opera]], where the brothers help two young singers in love by throwing a production of ''[[Il Trovatore]]'' into chaos. The film—including its famous scene where an absurd number of people crowd into a tiny stateroom on a ship—was a great success, and was followed two years later by an even bigger hit, ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' (1937), in which the brothers cause mayhem in a sanitarium and at a horse race. The film features Groucho and Chico's famous "Tootsie Frootsie Ice Cream" sketch. In a 1969 interview with [[Dick Cavett]], Groucho said that the two movies made with Thalberg were the best that they ever produced. Despite the Thalberg films' success, the brothers left MGM in 1937; Thalberg had died suddenly on September 14, 1936, two weeks after filming began on ''A Day at the Races'', leaving the Marxes without an advocate at the studio.

After a short experience at [[RKO]] (''[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]'', 1938), the Marx Brothers returned to MGM and made three more films: ''[[At the Circus]]'' (1939), ''[[Go West (1940 film)|Go West]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Big Store]]'' (1941). Prior to the release of ''The Big Store'' the team announced they were retiring from the screen. Four years later, however, Chico persuaded his brothers to make two additional films, ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946) and ''[[Love Happy]]'' (1949), to alleviate his severe [[gambling]] debts. Both pictures were released by [[United Artists]].

===Later years===
From the 1940s onward Chico and Harpo appeared separately and together in nightclubs and casinos. Chico fronted a [[big band]], the Chico Marx Orchestra (with 17-year-old [[Mel Tormé]] as a vocalist). Groucho made several radio appearances during the 1940s and starred in ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', which ran from 1947 to 1961 on [[NBC]] radio and television. He authored several books, including ''Groucho and Me'' (1959), ''Memoirs of a Mangy Lover'' (1964) and ''The Groucho Letters'' (1967).

Groucho and Chico briefly appeared in a 1957 color short film promoting ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' entitled "Showdown at Ulcer Gulch," directed by [[animator]] [[Shamus Culhane]], Chico's son-in-law. Groucho, Chico, and Harpo worked together (in separate scenes) in ''[[The Story of Mankind (film)|The Story of Mankind]]'' (1957). In 1959, the three began production of ''Deputy Seraph'', a TV series starring Harpo and Chico as blundering angels, and Groucho (in every third episode) as their boss, the "[[Deputy Seraph]]." The project was abandoned when Chico was found to be uninsurable (and incapable of memorizing his lines) due to severe [[arteriosclerosis]]. On March 8 of that year, Chico and Harpo starred as bumbling thieves in ''[[The Incredible Jewel Robbery]]'', a half-hour pantomimed episode of the ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' on CBS. Groucho made a cameo appearance—uncredited, because of constraints in his NBC contract—in the last scene, and delivered the only line of dialogue ("We won't talk until we see our lawyer!").

According to a September 1947 article in ''[[Newsweek]]'', Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo all signed to appear as themselves in a [[biopic]] entitled ''The Life and Times of the Marx Brothers''. In addition to being a non-fiction biography of the Marxes, the film would have featured the brothers reenacting much of their previously unfilmed material from both their vaudeville and Broadway eras. The film, had it been made, would have been the first performance by the Brothers as a quartet since 1933.

The five brothers made only one television appearance together, in 1957, on an early incarnation of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' called ''[[The Tonight Show#Tonight! America After Dark (1957)|Tonight! America After Dark]]'', hosted by [[Jack Lescoulie]]. Five years later (October 1, 1962) after Jack Paar's tenure, Groucho made a guest appearance to introduce the ''Tonight Show's'' new host, [[Johnny Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnny Carson.

Around 1960, the acclaimed director [[Billy Wilder]] considered writing and directing a new Marx Brothers film. Tentatively titled ''A Day at the U.N.'', it was to be a comedy of international intrigue set around the [[United Nations]] building in New York. Wilder had discussions with Groucho and Gummo, but the project was put on hold because of Harpo's ill-health and abandoned when Chico died in 1961.&lt;ref name="Gore"&gt;Gore, Chris (1999). ''The Fifty Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin.&lt;/ref&gt; He was 74. Three years later, on September 28, 1964, Harpo died at the age of 75 of a heart attack one day after heart surgery.

In 1966 [[Filmation]] produced a pilot for a Marx Brothers cartoon. Groucho's voice was supplied by [[Pat Harrington Jr.]] and other voices were done by [[Ted Knight]] and [[Joe Besser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheimer|first=Lou|title=Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation|year=2012|publisher=Two Morrows Publishing|location=Raleigh, NC|isbn=978-1-60549-044-1|page=51|author2=Mangels, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beck |first=Jerry |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/filmations-marx-brothers-15252.html |title=Filmation's Marx Brothers? |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |date=2009-07-22 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the four Marx Brothers had a brief reunion of sorts in the animated [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television special ''[[The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians]]'', produced by [[Rankin-Bass]] animation (of ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' fame). The special featured animated reworkings of various famous comedians' acts, including [[W. C. Fields]], [[Jack Benny]], [[George Burns]], [[Henny Youngman]], [[the Smothers Brothers]], [[Flip Wilson]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Jack E. Leonard]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] and the Marx Brothers. Most of the comedians provided their own voices for their animated counterparts, except for Fields and Chico Marx (both had died), and Zeppo Marx (who had left show business in 1933). Voice actor [[Paul Frees]] filled in for all three (no voice was needed for Harpo). The Marx Brothers' segment was a reworking of a scene from their Broadway play ''[[I'll Say She Is]]'', a parody of [[Napoleon]] that Groucho considered among the brothers' funniest routines. The sketch featured animated representations, if not the voices, of all four brothers. [[Romeo Muller]] is credited as having written special material for the show, but the script for the classic "Napoleon Scene" was probably supplied by Groucho.

==Impact on modern entertainment==

On January 16, 1977, the Marx Brothers were inducted into the Motion Picture Hall of Fame. With the deaths of Gummo in April 1977, Groucho in August 1977, and Zeppo in November 1979, the brothers were gone. But their impact on the entertainment community continues well into the 21st century.

Many television shows and movies have used Marx Brothers references. ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[Tiny Toons]]'', for example, have featured Marx Brothers jokes and skits. [[Hawkeye Pierce]] ([[Alan Alda]]) on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' occasionally put on a fake nose and glasses, and, holding a cigar, did a Groucho impersonation to amuse patients recovering from surgery. Early episodes also featured a singing and off-scene character named Captain Spaulding as a tribute.

[[Bugs Bunny]] impersonated Groucho Marx in the 1947 cartoon ''[[Slick Hare]]'' (with [[Elmer Fudd]] dressing up as Harpo and chasing him with a cleaver) and in a later cartoon he again impersonated Groucho hosting a TV show called "You Beat Your Wife," asking [[Elmer Fudd]] if he had stopped beating his wife. [[Tex Avery]]'s cartoon ''[[Hollywood Steps Out]]'' (1941) featured appearances by Harpo and Groucho. They appeared, sometimes with Chico and Zeppo caricatured, in cartoons starring [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Flip the Frog]] and others. In the ''[[Airwolf]]'' episode 'Condemned', four anti-virus formulae for a deadly plague were named after the four Marx Brothers.

In ''[[All in the Family]]'', Rob Reiner often did imitations of Groucho, and Sally Struthers dressed as Harpo in one episode in which she (as Gloria Stivic) and Rob (as Mike Stivic) were going to a Marx Brothers film festival, with Reiner dressing as Groucho. Gabe Kaplan did many Groucho imitations on his sit-com ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'' and [[Robert Hegyes]] sometimes imitated both Chico and Harpo on the show. In Woody Allen's film ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986), Woody's character, after a suicide attempt, is inspired to go on living after seeing a revival showing of ''Duck Soup''. In ''[[Manhattan]]'' (1979), he names the Marx Brothers as something that makes life worth living. In an episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' Murray calls the new station owner at home late at night to complain when the song "Hooray for Captain Spaulding" is cut from a showing of ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' because of the new owners' policy to cut more and more from shows to sell more ad time, putting his job on the line.

In ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996), Woody Allen and [[Goldie Hawn]] dress as Groucho for a Marx Brothers celebration in France, and the song "[[Hooray for Captain Spaulding]]", from ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', is performed, with various actors dressed as the brothers, striking poses famous to Marx fans. (The film itself is named after a song from ''[[Horse Feathers]]'', a version of which plays over the opening credits.)

Harpo Marx appeared as himself in a sketch on ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' in which he and [[Lucille Ball]] reprised the mirror routine from ''Duck Soup'', with Lucy dressed up as Harpo. Lucy had worked with the Marxes when she appeared in a supporting role in an earlier Marx Brothers film, ''[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]''. Chico once appeared on ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' dressed up as Harpo; his secret was shown in a caption reading, "I'm pretending to be Harpo Marx (I'm Chico)". The Marx Brothers were spoofed in the second act of the Broadway Review ''[[A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine]]''.

In the 1989 film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Professor Henry Jones ([[Sean Connery]]) mails his diary to his son [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) to keep it out of Nazi hands. When Indy misconstrues the purpose of being sent it and returns it to his father instead, his father berates him by saying "I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers!".

In the 1996 musical, [[By Jeeves]], based on the [[Jeeves]] stories by [[P.G. Wodehouse]], during ''The Hallo Song'', [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] suggests "You're either [[Pablo Picasso]]", to which Cyrus Budge III replies "or maybe Harpo Marx!"

In [[Rob Zombie]]'s 2003 film [[House of 1000 Corpses]], the clown Captain Spaulding is named after the Marx brothers character, and this is mentioned in the movie.

==Legacy==

===Awards and honors===
In the [[46th Academy Awards|1974 Academy Awards telecast]], [[Jack Lemmon]] presented Groucho with an honorary [[Academy Award]] to a standing ovation. The award was also on behalf of Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho's final major public appearances.  "I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor," he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time). Groucho also praised the late [[Margaret Dumont]] as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1YsAxiiH98 |title=Groucho Marx receiving an Honorary Oscar® |website=Oscars.org |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marx Brothers were collectively named #20 on [[American Film Institute|AFI's]] list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|Top 25 American male screen legends]] of Classic Hollywood. They are the only group to be so honored.

The "Sweathogs" of the ABC-TV series ''[[Welcome Back Kotter]]'' ([[John Travolta]], [[Robert Hegyes]], [[Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs]], and [[Ron Palillo]]) patterned much of their on-camera banter in that series after the Marx Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/tv-news/-welcome-back--kotter---25-things-you-never-knew-about-the-sweathogs-000758294.html|title='Welcome Back, Kotter': 25 Things You Never Knew About the Sweathogs|website=Tv.yahoo.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WelcomeBackKotter|title=Welcome Back, Kotter|website=Tvtropes.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbbz.tv/?page_id%3D2624 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122231341/http://www.wbbz.tv/?page_id=2624 |archivedate=2015-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Series star Gabe Kaplan was reputedly a big Marx Brothers fan.

===''Mightor''===
One day, while on a hunting trip, a teenage [[caveman]] named '''Tor''', along with his winged pet [[dinosaur]] '''Tog''', rescue an old man who, as a reward, gives Tor a magical club. When Tor raises his club to the sky, he transforms into the masked and muscular '''Mightor''', a [[prehistoric]] [[superhero]] who possesses superhuman strength and the power of flight through his club, which can also fire energy blasts. He can also transform Tog into a powerful fire-breathing dragon.

Mightor protects his village from evil-doers. Amongst the villagers are the chief, Pondo, and his daughter, the beautiful redhaired Sheera. Sheera has a younger brother named Little Rok, who loves pretending to be Mightor. The characters have several pets, including Little Rok's [[dodo bird]], Ork, and Sheera's [[mammoth]] calf, Bollo.

Tor is voiced by [[Bobby Diamond]], while Mightor is voiced by [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2014/02/16/wiki-worries/ |author=[[Mark Evanier]] |title=Wiki Worries |publisher=News From ME |date=2014-02-16 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pondo, Tog, Ork, and Bollo are voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].

'''November''' is the eleventh and penultimate month of the year in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian Calendar]]s, the fourth and last of four months to have a length of 30 [[day]]s, and the fifth and last of five months to have a length of less than 31 days. November was the ninth month of the ancient Roman calendar. November retained its name (from the Latin ''novem'' meaning "nine") when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the [[Roman calendar]].
November is a month of late [[spring (season)|spring]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and late [[autumn]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.

November was referred to as [[Blōtmōnaþ]] by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. [[Brumaire]] and [[Frimaire]] were the months on which November fell in the [[French Republican Calendar]].

'''''Plique-à-jour''''' (French for "letting in daylight") is a [[vitreous enamel]]ling technique where the enamel is applied in cells, similar to [[cloisonné]], but with no backing in the final product, so light can shine through the transparent or translucent enamel. It is in effect a miniature version of [[stained-glass]] and is considered very challenging technically:  high time consumption (up to 4 months per item), with a high failure rate.  The technique is similar to that of [[cloisonné]], but using a temporary backing that after firing is dissolved by acid or rubbed away.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-40; Ostoia, 78; [http://www.glass-on-metal.com/pastart/pliqueajour.htm ''Plique à Jour - Yesterdays Technique Today''], Bill Helwig, June 1992, Glass on Metal magazine&lt;/ref&gt; A different technique relies solely on [[surface tension]], for smaller areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SX29QC99mS8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Byzantine+plique-%C3%A0-jour+enamel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KEjVTfDiI8vAtAaF1uSKDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Art of Fine Enameling''], Karen L. Cohen, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan the technique is known as '''shotai-jippo''' (shotai shippo), and is found from the 19th century on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O119856/bowl/ Japanese bowl] in the V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The technique was developed in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phokani.ge/pdf/enamel_eng.pdf Georgian Art Studio Phokani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langantiques.com/pages/decorative_periods/art-nouveau-period Lang Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Byzantine plique-à-jour survived in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n [[icon]]s. The technique of plique-à-jour was adopted by [[Kievan Russia]] (strong trading partner of [[Constantinople]]) with other enamel techniques. Despite its complexity plique-à-jour tableware (especially "[[kovsh]]" bowls) was used by its aristocracy. Russian masters significantly developed plique-à-jour technique: in addition to cells cut in precious metal they worked with cells made of silver wire. Unfortunately the plique-à-jour technique of [[Kievan Russia]] was lost after the crushing [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century. Some surviving examples are exhibited in the Historical Museum in Moscow.

Western Europe adopted the plique-à-jour technique (cells cut in metal) of Byzantium.  The term 'smalta clara' ("clear enamel"), probably meaning ''plique à jour'' appears in 1295 in the inventory of [[Pope Boniface VIII]]&lt;ref&gt;Labarte, Histoire des arts industriels, iii, Paris, 1865, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; and the French term itself appears in inventories from the 14th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pgYqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=plique-%C3%A0-jour&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZR_VTbilGY_4sgaIk42jDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=plique-%C3%A0-jour&amp;f=false ''Recherches sur la peinture en émail dans l'antiquité et au moyen âge''], Jules Labarte, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571) gives a full description of the process in his Treatises of Benvenuto Cellini on Gold-smithing and Sculpture of 1568. Pre-19th century pieces are extremely rare because of their "extreme fragility ... which increases greatly with their size", and the difficulty of the technique.  Survivals "are almost exclusively small ornamental pieces". The outstanding early examples that survive are "the decorative insets in the early fifteenth-century [[Mérode Cup]] (Burgundian cup) at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, a Swiss early sixteenth-century plique-a-jour enamel plaque representing the family of the Virgin Mary in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/medieval_art/plaque_with_the_virgin_and_child//objectview.aspx?OID=170008038&amp;collID=17&amp;dd1=17 Plaque in Metropolitan]&lt;/ref&gt; and the eight pinnacle points over the front of the eleventh-century [[Saint Stephen's Crown]] in Hungary".&lt;ref&gt;Ostoia, 78&lt;/ref&gt;   The technique was lost in both Western and Eastern Europe.

The technique was revived in the late 19th century movement of revivalist jewellery, and became especially popular in Russia and Scandinavia. Works by [[Pavel Ovchinikov]], [[Ivan Khlebnikov]], and some masters working for [[Faberge]] are real masterpieces of plique-à-jour. Russian masters predominately worked with tableware.  Norwegian jewellers included David Andersen and J. Tostrup in Oslo,&lt;ref&gt;Marit Guinness Aschan and Rika Smith McNally. "Enamel." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. 28 July 2010 [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T026009 Subscription required].&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Hummer in Bergen.  [[Art nouveau]] artists such as [[René Lalique]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/tchan_5_04.shtm National Gallery of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; and other French and German artists predominantly used plique-à-jour in small jewellery, though the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum has a tray of 1901 by [[Eugene Feuillâtre]] (1870–1916).&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O88346/ring-tray/ Ring-tray by Eugene Feuillâtre], V&amp;A.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently plique-à-jour still not often used because it is challenging technically and mainly due to break in transferring of skills between generations of jewelers. Although some luxury houses ([[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]] in jewellery, [[Bulushoff]] in jewellery and tableware) produce limited numbers of products in plique-à-jour technique.  Works in shotai shippo technique are also known from China and Iran.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Techniques==
There are four basic ways of creating plique-a-jour:

1. Filigree plique-a-jour ("Russian plique-a-jour"): This is a building up process whereby a planned design is interpreted using gold or silver wires which are worked over a metal form (i.e. bowl). Wires are twisted or engraved, e.g. have additional micro patterns. The wires are soldered together. Enamels are ground and applied to each "cell" created by the metal wirework. The piece is fired in a kiln. This process of placing and firing the enamels is repeated until all cells are completely filled. Usually it takes up to 15-20 repeats.

2. Pierced plique-a-jour ("Western plique-a-jour"): A sheet of gold or silver is pierced and sawed, cutting out a desired design. This leaves empty spaces or "cells" to fill with enamel powders (ground glass).

3. Shotai shippo ("Japanese plique-a-jour"): A layer of flux (clear enamel) is fired over a copper form. Wires are fired onto the flux (similar to cloisonné) and the resulting areas are enameled in the colors of choice. When all the enameling is finished, the copper base is etched away leaving a translucent shell of plique-a-jour.

4. Cloisonné on mica: Cells in precious metal are covered with fixed mica, which is stitched out with abrasives after enameling.

'''Popular culture''' (also called '''pop culture''') is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of the  [[cultural practice|practices]],  [[opinion|beliefs]] and  [[cultural objects|objects]] that are dominant or ubiquitous in a [[society]] at a given point in time. Popular culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result of interaction with these dominant objects. Heavily influenced in [[modern history|modern times]] by [[mass media]], this collection of ideas permeates the [[everyday life|everyday lives]] of people in a given society. Therefore, popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's  [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards certain topics.&lt;ref&gt;McGaha, Julie. "Popular Culture &amp; Globalization". ''Multicultural Education'' 23.1 (2015): 32–37. ''SocINDEX with Full Text''. Web. 5 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are various ways to define pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;Strinati, D. (2004). ''An introduction to theories of popular culture''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, popular culture is considered{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} an empty conceptual category, or something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, J. (2018). ''Cultural theory and popular culture: An introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally defined{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} in contrast to other forms of [[culture]] such as [[folk culture]], [[working-class culture]], or [[high culture]], and also through different theoretical perspectives such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[structuralism]],  [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]], and more. The most common pop-culture categories are: [[entertainment]] (such as [[movies]], [[music]], [[television]] and [[video games]]), [[sport]]s, [[news]] (as in people/places in the news), [[politics]], [[fashion]]/clothes, [[technology]], and [[slang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mrpopculture.com/what-is-pop-culture |title= What Is Pop Culture?

Popular culture is sometimes viewed by many people as being trivial and [[Dumbing down|"dumbed down"]] in order to find consensual acceptance from (or to attract attention amongst) the [[mainstream]]. As a result, it comes under heavy criticism from various  [[Subculture|non-mainstream]] sources (most notably from [[Religion|religious]] groups and from [[Counterculture|countercultural]] groups) which deem it superficial, [[Consumerism|consumerist]],  [[Sensationalism|sensationalist]], or corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Darrell L.

==History and definitions==
{{see also|Cultural history}}
The term "popular culture" was coined in the 19th century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Although the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' lists the first use as 1854, it appears in an address by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] in 1818: {{cite book|title=The Address of Pestalozzi to the British Public|year=1818|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i6BDAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=I see that it is impossible to attain this end without founding the means of popular culture and instruction upon a basis which cannot be got at otherwise than in a profound examination of Man himself; without such an investigation and such a basis all is darkness.|author1=Pestalozzi|first1=Johann Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, popular culture was associated with poor [[education]] and the [[lower classes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Per Adam Siljeström|sv}}, ''The educational institutions of the United States, their character and organization'', J. Chapman, 1853, p. 243: "Influence of European emigration on the state of civilization in the United States: Statistics of popular culture in America". [[John Morley]] presented an address ''On Popular Culture'' at the [[Birmingham Town Hall]] in 1876, dealing with the education of the lower classes.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the "official culture" and higher education of the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOoe_MqMQe4C&amp;pg=PA13 ''Rabelais and Bakhtin: Popular Culture in "Gargantua and Pantagruel"''] p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d6jtq0LglIAC&amp;pg=PA9 ''Rabelais's Radical Farce''] p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Victorian era]] Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased [[literacy]] rates, and with the rise of capitalism and [[industrialisation]], people began to spend more money on entertainment. Labelling [[penny dreadful]]s the Victorian equivalent of video games, ''The Guardian'' described penny fiction as “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the invention of [[railway]] (the first public railway, [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], opened in north-east England in 1825) created both a market for cheap popular literature, and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. The first penny serials were published in the 1830s to meet this demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=E. S. |authorlink=E. S. Turner |year=1975 |title=Boys Will be Boys |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-14-004116-8 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stress in the distinction from "official culture" became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;"Learning is dishonored when she stoops to attract," cited in a section "Popular Culture and True Education" in University extension, Issue 4, The American society for the extension of university teaching, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2012}} a usage that became established by the [[interbellum]] period.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. "the making of popular culture plays [in post-revolutionary Russian theater]", Huntly Carter, ''The new spirit in the Russian theatre, 1917–28: And a sketch of the Russian kinema and radio, 1919–28, showing the new communal relationship between the three'', Ayer Publishing, 1929, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2012}}

From the end of [[World War II]], following major cultural and social changes brought by [[mass media]] innovations, the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of [[mass culture]], [[media culture]], image culture, [[consumer culture]], and culture for [[mass consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;"one look at the sheer mass and volume of what we euphemistically call our popular culture suffices", from [[Winthrop Sargeant]], 'In Defense of the High-Brow', an article from ''[[LIFE]]'' magazine, 11 April 1949, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Social and cultural changes in the United States were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The abbreviated form "pop" for popular, as in [[pop music]], dates from the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="NewGrovev15p85"&gt;''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', volume 15, p. 85 entry ''Pop music''&lt;/ref&gt; Although terms "pop" and "popular" are in some cases used interchangeably, and their meaning partially overlap, the term "pop" is narrower. Pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass appeal, while "popular" refers to what has gained popularity, regardless of its style.&lt;ref name="Steinem1965p73"&gt;[[Steinem, Gloria]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 ''Outs of pop culture''], in ''LIFE'' magazine, 20 August 1965, p. 73 quotation: {{quotation|Pop Culture-although big, mercurial, and slippery to define-is really an umbrella term that covers anything currently in fashion, all or most of whose ingredients are familiar to the public-at-large. The new dances are a perfect example... Pop Art itself may mean little to the average man, but its vocabulary...is always familiar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="top40.about.com"&gt;Bill Lamb, [http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm "What Is Pop Music? A Definition"], ''[[About.com]]'', retrieved 8 March 2012 quotation: {{quotation|It is tempting to confuse [[pop music]] with [[popular music]]. The ''[[New Grove Dictionary Of Music and Musicians]]'', the [[musicologist]]'s ultimate reference resource, identifies popular music as the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class. This would include an extremely wide range of music from vaudeville and minstrel shows to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Pop music, on the other hand, has primarily come into usage to describe music that evolved out of the [[rock 'n roll]] revolution of the mid-1950s and continues in a definable path to today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author John Storey, there are six definitions of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;John Storey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much "[[high culture]]" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also "popular." "Pop culture" is also defined as the culture that is "left over" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]].

A third definition equates pop culture with "[[mass culture]]" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Sérgio Campos Gonçalves, “[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216881597_Cultura_e_Sociedade_de_Consumo_um_olhar_em_retrospecto/file/6f288d60667a164854d4258d97a2a8b9.pdf?ev=pub_int_doc_dl Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]”, InRevista – Núcleo de Produção Científica em Comunicação – UNAERP (Ribeirão Preto), v. 3, pp. 18–28, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to American culture.{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, "pop culture" can be defined as an "authentic" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the "people."{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory "... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society." A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would "no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture."

Storey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2012}}

Popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and [[time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].

===Folklore===
Adaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A. W. Smith ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'', Vol. 104, No. 1/2 (1993), pp. 144–150&lt;/ref&gt; This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today, in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of [[joke]]s or [[urban legend]]. With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.

Although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves.

== Usage ==
Many people say that popular culture is a tool that higher ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the "common man", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television programs===
{{Main|Television program}}
A television program is a segment of audiovisual content intended for broadcast (other than a commercial, trailer, or other content not serving as attraction for viewership).

Television programs may be [[fictional]] (as in [[television comedy|comedies]] and [[dramatic programming|dramas]]), or [[non-fictional]] (as in [[documentary television|documentary]], [[television news|news]] and [[reality television]]). It may be topical (as in the case of a [[local programming|local]] [[newscast]] and some [[made-for-television]] movies), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series). They can be primarily [[instructional television|instructional]] or [[educational television|educational]], or entertaining as is the case in [[situation comedy]] and [[game shows]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Music===
{{Main|Popular music}}
'''Popular music''' is music with wide appeal&lt;ref name="PopMusic1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "popular music" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/popular-music|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is typically distributed to large audiences through the [[music industry]]. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no [[musical training]].&lt;ref name="PopMusic1"&gt;Popular Music. (2015).

Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of [[written music]], although since the beginning of the [[recording industry]], it is also disseminated through [[sound recording|recordings]]. Traditional music forms such as early [[blues]] songs or [[hymn]]s were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.&lt;ref name="PopMusic2" /&gt;

'''Public Analysts''' are scientists in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] whose principal task is to ensure the safety and correct description of food by testing for compliance with legislation.&lt;ref name=Dublin&gt;[http://www.publicanalystdublin.ie/en/ Public Analyst's Laboratory, Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt; Most Public Analysts are also Agricultural Analysts who carry out similar work on animal feedingstuffs and fertilisers.&lt;ref name=AgAct&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1970/pdf/ukpga_19700040_en.pdf Agriculture Act 1970, CHAPTER 40]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays this includes checking that the food labelling is accurate. They also test drinking water, and may carry out chemical and biological tests on other consumer products.&lt;ref name=UKPAS&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/News/Adjournment_Debate/The_Public_Analyst_Service_April_2009.pdf The Public Analyst Service]&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the work is done by other scientists and technicians in the laboratory, the Public Analyst has legal responsibility for the accuracy of the work and the validity of any opinion expressed on the results reported. There is an [http://www.publicanalyst.com/ Association of Public Analysts], which includes members with similar roles if different titles in other countries.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/ Association of Public Analysts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The office of Public Analyst was established in 1860, with the Act for Preventing the Adulteration of Articles of Food and Drink, the first three appointments being in [[London]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=Dublin/&gt;  Since the separation of the UK and Ireland, they operate under different legislation, but the term and general duties are the same.  The original work was chemical testing, and this is still a major part, but nowadays microbiological examination of food is an important activity, particularly in Scotland, where Public Analyst laboratories also carry out a statutory Food Examiner role.

==UK==
The primary UK legislation is the [[Food Safety Act 1990]].   All local authorities are required to appoint a Public Analyst,&lt;ref name=FSA1990S27&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/ukpga_19900016_en_5#pt3-pb1-l1g27]&lt;/ref&gt; although there have always been fewer Public Analysts and their laboratories than local authorities, most being shared by a number of local authorities. On the UK mainland there has always been a mixture of public sector and private sector laboratories. This remains the case today - but they all provide an equivalent service, and avoidance of conflicts of interest are ensured by the statutory terms of appointment. There is a statutory qualification requirement&lt;ref name=SI2463&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19902463_en_1.htm Statutory Instrument 1990 No. 2463 The Food Safety (Sampling and Qualifications) Regulations 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; for Public Analysts, known as the Mastership in Chemical Analysis (MChemA), awarded by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].  This is a specialist postgraduate qualification by examination that verifies knowledge and understanding of food and its potential defects, interpretation of food law, and the application and interpretation of chemical analysis for food law enforcement.

The Public Analysts’ laboratories must be third-party accredited to [[British Standard]] ISO 17025.&lt;ref name=ISO17025&gt;International Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 - ''General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories''  [[British Standards Institution|BSI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1980s there were some 40 Public Analyst Laboratories in the UK with over 100 appointed Public Analysts.  By 1993 that had reduced to 34 Laboratories and around 80 Public Analysts, and by 2010 the number of Public Analyst Laboratories in the UK had reduced to 22&lt;ref name=PALabs&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/The_Laboratories/the_laboratories.html]&lt;/ref&gt; with only about 26 Public Analysts.

Enforcement of food law in the UK is by local authorities, principally their [[environmental health|environmental health officers]] and [[Trading Standards Institute|trading standards officers]].  Whilst these officers are empowered to take samples of food, the actual assessment in terms of chemical analysis or microbiological examination and subsequent interpretation that are necessary to determine whether a food complies with legislation is carried out by Public Analysts and Food Examiners respectively, scientists whose qualifications and experience are specified by regulations.

==Ireland==
Public Analyst Laboratories in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Dublin and [[Galway]] provide an analytical service to the Food Safety Authority.&lt;ref name=Dublin/&gt;

==Practice==
The Public Analyst runs a laboratory which will:
* Analyse food:
** for composition: many foods have legally defined, customary or expected  compositions
** for [[food additive|additives]]: which must be legally permitted and within prescribed concentrations
** for [[Food contaminants|contamination]]: chemical, [[Microbiology|microbiological]]
** to assess the accuracy of labelling
** to investigate whether complaints by the public are justified
* Interpret relevant law passed by the [[European Union|EU]] and UK or Ireland:
** act as [[expert witness]] in prosecutions

In addition to their central rôle in relation to food law enforcement, Public Analysts provide expert scientific support to local authorities and the private sector in various other areas, for example they:
* analyse [[drinking water|drinking]], bathing water including swimming pools, industrial effluents, industrial process waters and other waters
* investigate environmental products and processes including assessing land contamination, building materials and examining fuels 
* advise on [[waste management]]
* investigate and monitor [[air pollution]]
* advise on consumer safety - in particular consumer products such as toys
* monitor asbestos and other hazards
* carry out toxicological work to assist HM Coroners

== Sampling ==
Sampling is largely outside the control of the Public Analyst.

Local authorities have a duty to check the safety of food and to provide adequate protection of the consumer. To achieve that they devise sampling plans, seeking to balance their need to monitor food against limited resources and other demands on their budgets. A typical sampling plan for a local authority might include samples of the following:

* samples from a particular source - a supermarket, manufacturer or caterer or country
* meat products - to check %meat or %fat or non-meat  or additives or species
* product marketing claims
* undeclared ingredients in prepared foods
* contaminated products
* nutritional content of prepared meals

==Other works==
;At College
Carver's first publication was in the Chico State student newspaper, ''The Wildcat'', on October 31, 1958. His contribution was a letter to the editor entitled "Where Is Intellect?", which complained about the apathy of students on campus. In 1962, Carver wrote an absurdist one-act play entitled ''Carnations'', which was staged on his college's campus on May 11 and received mostly negative feedback. The play was published in 1992 by Engdahl Typography.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

A fragment of Carver's unfinished novel ''The Augustine Notebooks'' was published in ''Iowa Review'' (Summer 1979), and later collected in ''Call If You Need Me'' (2000) and ''Collected Stories'' (2009). Additionally, Carver had accepted an advance on an unwritten novel from [[McGraw-Hill]] and planned to write a novel he imagined as "an ''[[The African Queen (novel)|African Queen]]'' sort of thing" set in German East Africa after [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview of Raymond Carver in ''Times Standard'' of Eureka California, July 24, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Carver later admitted he stopped working on the novel after two weeks, and it appears that nothing of it exists beyond the published fragment.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1982, Carver was approached by director [[Michael Cimino]] with the idea of reworking a screenplay on the life of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. Carver asked Tess Gallagher to assist him in the project. The movie was never produced but the screenplay, entitled ''Dostoevsky'', was published by Capra (Santa Barbara, 1985).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Editing==
Carver served as the founding editor of the [[California State University, Chico|Chico State]] literary magazine ''Selection'' in 1960 and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]] journal ''Quarry'' (later ''Quarry West'') in 1971. He also edited the Spring 1963 issue of ''Toyon'' at [[Humboldt State University|Humboldt State]]. Carver also selected the contents for the book ''Syracuse Poems and Stories 1980'' ([[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], N.Y.: Department of English, [[Syracuse University]], 1980). He also selected, along with Shannon Ravenel, the stories included in ''The Best American Short Stories 1986'' (Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin]], 1986) and edited ''American Short Story Masterpieces'' (New York: Delacorte Press, 1987) with Tom Jenks.

=== Spiritism and Spiritualism ===
At the beginning of the first chapter Hartmann explains that "the word '[[Spiritism]]' is of French production" but the English, and most part of the Germans prefer the term "Spiritualism." The author presents to use the term [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|"Spiritualism"]] to denote the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] point of view, which is the opposite of [[materialism]], and the explanation of [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] phenomena through participation of "[[spirit]]s", he offers to call by the term "Spiritism." {{sfn|Hartmann|2012|p=1}}{{refn|group=note|"Spiritualism is a religion based upon the belief that mediumship, the ability demonstrated by a few select persons to contact the world of spirits, proves that the individual survives bodily death. It arose in midnineteenth-century America and has spread around the world."{{sfn|Melton|2014|p=118}}}} He believes that most people, who are aspiring for Spiritism and read Spiritist journals, have no interest in a scientific study of the phenomena of mediumship, but instead seek "the confirmation of their belief in [[Afterlife|immortality]]."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=2|Treitel|2004|2p=14}}{{refn|group=note|History of "[[table-turning]]" in Germany began "in January 1853 when a woman in Bremen" received from New York a letter by her brother in which he, having reported on his successful spiritualistic experiments, suggested to her to conduct hers own experiments, in accordance with the detailed instructions attached to the letter. A few days later, in the salon belonging to the Bremen businessman, one of the first spiritualistic [[séance]]s in Europe was held.{{sfn|Treitel|2004|p=30}}}} Hartmann considers a reopening of the huge field of phenomena, that were rejected in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as a great merit of the modern spiritistic movement. However, in his opinion, Spiritism threatens to become a public disaster in Germany, therefore the state should use its authority in order to interest scientists in a study of the spiritistic phenomena. He writes that the public has the complete right to know about these things, and since it is not able to formulate its own opinion, it only remains to wait for the conclusions drawn by the official representatives of science.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=14, 15, 20|Treitel|2004|2pp=14, 15|Doyle|2013|3p=183}}{{refn|group=note|[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] stated that, in accordance with the Hartmann philosophy, "the [[soul|ego]] survives death as a discarnate entity against a background of... Christian theology, and spiritualist speculations."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1993|p=23}}}}{{refn|group=note|[[Frank Podmore]] wrote that the immature views of the first American Spiritualists were "transmuted and elaborated by European, and especially by German thinkers [including Hartmann]," who have leaded the phenomena into rank of scientific facts "by postulating new forces or new extensions of familiar forces, resident in the human organism, rather than to be content with adopting an explanation which is practically the negation of all explanations—the operations of spirits."{{sfn|Podmore|2011|p=162}}}}

=== Research methodology ===
Hartmann writes that in order to study the [[Paranormal|"abnormal phenomena of human nature"]] it is necessary to appeal to persons who are endowed with an abnormal organism. It should be remembered, he continues, that just as in "experiments with an electrical friction machine", there may be failures in experiments with mediums, but this should not prevent the "investigation of abnormal phenomena." He believes that the scientific study of spiritism should be based on "general methodological axioms" which can not be "transgressed with impunity."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1pp=4, 112|Карышев|1895|2p=27}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"First, principles are not to be multiplied without necessity; thus a second sort of causes are not to be supposed, as long as a single sort will suffice. Secondly, we should as long as possible abide by causes whose existence is guaranteed by experience or indubitable inference, and should not unnecessarily catch at causes of doubtful or unproven existence, such as are to be first established by their value as hypothesis for the explanation of phenomena in question. Thirdly, we should as long as possible try to do with natural causes and not touch supernatural ones without urgent necessity. Against these three axioms Spiritism offends."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1pp=112–3|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=333–4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hypothesis of hallucinations ===
The study of "masked [[somnambulism]]," as Hartmann argues, can give an understanding of the "whole area" of mediumistic phenomena.{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=31}}{{refn|group=note|"'''Somnambulism''', a state of sleep, or half-waking trance, spontaneously or artificially induced in which subconscious faculties take the place of normal consciousness and direct the body in the performance of erratic (sleep walking) or highly intellectual actions (solving problems)."{{sfn|Fodor|1966a}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Massey, facts of somnambulism in respect to mediumistic phenomena "have certainly been too much neglected by Spiritualists."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xi}} Du Prel wrote that somnambulism is "the most convincing proof" of the existence of supersensible world, since it shows that subconsciously "we have intertwined" with this transcendental world. Somnambulism proves that "[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and Hartmann were right," when they asserted that the will and the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] compose basis for the phenomenon of man.{{sfnm|Du Prel|1889|1p=189|Du Prel|2012a|2p=166}}}} He explains that an "universal medium must be more than autosomnambule; he must be at the same time a powerful [[Animal magnetism|magnetiser]]." In his opinion, on a spiritistic [[séance]] medium plunges itself into a state of "masked or open somnambulism." Further, such a medium-autosomnambule has hallucinations, considered by him for reality, and at the same time, he possesses a strong desire that those present should see this imaginary reality, i.e. would have the same hallucinatory ideas as he himself.{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=32|Аксаков|1910|2pp=269–71}}

Hartmann believes that "from the scientific psychological standpoint" every participator of mediumistic séance must constantly think on himself that he is under the influence of a very powerful [[Animal magnetism|mesmerist]] who aims to immerse him in masked somnambulism and thus taint him with his hallucinations.{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=53|Аксаков|1910|2p=277}}{{refn|group=note|Hartmann explains mediumistic phenomena "psychologically in terms of hidden mental powers." He argues that medium is "a powerful mesmerist, capable of... creating a shared hallucination."{{sfn|Wolffram|2009|p=42}}}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The mediums in their state of masked or open somnambulism have a size of nerve force, be it self-produced or extracted and accumulated by those present, as no magnetiser in his waking state has made it unfold, so surely theirs ability must with the help of this superior quantity of force to put those present in a state of open or masked somnambulism, greater than that of any magnetiser acting in the awake state."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=55|Aksakow|1894a|2p=309}}{{refn|group=note|According to Hartmann, the existence of a "mediumistic nerve force", which, he writes, is "mistakenly" called a psychic one, is a fact.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=111|Аксаков|1910|2p=668}}}}{{hidden|Original text (in German)|Die Medien in ihrem larvirten oder offenen Somnambulismus über ein Maass von Nervenkraft, sei es selbstproducirter, sei es von den Anwesenden extrahirter und angesammelter, verfügen, wie noch kein Magnetiseur im ganz wachen Zustand es zur Entfaltung gebracht hat, so gewiss muss auch ihre Fähigkeit, mit Hilfe dieses überlegenen Kraftquantums die Anwesenden in einen Zustand von offenem oder larvirtem Somnambulismus zu versetzen, grösser sein als die irgend eines im wachen Zustand agirenden Magnetiseurs.|headerstyle=background:#DDDDDD}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Hartmann, the waking will of the medium in the somnambulic state fulfills the function of a magnetiser, giving the somnambulic consciousness a certain direction in relation to emerging hallucinations. If a medium "has the hallucination" of no longer being itself but of being the "spirit of [[Katie King (spirit)|Katie King]]," for example, and of appearing as such, the hallucination will also be transmitted to the recipients, that the medium who emerges from the curtain really is "Katie King."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=95|Аксаков|1910|2p=272}} He believes that materialisation is most often just a transfiguration of medium himself,{{refn|group=note|"'''Transfiguration''', metamorphic power of the medium to assume bodily characteristics of deceased people for their representation."{{sfn|Fodor|1966b}}}} because when the phantom was separating from the medium it always appeared that it was completely coming from the medium and returning to him.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=110|Аксаков|1910|2p=669}}{{refn|group=note|Hartmann tries to refer to "cases of hallucination-transference" that took place among "Indian fakirs and Turkish dervishes,"{{sfn|Hartmann|2012|p=89}} however, according to [[William Walker Atkinson|Ramacharaka]], although the images materialized "from the air" by fakirs are similar to those that are observed in spiritualistic séances, "there is really no connection between the two classes of phenomena."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=310}}}}

The hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann rejects the possibility of obtaining photographs on which both the medium and the materialised figure would be simultaneously placed, since hallucination can not be photographed, thus, in the opinion of its author, all such photographs are fake.{{sfn|Вагнер|1889|p=lii}} For example, about a photograph taken by [[William Crookes]], on which can seen the medium simultaneously with the phantom, Hartmann writes that it is exposed to the strong suspicion that "instead of the supposed phantom the medium, and instead of the supposed medium the dress of the medium, stuffed with a cushion in a half-concealed position, have been photographed."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=93|Аксаков|1910|2p=238}}{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blavatsky]] wrote: "Man can create. Given a certain intensity of will, and the shapes created by the mind become subjective. Hallucinations, they are called, although to their creator they are real as any visible object is to any one else. Given a more intense and intelligent concentration of this will, and the form becomes concrete, visible, objective."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1877|p=62}}}}

=== Hypothesis of nerve force ===
According to Hartmann, any physical phenomena of mediumship, regardless of their complexity, are always fulfilled due to "mediumistic nerve force,"{{sfn|Carrington|1907|p=367}}{{sfn|Melton|2001b}} which is nothing else than a physical force that is "produced" by medium's nervous system and passes unhindered through any substance, "like magnetism."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=50|Aksakow|1894a|2p=156}}{{refn|group=note|"Hartmann explained the physical phenomena as due to some force analogous to electricity or magnetism emanating from the medium's body."{{sfn|Podmore|2011|p=162}}}} The medium's will must direct this force and control the one, and the distribution of the one depends on the "fantastic image that is in the somnambulistic conscious of the medium." In addition, physical phenomena that require "a special strain of nerve force" are occurring when mediums sink into "an open somnambulism."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=31, 51|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=221, 317}} The author confirms that the imprints of organic forms belong to "the most striking phenomena" of mediumship—they had been surpassed only cases of "matter's penetration through matter." He admits that the imprints undoubtedly prove that in this case there is no transfer of hallucinations but "an objective-real impact of mediumistic force on matter,"{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=52|Аксаков|1910|2p=132}} and explains this phenomenon as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we imagine another arrangement of the pressure and tension lines of the mediumistic nerve force—an arrangement corresponding to those pressures that are produced by inner side of the flat laying hand on a soft substance capable of perceiving the imprint, then the movement of the particles of matter caused by such a dynamical system should again be consistented with that, which is caused by direct pressure of the hand, i.e. imprint of an organic form would have been obtained, although such a form, capable of producing such imprint, might not has been in material kind."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=50|Aksakow|1894a|2p=154}}{{refn|group=note|This passage of the philosopher was commented by Aksakov as follows, "This explanation contains a number of impossibilities from the point of view of physics."{{sfn|Aksakow|1894a|p=154}}}}{{hidden|Original text (in German)|Denkt man sich eine andre Anordung der Druck- und Zuglinien der mediumistischen Nervenkraft, entsprechend denjenigen Druckverhältnissen, welche die Innenseite einer flach ausgestreckten Hand auf einen eindrucksfähigen Stoff hervorbringt, so müsste die Verschiebung der Stofftheilchen, welche durch ein solches dynamisches System hervorgebracht würde, wiederum mit der durch den Druck der Hand hervorgebrachten übereinstimmen, d. h. den Abdruck einer organischen Form zeigen, ohne dass eine organische Form in materieller Gestalt vorhanden gewesen wäre, welche diesen Abdruck hervorgebracht hätte.|headerstyle=background:#DDDDDD}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the phenomena Hartmann explains by the fact that medium in a state of somnambulism allegedly combines "the hallucination of the emerging image" with the idea on the need to move a real object and unconsciously produces this [[Psychokinesis|displacement]] "with the help of his mediumistic nerve force," while remaining confident that it was performed by own force of the fantastic image that has appeared by him, that is, through the "transfer of his hallucination to the audience," he unconsciously inspires them with the idea that the displacement that occurred really was fulfilled by that ghost which is just his hallucination.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=102|Аксаков|1910|2p=127}}{{refn|group=note|Aksakov commented, "So, we have here a hallucination with additive of the nerve force."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=127}}}}{{refn|group=note|Ramacharaka wrote that many of the so-called spiritistic phenomena are actually produced by "the unconscious [[astral projection]] of medium," and not by incorporeal beings, staying on other [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]].{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=323}}}}

=== Mental manifestations ===
Regarding spiritistic messages, Hartmann argues that only "the somnambulistic consciousness" can be the source of their content. He writes, "All messages have a content corresponding to the mental level and views of the medium." As a rule, this level happens to be "below the spiritual level" of the medium and participants of the séance, less often it equals, but it happens to be never higher.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=116|Аксаков|1910|2pp=304, 349}}

The author writes that some mediums, with their "mimic transfigurations", exhibit striking linguistic abilities. They can reproduce words and phrases "in strange, incomprehensible dialects", which they had previously accidentally heard without paying attention to this.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=60|Аксаков|1910|2p=380}} According to Hartmann, only a medium, who can write, can "produce [[automatic writing]] or perform writing at a distance [without the involvement of the hand]."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=49|Аксаков|1910|2p=369}}{{refn|group=note|However, Aksakov discovered "in the annals of spiritualism" several cases of mediumship of babies, associated with automatic writing.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=369}}}}

=== Explanation of paranormal ===
In principle, Hartmann admits the possibility of a mediumistic phenomenon of "the penetration of matter", as well as allows for the possibility of all other phenomena confirmed by the testimony of witnesses. However, he opposes the hypothesis by German astronomer [[Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner|Zöllner]] about the fourth dimension of space, preferring, rather,  the statement "on the molecular shakes of material bonds in the body, than the one on movements and vibrations outside of three-dimensional space."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=45|Aksakow|1894a|2p=116}}{{refn|group=note|Zöllner never admitted that spiritistic phenomena are produced by the spirits of dead people, but he connected them with the actions of some "mysterious beings" controlling the fourth dimension of space.{{sfn|Treitel|2004|p=14}}}} According to Hartmann, neither the sack nor the cage in which the medium can be contained will not be a hindrance to him: if he can pass through a substance in a state of sleep, "nothing prevents him from appearing as a phenomenon in front of the audience, in spite of all these precautions."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=88|Aksakow|1894a|2p=223}}{{refn|group=note|In Aksakow's opinion, "penetration" of one solid body by another can be imagined as the dematerialization of matter at the moment of passing through the object and then its reverse materialization.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=101}}}}

After the mentioning to the "expansive action" of the mediumistic nerve force that overcomes the "cohesion of material particles" and leads to acoustic phenomena, Hartmann proceeds to spiritistic phenomena related to "penetration of matter", classifying them as "an especially incredible field of phenomena." He refers to the confirmed experiments of Zöllner and the facts of "a [[apport (paranormal)|transference]]" of objects into a locked room,{{sfn|Melton|2001}} which repeatedly observed under the most stringent conditions of control. He lists various types of "the penetration of matter": the passing an iron ring through the hand of a medium, penetration of coins, slate-pencils, etc. in completely closed boxes, the inserting a ring on the table's leg, the tying of knots on ropes and belts with "sealed" ends, the bringing into the séance's room the items from another room or other houses, as well as bringing of flowers which were growing outside the room.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=44–5|Aksakow|1894a|2p=115}}

According to Hartmann, medium can't by only his will or by his purely psychological influence, cause the above-mentioned physical phenomena in inanimate objects. The main action of the will is a release the "mediumistic nerve force" out the nervous system and its directing with a certain way on the living or dead objects. Nevertheless, according to him, in the study of any phenomena of mediumism, with the exception of [[clairvoyance]], there is no need to go "beyond the bounds of the natural explanations."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=106|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=127, 224}}

=== On hypothesis of spirits ===
In conclusion, Hartmann assesses the central idea of spiritism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thus the whole hypothesis of spirits has dissolved into pure nothingness, after first the direct physical power, then the production of the phenomena of materialisation, and finally production of the ideality of the manifestations, have shifted from the presupposed spirits to the mediums. Whether there are spirits or not, we do not have to examine here; in any case, if there are any, they are referred back to that other world from which Spiritualism believed them to have sunk into this world."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=117|Aksakow|1894b|2p=749}}{{sfn|Carroll|2003}}{{refn|group=note|According to Massey, the spiritualistic hypothesis about the activities of the spirits of dead people was greatly exaggerated, and most of the reports allegedly originating from them could be explained by other reasons that were not recognized. He wrote, "The current Spiritualist conception of death as a simple change of external conditions, so that there is a mere continuity of consciousness on the same level, and in the same modes, seems to me to denote great poverty of thought nor are we constrained to accept it on the evidence of facts."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xv}} However, according to [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]], after he made five hundred séances with a medium [[Leonora Piper]], "no other hypothesis except for the spiritualistic one can explain the phenomena that he observed."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=677}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
One of the most active critics of Hartmann's book was [[Alexander Aksakov]].{{sfn|Melton|2001a}}{{refn|group=note|His "Answer for Hartmann" Aksakov began to print in parts in a German journal ''Psychische Studien'' immediately after the publication of this book. In 1890, it was published as a single edition entitled ''Animismus und Spiritismus.''{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=16}}}} The proofs which Aksakov used to "disprove Hartmann's hallucination hypothesis" were the photographs of spirits. The pictures "taken during the séances, in which both the medium and the materialised form were visible," were convincingly demonstrating, according to Aksakov, that materialisation is "an objective phenomenon", and not a kind the mass hypnosis (see the photo on the left). Criticism by Aksakov was supported in the publications of occultists in the journal [[:de:Sphinx (Zeitschrift)|''Sphinx'']], where "Hartmann was portrayed variously as obtuse or dishonest for his refusal to recognise his logical errors."{{sfn|Wolffram|2009|p=42}} Aksakov has been emphasizing that Hartmann had no practical experience and did not pay enough attention to those facts that did not correspond to his convictions, and many phenomena were "completely unknown" to him.{{sfn|Doyle|2013|p=184}}{{refn|group=note|Karl Du Prel highly praised Aksakov's book as having great significance for spreading Spiritism in Germany—it was in detail discussed in his article "Hartmann contra Aksakof" published in the ''Sphinx'' in June 1891.{{sfn|Kaiser|2009|p=69}} He wrote that Hartmann's work takes only 118 pages, whereas Aksakov's response is more than 800 pages (two volumes). This contrast, which is "remarkable in itself," is further strengthened when the reader learns that, according to Hartmann, he himself was never present at séances,{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=16}} whereas Aksakov who has become interested in the Spiritist movement in 1855, since 1870, repeatedly participated in the spiritistic séances.{{sfnm|Treitel|2004|1p=14|Aksakow|2012|2p=xxv|Du Prel|2012b|3p=26}}}}

[[File:Sir William Crookes and Katie King.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;William Crookes, Katie King, and hers medium.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Professor [[:da:Alfred Lehmann|Alfred Lehmann]] wrote that Hartmann uses his hypotheses, according to how it is more convenient to him: if a materialised figure appears on séance, then for him it is just a hallucination imagined by the participators of the séance; if this phantom is displayed in the photo, then its appearance is explained by the action of the mediumistic nerve force, since otherwise it could not be photographed. But the view arbitrarily using such unstable explanations is "scientifically untenable."{{sfn|Lehmann|1908|pp=375–6}} Commenting on Hartmann's statement that imprints of the organic forms are produced by the mediumistic nerve force,{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=52}} Aksakov wrote that this hypothesis necessarily leads to "the acceptance of the length, thickness, and density" of this force, in other words, to that which usually serves to define the body, thus such imprints should be produced "by the action of an invisible body formed with help of the medium," that is, by the materialised form.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=138}} Hartmann also speaks that mediumistic nerve force "can cause thermal and light phenomena," for example, it can produce certain forms, "at least inorganic ones: crosses, stars, a bright field with light points shimmering on it."{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|pp=49–50}} Hence, here, according to Aksakov's commentary, the nerve force becomes visible and does not constitute a hallucination. Why then does the same force that has become visible in a materialized organic image, sometimes in a luminous one, turns into a hallucination? According to Aksakov, the hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann is destroyed "by his own logic."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=284}}

In connection with the hypothesis of the author, explaining the physical phenomena of mediumship, Massey noted that "the opinion of most persons conversant with them will be that Hartmann's hypothesis is too complicated in itself, and even thus is unadequate to the facts."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xiv}} [[Karl, Freiherr von Prel|Karl Du Prel]] brought such Hartmann's statement from the first chapter of his book: "Since I never attended a séance myself, I am not in a condition to form a judgment on the reality of the phenomena in question... On the other hand, I hold myself at any rate competent to offer a conditional judgment on the conclusions to be drawn from these phenomena in case of their reality, for this is peculiarly the office of the philosopher."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=16, 23|Du Prel|1891|2p=380}} Then he commented on this passage as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I must admit, I always believed that there is 'a golden rule for the philosopher'—to remain silent where he has no experience, so that no one could be told: 'Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses!' (If you had been silent, you would have remained a philosopher!) That is why my final verdict lies in the fact that Hartmann, with his writings against spiritism, has certainly contributed to [[eristic]] but not in philosophy."{{sfn|Du Prel|1891|p=380}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, according to professor Heather Wolffram, such researchers as Hartmann and Aksakov with their searches "of a new scientific psychology based on the phenomena of the unconscious" are no less important for modern science than the materialist physiologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and his colleagues.{{sfn|Wolffram|2012}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">In [[economic development]], the '''staples thesis''' is a theory of export-led growth based on [[Economic history of Canada|Canadian]] experience. The theory "has its origins in research into Canadian social, political, and economic history carried out in Canadian universities...by members of what were then known as departments of political economy". From these groups of researchers, "the two most prominent scholars following this approach were [[Harold Innis]] and [[William Archibald Mackintosh|W.A. Mackintosh]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramesh|first=Michael Howlett; Alex Netherton; M.|title=The political economy of Canada : an introduction|year=1999|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Don Mills, Ontario [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-541348-9|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thesis==
The thesis explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east-west conception of trade. Innis argued that Canada developed as it did because of the nature of its staple [[Commodity|commodities]]: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals, that were exported to Britain and the West Indies. This trading link cemented Canada's cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions.

Innis argues that different staples led to the emergence of regional economies (and societies) within Canada. For instance, the staple commodity in [[Atlantic Canada]] was [[cod]]. This industry was very decentralized, but also very co-operative. In western Canada the central staple was [[wheat]]. Wheat farming was a very independent venture, which led to a history of distrust of government and corporations in that part of the country. (Also important, however, were the shocks caused by volatility in the market for wheat and by the weather itself on the growing season.) In [[Central Canada]], the main staple was fur, and the [[fur trade]] dominated the economy for many years. This fur trade was controlled by large firms, such as the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and thus produced the much more centralized, business-oriented society that today characterizes [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]].

Innis depicted the relationship between regions of Canada as one of "heartland" to "hinterland":[[Core-periphery|The periphery]], or hinterland, is dominated by the core, or heartland. Because the heartland was dependent upon the search for and accumulation of staples (which were located in the hinterland) to perpetuate the economy, it sought to gain economic and political power by exploiting the hinterland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innis-mcluhan/030003-1020-e.html "Staples Theory"] in ''Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan'', from [[Library and Archives Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To Innis, it was the fur trade that created the geographical boundaries of Canada. The early links between the Canadian interior and eastern ports led to Canadian unity and its distinctiveness from the [[United States]]. However, the importance of fur as a staple product also resulted in the northern half of the continent remaining dependent on Britain for trade and thus essentially British for so much of its history.

==Influence and criticism==
[[Mel Watkins]] revived the theory during the 1960s and 1970s through his work on resource capitalism and [[Economic history of Canada|Canadian political economy]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Mel Watkins (1967) "A Staples Theory of Economic Growth," In Easterbrook and Watkins (Eds.), ''Approaches to Canadian Economic History. ''Toronto: McClelland and Stewart.&lt;/ref&gt; While the staples thesis originally described the evolution of the Canadian state, it has since been used to study the economies of many nations that are dependent upon [[resource extraction]] and [[primary sector of the economy|primary industries]].

The staples thesis states that export of raw materials can sustain economic growth, while its critics argue that reliance on commodity export should not delay the development of basic [[manufacturing]] and provision of services. Among his strongest critics was [[Robin Neill]] who advocated a post-Innisian thesis, explaining the economic development of Canada as an expression of variegated regions (population density, cultural politics, geographic characteristics) and of their particular north-south relationships with the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Neill  |first=Robin | title=A History of Canadian Economic Thought | series=Routledge History of Economic Thought Series | location=London | publisher= Routledge | year=1991 | isbn=978-0-415-05412-6|chapter=The Staple Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians continue to use elements of the Innis Core-periphery model, applying it for example to British Columbia. That province's economic structure exemplifies the "core-periphery" structure of intra-regional relationships. The core is metropolitan Vancouver, with its concentration of corporate management and transportation functions and manufacturing growth. It dominates an underdeveloped periphery that depends on production and export of staple commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Hutton, "The Innisian core-periphery revisited: Vancouver's changing relationships with British Columbia's staple economy." ''BC Studies: The British Columbian Quarterly'' 113 (1997): 69-100.

The '''Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak''' ({{lang-bg|Казанлъшка гробница}}, ''Kazanlǎška grobnica'') is a vaulted-brickwork "beehive" ([[beehive tomb|tholos]]) tomb near the town of [[Kazanlak]] in central [[Bulgaria]].

The tomb is part of a large royal [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[necropolis]] in the [[Valley of the Thracian Rulers]] near their ancient capital of [[Seuthopolis]] in a region where more than a thousand tombs of kings and members of the Thracian aristocracy can be found.
 
It comprises a narrow corridor and a round burial chamber, both decorated with murals representing a Thracian couple at a ritual funeral feast. The monument dates back to the 4th century BCE and has been on the [[UNESCO]] protected [[World Heritage Site]] list since 1979. The murals are memorable for the splendid horses and for a gesture of farewell, in which the seated couple grasp each other's wrists in a moment of tenderness and equality (according to [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]—a view that is not shared by all specialists). The paintings are Bulgaria's best-preserved artistic masterpieces from the [[Hellenistic period]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/list/Thracian+tomb+of+Kazanlak|title=Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

To preserve the sensitive paintings, the tomb is not open to the public;  a full-size replica was built nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaria Travel [http://bulgariatravel.org/en/object/14/kazanlyshka_grobnica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The seated woman of the murals is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Bulgarian 50 [[Bulgarian lev|stotinki]] coin issued in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnb.bg Bulgarian National Bank].

'''''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen''''' is a 2009 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] directed by [[Michael Bay]] and based on  the [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] toy line. It is the [[sequel]] to 2007's ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', as well as the second installment in the [[live action|live-action]] [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]. Taking place two years after its predecessor, the plot revolves around Sam Witwicky, who is caught in the war between two factions of alien robots, the [[Autobot]]s, led by [[Optimus Prime]] and the [[Decepticon]]s, led by [[Megatron]]. Sam is having strange visions of Cybertronian symbols, and being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named [[Fallen (Transformers)|The Fallen]], who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an [[Spark (Transformers)|energon]] source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process. Returning Transformers include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Megatron, Starscream, and Scorponok.

With deadlines jeopardized by possible strikes by the [[Directors Guild of America]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild]], Bay managed to finish the production on time with the help of [[previsualization]] and a [[scriptment]] by his writers [[David Marconi]], [[Roberto Orci]], [[Alex Kurtzman]], and series newcomer [[Ehren Kruger]]. Shooting took place from May to November 2008, with locations in [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], and [[California]], as well as [[Military air base|air bases]] in [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]. This was the last film in the series to star [[Megan Fox]], and was also the last film in the series to be co-produced by [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Pictures]], leaving [[Paramount Pictures]] as the sole distributor of its future films, starting with ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]''.

''Revenge of the Fallen'' premiered on June 8, 2009 in [[Tokyo]] and was released on June 24, 2009 in the United States. Critical reception was widely negative, and the film is considered inferior to the first film. [[Metacritic]] said the film received "generally unfavorable reviews";&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen|title=''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' (2009)|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] consensus says it is "a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch".&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; The film won three [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] at the [[30th Golden Raspberry Awards]] ceremony and became the highest-grossing film to win the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] award. The film surpassed its predecessor at the box office, grossing a total of $402.1 million in the US and Canada and $434.2 million in other territories, for a total of $836.3 million worldwide. It was the [[2009 in film|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2009]], [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|32nd domestically]] and fourth-highest of the year worldwide. With over 11 million home media sales in 2009, it was also the [[List of best-selling films in the United States|top-selling film of the year in the United States]]. It was followed by ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'' in 2011, ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Age of Extinction]]'' in 2014, and ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight|The Last Knight]]'' in 2017.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;

In 17,000 B.C., the [[Thirteen (Transformers)|Seven Primes]] travel across the universe to create [[Spark (Transformers)|Energon]] with star-absorbing machines called Sun Harvesters, which destroy stars in order to collect their raw material. One of them later known as "[[Fallen (Transformers)|The Fallen]]", defies their rule to never to destroy planets with life by establishing a Sun Harvester on [[Earth]]. He is confronted by, the other Primes, who imprison the Fallen before he can harvest the planet's Sun using the [[Matrix of Leadership]]. The rest of the Primes then sacrifice themselves to hide the Matrix in an unknown location.
 
In the present, two years after Megatron's defeat, the [[Autobot]]s and the U.S. military have formed the Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty (NEST), a classified international task force used to eliminate the surviving [[Decepticon]]s. In [[Shanghai]], the Autobots intercept two Decepticons, Demolisher and Sideways. Sideways is killed by the Autobot [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]], while [[Optimus Prime]] kills Demolisher, but not before he warns them of the Fallen's return. At NEST's secure headquarters in [[Diego Garcia]], National Security Adviser Theodore Galloway concludes the Decepticons are still on Earth to hunt the Autobots, since Megatron's corpse is at the bottom of the [[Laurentian fan|Laurentian Abyss]] and the last-known [[Spark (Transformers)|AllSpark]] shard is secured in the base. [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] hacks into a military satellite, overhears the information, and sends [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] to retrieve the shard.

Meanwhile, [[Sam Witwicky]] is preparing to attend college, leaving his girlfriend [[List of Transformers film series characters|Mikaela Banes]] and guardian [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] behind. He finds a smaller AllSpark shard and picks it up, causing him to see Cybertronian symbols. As a side effect, the shard's energy brings various kitchen appliances to life, who then attack Sam and his family. After Bumblebee kills the living appliances, Sam gives the shard to Mikaela, who later captures Decepticon [[Lists of Transformers characters|Wheelie]] when he attempts to steal it. The [[List of The Transformers (TV series) characters#Constructicons|Constructicons]] resurrect Megatron by brutally ripping apart the Constructicon Scrapmetal to provide parts for him, as well as using the stolen shard. Megatron then travels to one of Saturn's moons, where he reunites with his master, the Fallen, who orders him to capture Sam alive and kill Optimus, as he is the only Transformer who can defeat the Fallen. After killing Alice, a Decepticon Pretender disguised as a college student, Sam, Mikaela and his college roommate, Leo are captured by the Decepticon Grindor and taken to an abandoned factory. Megatron reveals that the symbols in Sam's mind will lead the Decepticons to a new Energon source before Optimus and Bumblebee arrive to rescue the trio. Optimus engages Megatron, [[Starscream]], and Grindor; though Optimus injures Starscream by cutting his arm off and killing Grindor, Megatron kills Optimus by impaling him through the chest, destroying his spark. The other Autobots arrive and repel the Decepticons, forcing Megatron and Starscream to retreat. The Decepticons launch devastating simultaneous attacks around the world, destroying ships in the [[United States Second Fleet|Second Fleet]] and damaging [[Paris]]. The Fallen hijacks Earth's [[telecommunication]]s systems, demanding that Sam be handed to him. 

Sam, Mikaela, and Leo enlist the help of former Sector Seven agent, Seymour Simmons, who reveals that the Transformers [[Ancient astronauts|visited]] Earth [[Aeon|eons]] ago and the most ancient, known as [[Seekers (Transformers)|Seekers]], remained on Earth, hiding in secret. With help from Wheelie, they track down a Decepticon Seeker named [[Jetfire#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Jetfire]] at the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian Air and Space Museum]]. They use their shard to revive Jetfire, who teleports the group to [[Egypt]] and explains the story of the Fallen. Jetfire and Wheelie turn against the Decepticons, and order them to locate the Matrix, which could revive Optimus. Sam's group finds the Matrix in [[Petra]], but it disintegrates into dust in Sam's hands. Undeterred, Sam stuffs the Matrix's remains into his sock.
 
Meanwhile, NEST forces and the Autobots land near the [[Giza pyramid complex]] but are attacked by a large force of Decepticons. During the battle, many Constructicons combine to form [[List of The Transformers (TV series) characters|Devastator]], who destroys one of the pyramids to reveal the Sun Harvester inside, before he is killed by a destroyer's [[railgun]] called in by Simmons. Ravage and the Decepticon Rampage attempt to spring a trap with Sam's captured parents as bait, in order to force Sam to give them the Matrix, but Bumblebee interferes and kills them both. Major William Lennox and Master Sergeant Robert Epps call in an airstrike, which kills the majority of the Decepticon ground forces. However, Megatron manages to shoot Sam, seemingly killing him, before retreating upon getting attacked. Nearing his death, the Primes contact Sam through a vision, telling him the Matrix is earned, not found, and that he earned the right to bear it. They restore Sam's life and the Matrix, which he uses to revive Optimus.
 
The Fallen teleports to their location and steals the Matrix from Optimus, then returns to the pyramid with Megatron and activates the Sun Harvester. Jetfire, who was gravely wounded during the battle by Scorponok but did manage to kill his attacker, sacrifices himself in order to transplant his parts to Optimus, which give him immense strength and the ability to fly. Optimus knocks the Fallen and Megatron off the pyramid, destroying the Sun Harvester in the process. In the battle, Optimus disables Megatron and kills the Fallen; vowing vengeance, Megatron retreats with Starscream. The victorious Autobots and their allies then return to the United States as Sam resumes to attend to college.

==Production==

===Development===
Major hurdles for film's initial production stages included the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]] as well as the threat of strikes by other guilds. Prior to a potential [[Directors Guild of America]] strike, Bay began creating [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]] of action sequences featuring characters rejected for the 2007 film.

Screenwriters [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]], who had written the first film, originally passed on the opportunity to write a sequel due to schedule conflicts.

===Filming===
Inspired by its use in [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', three action sequences in ''Revenge of the Fallen'' were shot using [[IMAX]] cameras.&lt;ref name=collidervideo/&gt; Although screenwriter Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be [[3D film|3D]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|authorlink=Roberto Orci|first=Robert|last=Orci|title=Welcome Mr. Roberto Orci, You May Ask Questions|publisher=TFW2005|date=2008-09-24|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/2384404-post1356.html|accessdate=2008-09-24|quote=Some sequences will be in IMAX 3D|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121074414/http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/2384404-post1356.html|archivedate=January 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bay later said he found 3D too "gimmicky".

One shot that was filmed in the University of Pennsylvania was the party scene, filmed at what students call "The Castle". "The Castle" is home to the prestigious Psi Upsilon Fraternity. However, neither the University of Pennsylvania nor Princeton gave Bay permission to be named in the film because of a scene that both institutions felt "did not represent the school" in which Sam's mother ingests [[Cannabis edible#Cultural influence|marijuana-laced brownies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regarding Penn's Open Letter to Michael Bay|publisher=[[Michael Bay]]|date=2009-10-30|url=https://michaelbay.com/newsblog/files/d56f71572ffbeb023c7bea941830a529-226.php|accessdate=2008-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126015132/https://michaelbay.com/newsblog/files/d56f71572ffbeb023c7bea941830a529-226.php|archivedate=November 26, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Revenge of the Fallen'' has an approval rating of 19% based on 244 reviews and an average rating of 3.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' is a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch."&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen/|title=''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen''|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] gave the film an average score of 35 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen|title=''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' (2009)|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CinemaScore]] polls, however, users gave the film a "B+", compared to the "A" that the [[Transformers (film)|original film]] had scored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pamela Mcclintock|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118005468.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1|title='Transformers' on top with $390.4 mil|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2009-06-29|accessdate=2009-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703063140/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118005468.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1|archivedate=July 3, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Actor Shia LaBeouf was unimpressed with the film, stating "We got lost. We tried to get bigger. It's what happens to sequels. It's like, how do you top the first one? You've got to go bigger. [[Michael Bay]] went so big that it became too big, and I think you lost the anchor of the movie...You lost a bit of the relationship. Unless you have those relationships, then the movie doesn't matter.

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''Revenge of the Fallen'' was Bay's worst-reviewed film at the time of release, faring even worse than ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (2001).&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-critics"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Zak, Dan|date=2009-07-01|title=Reaching Critical Mess|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/30/AR2009063004206.html|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the film as "in-your-face, ear-splitting and unrelenting.

Later in his review, Ebert discouraged movie-goers from seeing the film by saying "If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090623/REVIEWS/906239997|title=Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews|work=[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Ebert, Roger|accessdate=2009-06-24|authorlink=Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote on his blog about the film, "The day will come when ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' will be studied in film classes and shown at cult film festivals. It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course there will be many more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/06/the_fall_of_the_revengers.html|title=The Fall of the Revengers|work=The Chicago Sun-Times|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=June 24, 2009|first=Roger|last=Ebert|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626222720/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/06/the_fall_of_the_revengers.html|archivedate=June 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the ''Transformers'' franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Peter Travers]] did not give the film any stars, considering that "''Revenge of the Fallen'' has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt; Which he later did name it the "worst film of the decade". Other reviewers, while still critical, were less damning of the film, ''[[The A.V.

On a year-end poll administered by [[Moviefone]], the film was voted the "worst film of 2009", and Fox's performance the worst by an actress that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2009/12/18/year-end-movie-poll/ |title= Year-End Movies Poll Results |publisher=[[Moviefone]] |accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comcast]] ranked the film as the 4th-worst sequel of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-worstsequels/47/ |title=Worst Sequels of All Time |publisher=[[Comcast]] |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811022049/http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-worstsequels/47/ |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' named the film the 25th-worst movie ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/50-worst-movies-ever/default.asp?film=25 |title=''Empire's'' The 50 Worst Movies Ever |publisher=''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine |date= |accessdate= July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, David Germain from the [[Associated Press]] called the film the "worst-reviewed $400&amp;nbsp;million hit ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/movies/transformers-worst-reviewed-400-million-hit_article_19879 |title= Transformers: Worst-Reviewed $400 Million Hit? |publisher=[[Access Hollywood]] |accessdate= July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable negative reaction to the characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist [[stereotype]]s. Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that "the characters [...] indicate that [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]] remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, [[Jar Jar Binks]] was set loose by [[George Lucas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/movies/24transform.html?hpw|title=Movie Review&amp;nbsp;— Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&amp;nbsp;— Invasion of the Robot Toys, Redux|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-24 | date=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Scott Mendelson said "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-mendelson/huff-post-review---transf_b_219510.html|title=Scott Mendelson: Huff Post Review: Transformers Revenge of the Fallen: The IMAX Experience(2009)|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2009-06-23|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Knowles]], founder of [[Ain't It Cool News]], went further, asking his readers "not to support this film" because "you'll be taking [your children] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/41512|title=Harry says TRANSFORMERS 2 is foul mouthed, racist &amp; misogynistic! It also runs an hour too long!|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=2009-06-23|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as "good clean fun" and insisted that "We're just putting more personality in."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sandy Cohen, The Associated Press|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-06-24-transformers_N.htm|title=Jive-talking twin Transformers raise race issues|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2010-10-17|date=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with "It's really hard for us to sit here and try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, it just shows you that we don't control every aspect of the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/news/orci-and-kurtzman-respond-to-claims-of-racism-in-transformers-2.php|title=Orci and Kurtzman Respond to Claims of Racism in ‘Transformers 2′|publisher=Film School Rejects|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2009-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627124144/http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/news/orci-and-kurtzman-respond-to-claims-of-racism-in-transformers-2.php|archivedate=June 27, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major complaint about the film was Bay's usage of the IMAX format. Instead of using IMAX for complete unbroken sequences similar to director [[Christopher Nolan]]'s approach for ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Bay chose to use the format primarily on a shot-by-shot basis, combining conventional 35mm footage and IMAX shots in the same sequence. That approach, combined with rapid cutting, created a jarring, highly unpleasant experience for most moviegoers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmwblog.com/2009/06/24/how-the-transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-imax-experience-compares-with-the-dark-knight/|title=How The Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen IMAX Experience Compares with The Dark Knight|publisher=Filmwblog.com|accessdate=2011-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328033927/http://filmwblog.com/2009/06/24/how-the-transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-imax-experience-compares-with-the-dark-knight/|archivedate=March 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
Despite mostly negative reviews from critics, the film was a box office success. ''Revenge of the Fallen'' grossed $16 million from midnight showings, at the time the most ever for a Wednesday midnight debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2009/06/24/transformers-midnight-grosses/|title='Transformers 2' racks up record $16 million in Wednesday midnight shows|date=2009-06-29|first=Nicole|last=Sperling|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film proceeded to beat [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]'s record ($44.2 million) for the biggest Wednesday opening in history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2598&amp;p=.htm |title=‘Transformers’ Sequel Blasts Off on First Day |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing in $62&amp;nbsp;million in total receipts on its first day (until ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse]]'' topped this record with $68.5 million in 2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2845&amp;p=.htm|title='Eclipse' Breaks Wednesday Record But Falls Short of 'New Moon'|last=Gray|first=Brandon|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=2010-07-01|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; additionally ranking it as the second biggest opening day ever at the time, behind ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/days/?page=open&amp;p.htm|title=Opening Day Records at the Box Office|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $108.9&amp;nbsp;million on its first weekend, the seventh-largest in history at the time, and brought in $200&amp;nbsp;million in its first five days, putting it in second place behind ''The Dark Knight''{{'}}s $203.7&amp;nbsp;million for the all-time biggest five-day opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2601&amp;p=.htm|title=Weekend Report: ‘Revenge of the Fallen' Rises with Optimal Debut |last=Gray|first=Brandon|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=2009-06-29|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its gross from Friday to Sunday was also the biggest June opening weekend for one year, breaking [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]'s record ($93.7 million), until ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' claimed that record the following year ($110.3&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2826&amp;p=.htm|title=Weekend Report: Pixar Pounds Its 'Toy' Chest|last=Gray|first=Brandon|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=2010-06-21|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Revenge of the Fallen'' remained #1 at the box office for two weeks straight by a close margin. Initial studio estimates showed a tie between it and that weekend's new release ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', but the actual totals showed ''Revenge of the Fallen'' taking the #1 spot yet again with $42.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&amp;yr=2009&amp;wknd=27&amp;p=.htm |title=Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Weekend Chart |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it was the first film of 2009 to reach the $300&amp;nbsp;million mark in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/070908-Transformers2300.html|title=Transformers 2 Passes $600 Million Worldwide Box Office|date=2009-07-08|accessdate=2015-10-26|work=Newsarama}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July&amp;nbsp;27, a month after its release, the movie reached $379.2&amp;nbsp;million in the US, which brought it into the top 10 highest-grossing movies ever in that country as of August&amp;nbsp;2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.transformers-movie-buzz.com/featured/945/revenge-of-the-fallen-cracks-the-top-10-all-time-list.html|title=‘Revenge of the Fallen’ Cracks the Top 10 All-Time List|date=2009-07-27|accessdate=2009-07-28|work=Movie Buzz}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revenge of the Fallen'' closed its box office run with $402.1 million in the U.S. &amp; Canada and $836.3 million worldwide, being the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|thirty-second-highest-grossing film of all time]] domestically, and the [[List of highest-grossing films|84th-highest-grossing film of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=transformers2.htm|title=Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[2009 in film|2009 films]], it was the second-highest-grossing in the United States and Canada, behind ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2009&amp;p=.htm |title=2009 Yearly Box Office Results |publisher=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fourth globally behind ''Avatar'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', and ''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2009&amp;p=.htm |title=2009 Worldwide Grosses |publisher=Box Office Mojo  |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the film marks as the second-highest-grossing [[Hasbro]] film of all time, behind only its sequel ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''.

'''Vardzia''' ({{lang-ka|ვარძია}}) is a [[cave monastery]] site in southern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Rock cut architecture|excavated]] from the slopes of the Erusheti Mountain on the left bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]], thirty kilometres from [[Aspindza]]. The main period of construction was the second half of the twelfth century. The caves stretch along the cliff for some five hundred meters and in up to nineteen tiers. The Church of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]], dating to the 1180s during the [[golden age]] of [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] and [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]], has an important series of [[Mural|wall paintings]]. The site was largely abandoned after the [[History of Georgia (country)#Ottoman and Persian domination|Ottoman takeover]] in the sixteenth century. Now part of a state heritage reserve, the extended area of Vardzia-[[Khertvisi]] has been submitted for future inscription on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.ge/pages/archive_ge/art/mural/georghy/meskheti.html |title=About Meskheti |publisher=[[Parliament of Georgia]] |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reserve"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heritagesites.ge/?lang=eng&amp;page=305 |title=Vardzia Historical-Architectural Museum-Reserve |publisher=[[National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia]] |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5236/ |title=Vardzia-Khertvisi |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NACH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heritagesites.ge/?lang=eng&amp;page=313 |title=Vardzia Monastery complex |publisher=[[National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia]] |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Queen Tamar - Vardzia fresco.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] in the Church of the Dormition, with a model of the church; an [[Aetiology|aetiological myth]] has the young Tamar, when out hunting with [[George III of Georgia|Giorgi]], lost in the caves; when called for, she replied "I am here, uncle" ({{lang-ka|აქ ვარ ძია}}) "ac var dzia", giving the site its name&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt;]]
[[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet-era]] excavations have shown that the area of Vardzia was inhabited during the [[Bronze Age]] and indicated the reach of [[Trialeti culture]]. Cave settlements such as [[Uplistsikhe]] are known along the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] from at least the fifth century BC, while [[rock cut architecture]] in the context of [[Christianity in Georgia (country)|Georgian Christianity]] is known from [[Zedazeni Monastery|Zedazeni]] and Garedzhi from the sixth century AD, and more locally from [[Vanis Kvabebi]], Cholta and Margastani from the eighth century.&lt;ref name="GG"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Monuments of Georgia: Vardzia |author=Gaprindashvili, Ghivi |year=1975 |publisher=Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad |language=English, Russian, Georgian |isbn=978-1-135-68320-7 |pages=7-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four distinct building phases have been identified at Vardzia: the first during the reign of [[George III of Georgia|Giorgi III]] (1156–1184), when the site was laid out and the first cave dwellings excavated; the second between his death and the marriage of his successor [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] in 1186, when the Church of the Dormition was carved out and decorated; the third from that date until the [[Battle of Basian]] c.1203, during which time many more dwellings as well as the defences, water supply, and irrigation network were constructed; while the fourth was a period of partial rebuilding after heavy damage in the earthquake of 1283.&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt;

A number of documentary sources supplement the knowledge derived from the site's physical fabric. The collection of chronicles known as the ''[[The Georgian Chronicles|History of Georgia]]'' refers to Tamar erecting a church to house the [[icon]] of the Virgin of Vardzia after receiving divine help in her campaigns, before transferring the monastery from Upper or Zeda Vardzia. Tamar is said to have departed from Vardzia during her [[Tamar of Georgia#Muslim neighbors|campaign against the Muslims]], and her ensuing victory at [[Battle of Basian|Basian]] is celebrated in the ''Hymns in Honour of the Virgin of Vardzia'' by [[Ioane Shavteli]]. The ''History of Georgia'' also relates how Vardzia escaped the [[Mongol conquests|Mongol invaders]] in the 1290s. The Persian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] chronicler Hasan Bey Rumlu describes Vardzia as a "wonder", "impregnable as the wall of [[Alexander the Great]]", before recounting its sack by the Persians under Shah [[Tahmasp I]] in 1551; a near-contemporary note in the Vardzia Gospel tells of its repatriation from a Persian bazaar. After the arrival of the [[History of Georgia (country)#Ottoman and Persian domination|Ottomans]] in 1578, the monks departed and the site was abandoned.&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt;

==Site==
The greater Vardzia area includes also the early eleventh-century church at Zeda Vardzia and the tenth- to twelfth-century rock village and cave churches of Ananauri. The main lower site was carved from the cliff's central [[stratum]] of [[Tufa|tufaceous]] [[breccia]] at an elevation of thirteen hundred metres above sea level. It is divided into an eastern and a western part by the Church of the Dormition. In the eastern part of the complex are seventy-nine separate cave dwellings, in eight tiers and with a total of 242 rooms, including six chapels, "Tamar's Room", a meeting room, reception chamber, pharmacy, and twenty-five wine cellars; 185 wine jars sunk into the floor document the importance of [[viticulture]] to the monastic economy. In the western part, between the bell tower and the main church, are a further forty houses, in thirteen tiers and with a total of 165 rooms, including six chapels, a [[refectory]] with a bakery, other ovens for baking bread, and a [[forge]]. Beyond the bell tower the complex rises to nineteen tiers, with steps leading to a cemetery. Infrastructure includes access tunnels, water facilities, and provision for defence.&lt;ref name="NACH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"/&gt;

==Church of the Dormition==
[[File:Vardzia Cave City, Georgia (inside).jpg|thumb|right|200px|View to the [[apse]] and [[Orthodox church (building)#Iconostasis|iconostasis]] or screen decorated with [[icon]]s that separates the [[Orthodox church (building)#Nave|nave]] from the [[Orthodox church (building)#Sanctuary|sanctuary]]]]
The Church of the Dormition was the central spiritual and monumental focus of the site. Carved similarly from the rock, its walls reinforced in stone, it measures {{convert|8.2|m|ft}} by {{convert|14.5|m|ft}}, rising to a height of {{convert|9.2|m|ft}}. Both church and [[Orthodox church (building)#Narthex|narthex]] are painted; these paintings are of "crucial significance in the development of the Medieval Georgian mural painting".&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Its patron, Rati [[Surameli]], is commemorated in a [[donor portrait]] on the north wall; the accompanying [[Epigraphy|inscription]] reads "Mother of God, accept ... the offering of your servant Rati, ''[[eristavi]]'' of [[Kartli]], who has zealously decorated this holy church to your glory".&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt; On the same north wall are portraits of the royal founders, [[George III of Georgia|Giorgi III]] and [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]]; she lacks the ribbon that is the attribute of a married woman and her inscription includes the formula "God grant her a long life", while that of Giorgi does not; this helps date the paintings to between Giorgi's death in 1184 and Tamar's marriage in 1186.&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt; Episodes from the life of Christ occupy the vaults and upper walls in a sequence, starting with the [[Annunciation]], followed by the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]], [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Raising of Lazarus]], [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem]], [[Last Supper]], [[Foot washing|Washing of the Feet]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], [[Harrowing of Hell]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], [[Descent of the Holy Spirit]], and [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] (the church is sometimes known as the Church of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], which corresponds with the [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Orthodox Feast]] of the Dormition).&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Courtauld"/&gt; At a lower level, more accessible as [[Intercession of saints|intercessors]], are paintings of saints and [[stylites]]. On the rear wall of the [[Orthodox_church_(building)#Sanctuary|sanctuary]], behind the altar, are [[Church Fathers#Greek Fathers|Twelve Church Fathers]]. In the [[Orthodox church (building)#Narthex|narthex]] are scenes of the [[Last Judgment]], [[Bosom of Abraham]], Angels bearing a Medallion with the Cross, and three scenes from the life of [[Saint Stephen]]; other paintings were lost in the 1283 earthquake.&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt; The paintings are not [[Fresco|frescoes]], but executed in ''secco'', and "testify to contacts with the Christian Orient and the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] world, but applied using local artistic traditions".&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"/&gt;

==Management==
Since 1985 the site has formed part of the Vardzia Historical–Architectural Museum-Reserve, which includes forty-six architectural sites, twelve archaeological sites, and twenty-one sites of monumental art.&lt;ref name="reserve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2001/whc-01-conf205-inf4e.pdf |title=Evaluations of Cultural Properties by ICOMOS (2001) |pages=18-21 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Vardzia-[[Khertvisi]] was submitted for inscription on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] as a Cultural Site in accordance with criteria [[World_Heritage_Site#Cultural_criteria|ii, iii, iv, v, and vi]].&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"/&gt; In their evaluation, advisory body [[ICOMOS]] cited [[Göreme]] in [[Cappadocia]] as the closest [[Wiktionary:comparandum|comparandum]] amongst cave monastery sites of international [[Values (heritage)|significance]].&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"/&gt;  In 2007 Vardzia-[[Khertvisi]] was resubmitted as a mixed Cultural and Natural Site in accordance also with criterion [[World Heritage Site#Natural criteria|vii]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; From 2012, [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] of the wall paintings in the Church of the Dormition is to be carried out by the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in conjunction with the [[National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia]] and [[Tbilisi State Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name="Courtauld"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/news/documents/Vardzia_Courtauld_Georgia_Collaboration.pdf |title=Vardzia: Preserving the Wall Paintings of Georgia |publisher=[[Courtauld Institute of Art]] |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
