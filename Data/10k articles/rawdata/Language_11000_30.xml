[[File:Blake London.jpg|thumb|300px| The second stanza of William Blake's [[London (William Blake poem)|''London'']] represents an example of anaphora. This image is a digital reproduction of his hand-painted 1826 print from Copy AA of ''[[Songs of Innocence and Experience]]''. The item is currently in the collection of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.aa.illbk.46 |title=Songs of Innocence and of Experience, object 46 (Bentley 46, Erdman 46, Keynes 46) |editor1=Morris Eaves |editor2=Robert N. Essick |editor3=Joseph Viscomi |publisher=[[William Blake Archive]] |location=London 1789 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[rhetoric]], an '''anaphora''' ({{Lang-el|ἀναφορά}}, "carrying back") is a [[rhetorical device]] that consists of repeating a sequence of words at the beginnings of neighboring clauses, thereby lending them [[:wikt:emphasis|emphasis]].&lt;ref name="Zhang2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Xiuguo Zhang |title=English Rhetoric |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZ4Npm20EMAC&amp;pg=PA121 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=清华大学出版社有限公司 |isbn=978-7-81082-377-7 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an [[epistrophe]] (or epiphora) is repeating words at the clauses' ends. The combination of anaphora and epistrophe results in [[symploce]].

==Functions==
Other than the function of emphasizing ideas, the use of anaphora as a rhetorical device adds rhythm to a word as well as making it more pleasurable to read and easier to remember. Anaphora is repetition at the beginning of a sentence to create emphasis. Anaphora serves the purpose of delivering an artistic effect to a passage. It is also used to appeal to the emotions of the audience in order to persuade, inspire, motivate and encourage them.&lt;ref name="Ex.Def."&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://literarydevices.net/anaphora/ |title=Anaphora - Examples and Definition of Anaphora |date=n.d. |website=LiteraryDevices.net |publisher=n.p. |access-date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous "I Have a Dream" speech, he uses anaphora by repeating "I have a dream" eight times throughout the speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/speech-analysis-dream-martin-luther-king/ |title=Speech Analysis: I Have a Dream – Martin Luther King Jr. |last=Dlugan |first=Andrew |date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. MLK Jr.'s use of repetition calls to the audience and persuades them to be the change.

==Usage==

:'''The voice of the Lord''' is over the waters;
::the God of glory thunders,
::the Lord, over many waters.
:'''The voice of the Lord''' is powerful;
::'''the voice of the Lord''' is full of majesty.

:'''The voice of the Lord''' breaks the cedars;
::the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
:He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf,
::and Sirion like a young wild ox.

:'''The voice of the Lord''' flashes forth flames of fire.
:'''The voice of the Lord''' shakes the wilderness;
::the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

:'''The voice of the Lord''' makes the deer give birth
::and strips the forests bare,
::and in his temple all cry, "Glory!"
::&amp;mdash; [[Psalm 29]]:3–9
Today, anaphora is seen in many different contexts, including songs, movies, television, political speeches, poetry, and prose.

:'''with''' charity for all;
:'''with''' firmness in the right,...
::&amp;mdash; [[Abraham Lincoln]], ''Second Inaugural Address''

:'''Out of''' the cradle endlessly rocking,
:'''Out of''' the mock-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
:'''Out of''' the Ninth-month midnight,
:Over the sterile sands, and the fields beyond, where the child, leaving his bed, wander'd alone, bare-headed, barefoot,	
:Down from the shower'd halo,
:Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive,	
:'''Out from''' the patches of briers and blackberries,	
:'''From''' the memories of the bird that chanted to me,	
:'''From''' your memories, sad brother, from the fitful risings and fallings I heard,	
:'''From''' under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tears,
:'''From''' those beginning notes of yearning and love, there in the transparent mist,
:'''From''' the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,	
:'''From''' the myriad thence-arous'd words,	
:'''From''' the word stronger and more delicious than any,	
:'''From''' such as now they start the scene revisiting,...
::&amp;mdash; [[Walt Whitman]], "[[Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking]]"
:'''When I have seen''' by Time's fell hand defaced
:The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
:When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
:And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
:'''When I have seen''' the hungry ocean gain
:Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
:And the firm soil win of the watery main,
:Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
:'''When I have seen''' such interchange of state,
:Or state itself confounded to decay;
:Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
:That Time will come and take my love away.
:This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
:But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
::&amp;mdash; [[William Shakespeare]], [[Sonnet 64]]

::&amp;mdash; [[Winston Churchill]]

'''Never shall I forget''' the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. '''Never shall I forget''' those flames which consumed my faith forever. '''Never shall I forget''' that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live.

==Jharkhand==
Jharkhand is not only in the neighboring state of West Bengal but parts of Rarh region of western part of ancient Bengal are included in this particular state. In many districts of this state, the districts were not included in West Bengal despite the Bengali population being the largest. Currently 42% of Jharkhand's population is Bengali, which is the single largest state in the state. In addition, Bangla and tribes of Bangla Jharkhand (which are called the Definition of Bengali) are the languages connecting However, although Hindi English and Urdu have the status of the official language of the state, Bengali is still not recognized as the official language. Many Bengali organizations of Jharkhand and tribal organizations have long been demanding to declare Bangla as the official language. Although Bengal was declared the second official language of Bengal under the pressure of Bengali movement in Jharkhand, it has not been implemented. Apart from Bangla-speaking students, the deprivation has been accepted, Bengali medium schools have been converted through Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{সংবাদ উদ্ধৃতি|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/city/patna/Bengalis-feel-ignored-by-Jharkhand-govt/articleshow/2103561.cms|title=Bengalis feel ignored by Jharkhand govt - Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{সংবাদ উদ্ধৃতি|url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/make-bengali-the-second-official-language-bangabhasi-samity-968862.html|title=Make Bengali the second official language: Bangabhasi Samity|newspaper=News18|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{সংবাদ উদ্ধৃতি|url=https://anilcmandals.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/bengali-language-bengali-speaking-population-in-jharkhand/|title=Bengali Language &amp; Bengali speaking population in Jharkhand|date=2014-11-12|newspaper=Anil mandal's blog|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Delhi==
During the partition of India in 1947 refugees from East Bengal took refuge in Delhi in the capital of India. At that time, Chittaranjan Park was the main residence in Delhi. Bengali's living in Delhi from last 200 years when Bengal regiment captured Delhi from Maratha in 1803. Bengali's living in Delhi from the time of Mughal when Sultan of Bengal used to do trade. Many Bengali buinsessman used to come to Delhi and stayed.  Many Bengali school which established before independence. Around more than 10 Bengali school's opened before independence and they are N P Bengali Girls Senior Secondary School, Shyama Prasad Vidyalaya, Bidhan Chandra Vidyalaya Senior Secondary School, Union Academy Senior Secondary School, Lady Irwin Senior Secondary School, Raisina Bengali Senior Secondary School, Bengali school J Block Laxmi nagar, Bengali Boys Senior Secondary School, Vinay Nagar Bengali Senior Secondary School, Ramakrishna Sarda Mission Nivedita Vidyamandir and these school's are english medium with Bangla is a mandatory subject. Besides, Bengalis from [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]], [[Assam]], [[Jharkhand]] and other Bengali-speaking states of India came to Delhi, before the Sindhi, Punjabis, and Baniya's.  [[Bengalis]] became Delhi's second largest minority community. According to the Indian population, approximately 2.5 million (25 lakhs) Bengali people live in Delhi.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.anandabazar.com/national/bangla-academy-will-form-at-delhi-1.186027|title=দিল্লিতে বাংলা আকাদেমি গঠনে তৎপরতা|first=সুমনা|last=কাঞ্জিলাল|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, there too Bengalis acknowledged discrimination. Although there are other languages Nizasub academy in Delhi, there is no Bengali language academy. Bangla Medium School is not available for Bengali Studies  in [[Delhi]]. Therefore, Bengalis in Delhi are protesting for the rights of language. Attempts at establishing a Bangla Academy in Delhi are currently underway due to the Bengali movement.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Biennial bearing''' (or alternate) bearing is a term used in [[pomology]] to refer to trees that have an irregular crop load from year to year. In the "on" year too much fruit is set, leading to small fruit size. Excess weight in the main branches can be too much for their mechanical resistance, causing them to break. Another major consequence is that [[flower induction]] will be lower, and the subsequent year will be  "off" year (too little fruit).

The behavior could be due to [[plant hormones]], particularly [[gibberellins]] produced in excess in the "on" years in the [[embryo]]s of the young fruit. It could also be caused by depletion of [[carbohydrate]] reserves in the tree.

Biennial bearing is more common in certain [[fruit crop]]s like [[mango]], [[apple]], [[pear]], [[apricot]] and [[avocado]], and is almost nonexistent in [[grapes]].

==Horticultural management==
This disorder can be reduced by [[thinning]] of [[flowers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=280 |title=Fruit: biennial bearing |accessdate=20 October 2015| publisher=Royal Horticultural Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and young [[fruit]].

[[Cicero]]'s '''''Brutus''''' (also known as ''De claris oratibus'') is a history of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Eloquence|oratory]].  It is written in the form of a dialogue, in which [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] ask Cicero to describe the qualities of all the leading Roman orators up to their time. Cicero then attempts to propose a reconstruction of Roman history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brill's Companion to Cicero|last=May|first=James|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=9004121471|location=Netherlands|pages=401–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is written in the form of a dialogue, the majority of the talking is done by Cicero with occasional intervention by Brutus and Atticus. The work was probably composed in 46 BC, with the purpose of defending Cicero's own oratory. He begins with an introductory section on Greek oratory of the Attic, Asianic, and Rhodian schools, before discussing Roman orators, beginning with [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], "The Liberator", though becoming more specific from the time of [[Marcus Cornelius Cethegus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howatson|first1=M.C|last2=Chivers|first2=Ian|title=Oxford Concise Companion to Classical Literature|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192827081|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
'''''Cicero''''' -  He is the main figure of the work. He strengthens the idea that after the civil war, many of the "good" orators have either left or fled Rome. The few individuals who stayed behind are hiding in silence. Cicero recalls his visits to the forum and some of the orators he has been able to hear. He also mentions his study of eloquence and his dedication to philosophical studies.

'''''Brutus''''' ''-'' He is a friend of Atticus and a person who does not like eloquence.

'''''Atticus''''' - He is a friend of Brutus who encounters Cicero while walking somewhere. Cicero mentions that Atticus is from Athens when he discusses the beginnings of oratory. It should also be noted that Atticus speaks the least of all the three men.

== History of Eloquence ==
Cicero begins his work by lamenting the death of his friend [[Quintus Hortensius|Hortensius]] and then ponders on whether anyone should feel sad that his friend died. His dialogue then proceeds to the moment where he comes across Brutus and Atticus. They begin to discuss a letter that reveals that the Roman state has suffered numerous losses and that Rome is going through tumultuous times. Cicero proceeds and states that he wants to write a universal history of Roman oratory. Because of the fatal overthrow of the state, Cicero deems it necessary to write this '''history of eloquence'''. Cicero begins by stating that [[eloquence]] is a difficult thing to acquire and that it was first present in Atticus' hometown: [[Athens]]. Oratory does not appear in the infancy of Athens, but is evident in the maturity of her power. He traces oratory from figures such as [[Peisistratos]], [[Solon]], [[Pericles]], and mentions how figures like [[Socrates]] challenged them. He continues by saying that oratory was only limited to Athens and was not ubiquitous in Greece. It was from here that oratory spread through parts of Asia and the world.

Cicero then begins to trace the origins of oratory in [[Rome]]. He mentions figures like [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Curius,]] [[Marcus Popillius Laenas|M. Popilius]], [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica|Quinius Metellus]] and even discusses how [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] and [[Lysias]] the Athenian resemble each other in their elegance, character, and brevity. Cicero mentions the idea that Cato is overshadowed by other figures, but is still noteworthy. After Cato, a whole new bunch of orators appeared in Rome like Severius Galba. He also provides an example of how Galba was able to win over the court with an amazing, eloquent speech and that his people (in a court case) were freed from all charges.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cicero's Brutus or History of Famous Orators|last=Jones|first=E.|publisher=AMS Press New York|year=|isbn=0-404-54106-2|location=|pages=1–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the ''Brutus'' ==
Cicero's work is typically seen as a list of orators and the development of oratory in Rome. While the purpose of the Brutus is to record the history of oratory and confirm that it has failed to exist, some scholars believe that Cicero fails in adequately achieving his task. This is a problem because Cicero fails to include a reliable list of Roman oratory by purposely omitting figures like [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], [[Sulla]], [[Catiline]], and [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steel|first=C.E.W.|date=2002–2003|title=Cicero's Brutus: The End of Oratory and the Beginning of History?|jstor=43646670|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|volume=46|pages=195–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also argue that the ''Brutus'' is not a complete list because Cicero fails to include himself in his list.

Another interesting criticism of the Brutus is that it lacks minuscule scene details. The work only thoroughly describes the garden and the statue of Plato where the three men plan to discuss oratory, but other than that, the work is devoid of other details. Whereas the scenery lacks details, the conversation does not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"'''Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door'''" is a phrase attributed to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ruth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kassinger|first=Ruth|title=Build a Better Mousetrap|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=128|isbn=0-471-39538-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lsZx0g_O30C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Build+a+Better+Mousetrap#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inventing modern"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lienhard|first=John H. |title=Inventing Modern: Growing Up with X-Rays, Skyscrapers, and Tailfins |pages=204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7oeXAV_XvB0C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22build+a+better+mousetrap%22+metaphor#v=onepage&amp;q=%22build%20a%20better%20mousetrap%22%20metaphor&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase is actually a misquotation of the statement:
{{quote|If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.|Ralph Waldo Emerson|&lt;ref name="inventing modern" /&gt;}}
According to some sources, the current phrasing of the quotation didn't appear until 7 years after Emerson died.  Thus, in 1889, Emerson was credited with having said

It is unclear who deserves credit for the phrasing in common use today.

The phrase has turned into a metaphor about the power of innovation&lt;ref name="inventing modern" /&gt; and is frequently taken literally, with more than 4,400 patents issued by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] for new mousetraps, with thousands more unsuccessful applicants, making them the "most frequently invented device in U.S. history".&lt;ref name="ruth" /&gt;  The popular modern snap-trap version of the [[mousetrap]] was invented in [[Lititz, Pennsylvania]], by John Mast in 1899, several years after the Emerson misquote had become popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1163.htm |title=Engines of Our Ingenuity No. 1163: A BETTER MOUSETRAP |accessdate=25 Dec 2016 |author=John H.

'''Chamling''' is one of the [[Kiranti languages]] spoken by the [[Kirati people|Kiranti]] of eastern [[Nepal]]. Alternate renderings and names include ''Chamling'', ''Chamlinge Rai'' and ''Rodong'' (which means "Kirati").&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt; It is closely related to the [[Bantawa language|Bantawa]] (some Bantawa-speaking communities call their language "Camling") and [[Puma language]]s of the Kiranti language family in eastern Nepal, and it belongs to the broader [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]].&lt;ref name="E"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rab Ethnologue report on Camling]&lt;/ref&gt; Chamling has SOV word order.

==History==
The Chamling language is one of the languages of the ancient Kiranti culture, which existed well before the arrival of [[Vedic period]] civilisation in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="Cemjonga"&gt;{{cite book| last=Cemjoṅga | first=Īmāna Siṃha | title=History and Culture of the Kirat People | year=2003 | publisher=Kirat Yakthung Chumlung | isbn=99933-809-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important versions of the ''[[Mundhum]]'' &amp;mdash; the main [[religious text]] forming the religious foundation of the [[Kirant Mundhum]] religion and the cultural heritage of the various Kirati people &amp;mdash; are composed in Camling; such versions are distinctive to the Camling-speaking tribes and a guide to their distinctive religious practices and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Monika Bock, Aparna Rao. ''Culture, Creation, and Procreation: Concepts of Kinship in South Asian Practice''. Page 65. 2000, Berghahn Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The Chamling language is used by small communities in eastern [[Sagarmatha Zone]], in central [[Khotang District]], [[Bhojpur District, Nepal|Bhojpur District]] and scattered areas in northern [[Udayapur District]] and a few more districts of eastern Nepal, the southeastern neighbour [[India]]n state of [[Sikkim]], the hill city of [[Darjeeling]] in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and the kingdom of [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name="E"/&gt;

==Demographics==
Despite its geographic prevalence, the actual number of Chamling speakers is estimated to be 10,000, spread across small tribes and villages.&lt;ref name="E"/&gt; Many members of the Chamling ethnic and tribal communities are no longer fluent in the Chamling language, which is taught only in remote areas in the Udayapur District.&lt;ref name="E"/&gt; Like Bantawa, Chamling is an endangered language. Many people in these areas speak a variety of Chamling that is mixed with the [[Nepali language]], which is the official language of Nepal.&lt;ref name="E"/&gt; Most Chamling-speaking people are [[Hindu]]s or practitioners of Kiranti Mundhum.

A '''coil stamp''' is a type of [[postage stamp]] sold in strips one stamp wide. The name derives from the usual handling of long strips, which is to coil them into rolls, in a manner reminiscent of [[adhesive tape]] rolls. A large percentage of modern stamps are sold in coil form, because they are more amenable to mechanized handling in large quantities than either [[Sheet of stamps|sheet stamp]]s or [[Postage stamp booklet|booklet stamp]]s.

==Origins==
Coil stamps first appeared at the beginning of the 20th century.

==In Sweden==
While in most countries coil production is restricted to the workaday stamps used in large quantities, [[Sweden]] has produced coil versions of most of their stamps since 1920.

==In the United Kingdom==
In the UK, coil stamps first appeared in 1907, to supply newly installed [[stamp vending machine]]s. As these were cut from complete sheets, they are perforated on all four sides. As each stamp was worth either a half or one old [[penny]] and 240 pence made up one [[pound sterling]], the coils were in rolls of 960 or 480 each.

==In the United States==
In the [[United States]], [[vending machine]] companies began to experiment with the automated dispensing of stamps. Early efforts to break sheets into strips manually did not work well, since they were prone to tearing and jamming, and soon the companies began to request [[imperforate]] sheets from the post office, cutting those into strips and punching holes of various shapes between each stamp. A variety of these "private coils" is known, some quite rare.

The first US government-produced coils appeared in 1908, produced by pasting together enough imperforate sheets to make rolls of 500 or 1,000 stamps, cutting them into strips and perforating between. The 1-cent, 2-cent and 5-cent values in the Series of 1902 (Second Bureau Issue) were produced in coil versions, but relatively few copies exist because in late 1908 the series was superseded by the Washington-Franklin Issues.  As a result, all Second Bureau coils are quite rare.  Even the most common, the horizontal 2-cent coil, can fetch as much as US$2000, while the much rarer, the 1-cent vertical coil, brought $130,000 at an auction in 2009, and the even rarer 2-cent vertical coil (only eight copies are known) would surely sell for considerably more, should one become available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siegelauctions.com/lot_grd.php?btnSubmit=Search&amp;sale_no=&amp;lot_no=&amp;fastsale=on&amp;sdate1=01%2F01%2F1930&amp;sdate2=10%2F11%2F2011&amp;lotclass=All&amp;majgroup=United+States&amp;cat_supgroup=U.S.+Stamps&amp;subgroup=All&amp;lot_catfk=All&amp;catselect=eq&amp;srtorder=316&amp;pfoper=gt&amp;pfgrade=&amp;gandor=or&amp;pseoper=gt&amp;psegrade=&amp;symbol%5B%5D=All&amp;realized1=&amp;realized2=&amp;keyword=&amp;recsperpage=10&amp;sea_name=&amp;pscolumn=default&amp;sortord=DESC&amp;calledfrom=lkp&amp;sea_emailflag=on&amp;pscolumn=default&amp;sortord=DESC&amp;calledfrom=lkp Siegel Power Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later a [[rotary press]] was adopted, which eliminated the pasting stage. The cylindrical plate used on a rotary press has a seam where ink tends to accumulate, resulting in [[joint line pair]]s.

==Perforations==
The perforations of coil stamps are usually found along the right and left sides ("vertical perf"), but they have also been produced with perforations along the top and bottom ("horizontal perf"). Longer perforations on one side than the other, and separation by cutting rather than tearing, are indications that a stamp may have come from a coil.

==Recent innovations==
A recent innovation enabled by [[Pressure sensitive adhesive|self-adhesive]] technology is the '''linerless coil stamp'''. While most [[self-adhesive stamp]]s have backing paper, linerless coils are like a roll of adhesive tape. Such rolls tend to be enormous, with thousands of stamps, and tend to be used only by large mailing operations.

'''Datian Min''' ({{zh|s=大田闽语|t=大田閩語|p=Dàtián Mǐnyǔ|poj=Tāi-chhân bân-gú}}) or '''Datian dialect''' ({{zh|s=大田话|t=大田話|p=Dàtián Huà}}) is a variety of [[Southern Min]] which is spoken in [[Datian County]], [[Sanming]] Prefecture, [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], China. It is a variety of Southern Min which has been influenced by other Min varieties, including [[Central Min]], [[Eastern Min]], [[Northern Min]] and [[Puxian Min]].

Datian Min developed from [[Hokkien]], a dialect of [[Southern Min]]. Before the year 1535, this area belonged to four counties: [[Youxi]], [[Dehua]], [[Yong'an]] and [[Zhangping]]. Hokkien was spoken in Dehua and Zhangping, while Yong'an and Youxi spoke Central Min and Eastern Min respectively. Datian County was set up and affiliated to Yanping Fu (延平府, mordern [[Nanping]]) which spoke Northern Min in 1535. [[Language contact]] occurred in the later days. The county changed affiliate to Yongchun Zhou (永春州, mordern [[Yongchun County]], spoke Hokkien dialect) in 1734, then to Yong'an Division (永安专区, mordern [[Sanming|Sanming Prefecture]], spoke Central Min) in 1949. The administrative here changed so frequently that the differences between Datian Min and Hokkien dialect became more and more obvious.

Datian Min has little intelligibility with other varieties of [[Southern Min]], and is sometimes classified as a separate branch of Min. Some Chinese scholars call it '''Min dialects transition area''' (闽方言过渡区).

'''Edgar Alexis Robert [[von Wahl]]''' or ''' de Wahl''' (23 August 1867 – 9 March 1948) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-born [[Estonians|Estonian]] teacher, mathematician and linguist. He is most famous for being the creator of [[Occidental language|Occidental]], a naturalistic [[constructed language]] based on the [[Indo-European languages]], which was initially published in 1922. An Estonian of ethnic [[Baltic German]] origin, he studied in [[Saint Petersburg]] and spent most of his later professional life in [[Tallinn]], Estonia.

He was born at [[Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast|Olwiopol]], [[Kherson Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now part of [[Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]).

At first an adherent of [[Volapük]], de Wahl later became one of the first users of [[Esperanto]] and advised [[Ludwig Zamenhof]] on some points of [[grammar]] and vocabulary of that language. After several years he abandoned Esperanto, and in the following decades he worked on the problem of the ideal form of an [[international auxiliary language]].

In 1922 he published a "key" to a new language, ''Occidental'', and the first number of a periodical entitled ''Kosmoglott'' (later ''Cosmoglotta''), written in that language. In following years, de Wahl participated in discussions about Occidental, and allowed the language to develop gradually as a result of the  recommendations of its users. After [[World War II]] started in 1939, he had only intermittent contacts with the Occidentalist movement, which had become centred in [[Switzerland]]. He became a member of the Committee of Linguistic Advisors, part of the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]], which would present [[Interlingua]] in 1951.

The last years of his life were spent in a [[sanatorium]] in Tallinn, Estonia, where he died in 1948. Shortly afterwards, in 1949, the name of Occidental was changed to Interlingue. Later, in 1951, [[Interlingua]] was unveiled; this led to the present insignificance of Interlingue (Occidental).

'''Gour Kishore Ghosh''' (22 June 1923 – 15 December 2000) was a Bengali writer and journalist.

==Early life==
Gour Kishore Ghosh was born in Hat Gopalpur village in the [[Jessore]] district in undivided [[Bengal]], (presently [[Bangladesh]]), on 22 June 1923. He completed his schooling in [[Nabadwip]], and completed his intermediate science (I.Sc.) examinations in 1945.

Due to extreme poverty, Ghosh could not continue his education further and had to become a professional soon after.&lt;ref&gt;http://o3.indiatimes.com/palashbiswas/archive/2007/02/23/3671512.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

He continually changed his professions between 1941 and 1953. Amongst others, he worked as private tutor, electrician and fitter, sailor, waiter at restaurants, trade union organiser, schoolteacher, [[talent manager|manager]] of a touring dance troupe, land customs clearing clerk, [[proof reader]] and others, until from an interim job as a border customs clerk he joined a new daily newspaper, Satyayuga&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=WKLTvyEyUgAC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=sagina+mahato+gour+ghosh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5WdMC1Bkp7&amp;sig=sNQsgUSYf9b9rAMdJcm5_Gckjso&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v9tJSuSJBIWftgeboYilBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&lt;/ref&gt; where his distinctive writing style earned him promotion to editor of two feature sections. Thus, he settled at his chosen profession, that of a reporter / journalist.

==Journalistic and literary career==
Ghosh went on to author popular columns in the literary weekly ''[[Desh (magazine)|Desh]]'' and in [[Calcutta]]'s largest vernacular daily, ''[[Anandabazar Patrika]]'', of which he also became [[senior editor]]. He portrayed the agony of [[West Bengal]] during the [[Naxalite]] movement from 1969 to 1971, in sharp satire, in his "News Commentary by Rupadarshi". He often wrote under his pen-name, ''Rupadarshi''.

After the [[The Emergency (India)|emergency]] was imposed upon India in 1975, Ghosh shaved his head and wrote a symbolic letter to his 13-year-old son explaining his act of "bereavement" over the loss of his freedom to write. Published in ''Kolkata'', a [[Bengali literature|Bengali]] monthly, this letter caused his arrest, was widely circulated through the underground and became a classic of protest. He was sent to jail along with another reporter [[Barun Sengupta]].&lt;ref&gt;The crusade and end of Indira raj by Sudhansu Kumar Ghose – 1978 – Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh smuggled from prison two other letters on abuses of authoritarian rule before, in his cell, he suffered a third heart attack.

He did not write much fiction, but what he wrote was highly appreciated and successful. In his fiction, he has illuminated the underlying human dilemma of West Bengal—of a talented, emotional people sorely affected by deep-seated religious and political differences.

Although reinstated as a senior editor of Ananda Bazar Patrika after the emergency ended and he had recovered from his illness, Ghosh started ''[[Aajkaal]]'' (This Time), in collaboration with a few associates in early 80's.

After a short stint with ''Aajkal'', he wrote for ''Anandabazar Patrika'' till the end.

His weekly satirical column was famous, as also a series of humorous stories. His mature work chose the rather neglected field of interaction between Hindu and Muslim societies.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=WKLTvyEyUgAC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=sagina+mahato+gour+ghosh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5WdMC1Bkp7&amp;sig=sNQsgUSYf9b9rAMdJcm5_Gckjso&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v9tJSuSJBIWftgeboYilBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his lighter works, [[Brojoda]], although not as popular as [[Feluda]], [[Ghanada]] and [[Tenida]], has left his distinct mark in the so-called ''dada-literature'' of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-10-01/kolkata/27223605_1_dadas-satyajit-ray-bengali&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
This humanitarian writer-journalist was presented with many awards during his lifetime. Notable among them were:

# [[Ananda Purashkar]] for Literature (1970)
# Ko Joy Uk Memorial award (1976), from the South Korean Government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesundayindian.com/print.asp?sid=4335&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Aamra Jekhaney'' (June 1970)
#  "Prem ney"
#  "Jol Porey Pata Norey
#  "Brojodar Goolpo Samagra"

==Personal life==
He had two daughters and a son. He was known for his spartan living.

His early political inspiration came from [[M. N. Roy]]'s ''Radical Humanism'', but in his later years he veered towards the ideals of [[Gandhi]].

He died on 15 December 2000 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pucl.org/reports/WestBengal/2001/ghosh.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2011, a [[Kolkata Metro]] station was named after him &lt;ref&gt;http://www.deccanherald.com/content/135697/content/212251/india-blend-good-bad-dutch.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Trivia==
''Sagina Mahato'', a story written by him in remembrance of a colleague of his in his political activist past, was successfully adopted into movies in Hindi ([[Sagina (film)|Sagina]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072109/&lt;/ref&gt; and Bengali ([[Sagina Mahato]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316525/&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Tapan Sinha]], with the famous thespian [[Dilip Kumar]] playing the part of the protagonist Sagina Mahato in both instances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1380">In [[manufacturing]] or [[mechanical engineering]] a '''groove''' is a long and narrow indentation built into a material, generally for the purpose of allowing another material or part to move within the groove and be guided by it. Examples include:

# A canal [[Machining|cut]] in a [[hardness|hard]] material, usually [[metal]]. This canal can be round, oval or an arc in order to receive another component such as a [[boss (engineering)|boss]], a tongue or a [[gasket]]. It can also be on the circumference of a [[Dowel#Machinery|dowel]], a [[Screw|bolt]], an [[axle]] or on the outside or inside of a [[Tubing (material)|tube]] or [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] etc. This canal may receive a [[circlip]] an [[o-ring]] or a gasket.
# A depression on the entire [[circumference]] of a [[Casting|cast]] or [[Machining|machined]] [[wheel]], a [[pulley]] or [[Sheave (mechanical)|sheave]]. This depression may receive a [[Wire rope|cable]], a [[rope]] or a [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]].
# A longitudinal channel formed in a [[Hot rolling|hot rolled]] [[rail profile]] such as a [[Tramway track#Grooved rail|grooved rail]]. This groove is for the [[flange]] on a train wheel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3846">In [[mathematics]], '''Hall's conjecture''' is an open question, {{As of|2015|lc=on}}, on the differences between [[Square number|perfect squares]] and [[perfect cube]]s. It asserts that a perfect square ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a perfect cube ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that are not equal must lie a substantial distance apart. This question arose from consideration of the [[Mordell equation]] in the theory of [[integer point]]s on [[elliptic curve]]s.

The original version of Hall's conjecture, formulated by [[Marshall Hall, Jr.]] in 1970, says that there is a positive constant ''C'' such that for any integers ''x'' and ''y'' for which ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ne; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; |y^2 - x^3| &gt; C\sqrt{|x|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hall suggested that perhaps ''C'' could be taken as 1/5, which was consistent with all the data known at the time the conjecture was proposed. Danilov showed in 1982 that the exponent 1/2 on the right side (that is, the use of |''x''|&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) can't be replaced by any higher power: for no δ &gt; 0 is there a constant ''C'' such that |''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;| &gt; C|''x''|&lt;sup&gt;1/2 + δ&lt;/sup&gt; whenever ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ne; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

In 1965, Davenport proved an analogue of the above conjecture in the case of polynomials: 
if ''f''(''t'') and ''g''(''t'') are nonzero polynomials over '''C''' such that 
''g''(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ne; ''f''(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in '''C'''[''t''], then

:&lt;math&gt; \deg(g(t)^2 - f(t)^3) \geq \frac{1}{2}\deg f(t) + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''weak'' form of Hall's conjecture, stated by Stark and Trotter around 1980, replaces the square root on the right side of the inequality by any exponent ''less'' than 1/2: for any ''ε'' &gt; 0, there is some constant ''c''(ε) depending on ε such that for any integers ''x'' and ''y'' for which ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ne; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; |y^2 - x^3| &gt; c(\varepsilon) x^{1/2-\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

The original, ''strong'', form of the conjecture with exponent 1/2 has never been disproved, although it is no longer believed to be true and the term ''Hall's conjecture'' now generally means the version with the ε in it.  For example, in 1998, [[Noam Elkies]] found the example

447884928428402042307918&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 5853886516781223&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = -1641843,

for which compatibility with Hall's conjecture would require ''C'' to be less than .0214 &amp;asymp; 1/50, so roughly 10 times smaller than the original choice of 1/5 that Hall suggested.

The weak form of Hall's conjecture would follow from the [[ABC conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Schmidt | first=Wolfgang M. | authorlink=Wolfgang M.

The '''Hmar languages''' belongs to the [[Kukish languages|Kukish]] branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] family of languages. The speakers of the language are also known as [[Hmar]]. According to the official 2011 Census of India, there are 30,000 Hmar speakers in Assam, 48,000 in Manipur,1,000 in Meghalaya, 29,000 in Mizoram although Majority of the Hmars in Mizoram speak Duhlian.

Hmar is a recognised language in the School curriculum of Assam, Manipur and Mizoram, and also recently recognised as one of the [[Modern Indian Languages]] (MIL) at [[Manipur University]]. Board of Secondary Education, Assam has also included Hmar as an MIL in its matriculation syllabus from 2005. Both Manipur University and [[Assam University]], Silchar has also permitted HMAR LANGUAGE to be studied as Modern Indian Language in the Graduation level.
==Geographical distribution==
Hmar is spoken in the following locations

*[[Assam]]: [[Dima Hasao district]] (formerly North Cachar district), [[Karbi Anglong district]], Barak Valley ([[Hailakandi district]], [[Karimganj district]]  and [[Cachar district]])
*[[Manipur]]: [[Pherzawl district]], [[Churachandpur district]], [[Jiribam district]], [[Imphal]] and [[Moreh]]
*[[Mizoram]]: [[Aizawl district]], [[Champhai district]] and [[Kolasib district]]
*[[Tripura]]: In and around [[Darchawi]] and [[Jampui Hills]]
*[[Meghalaya]]: [[Shillong]] and Khaddum village 
*[[Myanmar]]: [[Tamu District|Tamu]]
*[[Bangladesh]]: [[Bawm people|Bawm]]


Since Hmar speakers are scattered over a vast area in [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], [[Meghalaya]], Tripura, Chittagong Hill tracts, NC Hills and Cachar districts of [[Assam]] state and Myanmar, there appears to be slight dialectal distinction. There is no homogeneous settlement of Hmar speakers alone.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In Manipur, Hmar exhibits partial mutual intelligibility with the other Kukish dialects of the area including [[Thadou language|Thadou]], [[Paite language|Paite]], [[Vaiphei language|Vaiphei]], [[Simte language|Simte]], [[Kom language (India)|Kom]] and [[Gangte language|Gangte]] languages.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Chungkham Yashawanta|title=The linguistic situation in Manipur|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|date=1995|volume=18|issue=1|pages=129–134|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/singh1995linguistic.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knockout''' is a term used by [[Impact Wrestling]] to refer to its female talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/knockouts/ |title=Knockouts - The Ladies of TNA Wrestling |accessdate=2007-09-16 |publisher=Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006094333/http://www.tnawrestling.com/knockouts/|archivedate=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is applied universally to [[professional wrestling|wrestlers]], backstage interviewers, and [[manager (professional wrestling)|managers/valets]].

==History==
The term Knockouts is relatively new and was not used when Impact Wrestling (then known as NWA: Total Nonstop Action) debuted in 2002. The name originated from a DVD release in 2006 by the company, ''Knockouts: The Ladies of TNA Wrestling, Vol.1'', which focused on its then-current female stars. The name "Knockouts" as a catchall name for the women stuck after that. Female performers have been a part of TNA since the first national show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/020619a.html |title=NWA:TNA weekly pay-per-view results - June 19, 2002 |accessdate=2007-09-16 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured [[Mickie James|Alexis Laree]], [[Elektra (wrestling)|Elektra]], [[:imdbname:1752075|Erin Bray]], [[Francine Fournier|Francine]], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1750442/bio Miss Joni], Sasha, [[Daffney|Shannon]], [[Cathy Dingman|Taylor Vaughn]] and Teresa Tyler, as well as other female talent, including backstage interviewer [[Goldy Locks]] and valets [[Alicia Webb|Aleesha]] and [http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/seven-briggs.html Fluff Dupp]. [[Cynthia Lynch|Bobcat]] also debuted as a valet in a match that was taped during the first PPV, but aired during the second PPV.

===Miss TNA (2002)===
A Lingerie Battle Royal to crown the first 'Miss TNA' was taped during the very first NWA:TNA weekly PPV on June 19, 2002, and was aired during the second PPV on June 26, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/2002.html |title=NWA:TNA 2002 Results |accessdate=2007-11-20 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cathy Dingman|Taylor Vaughn]] won the first Miss TNA crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestleview.com/messages1/2024.shtml |title=TNA PPV results 6/26 |accessdate=2007-10-15 |publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt; She defended the title against Francine, who soon afterward abandoned her pursuit of the title and engaged in a brief feud with [[Jasmin St. Claire]]. Vaughn lost the title when she was defeated by male character [[Allan Funk|Bruce]] a few weeks later. Although male, he claimed that he should be entitled to wrestle for the Miss TNA crown because he was gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1028817969.shtml|title=NWA:TNA weekly pay-per-view results - July 08, 2002 |accessdate=2007-09-16 |publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce held the crown for three months and during his time as Miss TNA he attacked many female wrestlers and fans, enraging the male stars of TNA including Jorge Estrada. The two then had a singles match with the stipulation that if Estrada won, [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1750442/bio Priscilla] would become the new Miss TNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1036645751.shtml |title=NWA:TNA weekly pay-per-view results - 11th September, 2002 |accessdate=2007-10-16 |publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Estrada won the match, the crown didn't change hands because he won by disqualification. In the next weeks, Bruce's tag team partner, [[Lenny Lane|Lenny]], tried to get Bruce injured (since the runner-up would then take over the crown should the champion be injured).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1037252142.shtml |title=NWA:TNA weekly pay-per-view results - 13th November, 2002 |accessdate=2007-10-16 |publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the breakup of ''The Rainbow Express'', and Bruce's homosexuality was questioned by backstage interviewer [[Goldy Locks]], who claimed she had seen him in the shower with [http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/april-pennington.html April Pennington]. The storyline soon came to a close due to poor crowd reception, with Pennington and Goldylocks walking off together holding hands, as Lenny and Bruce fought over Pennington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/tna-pay-per-view/november-13-2002/episode/255485/recap.html |title=TNA Pay-Per-View: November 13, 2002 Recap |accessdate=2007-11-20 |publisher=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline ended with Bruce declaring himself straight and handing his crown over to Pennington. The Miss TNA crown wasn't mentioned on-screen afterward. Throughout 2002, TNA also featured Belladonna in a valet role and former ''[[WWE Tough Enough]]'' contestant [http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/p/paulina.html Paulina] as a bodyguard.

===Post–Miss TNA (2003–2006)===
Women's wrestling continued to be a feature of the weekly PPVs before an official women's division was established in 2007. In 2003, cage dancers (many of whom were independent female wrestlers who were then unknown at the time, including [[Jaime Lynne|Lollipop]]) were used near the top of the entrance ramp, but this concept was abandoned shortly after its conception. One of TNA's early controversial moments ensued on the March 12, 2003 pay-per-view when Lollipop had her top ripped off during a catfight with [[Sports Entertainment Extreme|S.E.X.]] member [http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/holly-wood.html Holly Wood] and exposed her breasts throughout the fight. TNA also featured [[ring girl]] [http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/athena.html Athena] in many feuds and altercations.

From 2003-2004, TNA regularly used several female wrestlers on their PPVs and television programs, including [[Trinity (wrestler)|Trinity]], [[Kim Nielsen (wrestler)|Desire]], [[Mickie James|Alexis Laree]], [[Traci Brooks]], [[Cheerleader Melissa]], [[Veronica Stevens|Nurse Veronica]] (who also competed as Simply Luscious), and [[Elizabeth Miklosi|Cheerleader Valentina]] (who also competed as JV Love); however, they were often primarily depicted as [[manager (professional wrestling)|valets]] who occasionally wrestled. Of all the women utilized at this time, Trinity was the most active in the ring, as she feuded with Desire, Alexis Laree, and Traci Brooks, as well as competed in the [[X Division]]. During this time, TNA also briefly featured an all-female faction named "[[Bitchslap (professional wrestling)|Bitchslap]]" that consisted of Nurse Veronica, Traci Brooks, Cheerleader Valentina, and Trinity (who only appeared twice with the group). They were engaged in a feud with TNA dancers Lollipop and April Pennington.

Independent female wrestlers were frequently featured on ''[[TNA Xplosion]]'' and occasionally on TNA pay-per-views, including [[Angelina Love|Angel Williams]] (who would later return as Angelina Love), [[April Hunter]], Brandi Wine, [[Daizee Haze]], [[Daffney|Lucy]] (who previously competed as Shannon and would later return as Daffney), [[Malia Hosaka]], [[Mercedes Martinez]], [[MsChif]], and [[ODB (wrestler)|ODB]] (who also wrestled as Poison).

TNA briefly recognized the [[NWA World Women's Championship]] in 2003. On March 12, 2003, [[Leilani Kai]] defeated [[Madison (wrestler)|Madison]] to win the NWA World Women's Championship in a dark match on a TNA pay-per-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ladysports.com/nashville.htm |title=Explosion in Nashville |accessdate=2007-11-20 |publisher=LadySports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225183858/http://ladysports.com/nashville.htm |archivedate=2008-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2003, Kai defended the title against Desire at a house show, but she was later stripped of the title by NWA President Bill Behrens due to missing several subsequent NWA shows. According to Kai, she skipped the shows because she felt the NWA governing board was not treating the Women's Championship with the respect it deserved, such as not televising title matches on the TNA pay-per-views and ''[[TNA Xplosion]]''.

Fewer women's matches were featured toward the end of 2004 and throughout 2005; however, TNA did feature pay-per-view matches pitting Trinity against former WWE Diva [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]] and Traci Brooks. TNA also featured [[Stephanie Bellars|Minsa]] in an on-air non-wrestling role.

Following the debut of the ''[[TNA Impact!|TNA iMPACT!]]'' television program in 2005, TNA featured former WWE Divas such as [[Gail Kim]], [[Jackie Gayda]], and [[Christy Hemme]], as well as independent female wrestler [[Jaime Dauncey|Sirelda]] in prominent on-air roles and feuds. Although most of the prior female talent had left TNA by this time, Traci Brooks remained in an on-air role and TNA added a new ring girl, [[SoCal Val]] (replacing Athena) and backstage interviewer, [[Leticia Cline]] (replacing Goldy Locks). Gail Kim competed in a few matches that were televised and/or taped throughout 2006 against Sirelda and Traci Brooks, while independent wrestler [[Amber O'Neal]] competed at TNA house shows in matches against Kim and Jacqueline. In the fall of 2006, [[Sherri Martel]] appeared on ''TNA iMPACT!'' in her final televised appearance before her death the following year.

===Impact Wrestling Knockouts Division (2007–present)===
[[File:Gail_Kim_Jan_2013.jpg|thumb|185px|left|upright|Inaugural [[TNA Knockouts Championship|TNA Knockouts Champion]], [[Gail Kim]]]]
The formation of an official women's division began at ''[[Final Resolution#2007|Final Resolution]]'' in 2007 as TNA spent the early part of the year building up the feud between Gail Kim and Jacqueline, who made her on-air return at the pay-per-view also during the summer a feud between Christy Hemme and [[Nicole Raczynski|Roxxi Laveaux]] took place. The first [[TNA Women's Knockout Championship|TNA Women's Knockout Champion]] was crowned on October 14, 2007, at ''[[Bound for Glory (2007)|Bound for Glory]]'' in a 10–Knockout gauntlet match which Gail Kim won with lastly eliminating Roxxi Laveaux.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiswjFPvUNY&amp;feature=em-uploademail Girl Talk with Christy Hemme, Velvet Sky and ODB  at the Arena that started Knockouts division - [[Arena at Gwinnett Center]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, TNA signed several additional female wrestlers and personalities, including [[Angelina Love|Angel Williams]], [[Kia Stevens|Amazing Kong]], [[ODB (wrestler)|ODB]], [[Shelly Martinez]], and [[Velvet Sky|Talia Madison]] who were then renamed after the PPV, as well as valet [[Karen Jarrett]] and new backstage interviewer [[Crystal Louthan]]. In a stark departure to TNA's past programming where their female talent were often promoted as [[Attractiveness|eye candy]] with little to no emphasis on athleticism or wrestling ability, in the same fashion as their WWE Diva counterparts during that time period, TNA's women's division emphasized on serious wrestling competition between their female talent, as well as their credibility on par with their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv3wgrPT0zU TNA Knockout TV Advert]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the inception of an official championship, matches and segments involving the Knockouts have contributed to drawing some of the better ratings of Impact shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_25786.shtml PWTorch - WWE News and Pro Wrestling Coverage Since 1987&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, TNA continued to expand the women's division by featuring various prospective independent talents, veterans, and reality show winners such as [[Sharmell Sullivan-Huffman|Sharmell]], [[Taylor Wilde]], [[Daffney]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Tara]], [[Ayako Hamada|Hamada]], [[Sarah Stock|Sarita]], [[Mickie James]], and  ''[[Survivor: The Amazon]]'' winner Jenna Morasca while Lauren Brooke became the new backstage interviewer at Lockdown and [[Daizee Haze]] who appeared in the first few years of the company returned in a one time match on May 1st losing to [[Cheerleader Melissa]] who was also pulling dual role under the Raisha Saeed gimmick at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_43965.shtml|title=TNA News: Former WWE women's champion reportedly signs with TNA; when she's expected to debut|date=2010-09-22|last=Caldwell|first=James|accessdate=2010-10-01|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarah Stock &amp; Shantelle Malawski.jpg|thumb|185px|right|upright|[[Sarah Stock|Sarita]] and [[Taylor Wilde]], the first [[TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship|TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions]]]]
The division would see the start of many various changes when in August, Gail Kim's contract with TNA expired and instead of renewing it, she decided to return to rival [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] for a second run. At the start of the following year in 2009, [[Madison Rayne]] debuted in TNA on January 8th and became the third member of [[The Beautiful People (professional wrestling)|The Beautiful People]] alongside existing members Angelina Love and Velvet Sky which made the tag team a stable and the [[TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship]] was introduced at ''[[No Surrender (2009)|No Surrender]]'' and Sarita and Taylor Wilde became the first [[TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship|TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions]] when they won the final match of an eight–team tournament. 

The women’s division would see a start of vast departures in fall of 2009 beginning when Angelina Love left the company on September 3rd due to visa work issue, Love was replaced by Lacey Von Erich in the Beautiful People stable and then immediately returned to the company the following year on January 14. Later on, Awesome Kong, Alissa Flash, Roxxi, Traci Brooks, Roxxi, ODB, and Tara (although would return two months later on July 11th at [[Victory Road (2010)|Victory Road]]) all departed from the company mutually or due to controversial circumstances. Madison Rayne made history by becoming the first person to hold both the Women's Knockout Championship and the Knockouts Tag Team Championship simultaneously at [[Lockdown (2010)|Lockdown]]. On August 8th, Francine appeared in a pre-taped interview at the ECW reunion themed Hardcore Justice and Lacey Von Erich, Hamada, and Taylor Wilde departed from the company at the end of the year. Despite departures during this time period, the division continued to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_35021.shtml|title=TNA News: Top star in the TNA Knockouts division released|date=2009-09-04|accessdate=2009-09-04|last=Caldwell|first=James|publisher=PWTorch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/10694/|title=Lineup for TNA Impact tapings tomorrow night/TNA signs member of famous family to debut this week|accessdate=2009-09-21|publisher=Wrestling Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_40727.shtml|title=TNA Lockdown Results 4/18: Keller's live ongoing PPV report with commentary - Team Hogan vs. Team Flair|first=Wade|last=Keller|date=2010-04-18|accessdate=2010-04-18|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/tnappvs/article_42979.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Hardcore Justice PPV results 8/8: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of ECW-themed PPV headlined by RVD vs. Sabu|first=James|last=Caldwell|date=2010-08-08|accessdate=2010-08-08|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_45229.shtml|title=TNA News: TNA Knockout announcers her departure from the company effective today|date=2010-11-11|accessdate=2010-11-11|last=Caldwell|first=James|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1291690239 |title=TNA vacates titles at Impact TV tapings tonight |first=Adam |last=Martin |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |work=WrestleView |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216165927/http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1291690239 |archivedate=2010-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1291929792|title=Report: Another Knockout done with TNA for now|first=Adam|last=Martin|date=2010-12-09|accessdate=2010-12-09|work=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knockouts Division authority figure==
In August 2008, it was announced on ''TNAwrestling.com'' that Traci Brooks was officially in charge of the Knockouts Division as the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Total Nonstop Action Wrestling authority figures|Knockouts Division Commissioner]], also known as the "Knockout Law".  On screen credit was given to [[Jim Cornette]] (at the time, the highest position of on-screen authority the fans saw), who was fed up with the Knockouts, and needed someone who "spoke their language" to control them. In January 2009, Brooks stopped appearing in TNA and Cornette resumed control over the Knockout division. Brooks returned on the March 12, 2009, edition of ''Impact!'' as a referee. She was released on March 4, 2010. Since the year of 2009, there has been five female talents who were appointed the role of authority figure in the women's division.

[[Image:TAInterlingua Figura1.png|thumb|300px|Figure 1. Demonstration of the languages which are used in the process of translating using a ''bridge'' language.]]
'''Interlingual machine translation''' is one of the classic approaches to [[machine translation]]. In this approach, the source language, i.e. the text to be translated is transformed into an interlingua, i.e., an abstract language-independent representation. The target language is then generated from the interlingua.  Within the rule-based machine translation paradigm, the interlingual approach is an alternative to the [[dictionary-based machine translation|direct approach]] and the [[transfer-based machine translation|transfer approach]].

In the direct approach, words are translated directly without passing through an additional representation. In the transfer approach the source language is transformed into an abstract, less language-specific representation. Linguistic rules which are specific to the language pair then transform the source language representation into an abstract target language representation and from this the target sentence is generated.

The interlingual approach to machine translation has advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that it requires fewer components in order to relate each source language to each target language, it takes fewer components to add a new language, it supports paraphrases of the input in the original language, it allows both the analysers and generators to be written by monolingual system developers, and it handles languages that are very different from each other (e.g. English and Arabic&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Monem, A., Shaalan, K., Rafea, A., Baraka, H., [http://www.springerlink.com/content/76t73q5805743640/ Generating Arabic Text in Multilingual Speech-to-Speech Machine Translation Framework], Machine Translation, Springer, Netherlands, 20(4): 205-258, December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;). The obvious disadvantage is that the definition of an interlingua is difficult and maybe even impossible for a wider domain. The ideal context for interlingual machine translation is thus multilingual machine translation in a very specific domain.

==History==
The first ideas about interlingual machine translation appeared in the 17th century with [[Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who came up with theories of how to create dictionaries using universal numerical codes. Others, such as [[Cave Beck]], [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[Johann Joachim Becher]] worked on developing an unambiguous universal language based on the principles of [[logic]] and iconographs. In 1668, [[John Wilkins]] described his interlingua in his "Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language". In the 18th and 19th centuries many proposals for "universal" international languages were developed, the most well known being [[Esperanto]].

That said, applying the idea of a universal language to machine translation did not appear in any of the first significant approaches. Instead, work started on pairs of languages. However, during the 1950s and 60s, researchers in [[Cambridge]] headed by [[Margaret Masterman]], in [[Leningrad]] headed by [[Nikolai Andreev]] and in [[Milan]] by [[Silvio Ceccato]] started work in this area. The idea was discussed extensively by the Israeli philosopher [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel]] in 1969.

During the 1970s, noteworthy research was done in [[Grenoble]] by researchers attempting to translate physics and mathematical texts from [[Russian language|Russian]] to [[French language|French]], and in [[Texas]] a similar project (METAL) was ongoing for Russian to [[English language|English]]. Early interlingual MT systems were also built at [[Stanford]] in the 1970s by [[Roger Schank]] and [[Yorick Wilks]]; the former became the basis of a commercial system for the transfer of funds, and the latter's code is preserved at [[The Computer Museum, Boston|The Computer Museum]] at [[Boston]] as the first interlingual machine translation system.

In the 1980s, renewed relevance was given to interlingua-based, and knowledge-based approaches to machine translation in general, with much research going on in the field. The uniting factor in this research was that high-quality translation required abandoning the idea of requiring total comprehension of the text. Instead, the translation should be based on linguistic knowledge and the specific domain in which the system would be used. The most important research of this era was done in [[distributed language translation]] (DLT) in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], which worked with a modified version of [[Esperanto]],  and the Fujitsu system in Japan.

==Outline==
[[Image:TAInterlingua Figura2.png|thumb|300px|Figure 2. a) Translation graph required for direct or [[transfer-based machine translation]] (12 dictionaries are required); b) Translation graph required when using a bridge language (only 8 translation modules are required).]]

In this method of translation, the interlingua can be thought of as a way of describing the analysis of a text written in a '''source language''' such that it is possible to convert its morphological, syntactic, semantic (and even pragmatic) characteristics, that is "meaning" into a '''target language'''. This interlingua is able to describe all of the characteristics of all of the languages which are to be translated, instead of simply translating from one language to another.

[[Image:TAInterlingua Figura3.png|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Translation graph using two interlinguas.]]

Sometimes two interlinguas are used in translation. It is possible that one of the two covers more of the characteristics of the source language, and the other possess more of the characteristics of the target language. The translation then proceeds by converting sentences from the first language into sentences closer to the target language through two stages. The system may also be set up such that the second interlingua uses a more specific vocabulary that is closer, or more aligned with the target language, and this could improve the translation quality.

The above-mentioned system is based on the idea of using linguistic proximity to improve the translation quality from a text in one original language to many other structurally similar languages from only one original analysis. This principle is also used in [[Pivot language|pivot machine translation]], where a [[natural language]] is used as a "bridge" between two more distant languages. For example, in the case of translating to [[English language|English]] from [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] using [[Russian language|Russian]] as an intermediate language.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Babych, Anthony Hartley, and Serge Sharoff (2007) "[http://www.mt-archive.info/MTS-2007-Babych-1.pdf Translating from under-resourced languages: comparing direct transfer against pivot translation]". ''Proceedings of MT Summit XI, 10–14 September 2007, Copenhagen, Denmark''. pp.29--35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation process==
In interlingual machine translation systems, there are two monolingual components: the ''analysis'' of the source language and the interlingual, and the ''generation'' of the interlingua and the target language. It is however necessary to distinguish between interlingual systems using only syntactic methods (for example the systems developed in the 1970s at the universities of Grenoble and Texas) and those based on [[artificial intelligence]] (from 1987 in Japan and the research at the universities of Southern California and Carnegie Mellon). The first type of system corresponds to that outlined in Figure 1. while the other types would be approximated by the diagram in Figure 4.

The following resources are necessary to an interlingual machine translation system:
[[Image:TAInterlingua Figura4.png|thumb|300px|right|Figure 4. Machine translation in a knowledge-based system.]]
* Dictionaries (or lexicons) for analysis and generation (specific to the [[definition domain|domain]] and the languages involved).
* A conceptual lexicon (specific to the domain), which is the [[knowledge base]] about events and entities known in the domain.
* A set of projection rules (specific to the domain and the languages).
* Grammars for the analysis and generation of the languages involved.

One of the problems of knowledge-based machine translation systems is that it becomes impossible to create databases for domains larger than very specific areas. Another is that processing these databases is very computationally expensive.

==Efficacy==
One of the main advantages of this strategy is that it provides an economical way to make multilingual translation systems. With an interlingua it becomes unnecessary to make a translation pair between each pair of languages in the system. So instead of creating &lt;math&gt;n(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; language pairs, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of languages in the system, it is only necessary to make &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; pairs between the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; languages and the interlingua.

The main disadvantage of this strategy is the difficulty of creating an adequate interlingua. It should be both abstract and independent of the source and target languages. The more languages added to the translation system, and the more different they are, the more potent the interlingua must be to express all possible translation directions. Another problem is that it is difficult to extract meaning from texts in the original languages to create the intermediate representation.

[[File:Fondeville.png|thumb|1667 edition of ''la Pastorala deu Paisan'']]
'''Jean-Henri Fondeville''' ([[Béarnese dialect|Béarnese Occitan]]: ''Joan Enric de Fondevila''; {{circa}} 1638 – 22 October 1705) was a [[Béarnese dialect|Béarnese Occitan]] writer.

Fondeville is author of the ''la Pastorala deu Paisan'' and also of the vehemently anti-Calvinist pastoral poem ''Eglògas''.

== Biography ==
Fondeville was born after the integration of [[Béarn]] into the [[Kingdom of France]] in 1621. 

Before this event, Béarn had been part of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. When Queen [[Jeanne d'Albret]] adopted [[Calvinism]], the kingdom became Protestant, keeping Béarnese Occitan as its administrative language, and when Jeanne d'Albret's son, Henry III of Navarre, became [[Henry IV of France]] and Navarre, he maintained the kingdom's independence; however, his son, [[Louis XIII of France]], decided to merge the kingdom with France, and to re-establish Catholicism.

During this process, Fondeville's father, a Protestant priest, was offered a lifetime annuity in order to choose Catholicism. Fondeville's godfather was Jean-Henri de Salette, bishop of [[Lescar]], (in which city he Fondeville is buried under the Latin inscription ''patronus et poeta facundus'').

In addition to being a writer, Fondeville also had an illustrious career as a lawyer at the [[Parliament of Navarre and Béarn]], which had its seat in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]].

'''Karl Emil Franzos''' (October 25, 1848{{snd}}January 28, 1904) was a popular Austrian novelist of the late 19th century. His works, both reportage and fiction, concentrate on the multi-ethnic corner of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Podolia]] and [[Bukovina]], now largely in [[Ukraine]], where the [[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires met. This area became so closely associated with his name that one critic called it "Franzos country". A number of his books were translated into English, and [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] is said to have been among his admirers.

==Life==
Karl Emil Franzos was born near the town of [[Chortkiv|Czortków]] (Chortkiv) in the eastern, Podolian region of the Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Kingdom of Galicia]]. His family came from [[Sephardi]] [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spanish Jews]] who fled the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] to Holland and later settled in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]]. In the 1770s his great-grandfather established a factory for one of his sons in East Galicia, part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] since the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772. When the Austrian administration required Jews to adopt surnames, "Franzos" became his grandfather's name, from his French background, even though he regarded himself as German.

Franzos's father Heinrich (1808&amp;ndash;1858) was a highly respected doctor in Czortków. His German [[Identity (social science)|identity]] at the time had mainly linguistic and cultural meaning, there being no state called "Germany", just a loose [[German Confederation]]. He was steeped in the humanistic ideals of the German [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as expressed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] and, especially, [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]. This brought a certain isolation: for local [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]] he was German, for Germans a [[Jew]] and for Jews a renegade, a ''deutsch''. In the ''[[Vormärz]]'' era of the first half of the 19th century, liberalism and nationalism went hand in hand, and Franzos's father was one of the first Jews to join a ''[[Burschenschaft]]'' student fraternity whose ideal was a German [[nation state]] with a liberal constitution. It is ironic that by the time Franzos, who shared his father's ideals, went to university, the German student fraternities had "dejudaised" themselves.

His father died when he was ten and his mother moved to the [[Duchy of Bukovina|Bukovina]] capital [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]] (Chernivtsi). The city's [[multiculturalism]], representative of the Habsburg Empire, strongly influenced his youth and character. The first languages he spoke were [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], learnt from his nurse; his first school was attached to the Czortków [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] abbey, where the teaching was in [[Latin]] and Polish; and he attended private lessons in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In Czernowitz he attended the German ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]]'', passing the ''[[Matura]]'' exam with honours in 1867. By now the family was in reduced circumstances and he supported himself by giving lessons, later, as a student, from his writing.

He would have liked to study [[Classics|classical]] [[philology]] with the aim of becoming a teacher, but no scholarship was forthcoming. Jews were not eligible for teaching posts, and even though he was non-religious, he refused to convert to advance his career. An additional reason for the refusal of a scholarship was that he did not attempt to conceal his liberal outlook, having, for example, tried to organise a celebration for the liberal poet, [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]]. He studied law at the universities of [[University of Vienna|Vienna]] and [[University of Graz|Graz]], that being a shorter course. When he graduated, he found himself in a similar situation: he did not want to become an advocate, and a position as judge was closed to him as a Jew.

Having had a number of pieces published while he was a student, he went into journalism and worked for newspapers and magazines for the rest of his life, at first in [[Budapest]] and in [[Vienna]] as a [[travel writing|travel writer]] of the ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]'' newspaper. In 1877 he married Ottilie Benedikt, a relative of editor [[Moriz Benedikt]]. From 1886 he lived in [[Berlin]], capital of the [[German Empire]]. Franzos had acclaimed the 1871 [[German unification]] under [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] leadership and advocated a [[German question|Greater Germany]] including the Austrian territories. However, the move to the German capital was caused as much by the greater opportunities for publishing there as by his "[[German nationalism|Germanic]]" tendencies. Indeed, the increasing virulence of [[antisemitism]] in Germany meant that later on he had difficulty placing pieces which were felt to be too pro-Jewish—which was often another way of saying "not sufficiently anti-Jewish".
[[File:K E Franzos-Mutter Erde fec.jpg|thumb|''[[Ehrengrab]]'' in Weißensee Cemetery]]
More and more under Jew-hatred attacks, Franzos suffering from heart trouble died at the age of 55 in Berlin, where he is buried in the [[Weißensee Cemetery]].

==Work==
Franzos showed the attitudes of the 19th-century [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] Jew in their best light. His conviction that [[Germanisation]] was the way forward was based on the idealistic strain in German culture and will have looked very different in his day to a post-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] perspective. He believed, following the example of Friedrich Schiller, that literature should have an ethical purpose, but he managed to express that purpose through a range of vivid characters who still have the power to move the modern reader.

Galicia and Bukovina were the most backward, the poorest provinces of the Austrian Empire, so that Franzos saw his promotion of Germanisation as part of an attempt to improve conditions there politically and economically as well as culturally and socially. Jews made up some 12% of the population, the largest proportion of any province; two-thirds of the Empire's Jews lived in Galicia. Besides being mostly poor, the [[shtetl]] Jews were strict, conservative [[Hasidim]], shutting themselves off as far as possible from their Christian neighbours, who responded in kind. Poor orthodox Jews from the east were a not uncommon sight in Vienna and were probably regarded with even greater hostility by many of the westernised Jews of the city than by the Christian population.

The rigidity with which the eastern Jewish communities shut themselves off from outside influences is the theme of Franzos's most ambitious work, ''[[Der Pojaz]]'', completed in 1893, but not published until after his death in 1905. Why this novel, which Franzos regarded as his major work, remained unpublished during his lifetime, is a mystery. It is possible that he thought his critical portrayal of the ghetto might be exploited by antisemitic elements which were becoming increasingly active in Germany in the 1890s. The relations between the Christian and Jewish communities come into sharpest focus in sexual matters—as a young man Franzos fell in love with a Christian girl but renounced her because of the barrier between the two groups. This problem forms the subject of a number of his works, including two of his best novels, ''[[Judith Trachtenberg (novel)|Judith Trachtenberg]]'' (1890) and ''Leib Weihnachtskuchen and his Child'' (1896).

The main focus of his writing is the relationships between the different nationalities of the region—Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, Germans and Jews—and his sympathies clearly lie with the oppressed groups, in particular the Ukrainian peasants and shtetl Jews. He insisted that he was free from racial prejudice and that his attacks on particular nationalities were because they oppressed others:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“I spoke out against the oppression of the Ukrainians and Poles by the Russians, but where the Poles do the same, as is the case in Galicia, then I speak out against their oppression of the Ukrainians, Jews and Germans.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also “spoke out” against the rigid attitudes and practices of orthodox religion, and in this his attacks were directed above all at his fellow Jews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“I stand up for the Jews because they are enslaved, but I attack the slavery the orthodox Jews impose on the liberal members of their faith.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His works include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|title=Franzos, Karl Emil|volume=11 |page=38 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabrit11chisrich#page/38/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Woyzeck==
[[File:Georg Büchner - Franzos-Werkausgabe !07.jpg|thumb|[[Title page]] of Franzos's Büchner edition]]
Franzos is also well known for being the first to publish an edition of [[Georg Büchner]]'s work, which was vital for the rediscovery of the ''Vormärz'' author. Franzos completed his edition in 1879, including plays like ''[[Danton's Death]]'' and ''Leonce and Lena''. The manuscript of Büchner's drama ''[[Woyzeck]]'' was difficult to decipher, and had to be treated with chemicals in order to bring the ink up to the surface of the paper, and many of the pages were kept and later destroyed by Büchner's widow, who survived him by four decades. But Franzos's edition was for many years the authoritative version, until the late 1910s when a revival of Büchner's works began in Europe and the many errors in Franzos' edition came to light. These errors include the misspelling of the title, as "Wozzeck" instead of "Woyzeck", an alternate ending that involves Wozzeck drowning in lieu of Büchner's incomplete manuscript, and a fragmented plot without connections between the scenes. Although the play is often performed in newer versions, Franzos' edition has been immortalized in the form of [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Wozzeck]]'', which uses the Franzos edition as its base.

According to [[oral tradition]] of the ''[[griots|griot]]'' poets of Mali and Guinea,  the Kouroukan Fouga established the federation of [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] clans under one government, outlined how it would operate and established the laws by which the people would live. The name ''Kurukan Fuga'' is a [[toponym]], translating to "clearing on granite / lateritic rock",&lt;ref&gt;''clairière au sol granitique'': Diango Cissé, ''Structures des Malinké de Kita'' (contribution à une anthropologie sociale et politique du Mali), Collection "Hier", Éditions populaires, 1970, p. 19;
''clairière latérique sur roche'': Projet Boucle du Niger, Actes du colloque: histoire et tradition orale : 1ère année, l'Empire du Mali : premier colloque international de Bamako, 27 janvier - 1er février 1975
Author, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the plain near the town of Ka-ba (present day [[Kangaba]]) where the narrative has  [[Sundiata Keita]]  present the charter.

The "Manden Charter, proclaimed in Kurukan Fuga",  was inscribed in 2009 (4.COM) on the Representative List of the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] kept by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00290 Manden Charter, proclaimed in Kurukan Fuga], Fourth Session of the Intergovernmental Committee (4.COM) – Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, 28 September to 2 October 2009, Decision 4.COM 13.59: "The Manden Charter, recognized by its community members as an essential part of their heritage, is customary law on the basis of which they regulate their social life while respecting nature and the changing environment; it is passed on orally from generation to generation and provides a sense of belonging, identity and continuity to its community"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
The earliest extant versions of the ''[[Epic of Sundiata]]'' were collected in the 1890s, and the first close transcription dates to 1967. As an instance of [[oral history]], the epic does not exist in a fixed form.

An attempt to "reconstruct" the Kouroukan Fouga from oral tradition was made in 1998, in a regional workshop held in [[Kankan]], [[Guinea]], with the aim of publishing and preserving the oral history related to the area's ''djeli'' or ''griots''.  Assisted by modern communicators and Guinea linguists under the supervision of Siriman Kouyaté, the workshop transcribed and translated the laws and edicts preserved in different regions from the core of the Mali Empire.

Kouyaté judged his reconstruction as being "a relatively faithful reproduction of a charter created in the fourteenth century".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[Djibril Tamsir Niane]] in an interview went as far as claiming the reconstruction was a "declaration on the rights of man" drafted "in 1236".&lt;ref&gt;"Africa drafted its declaration on the rights of man in 1236", ''Les Afriques'' magazine 24 July 2008, interview conducted by Chérif Elvalide Sèye.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English version of the charter was re-published by Mangoné Niang, Director of CELTHO/UA (Niamey), with a short commentary prepared by   Siriman Kouyaté, as an annex to the "Working Documents" for the "Inter-generational Forum on Endogenous Governance in West Africa"  organised by  Sahel and West Africa Club / [[OECD]], Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), 26 to 28 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/swac/events/38516561.pdf SAH/D(2006)563 Annexes November 2006] pp. 71-82.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Niang's introduction, 
:"The traditionists are those who [recited]&lt;ref&gt;Niang uses "declined"; the [http://caremali.com/docs/charte.pdf French original] has ''ont declamé''.&lt;/ref&gt; the text; then it has been transcribed  and translated, with the help of Guinea linguists and under the supervision of Mr. Siriman  Kouyaté – Magistrate and traditionist (his family is guardian of the Sosobala, in Niagasole,  Guinea). Afterwards S. Kouyaté structured The Charter, without falsifying the essential point, talking here about the modern juridical texts with a view to make it readable for contemporaries "

Niang lists ten "traditional communicators" on whose authority the text was reconstructed.
Siriman Kouyaté, the author of the reconstruction, is listed as one of the ten authorities.
Niang adds that "the original text in [[Malinke language|Malinke]] is available on the digital data bank ARTO".
The ten sources are listed as follows:
Siaka Kouyaté, [[Niagassola|Niagassola, Siguiri]] (Guinea),
Lamine Kouyaté, [[Mandiana Prefecture|Loïla, Mandiana]] (Guinea), 
Damissa Sékou [[Siguiri Prefecture|Diabaté, Siguiri]] (Guinea), 
Koulako Touré, [[Faranah]] (Guinea), 
Mamady Kante dit Konkoba, [[Dinguiraye]] (Guinea), 
Old Koita, [[Kérouané]] (Guinea), 
Sekouba Condé, [[Dabola]] (Guinea), 
E. Oumar Camara, [[Kankan]] (Guinea), 
Abdoulaye Kanouté, [[Tambakounda]] (Senegal), 
Siriman Kouyaté, Niagassola, Siguiri (Guinea).

==Contents==
The reconstructed Kouroukan Fouga, as published by Kouyaté, contains 44 edicts. They are divided into four sections concerned with Social Organization (edicts 1-30), [[Property rights|Property Rights]] (edicts 31-36), Environmental Protection (edicts 37-39) and Personal Responsibilities (edicts 40-44).

The Kouroukan Fouga divided the new empire into ruling clans (lineages) that were represented at a great assembly called the ''[[Gbara]]''. There were 16 clans known as the ''Djon-Tan-Nor-Woro'' (quiver carriers) responsible for leading and defending the empire. There were also 4 clans known as the ''Mori-Kanda-Lolou'' (guardians of the faith) who guided the ruling clans in matters of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. There were 4 ''[[nyamakala]]'' clans (people of [[caste]]) who had the monopoly on certain trades, which included but was not limited to [[smelting]], [[woodworking]], and [[Tanning (leather)|tanners]]. Lastly, there were 4 clans of ''djeli'' (masters of speech) who recorded the history of the empire through song. Combined these would make up the 29 seat ''Gbara'' at the plain of Kouroukan Fougan (named after the event where Sundiata "divided the world").  The 30th seat was likely occupied by the mansa's ''djeli'' called the ''belen-tigui'' (master of ceremonies), or may have been reserved for a female monitor since the constitution states women are to be represented at all levels of government (edict 16).

Article 7 institutes the ''[[sanankuya]]'' (a type of [[cousinage]] or [[joking relationship]] that is a longstanding West African social tradition) as a civic duty.

Kouyaté in his commentary draws attention to paragraph 20, dealing with the humane treatment of [[slave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The statement 20 of the Charter pointed out the condition of the slaves by humanizing it. " (p. 79).&lt;/ref&gt;
:20. "Do not ill treat the slaves. You should allow them to rest one day per week and to end their  working day at a reasonable time. You are the master of the slaves but not of the bag they carry."

===Social Organization===
*Article 1: The Great Mande Society is divided into sixteen clans of quiver carriers, five clans of marabouts, four groups of "nyamakalas" and one group of slaves. Each one has a specific activity and role.
*Article 2: The "nyamakalas" must devote themselves to tell the truth to the chiefs, to be their counsellors and to defend by the speech the established rulers and the order upon the whole territory.
*Article 3: The five clans of marabouts are our teachers and our educators in Islam. Everyone has to hold them in respect and consideration.
*Article 4: The society is divided into age groups. Those born during a period of three years in succession belong to the same age-group. The members of the intermediary class between young and old people, should be invited to take part in the making of important decisions concerning the society.
*Article 5: Everybody has a right to life and to the preservation of physical integrity. Accordingly, any attempt to deprive one's fellow being of life is punished with death.
*Article 6: To win the battle of prosperity, the general system of supervision has been established to fight against laziness and idleness.
*Article 7: The [[sanankunya]] (joking relationship) and the tanamannyonya (blood pact) have been established among the Mandinka. Consequently, any contention that occurs among these groups should not degenerate the respect for one another being the rule. Between brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, between grandparents and grandchildren, tolerance should be the principle.

*Article 13: Never offend the Nyaras (the talented).
*Article 14: Never offend women, our mothers.
*Article 15: Never beat a married woman before her husband has tried to correct the problem.
*Article 16: Women, apart from their everyday occupations, should be associated with all our managements.
*Article 17: Lies that have lived for 40 years should be considered like truths.
*Article 18: We should respect the law of primogeniture.
*Article 19: Any man has two parents-in-law: We have to hold them in respect and consideration.
*Article 20: Do not ill treat the slaves. We are the master of the slave but not the bag he carries.
*Article 21: Do not follow up with your constant attentions the wives of the chief, of the neighbor, of the marabout, of the priest, of the friend and of the partner.
*Article 22: Vanity is the sign of weakness and humility the sign of greatness.
*Article 23: Never betray one another. Respect your word of honor.
*Article 24: In Manden, do not maltreat the foreigners.
*Article 25: The ambassador does not risk anything in Manden.
*Article 26: The bull confided to your care should not lead the cattle-pen.
*Article 27: A girl can be given in marriage as soon as she is pubescent without age determination.
*Article 28: A young man can marry at age 20.
*Article 29: The dowry is fixed at 3 cows: one for the girl, two for the father and mother.
*Article 30: In Mande, divorce is tolerated for one of the following reasons: the impotence of the husband, the madness of one of the spouses, the husband's incapability of assuming the obligations due to the marriage. The divorce should occur out of the village. (The French version published in 1998 does not include this article, but splits article 34 into two, numbering the intervening articles differently).
*Article 31: We should help those who are in need.

===Of Goods===

*Article 32: There are five ways to acquire property: buying, donation, exchange, work and inheriting. Any other form without convincing testimony is doubtful.
*Article 33: Any object found without a known owner becomes common property only after four years.
*Article 34: The fourth heifer born is the property of the guardian of the heifer. One egg out of four is the property of the guardian of the laying hen.
*Article 35: One bovine should be exchanged for four sheep or four goats.
*Article 36: To satisfy one's hunger is not robbery if you don't take away anything in your bag or your pocket.

===Preservation of Nature===

*Article 38:  Before setting fire to the bush, don't look down at the ground, raise your head in the direction of the top of the trees to see whether they bear fruits or flowers.
*Article 39:  Domestic animals should be tied during cultivation and freed after the harvest. The dog, the cat, the duck and the poultry are not bound by the measure.

===Final Disposals===

*Article 42:  In big assemblies, be satisfied with your lawful representatives.
*Article 43:  Balla Fassèkè Kouyaté is nominated chief of ceremonies and main mediator in Manden. He is allowed to joke with all groups, in priority with the royal family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60392">[[Luganda]], the main language of southern Uganda, is a [[tonal language]] of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] family, traditionally described as having three tones: high (''{{IPA|á}}''), low (''{{IPA|à}}'') and falling (''{{IPA|â}}''). Rising tones are not found in Luganda, even on long vowels, since a sequence such as [''àá''] automatically becomes [''áá''].&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xiii"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tones perform various functions in Luganda: they help to distinguish one word from another, they distinguish one verb tense from another, and they are also used in sentence intonation, for example, to distinguish a statement from a question.

In general in Luganda some words are accented, with the accent shown by a fall in pitch from high to low: ''ens'''î''''' 'country', ''ekib'''ú'''ga'' 'city'. Others words, such as ''ekitabo'' 'book', are unaccented. In most circumstances accentless words receive an automatic default tone, called a phrasal tone, on all syllables except the first: ''ekítábó''; but in some circumstances this default tone does not appear, for example, when the word is the subject of a sentence or qualified by a number. Default tones are also added (or not added) at the end of accented words immediately following the fall in pitch, e.g. ''eddw'''â'''liro'' or ''eddw'''â'''líró'' 'hospital', ''mas'''é'''rengeta'' or ''mas'''é'''rengétá'' 'south'.

The description is made more complicated, however, by certain exceptions. For example, in some verbal forms the default tones begin not as expected immediately after the accent but after an interval of two or three low-toned syllables, e.g. ''b'''á'''lilabá'' 'they will see'. These complexities prevent Luganda from being described as a simple pitch-accent language.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of the Luganda tonal system has attracted the attention of numerous scholars, who have sought ways of describing Luganda tones most economically according to different linguistic models.&lt;ref&gt;See Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993) for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Although there are many complexities of detail, the general lines of tone in Luganda are simple. Most sentences have a gradual descent from the first high tone to the last, as in the following sentence:&lt;ref name=LBC105&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''kye kib'''&lt;u&gt;ú&lt;/u&gt;'''ga ekik'''&lt;u&gt;ú&lt;/u&gt;'''lu mu Ug'''&lt;u&gt;áń&lt;/u&gt;'''da'' 'it is the chief city in Uganda'

The three high tones '''''ú''''', '''''ú''''', and '''''áń''''' stand out prominently from the other syllables, and each one is a little lower than the last. The toneless syllables between are lower in pitch than the high tones. This descent is known as [[downdrift]] or 'automatic downstep' and is common in many African languages whenever tones come in a sequence HLH.

Another type of tonal pattern very common in Luganda is the high tone plateau.&lt;ref&gt;For the term see Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In this pattern, two high tones are at the same level, and the voice remains continuously high from one the other:
*''k&lt;u&gt;'''í'''rí mú Úg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'it is in Uganda'&lt;ref name=LBC105 /&gt;
*''mu mamb&lt;u&gt;úká gá Úg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'in the north of Uganda'&lt;ref name=LBC26&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third type of tonal pattern, not quite so common, is to have a series of low tones followed by a jump to a high one:
*''Mbarara kib'''ú'''ga'' 'Mbarara is a city'&lt;ref name=LBC138&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ebitabo kk'''ú'''mi'' 'ten books'&lt;ref name=LBC103&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

These three tonal patterns will be heard to occur again and again in Luganda sentences, and much of the description below concerns when to use one and when another.

==Types==

There are various types of high tone in Luganda, of which lexical, grammatical and phrasal tones are the most important. (To these can be added boundary tones and other tones indicating intonation.)

===Lexical tones===
Lexical high tones are those that go with particular words, such as those on the words below:
*''ekib'''ú'''ga'' 'city'
*''ens'''î''''' 'country'

When a word with final tone such as ''ens'''î''''' 'country' is spoken in isolation or at the end of a sentence, the tone is always heard as a falling tone; but in other contexts, it will generally be heard as an ordinary high tone.

Falling lexical tones can also be heard in non-final position:
*''eddw'''â'''l&lt;u&gt;író&lt;/u&gt;'' 'hospital'

Some words in Luganda have two lexical high tones. When this happens the two tones link into a plateau; that is, the syllables between are also raised.&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Pretraining Program'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; (In this article, a plateau will be shown by underlining.)
*''K&lt;u&gt;'''á'''mpál'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' '(the city of) [[Kampala]]'
*''edd&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''úk'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'shop'

A lexical tone, if it does not form a plateau with a following lexical tone, is always followed by a low tone. This low tone can either be in the following syllable, as in ''ekib'''ú'''ga'' 'city' or the second half (mora) of a syllable containing a falling tone, as in ''eddw'''â'''l&lt;u&gt;író&lt;/u&gt;'' 'hospital' or ''ens'''î''''' 'country'.

===Grammatical tones===
A grammatical tone is one that arises when a verb is used in a particular tense. For example, a verb in the subjunctive mood always has a high or falling tone on the last syllable:&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.182"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''muyingir'''ê''''' 'you should come in, please come in'

In this article, to distinguish them from phrasal high tones, lexical and grammatical tones will be marked in bold.

===Phrasal tones===
Phrasal tones are high tones which are automatically added to words in certain contexts; in other contexts the same word may be pronounced without phrasal tones. For example, when a word without lexical tones is the subject of a sentence, or followed by a number or quantity word, it remains toneless:
*''Mbarara kib'''ú'''ga'' 'Mbarara is a city'&lt;ref name=LBC138 /&gt;
*''ebitabo kk'''ú'''mi'' 'ten books'&lt;ref name=LBC103 /&gt;

But in most other contexts, or when spoken in isolation, the word has a high tone on all the syllables except the first [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] of the word (the phrasal tones are shown here by being underlined):
*''eb&lt;u&gt;ítábó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'books'
*''mu mamb&lt;u&gt;úká&lt;/u&gt;'' 'in the north'&lt;ref name=LBC26 /&gt;

A geminate consonant such as [''tt''] counts as one mora, and so if a word begins with a geminate consonant, the phrasal tone can begin immediately after it:
*''T&lt;u&gt;óró&lt;/u&gt;'' [''tt&lt;u&gt;óóró&lt;/u&gt;''] '(the kingdom of) [[Toro Kingdom|Toro]]'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.29"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''ggw&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt;'' [''ggw&lt;u&gt;éé&lt;/u&gt;''] 'you (sg.)'
*''ss&lt;u&gt;óméró&lt;/u&gt;'' 'it is a school'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Pretraining Program'', p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a rising tone [''àá''] becomes a level high tone [''áá''] in Luganda, the following word also has a high tone throughout:
*''y&lt;u&gt;éé&lt;/u&gt;'' 'yes'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrasal tones can also be added to the end of words that have a lexical high tone. However, between the lexical tone and the phrasal tones there must always be at least one low-toned syllable or mora:
*''t'''ú'''gend&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'we are going'
*''amas'''é'''reng&lt;u&gt;étá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'south'

If the lexical tone is a falling one, the second half the syllable with the tone counts as a low-toned mora, and the phrasal tones begin immediately on the following syllable:
*''eddw'''â'''l&lt;u&gt;író&lt;/u&gt;'' 'hospital'
*''abag'''â'''nd&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'Baganda people'

Whenever a word has a lexical as well as a phrasal tone like this, the lexical tone and the phrasal tone do not form a plateau but instead there is a sequence HLH. As with every sequence HLH, the second H (which is the phrasal tone) is a little lower than the first.&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Pretraining Program'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lexical or grammatical tone cannot form a plateau with a following phrasal tone; there is always at least one low-toned mora in between. However, a phrasal tone can very easily form a plateau with a following lexical tone or phrasal tone:
*''mu kyal&lt;u&gt;ó Másí'''ń'''&lt;/u&gt;di'' 'in the village of Masindi'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;
*''t'''ú'''gend&lt;u&gt;á mú lúgúúdó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'we are going into the street'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xxiii"/&gt;
*''ay&lt;u&gt;ágálá ókúlímá ámátóóké&lt;/u&gt;'' 'he wants to cultivate bananas'&lt;ref name=LBCxxii /&gt;

More examples of this are given below, as well as exceptions where no plateau is formed.

Phrasal tones tend to be less prominent than lexical tones and often in a sentence if a word with lexical tone is substituted for one with a phrasal tone, the pitch will be higher.

===Words containing HLL or HLLL===
Normally between a lexical or grammatical high tone in Luganda and a phrasal tone, there is just one low-toned syllable or mora. However there are some words in which a high lexical or grammatical tone is followed not by one, but by two or even three low-toned syllables:
*''b'''á'''lilab&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they will see'&lt;ref name="Hyman &amp; Katamba 1993, p.45"&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ab'''á'''lilaba'' 'they who will see'

The existence of such words greatly complicates the description of Luganda tones and has important implications for theoretical accounts of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; These are further discussed below.

===Intonational tones===
As well as the types of tone mentioned above, there are also intonational tones such as those which distinguish a question from a statement. For example, if a toneless word asks a yes-no question, it has high tones except the last syllable, which is low. Compare these two:
*''ss&lt;u&gt;óméró&lt;/u&gt;'' 'it is a school'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Pretraining Program'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ss&lt;u&gt;ómé&lt;/u&gt;ro?'' 'is it a school?'&lt;ref name=LBC242&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

A question like the following has a rise-and-fall on the last vowel:
*''gwe gul'''í''' gw&lt;u&gt;é '''ń'''néngérá wál'''î'''&lt;/u&gt;?'' 'is it the one I see there?'&lt;ref name=LBC242 /&gt;

Another type of intonational tone is an upglide sometimes heard just before a pause mid-sentence. (It is referred to by [[Earl Stevick|Stevick]] (1968) as 'comma intonation'.)&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xxiii"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tones and emphasis===
One way in which tones are not used in Luganda, however, is for focus or emphasis. As Crabtree says, 'The tone in Luganda is level, therefore it is impossible to emphasize as in English.' Instead he lists some other ways in which words can be emphasised in Luganda, such as placing the important word first, omitting an initial vowel where it would normally be added,&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (2010), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; using a relative construction (e.g. 'books are what I want'), using a negative construction (e.g. 'what I want, is it not books?') and others.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree (1902), p. 144-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downdrift==

===Lexical tone downdrift===
The usual pattern when two words have lexical or grammatical high tone (unless the two tones are in the same word, as in ''K'''á'''mpál'''â''''') is for the second tone to be a little lower than the first, with the syllables in between a little lower than the high tones, making a dip:
*''ebib'''ú'''ga mu ns'''î''''' 'cities in the country'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''bonn'''á''' bawal'''â''''' 'all of them are girls'&lt;ref name=LBC103 /&gt;
*''at'''é'''ma omut'''î''''' 'he cuts the tree'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xi"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mu kib'''ú'''ga K&lt;u&gt;ámpál'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'in the city of Kampala'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;
*''ebib'''ú'''ga bir'''í''''' 'those cities'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;

There is also usually a downstep if the first word ends in a lexical tone and the second word begins with one: 
*''balug'''ú''' m'''úń'''gi'' 'many yams'&lt;ref name=LBCxxii&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The falling tone in ''balug'''û''''' 'yams' changes to a high tone in this context, but there is still a downstep just as if the L part of the HL was still audible.

There is always downdrift when a phrasal tone follows a lexical one:
*''k'''í'''ri mu Buny&lt;u&gt;óró&lt;/u&gt;'' 'it is in Bunyoro'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.29"/&gt;

===Phrasal tone downdrift===
A phrasal tone is usually followed by a plateau, which continues either to the next high tone or, if there is no high tone, to the end of the phrase. Nonetheless, there are some kinds of phrases where the phrasal tones continue only as far as the end of the word, after which there is a low tone. The following high tone will be lower than the phrasal tone (i.e. there will be downdrift).

An example of these types of phrases is when a noun is followed by the pronominal words ''ban&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'these', ''ab&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the aforesaid', ''bonn'''â''''' 'all', or ''yekk'''â''''' 'alone' (or their equivalents in other noun classes), e.g.&lt;ref name=LBCxx&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ab&lt;u&gt;ántú&lt;/u&gt; ban&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'these people'
*''ab&lt;u&gt;ántú&lt;/u&gt; ab&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the aforementioned people'
*''ab&lt;u&gt;ántú&lt;/u&gt; bonn'''â''''' 'all people'
*''om&lt;u&gt;úntú&lt;/u&gt; yekk'''â''''' 'the person alone'
*''am&lt;u&gt;átóóké&lt;/u&gt; an&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt; bonn'''â''''' 'all those bananas'

However, there is plateauing before demonstrative adjectives of the ''-l'''i''''' type: 
*''ab&lt;u&gt;ántú bál'''î'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'those people'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;

Two other contexts where there is downdrift after a phrasal tone word are before ''nga'' 'when, if, as' and before ''nti'' meaning 'that':&lt;ref name=LBCxx /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Hyman &amp; Katamba (2010), p. 94, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''b'''áá'''numy&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt; nga b'''á'''lya'' 'they talked as they were eating'
*''ag&lt;u&gt;ámbá&lt;/u&gt; nti'' 'he says that...'

(The word ''nga'' in this context is toneless, but before a noun it has a tone: ''ng'''á''' sukk'''á'''ali'' 'like sugar'.&lt;ref name="LBCxvii"/&gt; It also has a tone when it means 'how...!': ''ng'''á''' wano bulú'''ń'''gi!'' 'how beautiful it is here!'&lt;ref name=LBC242 /&gt;)

There is a similar downstep after a personal pronoun in phrases like the following:
*''nz&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt; Muk&lt;u&gt;ásá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I am Mukasa'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ggw&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt; an'''í'''?'' [''ggwáaní''] 'who are you?'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plateauing==

===Lexical tone plateauing===
As noted above, the usual pattern with words containing lexical tones is for each word in a series to be a little lower in pitch than the one before. However, there are some circumstances when two lexical tones will be on the same level and make a plateau.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phrases with 'of'====
Typical of such phrases are those containing the word -'''''á''''' 'of', which forms a plateau not only with the preceding high tone but also with the following one, for example:
*''mu mas&lt;u&gt;'''é'''réngétá g'''á''' Úg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'in the south of Uganda'&lt;ref name=LBC26 /&gt;

The plateau is shown here by underlining.

If the second word is toneless, however, a plateau is made only with the preceding word:
*''ekkeng&lt;u&gt;'''é'''lé y'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;mul&lt;u&gt;énzí&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the boy's bell' (shortened from ''y'''á''' om&lt;u&gt;úlénzí&lt;/u&gt;'')&lt;ref name=LBCxx /&gt;

====Verb + Location====
Another kind of phrase which often has plateauing is 'verb + location', for example: 
*''k&lt;u&gt;'''í'''rí mú Búg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'it is in Buganda'&lt;ref name=LBC105 /&gt; 
*''b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''géńdá W'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;degey&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they are going to Wandegeya''&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xix"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nab&lt;u&gt;'''í'''gúl'''á''' mú K'''á'''mpál'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I bought them in Kampala'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.167"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ogit&lt;u&gt;'''é'''éká kú mmé'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;za'' 'you put (Present tense) it on the table'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.168"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''wano w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''yítíbwá Kíb'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;li'' 'this place is called Kibuli'&lt;ref name=LBC242 /&gt;

Sometimes there can be a slight dip in this kind of phrase, e.g. 
*''k'''í'''ri mu mas&lt;u&gt;'''é'''réngétá g'''á''' Úg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'it is in the south of Uganda'&lt;ref name=LBC26 /&gt;

But even here the three underlying high tones are on the same pitch and do not drift downwards.

However, there is usually no plateauing in this type of phrase when the verb is relative:
*''ek'''í'''ri mu Bug'''áń'''da'' 'which is in Buganda' (with downdrift)&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.219"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also no plateauing when the verb is negative:
*''teb'''á'''v'''á''' mu Ug'''áń'''da'' 'they don't come from Uganda'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.167"/&gt;

There can also be no plateauing between an earlier lexical tone and a following phrasal tone:
*''k'''í'''ri mu Buny&lt;u&gt;óró&lt;/u&gt;'' 'it is in Bunyoro'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.29"/&gt;

====Verb + focussed object====
A plateau is also possible between verb and object, when the object is emphasised or focussed. Contrast:&lt;ref&gt;Hyman (2017), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''b'''á'''gul&lt;u&gt;á ébík'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;po'' 'they buy cups'
*''b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''gúlá bík'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;po'' 'they buy &lt;small&gt;CUPS&lt;/small&gt;' (not something else)

===='And'====
Another situation where plateauing will follow a lexical tone is after the word ''né'' 'and', which has a tone when used before a noun:
*''Ug'''áń'''da n&lt;u&gt;'''é''' K'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;nya'' (pronounced ''yug'''áń'''da n&lt;u&gt;'''é''' kk'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;nya'') 'Uganda and Kenya'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''eb&lt;u&gt;íjánjááló n' '''é'''bíny'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;obw&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the beans and the peanuts'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt; 
*''n' &lt;u&gt;'''á'''báwál'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'and girls'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

But there is no plateau between the tone of ''n'''é''''' and a following phrasal tone:
*''ebiny'''ó'''obwa n' '''é'''bij&lt;u&gt;ánjááló&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the peanuts and the beans'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;

According to Hyman (2017), the word ''na/ne'' itself is underlyingly toneless, and the tone comes from the augment of the noun (i.e. the initial ''e-'' or ''a-'' or ''o-''), which in an earlier stage of the language was high-toned.&lt;ref name="Hyman 2017, p. 170"&gt;Hyman (2017), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ne'' is in fact toneless in phrases like the following, when it is followed by a 'narrative tense' verb (a 'narrative tense' verb is a form of relative clause verb without its initial vowel, used after ''ne''):
*''ne b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''lím'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'and they cultivate'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''n'''á''''', meaning 'with', is also contained in the word ''b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''lín'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they have' (literally 'they are with'). This is followed by a plateau when positive, but not when negative:
*''b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''lín'''á''' bálúg'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt; mú'''ń'''gi'' 'they have many yams'&lt;ref name=LBCxxii /&gt;
*''teb&lt;u&gt;'''á'''lín'''á'''&lt;/u&gt; balug'''ú''' mú'''ń'''gi'' 'they don't have many yams'&lt;ref name=LBCxxii /&gt;

====Verb + time====
A plateau is heard before words like ''jj'''ó''''' 'yesterday', ''lul'''í''''' 'the day before yesterday', and ''dd'''í''''' 'when?' in these sentences:&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nay&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''zá jj'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt; essa'''á'''ti en&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I washed this shirt yesterday'
*''nas&lt;u&gt;s'''á'''líbwá lúl'''í'''&lt;/u&gt; env'''í'''ir&lt;u&gt;í&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I cut my hair the day before yesterday'
*''wat&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''úká dd'''í'''&lt;/u&gt; wan&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;?'' 'when did you arrive here?'

But there is no plateau if the time adverb is toneless. Instead the adverb plateaus with the following word:
*''nag'''ú'''la dd&lt;u&gt;(á) éssá'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ti en&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I bought this shirt a long time ago'
 
===Phrasal tone plateauing===
In contrast to lexical tones, words with a phrasal tone very easily make a plateau with the following word, as the following examples show (the plateaus are indicated by underlining):
*''mu mamb&lt;u&gt;úká g'''á''' Úg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'in the north of Uganda'&lt;ref name="LBC26"/&gt;
*''av&lt;u&gt;á mú Búg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'he comes from Buganda'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ab&lt;u&gt;ántú mú kíb'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;ga'' 'people in the city'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;
*''mu kyal&lt;u&gt;ó Másí'''ń'''&lt;/u&gt;di'' 'in the village of Masindi'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;
*''eb&lt;u&gt;íjáńjááló byé bá'''á'''úzz'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the beans that they bought'&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;
*''ay&lt;u&gt;ágálá ókúlímá ámátóóké&lt;/u&gt;'' 'he wants to cultivate bananas'&lt;ref name=LBCxxii /&gt;

The phrasal high tone at the end of words like ''t'''ú'''gendá'' 'we are going' will also make a plateau in the same way, for example:
*''t'''ú'''gend&lt;u&gt;á mú lúgúúdó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'we are going into the street'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xxiii"/&gt;
*''b'''á'''fumb&lt;u&gt;é émm'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;re'' 'they are cooking ''emmére'' (staple food)'&lt;ref name=LBCxvii&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''amalw'''á'''al&lt;u&gt;író ámák'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;lu'' 'large hospitals'&lt;ref name=LBCxvii /&gt;

Note that in these examples, it is not the lexical tone of words like ''t'''ú'''gendá'' which forms a plateau with the following high tone, but the phrasal tone at the end of the word. So there is first downdrift in ''t'''ú'''gendá'' and then a plateau.

In a sentence like the following, in which an HLH word like ''t'''ú'''gend&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' is used in a 'verb + location' sentence where the location has a lexical tone, according to Stevick, the plateau in such sentences will start with the lexical tone. However, the speaker on the recordings of the Luganda Basic Course in sentences of this kind makes a plateau starting only with the second tone, so that there is a downstep first then a plateau:
*''t&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''géndá mú Úg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'we are going to Uganda' (according to Stevick)&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Pretraining Program'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''t'''ú'''gend&lt;u&gt;á mú Úg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'we are going to Uganda' (as read on the recordings)&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 136; cf. p. 87, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low tones then high==

The third common pattern in Luganda intonation is Low + High. This is only found if the first word is toneless. The following are some circumstances when no phrasal tones are added to a toneless word, and it has low tones throughout.

First, when it is the subject or topic of a sentence (unless it is a personal pronoun like ''ggw&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt;'' 'you sg.'):
*''Mbarara kib'''ú'''ga'' 'Mbarara is a city'.&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

A toneless word also remains low-toned before a numeral or quantity word (except after a negative verb), e.g. 
*''ebitabo kk'''ú'''mi'' 'ten books'&lt;ref name=LBC103 /&gt;
*''abantu b'''áń'''gi'' 'many people'&lt;ref name=LBC103 /&gt; 
*''amatooke amek'''á'''?'' 'how many bananas?'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''buli'' 'each' also remains low-toned when followed by another word: 
*''buli lun'''á'''ku'' 'each day'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xix"/&gt;
*''buli kit&lt;u&gt;ábó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'every book'&lt;ref name="Hyman 2017, p. 170"/&gt;

An adverb or a subordinate clause can also form the topic of a sentence and be low-toned, e.g.&lt;ref name=LBCxviii /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Hyman &amp; Katamba (2010), p. 84, for further examples.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''oluvannyuma, b'''á'''lya emm'''é'''re'' 'afterwards, they eat ''emmére'' (staple food)' 
*''nga ayagala ebijanjaalo, abig'''ú'''la'' 'when he wants beans, he buys them'

==Falling tones==
A high or a low tone may be found on any vowel, but a falling tone is found only on:
*(a) a final vowel, e.g. ''egg'''î''''' 'egg'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;
*(b) a long vowel, e.g. ''okul'''ó'''ot&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to dream'&lt;ref name=DP127&gt;Dutcher &amp; Paster (2008), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; 
*(c) a vowel followed by a prenasalised consonant, e.g. ''Abag'''â'''nd&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'Baganda people'
*(d) a vowel following a consonant + semivowel, e.g. ''okulw'''â'''l&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to fall sick'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xiii"/&gt;
*(e) a short vowel followed by a geminate consonant, e.g. ''okub'''ô'''bb&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to throb'.&lt;ref name=DP127 /&gt;

When a falling tone occurs on a syllable closed by a geminate, such as in ''okuc'''ô'''pp&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to become poor', the fall is very slight and hard to hear, though it can be measured instrumentally. The main way of telling that a word like this has a falling tone is that the tone on the following vowel is high.

===Morae===
One way of explaining these facts is to analyse Luganda words as consisting of [[mora (linguistics)|morae]] or moras, that is, speech segments each lasting a certain time. According to this analysis, a short vowel has one mora and a long vowel has two morae. A 'long' consonant such as ''gg'', ''mb'', or ''ly'' also has one mora. Thus the third syllable ''gâ'' of ''Abag'''â'''nd&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' can be said to be long by position, since it has two morae, one belonging to itself and the other 'borrowed from' or 'shared with' the prenasalised consonant which follows. A long syllable can have a falling tone, with the first mora high and the second mora low.

Certain accommodations have to be made to make the model fit. For example, an initial syllable starting with a vowel always counts as one mora, even in words like ''ens'''î''''' 'country' where the vowel is long and followed by a prenasalised consonant.&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xiv"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

No syllable can have more than two morae.&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xi"/&gt; For example, the second syllable of ''omw&lt;u&gt;éngé&lt;/u&gt;'' 'beer' has only two, despite starting with ''mw'' and being followed by a prenasalised consonant.

===Final vowels===
Final vowels are usually pronounced short, but in some words (including all words with monosyllabic stems) the vowel becomes long before a suffix, for example ''ens'''î''': k'''í'''?'' 'which country?'.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Final vowels which can become long are considered to have two morae. Certain other final vowels, such as the final ''-é'' of the subjunctive mood, are considered to have one mora.&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

A final vowel therefore, if it is not toneless, can either have a high tone on the second mora (e.g. ''em'''ú''':'' 'one') or on the first mora (e.g. ''mwend'''â''''' 'nine'),&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; or on its single mora (''muyingir'''é''''' 'please come in').&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.182"/&gt; All three of these, when at the end of a sentence, are pronounced with a falling tone. But in other contexts they have different pronunciations. For example, before the suffix ''k'''í''''' 'what?' a tone on the first mora of a bimoraic final vowel will fall (''ens'''î''' k'''í'''?'' 'what country?')&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; but a tone on the last mora will remain high (''tukol'''é''' k'''í'''?'' 'what should we do?').&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.182"/&gt;

If a word ends in a falling tone, the tone becomes an ordinary high tone in some circumstances. One of these is when it is the subject of a sentence:
*''K&lt;u&gt;'''á'''mpál'''á'''&lt;/u&gt; kib'''ú'''ga'' 'Kampala is a city'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''bonn'''á''' bawal'''â'''?'' 'are all of them girls?'&lt;ref name=LBC103/&gt;

Another is before a quantity word: 
*''balug'''ú''' m'''úń'''gi'' 'many yams'&lt;ref name=LBCxxii /&gt;

Although there are now two high tones in adjacent syllables, nonetheless a downstep still occurs just as if the L part of the falling tone were still audible, so that in the above phrase ''mú'' is slightly lower in pitch than ''gú''.

==Nouns==
Luganda nouns tend to fall tonally into certain regular patterns, of which the most common are (a) toneless (b) tone on the second mora from the end (c) tone on the third mora from the end. These three patterns together account for about 83% of nouns in Luganda. Some examples of the commonest patterns are as follows.

===Toneless nouns===
Judging from the numbers in the word list at the end of the ''Luganda Basic Course'', about one third of all nouns (32%) in Luganda are underlyingly toneless. However, when pronounced in isolation, they will have phrasal tones on all but the first mora (counting ''en-'' at the beginning of a word as one mora), as follows:
*''ek&lt;u&gt;ítábó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'book'
*''ess&lt;u&gt;óméró&lt;/u&gt;'' 'school'
*''om&lt;u&gt;úntú&lt;/u&gt;'' 'person'
*''eng&lt;u&gt;áttó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'shoe(s)'
*''om&lt;u&gt;úlímú&lt;/u&gt;'' 'work, job'
*''om&lt;u&gt;úlénzí&lt;/u&gt;'' 'boy'
*''ak&lt;u&gt;ámwá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'mouth'
*''ol&lt;u&gt;úpápúlá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'paper'
*''ent&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt;'' 'cow(s)'
*''env&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'relish'
*''am&lt;u&gt;átá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'milk'

===Penultimate tone===
Also very common, about 26% of the words, are nouns with a penultimate tone, that is on the second mora from the end of the word. If the penultimate syllable is long, as in ''eny'''áń'''ja'' 'lake', both moras are high-toned. What all these nouns have in common is that the last vowel cannot take a phrasal tone. Examples are:
*''ent'''é'''be'' 'chair'
*''ekib'''ú'''ga'' 'city'
*''emb'''ú'''zi'' 'goat'
*''ekik'''ó'''po'' 'cup'
*''omuk'''ó'''no'' 'hand, arm'
*''eny'''áń'''ja'' 'lake'
*''ens'''íḿ'''bi'' 'money'
*''ká'''á'''wa'' 'coffee'

===Antepenultimate tone===
Nouns which have a high tone on the third mora from the end of the word (e.g. ''akag'''á'''ali'' 'bicycle') are also very common, and the various types listed below account for at least 25% of the vocabulary.

When used before a pause, or before a pronominal word like ''ban&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'these' or ''bonn'''â''''' 'all' (see above) these words acquire a phrasal tone on the final syllable:
*''akag'''á'''al&lt;u&gt;í&lt;/u&gt; ak&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'that bicycle'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p.169.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in other contexts no phrasal tone is added, and there is no plateau with the following word:
*''omw'''á'''aka og&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''yís'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'last year'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''sá'''á'''nywedde m'''á'''zzi ku kanky'''â''''' 'I didn't drink water for breakfast'.&lt;ref name=LBC141&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p.141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrast the following example, where the phrasal tone of ''mat&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'milk' makes a plateau with the following word.&lt;ref name=LBC141 /&gt;
*''sá'''á'''nywedde mat&lt;u&gt;á kú kánky&lt;/u&gt;'''â''''' 'I didn't drink milk for breakfast'

Some nouns of this type are:
*''am'''á'''as&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;'' 'eyes'
*''omw'''â'''n&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'child'
*''omw'''â'''k&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'year'
*''omw'''ê'''z&lt;u&gt;í&lt;/u&gt;'' 'month'
*''eny'''á'''any&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'tomatoes'
*''am'''â'''zzi'' 'water'
*''c'''á'''ayi'' 'tea'
*''ssuk'''á'''ari'' 'sugar'
*''akag'''á'''ali'' 'bicycle'
*''emm'''é'''eri'' 'ship'
*''ekit'''û'''ndu'' 'part'
*''er'''î'''nnya'' 'name'
*''Abag'''â'''nda'' 'Baganda people'

To these can be added a few nouns with the tone on the antepenultimate syllable, which are all marked by Stevick as HLL:
*''ebugw'''áń'''juba'' 'west'
*''ebuv'''áń'''juba'' 'east'
*''ek'''í'''bala'' 'fruit'
*''ekk'''ó'''lero'' 'workshop'
*''omus'''ó'''mesa'' 'teacher'

Hyman draws attention to the word ''ek'''í'''bala'' ('fruit'), which is unusual in having an accent on the class-prefix. He suggests that this is either because it may be a borrowing from another Ugandan language, [[Soga language|Soga]], or because it is a derivative of the verb ''-b'''á'''la'' ('bear fruit').&lt;ref name="Hyman 2017, p. 170"/&gt;

A few nouns (mostly foreign) have a double tone followed by LL:
*''&lt;u&gt;'''Á'''m'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;reka'' 'America'
*''Omus&lt;u&gt;'''í'''r'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;amu'' 'Muslim'
*''Oluf&lt;u&gt;'''á'''l'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;nsa'' 'French (language)'
*''enn&lt;u&gt;'''í'''m'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;awa'' 'lemon' (Portuguese ''limão'')
*''amat&lt;u&gt;'''á'''f'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ali'' 'brick'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling tone on the final===
About 9% of the nouns have a falling tone on the final. The shorter of these nouns (up to three moras) have a single tone:
*''ens'''î''''' 'country'
*''egg'''î''''' 'egg'
*''embw'''â''''' 'dog'
*''balug'''û''''' 'yam(s)'
*''omut'''î''''' 'tree'

The longer nouns have a second tone earlier in the word, which links into a plateau:
*''ekib&lt;u&gt;'''í'''ín'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'class'
*''ekk&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''mér'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'prison'
*''olub&lt;u&gt;'''á'''áw'''ô'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'board'
*''edd&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''úk'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'shop'
*''eky&lt;u&gt;'''é'''ńky'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'breakfast'
*''obuk&lt;u&gt;'''í'''ík'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'direction'

A few less common nouns have a tone on the penultimate and the final:&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HK62&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mug&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''b'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'driver'
*''mus&lt;u&gt;'''í'''k'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'heir'

===Other patterns===
A very few words (about 2%) have the tone far enough from the end of the word to allow for two phrasal tones following the HL of the lexical tone:
*''amas'''é'''reng&lt;u&gt;étá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the south'
*''edd'''wâ'''l&lt;u&gt;író&lt;/u&gt;'' 'hospital'

Other patterns are possible, for example ''Olw'''ó'''kusat&lt;u&gt;ú&lt;/u&gt;'' 'Wednesday' (ending in HLLL), but these patterns account for only a small percentage of the nouns.

===Variable tone nouns===
There are certain words in Luganda which have a high tone on the third mora, and in which the tone shifts to the following mora when the word is used without its initial vowel:&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Abag'''â'''nda'' 'Baganda people' - ''Bag'''áń'''da'' 'they are Baganda'
*''omus'''ó'''mesa'' 'teacher' - ''musom'''é'''sa'' 'he is a teacher'
*''omuw'''á'''la'' 'girl' - ''muwal'''â''''' 'she is a girl'
*''omut'''á'''miivu'' 'drunkard' - ''mutam'''í'''ivu'' 'he is a drunkard'

Hyman and Katamba note that the same alternations take place in certain verb tenses:
*''agul'''â''''' 'he who buys' - ''abig'''ú'''la'' 'he who buys them'
*''alag'''í'''ra'' 'he who commands' - ''atul'''á'''gira'' 'he who commands us'
*''ayá'''á'''mba'' 'he who helps' - ''atuy'''á'''amba'' 'he who helps us'

A similar alternation occurs in numbers 1-5, and the words for 'yours' and 'his', with two differences, one that the tone comes on the second mora, and secondly that with a monosyllabic stem, the tone on the final is not deleted:
*''bis'''á'''tu'' - ''eb'''í'''satu'' 'three (e.g. books)'
*''bin'''â''''' - ''eb'''í'''n'''â''''' 'four'
*''biby'''ô''''' - ''eb'''í'''by'''ô''''' 'your ones (e.g. books)'

A few foreign nouns (mostly from Swahili) are also irregular, in that they have an extra tone in the plural or in the diminutive where the prefix has an extra syllable:&lt;ref name=HK62 /&gt;
*''bbak'''ú'''li'' 'bowl' - plural ''mab'''á'''k'''ú'''li'' 'bowls'
*''ggun'''í'''ya'' 'sack' - plural ''mag'''ú'''n'''í'''ya'' 'sacks'
*''kkal'''á'''amu'' 'pen, pencil' - plural ''mak'''á'''l'''á'''amu''
*''mbal'''á'''asi'' 'horse' - diminutive ''kab'''á'''l'''á'''asi'' 'little horse'

==Possessive pronouns ('my', 'our' etc.)==
Possessive pronouns in Luganda are of two types, those with two syllables, namely ''-ange'' 'my', ''-affe'' 'our', ''-ammwe'' 'your (pl.)', ''-aabwe'' (pronounced [''-aawwe'']) 'their' and those with one syllable, namely ''-'''ô''''' 'your' and ''-'''ê''''' 'his, her, its'.

The two-syllable possessives used on their own have an HLL tone: ''ekky'''â'''nge'' 'my one (e.g. place, book, etc.)',&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.172"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; ''ew'''â'''ffe'' 'our home'.&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when they are used with a noun, they become enclitic, and if the noun is HLL this tone goes on the final vowel of the noun, making a plateau with the earlier tone:
*''er&lt;u&gt;'''í'''ńny'''á'''&lt;/u&gt; lyange'' (before a pause, ''lyang&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt;'') 'my name'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.2-3"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''okus&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''més'''á'''&lt;/u&gt; wange'' 'my teacher'&lt;ref name=LBC163&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''akag&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ál'''í'''&lt;/u&gt; kange'' 'my bicycle'&lt;ref name=LBC163 /&gt;
*''c&lt;u&gt;'''á'''áy'''í'''&lt;/u&gt; waffe'' 'our tea'&lt;ref name=LBC157&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''am&lt;u&gt;'''á'''zz'''í'''&lt;/u&gt; waffe'' 'our water'&lt;ref name=LBC157 /&gt;

If added to a noun with a falling tone on the final, the final tone changes from falling to high:
*''ens'''í''': yange'' 'my country'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
*''edd&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''úk'''á'''&lt;/u&gt; yange'' 'my shop'
*''amag'''í''' gaffe'' 'our eggs'&lt;ref name=LBC157 /&gt;

Otherwise if the noun has penultimate tone, the tone on the final vowel is deleted by Meeussen's rule (HH &gt; HL):
*''ekib'''ú'''ga kyange'' 'my city'

When used with a toneless noun, however, the high tone migrates from the final syllable to the third mora of the noun. The tones which follow it are all L:
*''ekit'''á'''bo kyange'' 'my book'&lt;ref name=LBC184&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''kitab'''ó''' kyange'' '(it is) my book'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xiv"/&gt;
*''ebit'''á'''bo byaabwe'' 'their books'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.172"/&gt;
*''kitó'''ó'''ke kyange'' 'my plantain tree'&lt;ref name=HK49&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''kisum'''ú'''luzo kyange'' 'my key'&lt;ref name=HK49 /&gt;
*''olup'''á'''pula lwange'' 'my paper'&lt;ref name=LBC184 /&gt;

(The above rules are those given in the literature. In practice, however, the reader on the ''Luganda Basic Course'' recordings sometimes adds a tone on the final syllable of the noun even where it is theoretically not permitted: ''ens&lt;u&gt;'''í'''mb'''í'''&lt;/u&gt; zaabwe'' 'their money',&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; ''emig&lt;u&gt;'''á'''át'''í'''&lt;/u&gt; gyaffe'' 'our loaves', where the text writes ''emigáàtì'',&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 185, cf. p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; ''ekit'''á'''b'''ó''' kyange'' 'my book'.&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.168"/&gt;)

When the noun is a foreign borrowing, such as ''kitaamb'''á'''ala'' 'table-cloth' or ''mabal'''ú'''wa'' 'letters', it is reported that the high tone plateau starts not on the accented mora, but the second mora of the word:&lt;ref&gt;Kalema (1977), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ki&lt;u&gt;táámb'''á'''ál'''á'''&lt;/u&gt; kyaffe'' 'our table cloth'
*''ma&lt;u&gt;bál'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;wa gaange'' 'my letters'

With a monosyllabic possessive namely ''-'''ô''''' 'your' or ''-'''ê''''' 'his', the tones are different. The first tone remains in the same place as before, then there is a plateau from the first tone to the end:
*''ekit&lt;u&gt;'''á'''bó ky'''ô'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'your book'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.56"&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''er&lt;u&gt;'''í'''ńnyá ly'''ô'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'your name'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.2-3"/&gt;
*''ekib&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''gá ky'''ô'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'your city'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.56"/&gt;
*''akag&lt;u&gt;'''á'''álí k'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'his bicycle'&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.172"/&gt;

But when the noun has a tone on the final syllable, it becomes a high tone, and the tone of -''yó'' is suppressed by Meeussen's rule (HH &gt; HL):
*''ens'''í''': yo'' 'your country'
*''mu kib&lt;u&gt;'''í'''ín'''á''':&lt;/u&gt; kyo'' 'in your class'

==Verbs==

===High and low-toned verbs===
Like many Bantu languages, Luganda has high-toned and low-toned verbs. In the infinitive, low-toned verbs have the usual phrasal tones on all but the first mora:
*''ok&lt;u&gt;úsá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to grind'
*''okw&lt;u&gt;érá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to sweep'
*''ok&lt;u&gt;úggálá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to shut'
*''ok&lt;u&gt;újjá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to come'
*''ok&lt;u&gt;úlíndá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to wait'
*''ok&lt;u&gt;úsómá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to study, read'
*''ok&lt;u&gt;úsómésá&lt;/u&gt;'' to teach'
*''ok&lt;u&gt;úgúlá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to buy'

High-toned verbs (which are about 60% of verbs) have a high tone on the mora immediately following the infinitive prefix ''oku-''. Phrasal tones are added only in the case of longer verbs:
*''okuly'''â''''' 'to eat'
*''okunyw'''â''''' 'to drink'
*''okut'''ú'''ma'' 'to send'
*''okul'''á'''ba'' 'to see'
*''okuk'''ó'''la'' 'to work, to do'
*''okuf'''ú'''na'' 'to get, obtain'
*''okuy'''î'''mb&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to sing'
*''okut'''â'''nd&lt;u&gt;íká&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to begin'
*''okuy'''î'''ng&lt;u&gt;írá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to enter'

===Meeussen's rule (HH &gt; HL)===
Verbs in Luganda are particularly affected by a rule known as [[Meeussen's rule]], which is common in many African languages, whereby a sequence of tones HH becomes HL. Similarly HHH becomes HLL and HHHH becomes HLLL. (This rule does not affect nouns in Luganda.)

Thus *''b'''á'''-l'''í'''-l'''á'''ba'' 'they will see' theoretically has three high tones, one for the prefix ''b'''á'''-'' 'they', one for the future tense-marker ''-l'''í'''-'', and one for the verb-stem itself ''l'''á'''ba'' 'see'. However, after the operation of Meeussen's rule, and the addition of a phrasal tone, it changes as follows:&lt;ref name="Hyman &amp; Katamba 1993, pp.36, 45"&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba (1993), pp. 36, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* *''b'''á'''-l'''í'''-l'''á'''ba'' &gt; ''b'''á'''lilab&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they will see'

The important point here is that a phrasal tone cannot be added (except on the very last syllable before a pause) to any syllable that formerly had a high tone. Thus in the above word ''b'''á'''lilab&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' the remaining lexical tone on ''b'''á''''' is followed not by one low-toned syllable, but by two.

Hyman and Katamba give the following examples to illustrate how a lowered H cannot acquire a phrasal tone or form a plateau:&lt;ref name="Hyman &amp; Katamba 1993, p.45"/&gt;
*''b'''á'''lilab&lt;u&gt;á ébík'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;po'' 'they will see cups' (with a plateau), where ''b'''á'''lilaba'' is derived from *''b'''á'''l'''í'''l'''á'''ba''
*''ab'''á'''lilaba ebik'''ó'''po'' 'they who will see cups' (with downdrift), where ''ab'''á'''lilaba'' is derived from *''ab'''á'''l'''í'''l'''á'''b'''á'''''

To make sense of the tones of Luganda verbs therefore, it is necessary to consider not only what tones the verb actually has, but also the underlying tones which it formerly had before the operation of Meeussen's rule.

===Tones in tenses===
Various elements add a tone to verbs:&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xiv ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The tone of the subject prefix. This usually has a tone if it is 'diphonic' (consisting of two phonemes) such as ''b'''á'''-'' 'they', ''t'''ú'''-'' 'we', ''k'''í'''''- 'it' etc, but usually toneless if it is monophonic (consisting of one phoneme), e.g. ''a''- 'he/she', ''n-'' 'I', ''o''- 'you (sg.)' etc. (For an exception see below on relative clause verbs.)
*The tone of the tense-marker. The tense-markers -'''''á'''''- (Near Past), -''n'''á'''a''- (Near Future), -''l'''í'''''- (General Future), -''ky'''á'''''- ('still') all add a tone, while -''a''- (Far Past) adds a tone in the syllable which follows. (The tense-markers -''nna''- 'not yet' and -''aaka''- 'just' do not add a tone; there is also no tone in the ending ''-nga'' used to make the habitual aspect.)
*The tone of the verb-stem, if it is high-toned. In the Infinitive and General Future this tone is on the first mora only, but in the Present tense it affects the first two moras.
*The tone of the negative marker. The 1st person negative marker ''s'''í'''-'' has its own tone. The negative marker with other persons is ''te-'', which adds a tone on the following syllable. In relative-clause verbs the negative marker is -''t'''á'''''-.
*In addition, many tenses add a grammatical tone on the final syllable. In longer verbs, in some cases this tone may move to the penultimate syllable.

Having added these tones, the following rules apply:

*Any sequence HLH (HLLH, HLLLH) becomes a plateau by the plateauing rule, for example ''teb'''á'''gul'''á''''' becomes ''teb&lt;u&gt;'''á'''gúl'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they do not buy'.
*Any sequence HH (HHH, HHHH) becomes HL (HLL, HLLL) by Meeussen's rule, unless there is a plateau; for example ''b'''á'''l'''á'''b'''á''''' becomes ''b'''á'''laba'' 'they see'.
*Phrasal tones are added to the end of the verb, except that:
:(a) A phrasal tone is not added to any syllable of which the tone has been deleted by Meeussen's rule, except at the end of a sentence or before pronominal words such as ''bonn'''â''''' 'all'.
:(b) A phrasal tone also does not directly follow the General Future infix -''l'''í'''''- in low-toned verbs, even if the tone of -''l'''í'''''- is deleted.

===Relative clause verbs===
Relative clause verbs have a different intonation from ordinary verbs in Luganda. They are more commonly used than in English, since as Crabtree pointed out (1902) they are used for emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree (1902), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, instead of 'who bought things?' a Luganda-speaker would say 'which are the ones who bought things?'
*''bak'''í''' ab&lt;u&gt;'''á'''gúz'''é'''&lt;/u&gt; ebintu?''&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, instead of 'he went to Buganda to teach', a Luganda-speaker might say 'what he went to Buganda for is to teach':&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''y&lt;u&gt;'''á'''génd'''á''' mú Búgá'''ń'''&lt;/u&gt;da kus&lt;u&gt;ómésá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'what he went to Buganda for is to teach'

An initial vowel is usually added before diphonic subject-prefixes such as ''b'''á'''-'' (e.g. ''ab&lt;u&gt;'''á'''gúl'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they who buy'), but not before monophonic prefixes such as ''a-''. However, this initial vowel disappears in certain contexts, such as the second example above.

In object clauses, such as the following, a toneless prefix acquires a tone:&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''emm'''é'''re gye '''&lt;u&gt;á'''fú'''ḿ'''&lt;/u&gt;ba'' 'the staple food which she is cooking'

But when an object copula is used as in the following sentence, both kinds of prefix lose their tone:
*''emm'''é'''re gye bafú'''ḿ'''ba'' 'the staple food is what they are cooking'.

The word ''gwe'', ''ge'', ''bye'' etc. itself usually has no tone. However, the rules for such clauses can be complex.&lt;ref&gt;See Hyman &amp; Katamba (2010), pp. 87ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of tenses===

In the tables which follow, examples are given of six commonly used tenses, together with the subjunctive mood, with some comments on each. In the tables two verbs are used, ''-gula'' 'buy' and -''l'''á'''ba'' 'see', as examples of low and high-toned verbs respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', pp. xxv-xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Present tense====

|-
! 'they see'
|''b'''á'''laba''||''ab'''á'''laba'' ||''teb'''á'''laba''||''ab'''á'''talaba''
|-
|}

The underlying tones of the 3rd person plural of the high-toned verb change by Meeussen's rule as follows:
* *''b'''á'''-l'''á'''b'''á''''' &gt; ''b'''á'''laba'' 'they see' (HHH &gt; HLL)

That is, the first ''two'' moras of the verb-stem in this tense are underlyingly high. (Compare ''b'''á'''sesem&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they vomit'; ''b'''á'''tand&lt;u&gt;íká&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they begin'.)

When an object-infix such as ''-gu-'' 'it (e.g. bread)' is added, the tones change as follows:
* *''b'''á'''-gu-l'''á'''b'''á''''' &gt; ''b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''gúl'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ba'' 'they see it'

The negative and relative versions of this tense all have a grammatical tone on the final vowel, which in fact has two moras and is underlyingly *''-a'''á'''''. In a two-mora high-toned verb, this final tone disappears by Meeussen's rule, but it reappears and makes a plateau when the verb-stem has three moras or more:
*''teb'''á'''laba'' 'they do not see' (HHHH &gt; HLL)
*''teb&lt;u&gt;'''á'''léét'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they do not bring' (HHLH &gt; HHH)

When the irregular verb ''-li'' 'is (in a certain location)' is used in a relative clause, a high tone is placed on the final vowel when the prefix is toneless. But when the prefix has a tone, the tone on the final is deleted by Meeussen's rule. The tone therefore varies according to whether the prefix is monophonic or diphonic:
*''al&lt;u&gt;í&lt;/u&gt;'' 'he is' - ''al'''í''''' 'who is'
*''b'''á'''li'' 'they are' - ''ab'''á'''li'' 'who are'

The two words ''al&lt;u&gt;í&lt;/u&gt;'' and ''al'''í''''', although both end in high tones, are pronounced differently in contexts such as the following, where the tone of ''al'''í''''' is higher and does not make a plateau:&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.219"/&gt;
*''al&lt;u&gt;í mú Búg'''áń'''&lt;/u&gt;da'' 'he is in Buganda'
*''al'''í''' mu Bug'''áń'''da'' 'who is in Buganda'

|-
! 'they have bought'
|''b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''gúz'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''ab&lt;u&gt;'''á'''gúz'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''teb&lt;u&gt;'''á'''gúz'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''ab&lt;u&gt;'''á'''tágúz'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''
|-
! 'they have seen'
|''b'''á'''labye''||''ab&lt;u&gt;'''á'''láby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''teb&lt;u&gt;'''á'''láby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''ab&lt;u&gt;'''á'''táláby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''
|-
|}

The Perfect tense uses a different stem from the Present (e.g. ''-guz'''ê''''' instead of ''-gula'' 'buy'), and there is an underlying high tone on the ending. In longer (3-mora) low-toned verbs, such as ''-genda'' 'go' or ''-kweka'' 'hide (something)', the final tone moves to the penultimate syllable in the basic form:
*''agé'''ń'''ze'' 'she has gone' (not *''agenz'''ê''''' as one might expect)

All the forms of this tense have a tone on the final vowel, but the basic form is different from the negative and relative. In high-toned verbs, Meeussen's rule applies in the basic form (e.g. ''b'''á'''labye'' 'they have seen'), but in the negative and relative forms there is a plateau instead (''teb&lt;u&gt;'''á'''láby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;'' they have not seen'). Another example, using the 1st person negative marker ''s'''í'''-'', which keeps its own tone, is the following:
*''nt'''é'''gedde'' 'I have understood' vs. ''s&lt;u&gt;'''í'''tégédd'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I have not understood'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
! 'he saw'
|''y&lt;u&gt;'''á'''láby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''ey&lt;u&gt;'''á'''láby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''tey'''á'''labye''||''atá'''á'''labye''
|-
! 'they bought'
|''b&lt;u&gt;'''áá'''gúz'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''ab&lt;u&gt;'''áá'''gúz'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''tebá'''á'''guze''||''ab&lt;u&gt;'''á'''tá'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;guze''
|-
! 'they saw'
|''b&lt;u&gt;'''áá'''láby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''ab&lt;u&gt;'''áá'''láby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;''||''tebá'''á'''labye''||''ab&lt;u&gt;'''á'''tá'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;labye''
|-
|}

The Near Past tense uses the same verb-stem as the Perfect tense but with the tense marker -'''''á'''''-. The subject prefixes change to ''y'''á'''-'' 'he' and ''b'''áá'''-'' 'they'. The final vowel once again is -'''ê'''''.

In low-toned verbs the subject prefix makes a plateau with the grammatical tone on the final vowel:
*''y&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-gúz'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'he bought (today)' (from ''ok&lt;u&gt;úgúlá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to buy')

In longer low-toned verbs in this tense the final tone moves to the second mora of the penultimate syllable:&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p.xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''y&lt;u&gt;'''á'''kẃ'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;se'' 'he hid (today)' (from ''ok&lt;u&gt;úkwéká&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to hide something')

In high-toned verbs in this tense there is always a plateau even in the basic form of the verb (in this it differs from the Perfect tense above). Contrast:
*''b'''á'''labye'' 'he has seen' (from ''okul'''á'''ba'' 'to see')
*''b&lt;u&gt;'''áá'''-láby'''ê'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'he saw (today)'

|-
|}

The tense-infix of this tense is ''a'', which puts a tone on the syllable which follows it.

Although the forms in the table above do not appear to have a high tone on the final, in fact there is an underlying high tone, which reappears and makes a plateau in forms like the following:
*''ya-g&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''-kwékâ&lt;/u&gt; 'he hid it'

Another indication that there is an underlying high tone on the final vowel is the fact that forms like ''bá'''á'''gula'' 'they bought' do not add a phrasal tone on the final syllable (except before a pause or before a pronominal word like ''bonn'''â''''' 'all').

|-
|}

The Near Future tense has a tense-marker -''n'''á'''-a''-. In the relative and negative forms, there is an (underlying) grammatical tone on the final vowel. In the negative of this tense, the final vowel changes to ''-e''.

In the second person singular -''n'''á'''-a''- becomes ''n'''ó'''-o-'':&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;
* *''o-n'''á'''-a-ly'''â''''' &gt; ''on&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''oly'''â'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'you (sg.) will eat'

|-
|}

This tense has a tone on the tense-marker ''-l'''í'''-''. The tone of this disappears by Meeussen's rule after a high-toned subject prefix. A peculiarity of this tense is that with a low-toned verb, the syllable after ''-l'''í'''-'' cannot bear a phrasal tone, even when the tone of ''-l'''í'''-'' itself is deleted by Meeussen's rule.

The forms given above differ from those given by Stevick,&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; who states that in this tense as in the Present the first two moras of a high-toned verb stem have underlying tone. However, the examples given by Hyman and Katamba (e.g. ''b'''á'''liwul&lt;u&gt;írá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they will hear')&lt;ref name="Hyman &amp; Katamba 1993, pp.36, 45"/&gt; imply that only the first mora of a high-toned verb has an underlying tone in this tense. Contrast the Present tense example below, in which both syllables of ''-laba'' are low, with the Future tense, where only the second syllable has a phrasal tone:
*''b'''á'''laba om&lt;u&gt;úgáátí&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they see bread'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''b'''á'''lilab&lt;u&gt;á ébík&lt;/u&gt;'''ó'''po'' 'they will see cups'&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Katamba 1993, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subjunctive mood====

*''agul'''ê''''' 'he should buy'
*''alab'''ê''''' 'he should see'
*''bagul'''ê''''' 'they should buy'
*''balab'''ê''''' 'they should see'

The subjunctive mood has just a single tone on the final vowel, which causes all earlier tones in the verb to be deleted. Before a pause, this tone becomes a falling tone, but before ''kí?'' 'what?', it remains high:&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.182"/&gt;
*''muyingir'''ê''''' 'please come in, you should come in'
*''tukol'''é''' k'''í'''?'' 'what should we do?'

Contrast the following, where the final vowel has a falling tone and two moras:&lt;ref name="Luganda Basic Course, p.xiv"/&gt;
*''ens'''î''' k'''í'''?'' 'what country?'
er
The subjunctive has no relative clause or negative form, but a negative may be made by using the subjunctive of the verb ''ok&lt;u&gt;úlémá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to fail' plus the infinitive.&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''balem'''é''' okuy'''î'''ng&lt;u&gt;írá&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they should not come in'&lt;ref&gt;''Luganda Basic Course'', p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object infixes==
An object infix such as ''-m'''ú'''-'' 'him/her' or ''-b'''á'''-'' 'them' can be added to a verb before the verb-root. In the infinitive, object infixes have a tone:&lt;ref&gt;Hyman (2017), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''oku-m'''ú'''-siba'' 'to tie him/her'
*''oku-b'''á'''-siba'' 'to tie them'

However, in the present tense, they are toneless:
*''a-mu-siba'' 'he ties him/her'

But the reflexive infix is always high-toned, even in the present tense:
*''okw-'''éé'''-siba'' 'to tie oneself'
*''y-'''éé'''-siba'' 'he ties himself/she ties herself'

'''Me'en''' (also Mekan, Mie'en, Mieken, Meqan, Men) is a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]] ([[Eastern Sudanic]], [[Surmic]], Southeast Surmic&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unseth. 1988. The Validity and Unity of the Southeast Surma Language Grouping. ''Northeast African Studies'' 10.2/3:151-163&lt;/ref&gt;) spoken in [[Ethiopia]] by the [[Me'en people]]. In recent years, it has been written with the [[Ge'ez alphabet]], but in 2007 a decision was made to use the Latin alphabet. Dialects include Bodi (Podi) and Tishena (Teshina, Teshenna).

Me'en is unique among Surmic languages in that it has [[ejective consonants]].

Reliable descriptions of some parts of the language have been produced by Hans-Georg Will, often contradicting [[Carlo Conti Rossini]]'s work, the editing of the extensive language notes of a non-linguist.

'''Miren Agur Meabe Plaza''' (born 7 October 1962) is a [[Biscay]]an writer in the [[Basque language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/artikuluak/artikulua.php?id=eu&amp;ar=96680|title=Meabe Plaza, Miren Agur - Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia|website=aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basqueliterature.com/es/Katalogoak/egileak/meabe|title=MEABE, Miren Agur. Portal Literatura Vasca|website=www.basqueliterature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Meabe was born in [[Lekeitio]]. She gained a diploma in Teaching by the [[Derio School of Teachers]] in the speciality of Social Sciences, graduating in Basque Philology. She worked for several years at the Ikastola Kirikino in [[Bilbao]]. 
Since 1990, she has also directed the Giltza-Edebé publishing house in the Basque Country. At present her work is centered on translation and literary creation.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

As a writer, her work is developed especially around poetry and children's and young people's literature. She has been awarded several prizes.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  Several of her works have been translated into Catalan, Spanish and Galician. Since 2006, she has been a collaborating member of The Royal Academy of the Basque-Euskaltzaindia Language.

Her first story, "Uneka ... Gaba", was published in 1986. 
In this work, using a language very close to the lyric, we can already appreciate the characteristic features of her work: [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and the [[postmodern]] concept of the "moment": "the moment lives and we only live the moment." The self and the moment surround us.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Focused on poetry in 1991, she won the Literary Contest of the City Council of Lasarte-Oria with the work ''Oi hondarrezko emaikaitz''. It is a collection of poems around the myth of [[Penelope]]. The first edition went unnoticed and was edited again in the magazine ''Idatz &amp; Mintz'' of the Institute Labayru in the year 1999.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  Several of these poems were published later in his book of poetry more known as: ''Azalaren kodea'' (2000).

In this work, as appears from her poetics, the author tries to develop a writing based on the body. The titles of the sections of the book show the different ways of expressing themselves in relation to the body: "Orbainak" (Scars), "Tatuajeak" (Tattoos) and "Kontraseinuak" (Passwords). She uses a new language of gestures and love. However, in Oharrak style is defined by accuracy, brevity and concreteness.
This new vocabulary related to the woman's body is an attempt to communicate through gestures, despite being realized through the word. The author's own life is at the beginning of the poems, which conveys her message through those verses.

Miren Agur Meabe also deals with children's and young people's literature, especially since the year 2000, and is the genre with which she has received the most recognition, mainly for the Euskadi Prize, Euskadi Saria, and the translation of these works: ''Itsaslabarreko Et al'' (2001). {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 
It is an adventure story, with the ingredients of research and fear. 
''Itsasargian urtebete'' (2006) provides a version of the civil war from a boy's point of view. It affects the passages of his life and his sensitivity to live them, especially those related to love. Unlike the work of [[Joseba Sarrionaindia]] on the same subject, Miren Agur Meabe is dedicated mainly to highlight the everyday.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 
As for the youthful poetry premiered with ''Zer da, ba, Maitasuna?'' {{clarify|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Komi Molodtsov' alfabet.jpg|thumb|Cyrillic Molodtsov alphabet]]
The '''Cyrillic Molodtsov alphabet''' ({{lang-kv|Молодцов анбур}}, ''Molodcov anbur'') is an alphabet derived from [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] that was used in the 1920s and 1930s to write two versions of the [[Komi language]]; Komi-Zyrian and Komi-Permyak. It was replaced by the Latin Molodtsov alphabet in 1931&lt;ref&gt;"Creating and development of the Komi literary language" in {{cite web |url=http://www.reocities.com/Athens/2282/finno.html |title=The Finno-Ugric language family |author=Tsypanov, Prof. E. A.; anonymous (tr.) |publisher=ReoCities |accessdate=8 Dec 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by the Cyrillic alphabet in the [[Komi Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].  

The letters particular to the Cyrillic Molodtsov alphabet are:
[[Ԁ]] [[Ԃ]] [[Ԅ]] [[Ԇ]] [[Ԉ]] [[Ԋ]] [[Ԍ]] [[Ԏ]] (the hooks represent [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]])

'''Mongo''', also called '''Nkundo''' or '''Mongo-Nkundu''' (''Lomongo, Lonkundu''), is a Bantu language spoken by several of the [[Mongo people]]s in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Mongo speakers reside in central DR Congo over a large area inside the curve of the [[Congo River]].  Mongo is a [[tonal language]].

There are a large number of dialects. Maho (2009) lists one of these, Bafoto (Batswa de l'Equateur), [[Guthrie code|C.611]], as a separate language. The others are:&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

'''Mukund Parikh''' is a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] novelist, poet and playwright from [[Gujarat]], India.

==Life==
Mukund Parikh was born on 26 January 1934 in Nadisar village (now in [[Panchmahal district]], Gujarat) to Bhailal Parikh. He completed his primary and secondary education from his native town [[Balasinor]]. He completed his B. A. in Economics from Dharmendrasinhji College, [[Rajkot]] in 1957. He worked in a Provident Fund Commissioner Office from 1954 to 1980. He studied LL.B. from [[Ahmedabad]] in 1980 from [[Gujarat University]].&lt;ref name="Seshagiri2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Narasimhiah Seshagiri|title=Encyclopaedia of Cities and Towns in India: Gujarat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhsoAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-212-0981-6|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, he is working as a lawyer.&lt;ref name="AGSI"&gt;{{cite book|title=અર્વાચીન ગુજરાતી સાહિત્યનો ઈતિહાસ - આધુનિક અને અનુઆધુનિક યુગ|last=Brahmabhatt|first=Prasad|publisher=Parshwa Publication|year=2010|isbn=978-93-5108-247-7|location=Ahmedabad|pages=196–198|language=gu|trans-title=History of Modern Gujarati Literature – Modern and Postmodern Era}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His ''Mahabhinishkraman'' (1968) was an experimental novel.&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. M. George|title=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology: Surveys and poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;pg=PA141|year=1992|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-324-0|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Weekly of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7gnAQAAIAAJ|volume=101|year=1980|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a [[love triangle]] of a character named Amit Dalal and it explores his relationship with three ladies: Chandan, his mother; Rama, his wife and Saroj, his lover. Parikh employs the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] in his narration. He has used motifs such as [[pipal tree]] and darkness. He has explored [[Oedipus complex]] in his character's relationships. The novel was particularly praised for its language.&lt;ref name="AGSI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendra2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gujarat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4oMAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Smt.

He was associated with the experimental literary circles such as Re Math and Akanth Sabarmati. His [[one-act play]] ''Choras Inda Ane Gol Kabaro'' was included in a collection of five one-act plays ''Make Believe'' (1968) published by Re Math. This play is considered as an example of an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurd play]] from the early period of modern Gujarati literature. It is a psychological play flipping the places of an actor and the viewers in the theatre. ''Moksh'' (1975) is his one-act plays collection.&lt;ref name="AGSI"/&gt;

''Man Chitarie'' (2004) is his poetry collection awarded by [[Gujarat Sahitya Akademi]].&lt;ref name="AGSI"/&gt;

He co-edited poetry journal ''Shabda'' with [[Ravji Patel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAUwAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=January 2009|publisher=Sahitya Akademi.|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catalan language}}

'''Old Catalan''' was the [[Romance languages|Romance variety]] spoken in territories that spanned roughly the territories of the [[Principality of Catalonia]], the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], and the island of [[Sardinia]]; all of them then part of the [[Crown of Aragon]].

Old Catalan, classified as an Occitano Romance variety, is grouped with Old Occitan or Provençal.

====Laterals====
It is believed that Old Catalan had two lateral palatal phonemes. The first,{{IPA|/ʎ/}}, was written as {{angle bracket|ll}} and has remained unchanged until recently. The second, reconstructed as {{IPA|/jl/}}, came from the Latin groups C'L, G'L, LE, and LI; it was written as {{angle bracket|yl}} and {{angle bracket|il}}. {{IPA|/jl/}} never appeared in initial position. This second phoneme has either merged into {{IPA|/ʎ/}} in most dialects but into {{IPA|/j/}} in a few dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rasico|first=Philip|title=Estudis sobre la fonologia del català preliterari|year=1982|publisher=Curial/Publicacions de l’Abadia de Montserrat|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 12th century, word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} became {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, even though it continued to be spelled as {{angle bracket|l}} until the 15th century.{{sfn|Moll|1993|p=93}}

====Labiodentals====
{{IPA|/v/}} began to merge into {{IPA|/b/}} in some dialects around the 14th century, a process called [[betacism]].{{sfn|Recasens|1991|p=196}} Now, the distinction is maintained only in Valencia, the Balearic Islands, and southern Tarragona.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The system features a modification of the original Proto-Romance {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. First, {{IPA|/e/}} was centralized to {{IPA|/ə/}}, and then {{IPA|/ɛ/}} was raised to {{IPA|/e/}}. In Modern Central Catalan, stressed {{IPA|/ə/}} has been fronted to {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, thus partially inverting the original Proto-Romance distribution still found in Italian and Portuguese. Balearic varieties still keep stressed {{IPA|/ə/}}.

It is assumed that during the preliterary period all the Catalan dialects featured a weak realization of the pretonic vowels. Around the 13th century, pretonic {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} began to be confused in writing in the Eastern dialects. In these dialects, the confusion would be spread to all unstressed instances of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, a process that was almost complete by the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rasico|first=Philip D.|title=Entorn d'una llei fonètica catalana observada fa temps|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coromines|first=Joan|title="Vides de Sants" rosselloneses|page=295|language=Catalan|quote=''A l'Edat Mitjana, les abundoses confusions ortogràfiques dels manuscrits demostren que el fet ja estava consumat des d'una data primerenca, pel que fa a la posició pretònica; en final absoluta sovintegen menys les confusions de a amb e si bé no constitueixen una raresa; en síl·laba posttònica interna, i en la final quan segueix consonant, no es troben confusions abans del segle XV si no es en textos sospitosos i molt excepcionalment''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Final post-tonic {{IPA|/e, o/}} were devoiced{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and were lost during the formation of Catalan. According to some historic studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Duarte|Alsina|1984|pp=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; final nasals were velarised and assimilated before being lost in Modern Catalan (e.g. {{IPA|[ˈpãŋ]}}  → {{IPA|[ˈpã]}} → {{IPA|[ˈpa]}}).

==Orthography==
Current Catalan orthography is mostly based on medieval practice; however, some of the pronunciations and conventions have changed.
* Accents (such as {{angle bracket|´}} and {{angle bracket|`}}) and the diaeresis {{angle bracket|¨}} were used less frequently.
* The [[tilde]] {{angle bracket|~}} was sometimes used to replace {{angle bracket|m}} and {{angle bracket|n}}{{how|date=November 2015|title=Surely on top of the preceding vowel, right?}}.
* The [[interpunct]] {{angle bracket|·}} was often used to indicate elision and hyphenation.{{examples|date='col•legi' that means school}}
* {{angle bracket|c}} in front of {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|i}}; {{angle bracket|ç}} and final {{angle bracket|z}} (also spelled {{angle bracket|ç}}, and {{angle bracket|s}} after merging with {{IPA|/s/}}&lt;!-- later standardised to {{angle bracket|ç}} --&gt;) represented {{IPA|/ts/}} instead of modern {{IPA|/s/}}: Old Catalan {{IPA|/ˈtsɛl/}}, modern ''cel'' {{IPA|/ˈsɛl/}}
* {{angle bracket|ch}}, {{angle bracket|ph}}, {{angle bracket|rh}} and {{angle bracket|th}} represented {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}. Mediaeval scribes often confused them with {{angle bracket|c}}, {{angle bracket|f}}, {{angle bracket|r}} and {{angle bracket|t}}
* {{angle bracket|ch}} represented {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, especially in the Valencian variant
* {{angle bracket|ch}} at the end of the word was used for {{IPA|/k/}} instead of modern {{angle bracket|c}}. This convention was kept until the early 20th century modern ''amic'' was written ''amich'' ("friend")
* {{angle bracket|yl}}, {{angle bracket|il}}, were used for the phoneme {{IPA|/jl/}}. In the modern language, the sound has come to be pronounced {{IPA|/ʎ/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} depending on the dialect. Both are now written as {{angle bracket|ll}}: e.g. modern ''mirall'' was written ''mirail'' or ''mirayl'' ("mirror"). Cf. Latin ''miraculus''.
* Initial /{{IPA|ʎ/}} (appeared in the 12th century from initial {{IPA|/l/}}) was written as {{angle bracket|l}}- until the 15th century to maintain connections with Latin etyma.{{sfn|Moll|1993|p=93}} In the modern language, it is written as {{angle bracket|ll}}: e.g. modern ''llibre'' was written ''libre'' ("book"). Cf. Latin ''liber''.
* {{angle bracket|h}} was frequently omitted: modern ''haver'' was written ''aver'' ("to have"). Cf. Latin ''habere''.
* {{angle bracket|h}} was sometimes used to mark hiatus: e.g. modern ''veí'' was written ''vehi'' ("neighbour")
* Final unvoiced obstruents were often written as such. In the modern language, the characters for their voiced counterparts may be used to reflect Latin etymology: modern ''fred'' was written ''fret'' ("cold"). Cf. Latin ''frigidus''.

== History ==
=== Early Middle Ages ===
[[File:Homilies d'Organya.jpg|thumb|''Les Homilies d'Organyà'' (12th century), first written in Catalan.]]
By the 9th&amp;nbsp;century, the Catalan language had developed from [[Vulgar Latin]] on both sides of the eastern end of the [[Pyrenees]] mountains (counties of [[County of Roussillon|Rosselló]], [[Empúries]], [[Besalú]], [[Cerdanya]], [[Urgell]], [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] and [[County of Ribagorça|Ribagorça]]), as well as in the territories of the Roman province and later archdiocese of [[Tarraconensis]] to the south.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}} From the 8th&amp;nbsp;century on, the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards, conquering territories then occupied by Muslims, bringing their language with them.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}}

This phenomenon gained momentum with the separation of the [[County of Barcelona]] from the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 988&amp;nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}} By the 9th century, the Christian rulers occupied the northern parts of present-day Catalonia, usually termed "Old Catalonia", and during the 11th and 12th centuries they expanded their domains to the region north of the [[Ebro river]], a land known as "New Catalonia".{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}} During the 13th century, the Catalans expanded to the [[Kingdom of Valencia|Land of Valencia]] and across to the [[Balearic Islands]] and Alghero in Sardinia.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}}

{{quote box|width=50%|title=''Greuges'' of Guitard Isarn, Lord of Caboet (ca. 1080–1095){{sfn|Veny|1997|pp=9–18}}&lt;ref&gt;The source book has reconstructed elided fragments and written out abbreviations in full, like ''et''. Capitalization, the use of u-v, i-j, and c-ç have all been regularized. Accents apostrophes and diaeresis have been added according to the modern orthography. Used punctuation according to modern usage.&lt;/ref&gt;|bgcolor=Honeydew|quote=Hec est memoria de ipsas rancuras que abet dominus Guitardus Isarnus, senior Caputense, de rancuras filio Guillelm Arnall et que ag de suo pater, Guilelm Arnall; et non voluit facere directum in sua vita de ipso castro Caputense ''che li comannà''. ''Et si Guilelm Arnal me facia tal cosa que dreçar no·m volgués ho no poqués, ho ssi·s partia de mi, che Mir Arnall me romasés aisí com lo·m avia al dia che ad él lo commanné.'' Et in ipsa onor ''a Guillelm Arnal no li doné negú domenge ni establiment de cavaler ni de pedó per gitar ni per metre quan l·i comanné Mir Arnall.'' |source=Lines 1–4. Passages in Catalan in italics}}
According to historian [[Jaime Villanueva|Jaume Villanueva]] (1756–1824), the first attested Catalan sentence is thought to be found in an 8th-century manuscript from [[Ripoll]] that has since been lost. It was a whimsical note in 10th- or early 11th-century calligraphy: ''Magister m[eu]s no vol que em miras novel'' ("my master does not want you to watch me, newbie").{{sfn|Moran|1994|pp=55–93}}

During the 11th century, several feudal documents (especially oaths and complaints) written in [[macaronic Latin]] began to exhibit elements of Catalan, with proper names or even sentences in Romance.{{sfn|Moran|2004|pp=37–38}} Of special historical and linguistic importance is the ''Memorial of Complaints of Ponç I''&lt;ref&gt;''Memorial de greuges de Ponç I, comte d'Empúries, contra Jofre, comte de Rosselló''&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 1050–1060), featuring whole sentences in Romance.{{sfn|Moran|2004|pp=37–38}} By the end of the 11th century, documents written completely or mostly in Catalan begin to appear, like the ''Complaints of Guitard Isarn, Lord of Caboet'' (ca. 1080–1095), or ''The Oath of peace and truce of count Pere Ramon'' (1098).{{sfn|Moran|2004|pp=37–38}} Catalan shares many features with [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] languages, which are mostly located in France and Northern Italy. Old Catalan diverged from [[Old Occitan]] between the 11th and 14th centuries.{{sfn|Riquer|1964}}

===Late Middle Ages===

Catalan lived a golden age during the [[Late Middle Ages]], reaching a peak of maturity and cultural plenitude.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}} Examples of this can be seen in the works of Majorcan polymath [[Ramon Llull]] (1232–1315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th-14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry which culminated in [[Ausiàs March]] (1397–1459).{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}}

By the 15th century, the city of [[Valencia]] had become the center of social and cultural dynamism, and Catalan was present all over the [[Mediterranean]] world.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}} The belief that political splendor was correlated with linguistic consolidation was voiced through the Royal Chancery, which promoted a highly standardized language.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}}

The outstanding{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}} novel of chivalry ''[[Tirant lo Blanc]]'' (1490), by [[Joanot Martorell]], shows the transition from medieval to Renaissance values, something than can also be seen in the works of [[Bernat Metge]] and [[Andreu Febrer]].{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}} During this period, Catalan was what Costa Carreras terms "one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe".{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}} The flowering of the Renaissance was closely associated with the advent of the [[printing press]], and the first book produced with movable type in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was printed in Valencia in 1474: ''Trobes en llaors de la Verge maria'' ("Poems of praise of the Virgin Mary").{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6–7}}

In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[formal language theory]], the profinite words are the generalization of the notion of finite words into a [[Cauchy completion|complete topological space]]. This notion allows to use [[topology]] to study languages and finite semigroups. For example, profinite words are used to give an alternative characterization to the algebraic notion of [[variety of finite semigroups]].

==Definition==

Let '''A''' an [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]. The set of profinite words over '''A''' consists in the [[Completion (topology)|completion]] of a metric space defined on the set &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt; of words over '''A'''. The distance used to define this metric space is defined using a notion of separation of words. Those notions are now defined.

===Separation===
Let '''M''' and '''N''' [[monoid]]s, let '''p''' and '''q''' be elements of the monoid '''M'''. Let '''φ''' a [[morphism]] of monoid from '''M''' to '''N'''. It is said that the morphism φ separates '''p''' and '''q''' if &lt;math&gt;\phi(p)\ne\phi(q)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z, w\mapsto |w|&lt;/math&gt; sending a words to the parity of its length separates the words '''ababa''' and '''abaa'''. Indeed &lt;math&gt;\phi(ababa)=1\ne0=\phi(abaa)&lt;/math&gt;. 

It is said that '''N''' separates '''p''' and '''q''' if there exists a morphism of monoid φ from '''M''' to '''N''' which separates '''p''' and '''q'''. Using previous example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; separates '''ababa''' and '''abaa'''. More generally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; separates any words whose size are not congruent modulo '''n'''. In general, any two distinct words can be separated, using the monoid whose elements are the factors of '''p''' plus a fresh element 0. The morphism sends prefixes of '''p''' to themselves and everything else to 0.

===Distance===
The distance between two distinct words '''p''' and '''q''' is defined as the inverse of the size of the least morphism '''N''' separating '''p''' and '''q'''. Thus, the distance of '''ababa''' and '''abaa''' is &lt;math&gt;\frac12&lt;/math&gt;. The distance of '''p''' and itself is defined as 0.

This distance '''d''' is ultrametric, and furthermore it satisfies &lt;math&gt;d(uw,vw)\le d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(wu,wv)\le d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since any word '''p''' can be separated from any other word using a monoid with '''|p|+1''' elements, where '''|p|''' is the length of '''p''', it follows that the distance between '''p''' and any other word is at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|p|}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the topology defined by this metric is discrete. 
===Profinite topology===
The profinite topology over '''A''', denoted &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[Completion (topology)|completion]] of the set of finite words under the distance defined above. It should be noted that the completion preserve the monoid structure.

The topology &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt; is compact.

Any monoid morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to M&lt;/math&gt;, with '''M''' finite can be extended uniquely into  a morphism &lt;math&gt;\hat\phi:\hat A^*\to M&lt;/math&gt;, and this morphism is uniformly continuous.  Furthermore, it is the least topological space with this property.

===Profinite word===
A profinite word is an element of the profinite topology. And a profinite language is a set of profinite word. Each finite words are profinite words. A few examples of profinite words which are not finite are now given.

For '''m''' any word, let &lt;math&gt;m^\omega&lt;/math&gt; denote &lt;math&gt;\lim_{i\to\infty}m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]]. Intuitively, to separate &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m^{i'!}&lt;/math&gt;, a monoid should count at least up to &lt;math&gt;\min(i,i')&lt;/math&gt;, hence requires at least &lt;math&gt;\min(i,i')&lt;/math&gt; elements. Since &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]], &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a profinite word.

Furthermore, the word &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent. This is due to the fact that, for any morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to N&lt;/math&gt; with '''N''' finite, &lt;math&gt;\phi(m^{i!})=\phi(m)^{i!}=n^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; for some '''n''' belonging to '''N'''. Since '''N''' is finite, for '''i''' great enough, &lt;math&gt;n^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent, and the sequence is constant. 

Similarly, &lt;math&gt;m^{\omega+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m^{\omega-1}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}m^{n!+ 1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}m^{n!-1}&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

==Profinite languages==
The notion of profinite languages allow to relate notions of [[semigroup theory]] to notions of topology. More precisely, given  '''P''' a profinite language, the following statements are equivalent:
*'''P''' is clopen.
*'''P''' is [[recognizable_set|recognizable]],
*The [[syntactic congruence]] of '''P''' is clopen, as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*\times\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Similar statements also holds for languages '''P''' of finite words.  The following conditions are equivalent.
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is recognisable (as a subset of &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt;),
*the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of '''P''', &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt;, is recognisable (as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;), where 
*&lt;math&gt;P=K\cap A^*&lt;/math&gt;, for some clopen '''K''',
*&lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; is clopen.

Those characterisations are due to the more general fact that, taking the closure of a finite language, and restricting a profinite language to finite words are inverse operations, when they are applied to recognisable languages.

The '''Royal Institute of the Albanian Studies''' (in Albanian: Instituti Mbretnuer i Studimeve Shqiptare) (1940-1944) was a scientific and cultural institute that preceded the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]].

Founded during the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)]], it had four commissions:&lt;ref name="ARTI"&gt;{{cite web|author=Agency for Research, Technology and Innovation of Albania|title=Instituti i Studimeve Shqiptare|url=http://www.akti.gov.al/kerkimishkencor/issh.html|year=2013|publisher=for Research, Technology and Innovation of Albania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sculpture''' is the branch of the [[visual arts]] that operates in [[three dimensions]]. It is one of the [[plastic arts]]. Durable sculptural processes originally used [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in [[stone]], [[metal]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood]] and other materials but, since [[Modernism]], there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by [[welding]] or modelling, or [[Molding (process)|molded]] or [[Casting|cast]].
 
Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than [[pottery]]) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost.&lt;ref name="artmuseums.harvard.edu"&gt;[http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html "Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity" September 2007 to January 2008, The Arthur M. Sackler Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104060402/http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html |date=2009-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa.

The [[Western culture|Western]] tradition of sculpture began in [[ancient Greece]], and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the [[Classical Greece|classical]] period. During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]] sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the [[Renaissance]] produced famous sculptures such as [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, with the making of [[Assemblage (art)|constructed sculpture]], and the presentation of [[found object]]s as finished art works.

==Types==
A basic distinction is between sculpture in the round, free-standing sculpture, such as [[statue]]s, not attached (except possibly at the base) to any other surface, and the various types of [[relief]], which are at least partly attached to a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or [[bas-relief]], [[alto-relievo|high relief]], and sometimes an intermediate [[mid-relief]]. [[Sunk-relief]] is a technique restricted to [[ancient Egypt]]. Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to accomplish in the round, and is the typical technique used both for [[architectural sculpture]], which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much [[pottery]], metalwork and [[jewellery]]. Relief sculpture may also decorate [[stele]]s, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.

Another basic distinction is between subtractive carving techniques, which remove material from an existing block or lump, for example of stone or wood, and modelling techniques which shape or build up the work from the material. Techniques such as [[casting]], stamping and moulding use an intermediate matrix containing the design to produce the work; many of these allow the production of several copies.

[[File:龙门-Buddha.jpg|thumb|left|Open air Buddhist [[rock relief]]s at the [[Longmen Grottoes]], China]]
The term "sculpture" is often used mainly to describe large works, which are sometimes called [[monumental sculpture]], meaning either or both of sculpture that is large, or that is attached to a building. But the term properly covers many types of small works in three dimensions using the same techniques, including coins and [[medal]]s, [[hardstone carving]]s, a term for small carvings in stone that can take detailed work.

The very large or "colossal" statue has had an enduring appeal since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]; the [[List of statues by height|largest on record]] at {{convert|182|m|ft|abbr=on}} is the 2018 Indian [[Statue of Unity]]. Another grand form of portrait sculpture is the [[equestrian statue]] of a rider on horse, which has become rare in recent decades. The smallest forms of life-size portrait sculpture are the "head", showing just that, or the [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]], a representation of a person from the chest up. Small forms of sculpture include the [[figurine]], normally a statue that is no more than {{convert|18|in|cm}} tall, and for reliefs the [[plaquette]], medal or coin.

Modern and contemporary art have added a number of non-traditional forms of sculpture, including [[sound sculpture]], [[light sculpture]], [[environmental art]], [[environmental sculpture]], [[Lock On (street art)|street art sculpture]], [[Kinetic art|kinetic sculpture]] (involving aspects of [[Motion (physics)|physical motion]]), [[land art]], and [[site-specific art]]. Sculpture is an important form of [[public art]]. A collection of sculpture in a garden setting can be called a [[sculpture garden]].

==Purposes and subjects==
[[File:Moáis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''[[Moai]]'' from [[Easter Island]], where the concentration of resources on large sculpture may have had serious political effects.]]
One of the most common purposes of sculpture is in some form of association with religion. [[Cult image]]s are common in many cultures, though they are often not the colossal statues of deities which characterized [[ancient Greek art]], like the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. The actual cult images in the innermost sanctuaries of [[Egyptian temple]]s, of which none have survived, were evidently rather small, even in the largest temples. The same is often true in [[Hinduism]], where the very simple and ancient form of the [[lingam]] is the most common. [[Buddhism]] brought the sculpture of religious figures to East Asia, where there seems to have been no earlier equivalent tradition, though again simple shapes like the ''[[bi (jade)|bi]]'' and ''[[cong (jade)|cong]]'' probably had religious significance.

Small sculptures as personal possessions go back to the earliest prehistoric art, and the use of very large sculpture as [[public art]], especially to impress the viewer with the power of a ruler, goes back at least to the [[Great Sphinx]] of some 4,500 years ago. In [[archaeology]] and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of large or monumental sculpture in a culture is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;&lt;ref name="Google books"&gt;See for example Martin Robertson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BoUsvD1_VNQC&amp;pg=PA9 A shorter history of Greek art]'', p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1981, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28084-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[totem pole]] is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology. The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization. Recent unexpected discoveries of ancient Chinese [[bronze age]] figures at [[Sanxingdui]], some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_san.shtm NGA, Washington] feature on exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the [[Indus Valley civilization]], appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals. The [[Mississippian culture]] seems to have been progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed. Other cultures, such as ancient Egypt and the [[History of Easter Island|Easter Island culture]], seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage.
[[File:National gallery in washington d.c., pisanello, medaglia di giovanni di bisanzio recto.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Medal of John VIII Palaeologus]], c. 1435, by [[Pisanello]], the first portrait medal, a medium essentially made for collecting.]]

The collecting of sculpture, including that of earlier periods, goes back some 2,000 years in Greece, China and Mesoamerica, and many collections were available on semi-public display long before the modern [[museum]] was invented. From the 20th century the relatively restricted range of subjects found in large sculpture expanded greatly, with abstract subjects and the use or representation of any type of subject now common. Today much sculpture is made for intermittent display in galleries and museums, and the ability to transport and store the increasingly large works is a factor in their construction. Small decorative [[figurine]]s, most often in ceramics, are as popular today (though strangely neglected by [[Modern art|modern]] and [[Contemporary art]]) as they were in the [[Rococo]], or in ancient Greece when [[Tanagra figurines]] were a major industry, or in East Asian and [[Pre-Columbian art]]. Small sculpted fittings for furniture and other objects go well back into antiquity, as in the [[Nimrud ivories]], [[Begram ivories]] and finds from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]].

Portrait sculpture began in Egypt, where the [[Narmer Palette]] shows a ruler of the 32nd century BCE, and [[Mesopotamia]], where we have 27 surviving [[statues of Gudea]], who ruled [[Lagash]] c. 2144 – 2124 BCE. In ancient Greece and Rome, the erection of a portrait statue in a public place was almost the highest mark of honour, and the ambition of the elite, who might also be depicted on a coin.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Ptolemies]] began the Hellenistic tradition of ruler-portraits on coins, and the Romans began to show dead politicians in the 1st century BC, with [[Julius Caesar]] the first living figure to be portrayed; under the emperors portraits of the Imperial family became standard. See Burnett, 34-35; Howgego, 63-70&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures such as Egypt and the Near East public statues were almost exclusively the preserve of the ruler, with other wealthy people only being portrayed in their tombs. Rulers are typically the only people given portraits in Pre-Columbian cultures, beginning with the [[Olmec colossal heads]] of about 3,000 years ago. East Asian portrait sculpture was entirely religious, with leading clergy being commemorated with statues, especially the founders of monasteries, but not rulers, or ancestors. The Mediterranean tradition revived, initially only for tomb effigies and coins, in the Middle Ages, but expanded greatly in the Renaissance, which invented new forms such as the personal portrait [[medal]].

Animals are, with the human figure, the earliest subject for sculpture, and have always been popular, sometimes realistic, but often imaginary monsters; in China animals and monsters are almost the only traditional subjects for stone sculpture outside tombs and temples. The kingdom of plants is important only in jewellery and decorative reliefs, but these form almost all the large sculpture of [[Byzantine art]] and [[Islamic art]], and are very important in most Eurasian traditions, where motifs such as the [[palmette]] and vine scroll have passed east and west for over two millennia.

One form of sculpture found in many prehistoric cultures around the world is specially enlarged versions of ordinary tools, weapons or vessels created in impractical precious materials, for either some form of ceremonial use or display or as offerings. [[Jade]] or other types of [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] were used in China, [[Olmec]] Mexico, and [[Neolithic Europe]], and in early Mesopotamia large pottery shapes were produced in stone. Bronze was used in Europe and China for large axes and blades, like the [[Oxborough Dirk]].

==Materials and techniques==
[[File:Mesopotamia male worshiper 2750-2600 B.C.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sumer]]ian male worshipper, alabaster with shell eyes, 2750−2600 B.C.E.]]
The materials used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history. The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially [[bronze]], stone and pottery, with wood, bone and [[antler]] less durable but cheaper options. Precious materials such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[jade]], and [[ivory]] are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine]] statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including [[hardwood]]s (such as [[oak]], [[Buxus|box/boxwood]], and [[Tilia|lime/linden]]); [[terracotta]] and other [[ceramic]]s, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of [[cylinder seal]]s and engraved gems), and cast metals such as [[pewter]] and [[zinc]] (spelter). But a vast number of other materials have been used as part of sculptures, in ethnographic and ancient works as much as modern ones.

Sculptures are often [[paint]]ed, but commonly lose their paint to time, or restorers. Many different painting techniques have been used in making sculpture, including [[tempera]], [[oil painting]], [[gilding]], house paint, aerosol, enamel and sandblasting.&lt;ref name="artmuseums.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flashpointmag.com/sculptur.htm Article by Morris Cox]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sculptors seek new ways and materials to make art. One of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s most famous sculptures included [[bicycle]] parts. [[Alexander Calder]] and other modernists made spectacular use of painted [[steel]]. Since the 1960s, [[acryl group|acrylics]] and other plastics have been used as well. [[Andy Goldsworthy]] makes his unusually ephemeral sculptures from almost entirely natural materials in natural settings. Some sculpture, such as [[ice sculpture]], [[sand sculpture]], and [[gas sculpture]], is deliberately short-lived. Recent sculptors have used [[stained glass]], tools, machine parts, hardware and consumer packaging to fashion their works. Sculptors sometimes use [[found objects]], and [[Chinese scholar's rocks]] have been appreciated for many centuries.

===Stone===
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeologico - Mostra sul colore nell'antichità 08 - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|Modern reconstruction of the original painted appearance of a Late Archaic Greek marble figure from the [[Temple of Aphaea]], based on analysis of pigment traces,&lt;ref&gt;[https://christogenea.org/resources/Harvard%20gods%20in%20color%20gallery%20guide.pdf "Gods in Colour"]&lt;/ref&gt; c. 500 BCE]]
[[Stone sculpture]] is an ancient activity where pieces of rough natural [[Rock (geology)|stone]] are shaped by the [[Stone carving|controlled removal of stone]]. Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged in some form of stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe. [[Petroglyph]]s (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains ''in situ'', by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. [[Monumental sculpture]] covers large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings. [[Hardstone carving]] is the carving for artistic purposes of [[semi-precious]] stones such as [[jade]], [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[rock crystal]], [[sard]] or [[carnelian]], and a general term for an object made in this way. [[Alabaster]] or mineral [[gypsum]] is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable. [[Engraved gems]] are small carved gems, including [[cameo (carving)|cameos]], originally used as [[seal ring]]s.

The copying of an original statue in stone, which was very important for ancient Greek statues, which are nearly all known from copies, was traditionally achieved by "[[Pointing machine|pointing]]", along with more freehand methods. Pointing involved setting up a grid of string squares on a wooden frame surrounding the original, and then measuring the position on the grid and the distance between grid and statue of a series of individual points, and then using this information to carve into the block from which the copy is made.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 147; he notes that ancient Greek copyists seem to have used many fewer points than some later ones, and copies often vary considerably in the composition as well as the finish.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal===
[[File:Refugees medal DSCF9937.JPG|thumb|[[Ludwig Gies]], cast iron [[plaquette]], 8 x 9.8 cm, ''Refugees'', 1915]]
[[Bronze]] and related [[copper alloy]]s are the oldest and still the most popular metals for [[Casting|cast]] metal [[sculptures]]; a cast [[bronze sculpture]] is often called simply a "bronze". Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mold. Their strength and lack of brittleness (ductility) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various [[ceramic]] or stone materials (see [[marble sculpture]] for several examples). [[Gold]] is the softest and most precious metal, and very important in jewellery; with [[silver]] it is soft enough to be worked with hammers and other tools as well as cast; [[repoussé and chasing]] are among the techniques used in gold and [[silversmithing]].

[[Casting]] is a group of manufacturing processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process,&lt;ref name="jepsculpture"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Flash animation of the lost-wax casting process | work = | publisher = James Peniston Sculpture | date = | url = http://www.jepsculpture.com/bronze.shtml| doi = | accessdate = 2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a final stage of "cold work" may follow on the finished cast. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that ''cold set'' after mixing of components (such as [[epoxies]], [[concrete]], [[plaster]] and [[clay]]). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BC.&lt;ref name=mco&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ravi| first = B.| title = Metal Casting – Overview| publisher = Bureau of Energy Efficiency, India| year = 2004| url = http://www.emt-india.net/process/foundries/pdf/CDA1.pdf| postscript = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific techniques include [[lost-wax casting]], [[plaster mold casting]] and [[sand casting]].

[[Welding]] is a process where different pieces of metal are fused together to create different shapes and designs. There are many different forms of welding, such as [[Oxy-fuel welding]], [[Stick welding]], [[MIG welding]], and [[TIG welding]]. Oxy-fuel is probably the most common method of welding when it comes to creating steel sculptures because it is the easiest to use for shaping the steel as well as making clean and less noticeable joins of the steel. The key to Oxy-fuel welding is heating each piece of metal to be joined evenly until all are red and have a shine to them. Once that shine is on each piece, that shine will soon become a 'pool' where the metal is liquified and the welder must get the pools to join together, fusing the metal. Once cooled off, the location where the pools joined are now one continuous piece of metal. Also used heavily in Oxy-fuel sculpture creation is forging. [[Forging]] is the process of heating metal to a certain point to soften it enough to be shaped into different forms. One very common example is heating the end of a steel rod and hitting the red heated tip with a hammer while on an anvil to form a point. In between hammer swings, the forger rotates the rod and gradually forms a sharpened point from the blunt end of a steel rod.

===Glass===
[[File:Chihuly glass in boat, morning, Palm House - geograph.org.uk - 297500.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dale Chihuly]], 2006, ([[Blown glass]])]]
[[Glass]] may be used for sculpture through a wide range of working techniques, though the use of it for large works is a recent development. It can be carved, with considerable difficulty; the Roman [[Lycurgus Cup]] is all but unique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lycurgus_cup.aspx British Museum - The Lycurgus Cup]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot casting can be done by ladling molten glass into molds that have been created by pressing shapes into sand, carved graphite or detailed plaster/silica molds. Kiln casting glass involves heating chunks of glass in a kiln until they are liquid and flow into a waiting mold below it in the kiln. Glass can also be blown and/or hot sculpted with hand tools either as a solid mass or as part of a blown object. More recent techniques involve chiseling and bonding plate glass with polymer silicates and UV light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Arthur|title=The Sculpture Reference Illustrated|date=2005|location=Gulfport, MS|isbn=0-9755383-0-6|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|thumb|A carved wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song dynasty]] 960–1279, [[Shanghai Museum]]]]

===Pottery===
Pottery is one of the oldest materials for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting. Sculptors often build small preliminary works called [[maquette]]s of ephemeral materials such as [[plaster|plaster of Paris]], wax, unfired clay, or [[plasticine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/clay-into-terracotta/ V&amp;A Museum, Sculpture techniques: modelling in clay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802094251/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/clay-into-terracotta/ |date=2012-08-02 }}, accessed August 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small [[figurine]]s have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture. Stamps and moulds were used by most ancient civilizations, from [[Ancient Roman pottery|ancient Rome]] and Mesopotamia to China.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 140–144; Frankfort 112–113; Henig, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wood carving===
[[File:Detalle crucificado Luján Pérez, 1793.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, Spanish, wood and polychrome, 1793.]]
[[Wood carving]] has been extremely widely practiced, but survives much less well than the other main materials, being vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. It therefore forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures.&lt;ref name="Google books"/&gt;  Outdoor wood sculpture does not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the [[totem pole]] tradition developed. Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and the great majority of [[African sculpture]] and that of [[Oceania]] and other regions.

Wood is light, so suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be carried, and can take very fine detail. It is also much easier to work than stone.  It has been very often painted after carving, but the paint wears less well than the wood, and is often missing in surviving pieces.  Painted wood is often technically described as "wood and [[polychrome]]".  Typically a layer of [[gesso]] or plaster is applied to the wood, and then the paint is applied to that.

==Social status of sculptors==

Worldwide, sculptors have usually been tradesmen whose work is unsigned; in some traditions, for example China, where sculpture did not share the prestige of [[literati painting]], this has affected the status of sculpture itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; Even in [[ancient Greece]], where sculptors such as [[Phidias]] became famous, they appear to have retained much the same social status as other artisans, and perhaps not much greater financial rewards, although some signed their works.&lt;ref&gt;Burford, Alison, "Greece, ancient, §IV, 1: Monumental sculpture: Overview, 5 c)" in [[Oxford Art Online]], accessed August 24th, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Middle Ages]] artists such as the 12th-century [[Gislebertus]] sometimes signed their work, and were sought after by different cities, especially from the [[Trecento]] onwards in Italy, with figures such as [[Arnolfo di Cambio]], and [[Nicola Pisano]] and his son [[Giovanni Pisano|Giovanni]]. Goldsmiths and jewellers, dealing with precious materials and often doubling as bankers, belonged to powerful [[guild]]s and had considerable status, often holding civic office. Many sculptors also practised in other arts; [[Andrea del Verrocchio]] also painted, and [[Giovanni Pisano]], Michelangelo, and [[Jacopo Sansovino]] were [[Architecture|architects]]. Some sculptors maintained large workshops. Even in the Renaissance the physical nature of the work was perceived by Leonardo da Vinci and others as pulling down the status of sculpture in the arts, though the reputation of Michelangelo perhaps put this long-held idea to rest.

From the [[High Renaissance]] artists such as Michelangelo, [[Leone Leoni]] and [[Giambologna]] could become wealthy, and ennobled, and enter the circle of princes, after a period of sharp argument over the relative status of sculpture and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, 150–151; Blunt&lt;/ref&gt;  Much decorative sculpture on buildings remained a trade, but sculptors producing individual pieces were recognised on a level with painters. From the 18th century or earlier sculpture also attracted middle-class students, although it was slower to do so than painting. Women sculptors took longer to appear than women painters, and were less prominent until the 20th century.

==Anti-sculpture movements==
[[Aniconism]] remained restricted to [[Judaism]], which did not accept figurative sculpture until the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0018_0_17899.html Jewish virtual library, History of Jewish sculpture]&lt;/ref&gt; before expanding to [[Early Christianity]], which initially accepted large sculptures. In Christianity and Buddhism, sculpture became very significant. Christian [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] has never accepted monumental sculpture, and [[Islam]] has consistently rejected nearly all figurative sculpture, except for very small figures in reliefs and some animal figures that fulfill a useful function, like the famous lions supporting a fountain in the [[Alhambra]]. Many forms of [[Protestantism]] also do not approve of religious sculpture. There has been much [[iconoclasm]] of sculpture from religious motives, from the Early Christians, the [[Beeldenstorm]] of the [[Protestant Reformation]] to the 2001 destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the [[Taliban]].

==History of sculpture==

=== Prehistoric periods ===
[[File:Venus-of-Schelklingen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Venus of Hohle Fels]] (also known as the [[Venus of Schelklingen]]; is an [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines|Venus figurine]] [[ivory carving|hewn from ivory]] of a [[mammoth]] [[tusk]] found in 2008 near [[Schelklingen]], [[Germany]]. It is dated to between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago, belonging to the early [[Aurignacian]], at the very beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], which is associated with the assumed earliest presence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' in [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] ([[Cro-Magnon]]). Along with the [[Löwenmensch figurine|Löwenmensch]], it is the oldest undisputed example of [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic art]] and [[figurative art|figurative]] [[prehistoric art]] in general.]]

The earliest undisputed examples of sculpture belong to the [[Aurignacian culture]], which was located in Europe and southwest Asia and active at the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. As well as producing some of the earliest known [[cave art]], the people of this culture developed finely-crafted stone tools, manufacturing pendants, bracelets, ivory beads, and bone-flutes, as well as three-dimensional figurines.&lt;ref&gt;P.Mellars, Archeology and the Dispersal of Modern Humans in Europe: Deconstructing the Aurignacian, ''Evolutionary Anthropology'', vol. 15 (2006), pp. 167–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e75T03MIp3sC&amp;pg=PA211|page=211|title=History of Humanity: Prehistory and the beginnings of civilization|year=1994|author=de Laet, Sigfried J.|publisher=UNESCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 30&amp;nbsp;cm tall [[Löwenmensch figurine|Löwenmensch]] found in the Hohlenstein Stadel area of Germany is an [[anthropomorphic]] lion-man figure carved from [[woolly mammoth]] ivory. It has been dated to about 35–40,000{{nbsp}}BP, making it, along with the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]], the oldest known uncontested example of figurative art.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, J. (2013) ''Ice Age art: arrival of the modern mind'', The British Museum, {{ISBN|978-0714123332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much surviving [[prehistoric art]] is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female [[Venus figurines]] such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]] (24–26,000{{nbsp}}BP) found across central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 8–16, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Swimming Reindeer]] of about 13,000 years ago is one of the finest of a number of [[Magdalenian]] carvings in bone or antler of animals in the [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]], although they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Joachim, "Prehistoric Europe, §II: Palaeolithic 3. Portable art" in [[Oxford Art Online]], accessed August 24, 2012; Sandars, 37–40&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the largest prehistoric sculptures can be found at the [[Trois Frères|Tuc d'Audobert caves]] in France, where around 12–17,000 years ago a masterful sculptor used a spatula-like stone tool and fingers to model a pair of large bison in clay against a limestone rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mBrvazPDFoYC&amp;pg=PT36|title=Gardner’s Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective, Volume 1|page=36|author=Kleiner, Fred|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the beginning of the [[Mesolithic]] in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced,&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 75–80&lt;/ref&gt; and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the [[Gundestrup cauldron]] from the [[European Iron Age]] and the Bronze Age [[Trundholm sun chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 253−257, 183−185&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cylinder seal lions Louvre MNB1167.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|[[Cylinder seal]] with its impression on clay; [[serpopard]]s and eagles, Uruk Period, 4100–3000 BC]]
The [[Protoliterate period]] in [[Mesopotamia]], dominated by [[Uruk]], saw the production of sophisticated works like the [[Warka Vase]] and [[cylinder seal]]s. The [[Guennol Lioness]] is an outstanding small [[limestone]] figure from [[Elam]] of about 3000–2800 BC, part human and part lioness.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 24–37&lt;/ref&gt; A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple [[cult image]]s of the deity, but very few of these have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 45–59&lt;/ref&gt;  Sculptures from the [[Sumer]]ian and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men. Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at [[Ur]] (c. 2650 BC), including the two figures of a ''[[Ram in a Thicket]]'', the ''[[Copper Bull]]'' and a bull's head on one of the [[Lyres of Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 61–66&lt;/ref&gt;

From the many subsequent periods before the ascendency of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in the 10th century BCE Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: [[cylinder seal]]s, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, Chapters 2–5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burney Relief]] is an unusually elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15&amp;nbsp;inches, 50 x 37&amp;nbsp;cm) [[terracotta]] plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions. It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BCE, and may also be moulded.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 110–112&lt;/ref&gt; Stone [[stela]]e, [[votive offering]]s, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 66–74&lt;/ref&gt; the fragmentary [[Stele of the Vultures]] is an early example of the inscribed type,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; and the Assyrian [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]] a large and solid late one.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 66–74; 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire. Unlike earlier states, the Assyrians could use easily carved stone from northern Iraq, and did so in great quantity.  The Assyrians developed a style of extremely [[Assyrian sculpture#Palace reliefs|large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs]] in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the [[British Museum]] has an outstanding collection, including the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' and the [[Lachish relief]]s showing a campaign. They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures of the human-headed [[lamassu]], which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete). Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 141–193&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Art of ancient Egypt|Amarna art}}
The [[monumental sculpture]] of ancient Egypt is world-famous, but refined and delicate small works exist in much greater numbers. The Egyptians used the distinctive technique of [[sunk relief]], which is well suited to very bright sunlight. The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 "fists" to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 33&lt;/ref&gt; This appears as early as the [[Narmer Palette]] from Dynasty I. However, there as elsewhere the convention is not used for minor figures shown engaged in some activity, such as the captives and corpses.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 12–13 and note 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Other conventions make statues of males darker than females ones. Very conventionalized portrait statues appear from as early as Dynasty II, before 2,780 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 21–24&lt;/ref&gt; and with the exception of the [[Amarna art|art of the Amarna period]] of [[Ahkenaten]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 170–178; 192–194&lt;/ref&gt; and some other periods such as Dynasty XII, the idealized features of rulers, like other Egyptian artistic conventions, changed little until after the Greek conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 102–103; 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were always regarded as deities, but other deities are much less common in large statues, except when they represent the pharaoh ''as'' another deity; however the other deities are frequently shown in paintings and reliefs. The famous row of four colossal statues outside the [[Abu Simbel temples|main temple at Abu Simbel]] each show [[Rameses II]], a typical scheme, though here exceptionally large.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 4–5; 208–209&lt;/ref&gt;  Small figures of deities, or their animal personifications, are very common, and found in popular materials such as pottery. Most larger sculpture survives from [[Egyptian temple]]s or tombs; by Dynasty IV (2680–2565 BCE) at the latest the idea of the [[Ka statue]] was firmly established. These were put in tombs as a resting place for the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|''ka'' portion of the soul]], and so we have a good number of less conventionalized statues of well-off administrators and their wives, many in wood as Egypt is one of the few places in the world where the climate allows wood to survive over millennia. The so-called [[reserve head]]s, plain hairless heads, are especially naturalistic. Early tombs also contained small models of the slaves, animals, buildings and objects such as boats necessary for the deceased to continue his lifestyle in the afterworld, and later ''[[Ushabti]]'' figures.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Greece====
[[File:Vognstyreren-fra Delfi2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Charioteer of Delphi]], [[Art in ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[bronze sculpture]], 5th century BCE, close up head detail]]
{{main article|Ancient Greek sculpture}}

The first distinctive style of [[ancient Greek sculpture]] developed in the Early Bronze Age [[Cycladic]] period (3rd millennium BCE), where marble figures, usually female and small, are represented in an elegantly simplified geometrical style. Most typical is a standing pose with arms crossed in front, but other figures are shown in different poses, including a complicated figure of a harpist seated on a chair.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Category:Getty Villa - Harp player - inv. 85.AA.103|images of Getty Villa 85.AA.103]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures developed sculpture further, under influence from Syria and elsewhere, but it is in the later [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] from around 650 BCE that the [[kouros]] developed. These are large standing statues of naked youths, found in temples and tombs, with the [[Kore (sculpture)|kore]] as the clothed female equivalent, with elaborately dressed hair; both have the "[[archaic smile]]". They seem to have served a number of functions, perhaps sometimes representing deities and sometimes the person buried in a grave, as with the [[Kroisos Kouros]]. They are clearly influenced by Egyptian and Syrian styles, but the Greek artists were much more ready to experiment within the style.

During the 6th century Greek sculpture developed rapidly, becoming more naturalistic, and with much more active and varied figure poses in narrative scenes, though still within idealized conventions. Sculptured [[pediment]]s were added to [[Greek temple|temples]], including the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, where the remains of the pediment of around 520 using figures in the round were fortunately used as infill for new buildings after the Persian sack in 480 BCE, and recovered from the 1880s on in fresh unweathered condition. Other significant remains of architectural sculpture come from [[Paestum]] in Italy, [[Corfu]], [[Delphi]] and the [[Temple of Aphaea]] in [[Aegina]] (much now in [[Munich]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 72, 85–109; Boardman, 47–59&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Greek sculpture originally included at least some colour; the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek|Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, has done extensive research and recreation of the original colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glyptoteket.com/about-the-museum/research/|title=Research - Glyptoteket|work=Glyptoteket|access-date=2017-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trackingcolour.com|title=Tracking Colour|website=www.trackingcolour.com|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Classical=====
[[File:South metope 27 Parthenon BM.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|High Classical high relief from the [[Elgin Marbles]], which originally decorated the [[Parthenon]], c. 447–433 BCE]]
There are fewer original remains from the first phase of the Classical period, often called the [[Severe style]]; free-standing statues were now mostly made in bronze, which always had value as scrap. The Severe style lasted from around 500 in reliefs, and soon after 480 in statues, to about 450. The relatively rigid poses of figures relaxed, and asymmetrical turning positions and oblique views became common, and deliberately sought. This was combined with a better understanding of anatomy and the harmonious structure of sculpted figures, and the pursuit of naturalistic representation as an aim, which had not been present before. Excavations at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia]] since 1829 have revealed the largest group of remains, from about 460, of which many are in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 109–119; Boardman, 87–95&lt;/ref&gt;

The "High Classical" period lasted only a few decades from about 450 to 400, but has had a momentous influence on art, and retains a special prestige, despite a very restricted number of original survivals. The best known works are the [[Parthenon Marbles]], traditionally (since [[Plutarch]]) executed by a team led by the most famous ancient Greek sculptor [[Phidias]], active from about 465–425, who was in his own day more famous for his colossal [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine]] [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]] (c. 432), one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], his ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' (438), the cult image of the [[Parthenon]], and ''[[Athena Promachos]]'', a colossal bronze figure that stood next to the Parthenon; all of these are lost but are known from many representations. He is also credited as the creator of some life-size bronze statues known only from later copies whose identification is controversial, including the ''[[Hermes Ludovisi|Ludovisi Hermes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lapatin, Kenneth D. S., ''Phidias'', [[Oxford Art Online]], accessed August 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Classical style continued to develop realism and sophistication in the human figure, and improved the depiction of drapery (clothes), using it to add to the impact of active poses. Facial expressions were usually very restrained, even in combat scenes. The composition of groups of figures in reliefs and on pediments combined complexity and harmony in a way that had a permanent influence on Western art. Relief could be very high indeed, as in the Parthenon illustration below, where most of the leg of the warrior is completely detached from the background, as were the missing parts; relief this high made sculptures more subject to damage.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 119–131&lt;/ref&gt; The Late Classical style developed the free-standing female nude statue, supposedly an innovation of [[Praxiteles]], and developed increasingly complex and subtle poses that were interesting when viewed from a number of angles, as well as more expressive faces; both trends were to be taken much further in the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 131–141&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fregio della gigantomachia 02.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Pergamene style of the Hellenistic period, from the [[Pergamon Altar]], early 2nd century]]

=====Hellenistic=====
The [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]] is conventionally dated from the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, and ending either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in 146 BC or with the final defeat of the last remaining successor-state to Alexander's empire after the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, which also marks the end of [[Republican Rome]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Alexander The Great and the Hellenistic Age, p. xiii. Green P. {{ISBN|978-0-7538-2413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thus much longer than the previous periods, and includes at least two major phases: a "Pergamene" style of experimentation, exuberance and some sentimentality and vulgarity, and in the 2nd century BC a classicising return to a more austere simplicity and elegance; beyond such generalizations dating is typically very uncertain, especially when only later copies are known, as is usually the case. The initial Pergamene style was not especially associated with [[Pergamon]], from which it takes its name, but the very wealthy kings of that state were among the first to collect and also copy Classical sculpture, and also commissioned much new work, including the famous [[Pergamon Altar]] whose sculpture is now mostly in [[Berlin]] and which exemplifies the new style, as do the   [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] (another of the Seven Wonders), the famous ''[[Laocoön and his Sons]]'' in the [[Vatican Museums]], a late example, and the bronze original of ''[[The Dying Gaul]]'' (illustrated at top), which we know was part of a group actually commissioned for Pergamon in about 228 BC, from which the [[Ludovisi Gaul]] was also a copy. The group called the [[Farnese Bull]], possibly a 2nd-century marble original, is still larger and more complex,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 142–156&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tanagra o corinto, figura di donna seduta, 325-150 ac ca. 11.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Small [[Greek terracotta figurines]] were very popular as ornaments in the home]]

Hellenistic sculpture greatly expanded the range of subjects represented, partly as a result of greater general prosperity, and the emergence of a very wealthy class who had large houses decorated with sculpture, although we know that some examples of subjects that seem best suited to the home, such as children with animals, were in fact placed in temples or other public places. For a much more popular home decoration market there were [[Tanagra figurine]]s, and those from other centres where small pottery figures were produced on an industrial scale, some religious but others showing animals and elegantly dressed ladies. Sculptors became more technically skilled in representing facial expressions conveying a wide variety of emotions and the portraiture of individuals, as well representing different ages and races. The reliefs from the Mausoleum are rather atypical in that respect; most work was free-standing, and group compositions with several figures to be seen in the round, like the ''Laocoon'' and the Pergamon group celebrating victory over the Gauls became popular, having been rare before. The [[Barberini Faun]], showing a [[satyr]] sprawled asleep, presumably after drink, is an example of the moral relaxation of the period, and the readiness to create large and expensive sculptures of subjects that fall short of the heroic.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 142–154&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conquests of Alexander [[Hellenistic culture]] was dominant in the courts of most of the Near East, and some of [[Central Asia]], and increasingly being adopted by European elites, especially in Italy, where [[Magna Graecia|Greek colonies]] initially controlled most of the South. Hellenistic art, and artists, spread very widely, and was especially influential in the expanding Roman Republic and when it encountered Buddhism in the easternmost extensions of the Hellenistic area. The massive so-called [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] found in [[Sidon]] in modern [[Lebanon]], was probably made there at the start of the period by expatriate Greek artists for a Hellenized Persian governor.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 155–158&lt;/ref&gt;  The wealth of the period led to a greatly increased production of luxury forms of small sculpture, including [[engraved gem]]s and cameos, jewellery, and gold and silverware.

====Europe after the Greeks====

=====Roman sculpture=====
{{main article|Roman sculpture}}
[[File:26 colonna traiana da estt 05.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Section of [[Trajan's Column]], CE 113, with scenes from the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]]]
Early Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]], themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in [[terracotta]], usually lying on top of a [[sarcophagus]] lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding [[Roman Republic]] began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] far east, official and [[Roman patrician|patrician]] sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 58–63; Hennig, 66-69&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2nd century BCE, "most of the sculptors working at Rome" were Greek,&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 24&lt;/ref&gt; often enslaved in conquests such as that of [[Corinth]] (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66–69; Strong, 36–39, 48; At the trial of [[Verres]], former governor of [[Sicily]], [[Cicero]]'s prosecution details his depredations of art collections at great length.&lt;/ref&gt;

A native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments, which very often featured portrait busts, of prosperous middle-class Romans, and [[Roman portraiture|portraiture]] is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]] or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous bronze head supposedly of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of Italic style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen on coins of the Late Republic, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the [[basilica]]s of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even [[Londinium]] had a near-colossal statue of [[Nero]], though far smaller than the 30 metre high [[Colossus of Nero]] in Rome, now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66–71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ara Pacis Relief Pax.jpg|thumb|left|[[Augustus|Augustan]] state Greco-Roman style on the [[Ara Pacis]], 13 BCE]]

The Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in relief, culminating in the great [[Roman triumphal column]]s with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating [[Trajan's Column|Trajan]] (CE 113) and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] (by 193) survive in Rome, where the [[Ara Pacis]] ("Altar of Peace", 13 BCE) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined. Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the [[Arch of Constantine]] and the base of the [[Column of Antoninus Pius]] (161),&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 73–82;Strong, 48–52, 80–83, 108–117, 128–132, 141–159, 177–182, 197–211&lt;/ref&gt; [[Campana relief]]s were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus. All forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver [[Warren Cup]], glass [[Lycurgus Cup]], and large cameos like the [[Gemma Augustea]], [[Gonzaga Cameo]] and the "[[Great Cameo of France]]".&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 6; Strong, 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;  For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of [[Ancient Roman pottery|pottery vessels]] and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving through a late 2nd-century "baroque" phase,&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 171–176, 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace. The contrast is famously illustrated in the [[Arch of Constantine]] of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with [[roundel]]s in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the ''[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|Four Tetrarchs]]'' (c. 305) from the new capital of [[Constantinople]], now in [[Venice]]. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] found in both monuments the same "stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity — in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 9 (both quotes), more generally his Ch 1; Strong, 250–257, 264–266, 272–280&lt;/ref&gt;

This revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which [[Christianity]] was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors. However, rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the [[consular diptych]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 287–291, 305–308, 315–318; Henig, 234–240&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Early Medieval and Byzantine=====
[[File:St Ninian's Isle TreasureDSCF6209det.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Silver monster on a [[chape]], Scottish or Anglo-Saxon, [[St Ninian's Isle Treasure]], c. 800?]]
[[File:Gerokreuz full 20050903.jpg|thumb|The [[Gero Cross]], c. 965–970, [[Cologne, Germany]]]]
The [[Early Christian]]s were opposed to monumental religious sculpture, though continuing Roman traditions in portrait busts and [[sarcophagus]] reliefs, as well as smaller objects such as the consular diptych. Such objects, often in valuable materials, were also the main sculptural traditions (as far as is known) of the [[barbaric civilization]]s of the [[Migration period]], as seen in the objects found in the 6th-century burial treasure at [[Sutton Hoo]], and the jewellery of [[Scythian art]] and the hybrid Christian and [[animal style]] productions of [[Insular art]]. Following the continuing Byzantine tradition, [[Carolingian art]] revived ivory carving, often in panels for the [[treasure binding]]s of grand [[illuminated manuscript]]s, as well as [[crozier]] heads and other small fittings.

[[Byzantine art]], though producing superb ivory reliefs and architectural decorative carving, never returned to monumental sculpture, or even much small sculpture in the round.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 12, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the West during the [[Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian]] periods there was the beginnings of a production of monumental statues, in courts and major churches. This gradually spread; by the late 10th and 11th century there are records of several apparently life-size sculptures in [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] churches, probably of precious metal around a wooden frame, like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]]. No Anglo-Saxon example has survived,&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; and survivals of large non-architectural sculpture from before 1,000 are exceptionally rare. Much the finest is the [[Gero Cross]], of 965–70, which is a [[crucifix]], which was evidently the commonest type of sculpture; [[Charlemagne]] had set one up in the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] around 800. These continued to grow in popularity, especially in Germany and Italy. The [[rune stone]]s of the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] world, the [[Pictish stone]]s of [[Scotland]] and possibly the [[high cross]] reliefs of Christian Great Britain, were northern sculptural traditions that bridged the period of Christianization.

=====Romanesque=====
[[File:Braunschweiger Loewe Original Brunswick Lion.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Brunswick Lion]], 1166, the first large hollow casting of a figure since antiquity, 1.78 metres tall and 2.79 metres long]]
{{main article|Romanesque art}}
From about 1000 there was a general rebirth of artistic production in all Europe, led by general economic growth in production and commerce, and the new style of [[Romanesque art]] was the first medieval style to be used in the whole of Western Europe. The new cathedrals and pilgrim's churches were increasingly decorated with architectural stone reliefs, and new focuses for sculpture developed, such as the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over church doors in the 12th century, and the inhabited [[Capital (architecture)#Romanesque and Gothic capitals|capital]] with figures and often narrative scenes. Outstanding abbey churches with sculpture include in France [[Abbey of la Madaleine, Vézelay|Vézelay]] and [[Moissac Abbey|Moissac]] and in Spain [[Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos|Silos]].&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 79–80; 90–102&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanesque art was characterised by a very vigorous style in both sculpture and painting. The capitals of columns were never more exciting than in this period, when they were often carved with complete scenes with several figures.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 107–114&lt;/ref&gt;  The large wooden [[crucifix]] was a German innovation right at the start of the period, as were free-standing statues of the enthroned Madonna, but the [[high relief]] was above all the sculptural mode of the period. Compositions usually had little depth, and needed to be flexible to squeeze themselves into the shapes of capitals, and church typanums; the tension between a tightly enclosing frame, from which the composition sometimes escapes, is a recurrent theme in Romanesque art. Figures still often varied in size in relation to their importance portraiture hardly existed.

Objects in precious materials such as ivory and metal had a very high status in the period, much more so than monumental sculpture — we know the names of more makers of these than painters, illuminators or architect-masons. Metalwork, including decoration in [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], became very sophisticated, and many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the [[Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral]] by [[Nicholas of Verdun]]. The bronze [[Gloucester candlestick]] and the [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|brass font of 1108–17 now in Liège]] are superb examples, very different in style, of metal casting, the former highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic. The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hildesheim|Hildesheim Cathedral]], the [[Gniezno Doors]], and the doors of the [[Basilica di San Zeno]] in [[Verona]] are other substantial survivals. The [[aquamanile]], a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century, and often took fantastic [[zoomorphic]] forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass. Many wax impressions from impressive seals survive on charters and documents, although Romanesque coins are generally not of great aesthetic interest.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 115–132&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cloisters Cross]] is an unusually large [[ivory]] [[crucifix]], with complex carving including many figures of [[prophet]]s and others, which has been attributed to one of the relatively few artists whose name is known, [[Master Hugo]], who also illuminated manuscripts. Like many pieces it was originally partly coloured. The [[Lewis chessmen]] are well-preserved examples of small ivories, of which many pieces or fragments remain from [[crozier]]s, plaques, [[pectoral cross]]es and similar objects.

===== Gothic =====
{{main article|Gothic art}}
[[File:Vierge a l'Enfant debout.jpg|thumb|French ivory Virgin and Child, end of 13th century, 25 cm high, curving to fit the shape of the ivory tusk]]

The Gothic period is essentially defined by [[Gothic architecture]], and does not entirely fit with the development of style in sculpture in either its start or finish. The facades of large churches, especially around doors, continued to have large typanums, but also rows of sculpted figures spreading around them. The statues on the Western (Royal) Portal at [[Chartres Cathedral]] (c. 1145) show an elegant but exaggerated columnar elongation, but those on the south [[transept]] portal, from 1215 to 1220, show a more naturalistic style and increasing detachment from the wall behind, and some awareness of the classical tradition. These trends were continued in the west portal at [[Rheims Cathedral]] of a few years later, where the figures are almost in the round, as became usual as Gothic spread across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 297–300; Henderson, 55, 82-84&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy [[Nicola Pisano]] (1258–78) and his son [[Giovanni Pisano|Giovanni]] developed a style that is often called [[Proto-Renaissance]], with unmistakable influence from Roman sarcophagi and sophisticated and crowded compositions, including a sympathetic handling of nudity, in relief panels on their [[Pulpit (Siena Cathedral)|pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265–68)]], the [[Fontana Maggiore]] in [[Perugia]], and Giovanni's [[Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea, Pistoia|pulpit in Pistoia]] of 1301.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 11–24; Honour and Fleming, 304; Henderson, 41&lt;/ref&gt;  Another revival of classical style is seen in the [[International Gothic]] work of [[Claus Sluter]] and his followers in [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]] and [[Flanders]] around 1400.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 65-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Late Gothic sculpture continued in the North, with a fashion for very large wooden sculpted altarpieces with increasingly virtuoso carving and large numbers agitated expressive figures; most surviving examples are in Germany, after much iconoclasm elsewhere. [[Tilman Riemenschneider]], [[Veit Stoss]] and others continued the style well into the 16th century, gradually absorbing Italian Renaissance influences.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 305-311&lt;/ref&gt;

Life-size tomb effigies in stone or [[alabaster]] became popular for the wealthy, and grand multi-level tombs evolved, with the [[Scaliger Tombs]] of [[Verona]] so large they had to be moved outside the church. By the 15th century there was an industry exporting [[Nottingham alabaster]] altar reliefs in groups of panels over much of Europe for economical parishes who could not afford stone retables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/bbchistory/object_text07.htm][[V&amp;A Museum]]&lt;span&gt; feature on the Nottingham alabaster &lt;/span&gt;''Swansea Altarpiece''&lt;/ref&gt;  Small carvings, for a mainly lay and often female market, became a considerable industry in Paris and some other centres. Types of ivories included small devotional [[polyptych]]s, [[Virgin and Child from the Sainte-Chapelle|single figures, especially of the Virgin]], mirror-cases, combs, and [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|elaborate caskets with scenes from Romances]], used as engagement presents.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 193-198&lt;/ref&gt;  The very wealthy collected extravagantly elaborate jewelled and enamelled metalwork, both secular and religious, like the [[Duc de Berry]]'s [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], until they ran short of money, when they were melted down again for cash.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, 25-48; Henderson, 134-141&lt;/ref&gt;

====Renaissance====

[[Renaissance sculpture]] proper is often taken to begin with the famous competition for the doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]] in 1403, from which the trial models submitted by the winner, [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] survive. Ghiberti's doors are still in place, but were undoubtedly eclipsed by his second pair for the other entrance, the so-called "Gates of Paradise", which took him from 1425 to 1452, and are dazzlingly confident classicizing compositions with varied depths of relief allowing extensive backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 41–46, 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; The intervening years had seen Ghiberti's early assistant [[Donatello]] develop with seminal statues including his ''[[David (Donatello)|Davids]]'' in marble (1408–09) and bronze (1440s), and his [[Equestrian statue of Gattamelata]], as well as reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 45–52, and see index&lt;/ref&gt; A leading figure in the later period was [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], best known for his [[equestrian statue]] of [[Bartolomeo Colleoni]] in Venice;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 114–118, 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; his pupil [[Leonardo da Vinci]] designed an equine sculpture in 1482 ''[[Leonardo's horse|The Horse]]'' for [[Milan]]-but only succeeded in making a {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=on}} clay model which was destroyed by French archers in 1499, and his other ambitious sculptural plans were never completed.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

The period was marked by a great increase in patronage of sculpture by the state for public art and by the wealthy for their homes; especially in Italy, public sculpture remains a crucial element in the appearance of historic city centres. Church sculpture mostly moved inside just as outside public monuments became common. Portrait sculpture, usually in busts, became popular in Italy around 1450, with the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Francesco Laurana]] specializing in young women in meditative poses, while [[Antonio Rossellino]] and others more often depicted knobbly-faced men of affairs, but also young children.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 103–110, 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;  The portrait [[medal]] invented by [[Pisanello]] also often depicted women; relief [[plaquette]]s were another new small form of sculpture in cast metal.

Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Pieta (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]'', and pieces for the [[Tomb of Pope Julius II]] and [[Medici Chapel]] could not be ignored by subsequent sculptors. His iconic David (1504) has a ''[[contrapposto]]'' pose, borrowed from classical sculpture. It differs from previous representations of the subject in that David is depicted before his battle with Goliath and not after the giant's defeat. Instead of being shown victorious, as Donatello and Verocchio had done, David looks tense and battle ready.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Chapter 8, 179–181&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mannerist====

{{main article|Mannerism}}
As in painting, early Italian [[Mannerist]] sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the [[High Renaissance]], which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence, next to Michelangelo's ''David''. [[Baccio Bandinelli]] took over the project of ''[[Hercules and Cacus]]'' from the master himself, but it was little more popular than it is now, and maliciously compared by [[Benvenuto Cellini]] to "a sack of melons", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the [[pedestal]] of statues. Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 179–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellini's bronze ''[[Perseus with the head of Medusa]]'' is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, but is indeed mannered compared to the ''David''s of Michelangelo and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 183–187&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel [[Cellini Salt Cellar|Salt Cellar]] (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;  As these examples show, the period extended the range of secular subjects for large works beyond portraits, with mythological figures especially favoured; previously these had mostly been found in small works.

Small bronze figures for collector's [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which [[Giambologna]], originally [[Flemish]] but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century, also creating life-size sculptures, of which two joined the collection in the Piazza della Signoria.

[[File:Apollo and Daphne (Bernini).jpg|thumb|[[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], ''[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]'' in the [[Galleria Borghese]], 1622–1625]]
In Baroque sculpture, groups of figures assumed new importance, and there was a dynamic movement and energy of human forms— they spiralled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space. Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles, and reflected a general continuation of the Renaissance move away from the relief to sculpture created in the round, and designed to be placed in the middle of a large space – elaborate fountains such as Bernini's [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] (Rome, 1651), or those in the [[Gardens of Versailles]] were a Baroque speciality. The [[Baroque]] style was perfectly suited to sculpture, with [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] the dominating figure of the age in works such as ''[[The Ecstasy of St Theresa]]'' (1647–1652).&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, 134-142 on the [[Cornaro chapel]]; see index for Bernini generally&lt;/ref&gt; Much Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water fountains, or fused sculpture and architecture to create a transformative experience for the viewer. Artists saw themselves as in the classical tradition, but admired [[Hellenistic]] and later Roman sculpture, rather than that of the more "Classical" periods as they are seen today.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestant Reformation]] brought an almost total stop to religious sculpture in much of Northern Europe, and though secular sculpture, especially for portrait busts and [[tomb monument]]s, continued, the [[Dutch Golden Age]] has no significant sculptural component outside goldsmithing.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 450&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly in direct reaction, sculpture was as prominent in [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholicism]] as in the late Middle Ages. Statues of rulers and the nobility became increasingly popular. In the 18th century much sculpture continued on Baroque lines – the [[Trevi Fountain]] was only completed in 1762. [[Rococo]] style was better suited to smaller works, and arguably found its ideal sculptural form in [[Ceramic art#Porcelain|early European porcelain]], and interior decorative schemes in wood or plaster such as those in French domestic interiors and [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches#Rococo|Austrian and Bavarian pilgrimage churches]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 460-467&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neoclassical sculpture|Neoclassical style]] that arrived in the late 18th century gave great emphasis to sculpture. [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]] exemplifies the penetrating portrait sculpture the style could produce, and [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes the idealist aspect of the movement. The Neoclassical period was one of the great ages of public sculpture, though its "classical" prototypes were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. In sculpture, the most familiar representatives are the Italian [[Antonio Canova]], the Englishman [[John Flaxman]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. The European neoclassical manner also took hold in the United States, where its pinnacle occurred somewhat later and is exemplified in the sculptures of [[Hiram Powers]].

====Greco-Buddhist sculpture and Asia====
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|[[Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)|One of the first representations]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], 1st–2nd century CE, [[Gandhara]]]]
{{main article|Greco-Buddhist art}}

[[Greco-Buddhist art]] is the artistic manifestation of [[Greco-Buddhism]], a cultural [[syncretism]] between the [[Ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] culture and [[Buddhism]], which developed over a period of close to 1000 years in [[Central Asia]], between the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests of Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BCE, and the [[Islam]]ic conquests of the 7th century CE. Greco-Buddhist art is characterized by the strong idealistic realism of Hellenistic art and the first representations of the Buddha in human form, which have helped define the artistic (and particularly, sculptural) canon for Buddhist art throughout the Asian continent up to the present. Though dating is uncertain, it appears that strongly Hellenistic styles lingered in the East for several centuries after they had declined around the Mediterranean, as late as the 5th century CE. Some aspects of Greek art were adopted while others did not spread beyond the Greco-Buddhist area; in particular the standing figure, often with a relaxed pose and one leg flexed, and the flying cupids or victories, who became popular across Asia as [[apsara]]s. Greek foliage decoration was also influential, with Indian versions of the [[Corinthian capital]] appearing.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 370–378; Harle, 71–84&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of Greco-Buddhist art are to be found in the Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] (250 BCE – 130 BCE), located in today’s [[Afghanistan]], from which Hellenistic culture radiated into the [[Indian subcontinent]] with the establishment of the small [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] (180 BCE-10 BCE). Under the [[Indo-Greeks]] and then the [[Kushan]]s, the interaction of Greek and Buddhist culture flourished in the area of [[Gandhara]], in today’s northern [[Pakistan]], before spreading further into India, influencing the art of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and then the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art of the [[Gupta empire]], which was to extend to the rest of South-East Asia. The influence of Greco-Buddhist art also spread northward towards [[Central Asia]], strongly affecting the art of the [[Tarim Basin]] and the [[Dunhuang Caves]], and ultimately the sculpted figure in China, Korea, and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 370–378; Sickman, 85–90; Paine, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
{{Main article|Chinese art|Chinese ceramics|Lacquerware|Chinese jade}}
[[File:Guanyin 00.jpg|thumb|Seated [[Bodhisattva]] [[Guanyin]], wood and pigment, 11th century, [[Northern Song dynasty]].]]
[[Chinese ritual bronzes]] from the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou Dynasty|Western Zhou Dynasties]] come from a period of over a thousand years from c. 1500 BC, and have exerted a continuing influence over [[Chinese art]]. They are cast with complex patterned and [[zoomorphic]] decoration, but avoid the human figure, unlike the huge figures only recently discovered at [[Sanxingdui]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapter 1, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;  The spectacular [[Terracotta Army]] was assembled for the tomb of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[emperor]] of a unified China from 221–210 BCE, as a grand imperial version of the figures long placed in tombs to enable the deceased to enjoy the same lifestyle in the afterlife as when alive, replacing actual sacrifices of very early periods. Smaller figures in pottery or wood were placed in tombs for many centuries afterwards, reaching a peak of quality in [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 138-138&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition of unusually large pottery figures persisted in China, through Tang [[sancai]] tomb figures to later Buddhist statues such as the near life-size set of [[Yixian glazed pottery luohans]] and later figures for temples and tombs.  These came to replace earlier equivalents in wood.

Native Chinese religions do not usually use cult images of deities, or even represent them, and large religious sculpture is nearly all Buddhist, dating mostly from the 4th to the 14th century, and initially using Greco-Buddhist models arriving via the [[Silk Road]]. Buddhism is also the context of all large portrait sculpture; in total contrast to some other areas, in medieval China even painted images of the emperor were regarded as private. Imperial tombs have spectacular avenues of approach lined with real and mythological animals on a scale matching Egypt, and smaller versions decorate temples and palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 135–145; 145–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Small Buddhist figures and groups were produced to a very high quality in a range of media,&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 163–165&lt;/ref&gt; as was relief decoration of all sorts of objects, especially in metalwork and [[Chinese jade|jade]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapters 4 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;  In the earlier periods, large quantities of sculpture were cut from the living rock in pilgrimage cave-complexes, and as outside [[rock reliefs]].  These were mostly originally painted.  In notable contrast to [[Scholar-official|literati]] painters, sculptors of all sorts were regarded as artisans and very few names are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 135&lt;/ref&gt;  From the [[Ming dynasty]] onwards, statuettes of religious and secular figures were produced in [[Chinese porcelain]] and other media, which became an important export.

====Japan====
{{see also|Japanese art|Japanese sculpture|List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)}}
[[File:NaraTodaijiDaibutsu0212.jpg|thumb|[[Tōdai-ji|Nara Daibutsu]], c. 752, [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]]]]
Towards the end of the long [[Neolithic]] [[Jōmon period]], some [[Jōmon pottery|pottery vessels]] were "flame-rimmed" with extravagant extensions to the rim that can only be called sculptural,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbz.or.jp/eng/middlejomon.htm Middle Jomon Sub-Period] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525100233/http://www.nbz.or.jp/eng/middlejomon.htm |date=2009-05-25 }}, Niigata Prefectural Museum of History, accessed August 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and very stylized pottery [[dogū]] figures were produced, many with the characteristic "snow-goggle" eyes. During the Kofun period of the 3rd to 6th century CE, [[haniwa]] terracotta figures of humans and animals in a simplistic style were erected outside important tombs. The arrival of Buddhism in the 6th century brought with it sophisticated traditions in sculpture, Chinese styles mediated via Korea. The 7th-century [[Hōryū-ji]] and its contents have survived more intact than any East Asian Buddhist temple of its date, with works including a ''Shaka Trinity'' of 623 in bronze, showing the historical Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas and also the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Guardian Kings of the Four Directions]].&lt;ref&gt;Paine &amp; Soper, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The wooden image (9th century) of Shakyamuni, the "historic" Buddha, enshrined in a secondary building at the [[Murō-ji]], is typical of the early [[Heian period|Heian]] sculpture, with its ponderous body, covered by thick drapery folds carved in the hompa-shiki (rolling-wave) style, and its austere, withdrawn facial expression. The [[Kei school]] of sculptors, particularly [[Unkei]], created a new, more realistic style of sculpture.

Almost all subsequent significant large sculpture in Japan was Buddhist, with some [[Shinto]] equivalents, and after Buddhism declined in Japan in the 15th century, monumental sculpture became largely architectural decoration and less significant.&lt;ref&gt;Paine &amp; Soper, 121&lt;/ref&gt;  However sculptural work in the decorative arts was developed to a remarkable level of technical achievement and refinement in small objects such as [[inro]] and [[netsuke]] in many materials, and metal ''tosogu'' or [[Japanese sword mountings]]. In the 19th century there were export industries of small bronze sculptures of extreme virtuosity, ivory and porcelain figurines, and other types of small sculpture, increasingly emphasizing technical accomplishment.

[[File:Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi.jpg|thumb|Hindu [[Gupta]] [[terracotta]] relief, 5th century CE, of [[Krishna]] Killing the Horse Demon Keshi]]

The first known [[sculpture in the Indian subcontinent]] is from the [[Indus Valley civilization]] (3300–1700 BC), found in sites at [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]] in modern-day [[Pakistan]]. These include the famous small bronze female dancer. However, such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted. After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from [[Daimabad]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin, relative to other cultures, and the development of Indian civilization, relatively late, with the reign of [[Asoka]] from 270 to 232 BCE, and the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;  Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all [[Sanchi]]; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood that also embraced [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Harle, 26–38"&gt;Harle, 26–38&lt;/ref&gt;

The pink sandstone Hindu, [[Jain]] and Buddhist sculptures of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture.&lt;ref name="Harle, 26–38"/&gt;  The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. 320-550) which remains a "classical" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier [[Ellora Caves]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 87; his Part 2 covers the period&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Elephanta Caves]] are probably slightly later.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Later large-scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and [[yakshi]] often have sensuously curving poses. Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief. The celebrated bronzes of the [[Chola]] dynasty (c. 850–1250) from [[south India]], many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of [[Shiva]] as [[Nataraja]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 301-310, 325-327&lt;/ref&gt; with the massive granite carvings of [[Mahabalipuram]] dating from the previous [[Pallava]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 276–284&lt;/ref&gt;

====South-East Asia====
[[File:Linteau Musée Guimet 1097 01.jpg|thumb|9th-century Khmer [[lintel]]]]
The sculpture of the region tends to be characterised by a high degree of ornamentation, as seen in the great monuments of Hindu and Buddhist [[Khmer sculpture]] (9th to 13th centuries) at [[Angkor Wat]] and elsewhere, the enormous 9th-century Buddhist complex at [[Borobudur]] in [[Java]], and the Hindu monuments of [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 196–200&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these include many reliefs as well as figures in the round; Borobudur has 2,672 relief panels, 504 Buddha statues, many semi-concealed in openwork [[stupa]]s, and many large guardian figures.

In [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], sculpture was mainly of [[Iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand|Buddha images]], often gilded, both large for temples and monasteries, and small figurines for private homes. Traditional sculpture in [[Myanmar]] emerged before the [[Pagan Kingdom|Bagan period]]. As elsewhere in the region, most of the wood sculptures of the Bagan and Ava periods have been lost. In later periods Chinese influence predominated in [[Vietnam]], Laos and [[Cambodia]], and more wooden sculpture survives from across the region.

===Islam===
[[File:Panel hunters Louvre OA 6265-1.jpg|thumb|Ivory with traces of paint, 11th–12th century, Egypt]]

[[Islam]] is [[Aniconism in Islam|famously aniconic]], so the vast majority of sculpture is [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] decoration in relief or openwork, based on vegetable motifs, but tending to geometrical abstract forms. In the very early [[Mshatta Facade]] (740s), now mostly in [[Berlin]], there are animals within the dense arabesques in high relief, and figures of animals and men in mostly low relief are found in conjunction with decoration on many later pieces in various materials, including metalwork, ivory and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky and Rogers, 23, 26-27, 33-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures of animals in the round were often acceptable for works used in private contexts if the object was clearly practical, so medieval Islamic art contains many metal animals that are [[aquamanile]]s, [[incense]] burners or supporters for fountains, as in the stone lions supporting the famous one in the [[Alhambra]], culminating in the largest medieval Islamic animal figure known, the [[Pisa Griffin]]. In the same way, luxury [[hardstone carving]]s such as dagger hilts and cups may be formed as animals, especially in [[Mughal art]]. The degree of acceptability of such relaxations of strict Islamic rules varies between periods and regions, with [[Islamic Spain]], Persia and India often leading relaxation, and is typically highest in courtly contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky and Rogers, 23, 33-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, with the exception of some monumental Egyptian sculpture, most African sculpture was created in wood and other organic materials that have not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago; older pottery figures are found from a number of areas. [[Traditional African masks|Masks]] are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized. There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among "groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the [[Niger]] and [[Congo river]]s" in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="Honour &amp; Fleming, 557"&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 557&lt;/ref&gt;  Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for religious ceremonies; today many are made for tourists as "airport art".&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 559–561&lt;/ref&gt;  African masks were an influence on European [[Modernism|Modernist]] art, which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction.

The [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Kush]] in modern [[Sudan]] was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles to the north. In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the [[Nok culture]] which thrived between 500 BC and 500 AD in modern [[Nigeria]], with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes. Later West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs to decorate palaces like the famous [[Benin Bronzes]], and very fine naturalistic royal heads from around the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] town of [[Ife]] in terracotta and metal from the 12th–14th centuries. [[Akan goldweights]] are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400–1900, some apparently representing [[proverb]]s and so with a narrative element rare in African sculpture, and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 556–561&lt;/ref&gt;

Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The [[Mandé peoples|Mande]]-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces of wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs are shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.

Populations in the [[African Great Lakes]] are not known for their sculpture.&lt;ref name="Honour &amp; Fleming, 557"/&gt; However, one style from the region is pole sculptures, carved in human shapes and decorated with geometric forms, while the tops are carved with figures of animals, people, and various objects. These poles are, then, placed next to graves and are associated with death and the ancestral world. The culture known from [[Great Zimbabwe]] left more impressive buildings than sculpture but the eight [[soapstone]] [[Zimbabwe Bird]]s appear to have had a special significance and were mounted on [[monolith]]s. Modern [[Zimbabwe]]an sculptors in soapstone have achieved [[Sculpture of Zimbabwe|considerable international success]]. Southern Africa’s oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 AD and have cylindrical heads with a mixture of human and animal features.

====Ethiopia and Eritrea====
{{further information|Ethiopian art|Lalibela Cross}}

The creation of sculptures in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] can be traced back to its ancient past with the kingdoms of [[Dʿmt]] and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]]. [[Christian art]] was established in Ethiopia with the conversion from [[Traditional African religions|paganism]] to [[Religion in Ethiopia|Christianity]] in the 4th century AD, during the reign of king [[Ezana of Axum]].&lt;ref&gt;De Lorenzi (2015), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian imagery decorated churches during the Asksumite period and later eras.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (2015), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, at [[Lalibela]], life-size [[Christian saints|saints]] were carved into the Church of Bet Golgotha; by tradition these were made during the reign of the [[Zagwe dynasty|Zagwe]] ruler [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]] in the 12th century, but they were more likely crafted in the 15th century during the [[Solomonic dynasty]].&lt;ref name="briggs 2015 p331"&gt;Briggs (2015), p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela]], one of several examples of [[rock cut architecture]] at Lalibela containing intricate carvings, was built in the 10th-13th centuries as proven by archaeology.&lt;ref name="sobania 2012 p.462"&gt;Sobania (2012), p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sudan====
{{further|Nubian pyramids}}
In [[History of Sudan|ancient Sudan]], the development of sculpture stretches from the simple pottery of the [[Kerma culture]] beginning around 2500 BC to the monumental statuary and architecture of the [[Meroitic Empire|Kingdom of Kush]], its last phase—the [[Meroitic period]]—ending around 350 AD (with its conquest by Ethiopia's Aksum).&lt;ref name="harkless 2006 174"&gt;Harkless (2006), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.mfa.org/collections/ancient-world/tour/nubian-art Nubian Art]". [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. Accessed 28 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond pottery items, the Kerma culture also made furniture that contained sculptures, such as gold cattle hoofs as the legs of beds.&lt;ref name="harkless 2006 174"/&gt; Sculpture during the Kingdom of Kush included full-sized statues (especially of kings and queens), smaller figurines (most commonly depicting royal servants), and reliefs in stone, which were influenced by the contemporary ancient Egyptian sculptural tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Harkless (2006), pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;March 2011.

===The Americas===
{{see also|Sculpture of the United States|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Pre-Columbian art|Northwest Coast art|Inuit art}}
Sculpture in what is now Latin America developed in two separate and distinct areas, [[Mesoamerica]] in the north and [[Peru]] in the south. In both areas, sculpture was initially of stone, and later of [[terracotta]] and metal as the civilizations in these areas became more technologically proficient.&lt;ref&gt;Castedo, Leopoldo, ''A History of Latin American Art and architecture'', Frederick A. Praeger, Publisher, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mesoamerican region]] produced more monumental sculpture, from the massive block-like works of the [[Olmec]] and [[Toltec]] cultures, to the superb low [[relief]]s that characterize the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Aztec]] cultures. In the Andean region, sculptures were typically small, but often show superb skill.

{{anchor|North America}}
In North America, wood was sculpted for [[totem poles]], masks, utensils, [[War canoe]]s and a variety of other uses, with distinct variation between different cultures and regions. The most developed styles are those of the [[Northwest Coast art|Pacific Northwest Coast]], where a group of elaborate and highly stylized formal styles developed forming the basis of a tradition that continues today. In addition to the famous totem poles, painted and carved [[longhouse|house fronts]] were complemented by carved posts inside and out, as well as mortuary figures and other items. Among the [[Inuit]] of the far north, traditional carving styles in ivory and soapstone are still continued.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 553–556&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of European Catholic culture readily adapted local skills to the prevailing [[Baroque]] style, producing enormously elaborate [[retablo]]s and other mostly church sculptures in a variety of hybrid styles.&lt;ref&gt;Neumeyer, Alfred, ''The Indian Contribution to Architectural Decoration in Spanish Colonial America''. ''The Art Bulletin'', June 1948, Volume XXX, Number two&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of such examples in Canada is the altar area of the [[Notre-Dame Basilica (Montreal)|Notre Dame Basilica]] in Montreal, Quebec, which was carved by peasant ''[[habitant]]'' labourers. Later, artists trained in the Western academic tradition followed European styles until in the late 19th century they began to draw again on indigenous influences, notably in the Mexican baroque grotesque style known as [[Churrigueresque]]. Aboriginal peoples also adapted church sculpture in variations on [[Carpenter Gothic]]; one famous example is the ''Church of the Holy Cross'' in [[Skookumchuck Hot Springs, British Columbia]].

The history of [[Sculpture of the United States|sculpture in the United States]] after Europeans' arrival reflects the country's 18th-century foundation in [[Roman empire|Roman]] republican civic values and [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]]. Compared to areas colonized by the Spanish, sculpture got off to an extremely slow start in the British colonies, with next to no place in churches, and was only given impetus by the need to assert nationality after independence. American sculpture of the mid- to late-19th century was often classical, often romantic, but showed a bent for a dramatic, narrative, almost journalistic realism. Public buildings during the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century often provided an architectural setting for sculpture, especially in relief. By the 1930s the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture and design and [[art deco]] characterized by the work of [[Paul Manship]] and [[Lee Lawrie]] and others became popular. By the 1950s, traditional sculpture education would almost be completely replaced by a [[Bauhaus]]-influenced concern for [[Abstract art|abstract]] design. [[Minimalist]] sculpture replaced the figure in public settings and architects almost completely stopped using sculpture in or on their designs. Modern sculptors (21st century) use both classical and abstract inspired designs. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a swing back toward figurative public sculpture; by 2000, many of the new public pieces in the United States were figurative in design.

Modern classicism contrasted in many ways with the classical sculpture of the 19th century which was characterized by commitments to naturalism ([[Antoine-Louis Barye]])—the melodramatic ([[François Rude]]) sentimentality ([[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]])-- or a kind of stately grandiosity ([[Lord Leighton]]). Several different directions in the classical tradition were taken as the century turned, but the study of the live model and the post-Renaissance tradition was still fundamental to them.
[[Auguste Rodin]] was the most renowned European sculptor of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert E. (2003). ''Rodin's Art: The Rodin Collection of the Iris &amp; Gerald B. Cantor Center for the Visual Arts''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513381-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psmuseum.org/exhibitions/upcoming_exhibition_new.php ''Rodin to Now: Modern Sculpture'', Palm Springs Desert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; He is often considered a sculptural [[Impressionist]], as are his students including [[Camille Claudel]], and [[Hugo Rheinhold]], attempting to model of a fleeting moment of ordinary life.
Modern classicism showed a lesser interest in naturalism and a greater interest in formal stylization. Greater attention was paid to the rhythms of volumes and spaces—as well as greater attention to the contrasting qualities of surface (open, closed, planar, broken etc.) while less attention was paid to story-telling and convincing details of anatomy or costume. Greater attention was given to psychological effect than to physical realism, and influences from earlier styles worldwide were used.

Early masters of modern classicism included: [[Aristide Maillol]], [[Alexander Matveyev]], [[Joseph Bernard]], [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[Georg Kolbe]], [[Libero Andreotti]], [[Gustav Vigeland]], [[Jan Stursa]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. As the century progressed, modern classicism was adopted as the national style of the two great European totalitarian empires: [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], who co-opted the work of earlier artists such as Kolbe and [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]] in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Penelpoe, ''Taking Positions: Figurative Sculpture and the Third Reich'', Henry Moore Institute, London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and Matveyev in Russia. Over the 70 years of the USSR, new generations of sculptors were trained and chosen within their system, and a distinct style, [[socialist realism]], developed, that returned to the 19th century's emphasis on melodrama and naturalism.

Classical training was rooted out of art education in Western Europe (and the Americas) by 1970 and the classical variants of the 20th century were marginalized in the history of modernism. But classicism continued as the foundation of art education in the Soviet academies until 1990, providing a foundation for expressive figurative art throughout eastern Europe and parts of the Middle East. By the year 2000, the European classical tradition retains a wide appeal to the public but awaits an educational tradition to revive its contemporary development.

Some of the modern classical became either more decorative/art deco ([[Paul Manship]], [[Jose de Creeft]], [[Carl Milles]]) or more abstractly stylized or more expressive (and Gothic) ([[Anton Hanak]], [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]], [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Arturo Martini]])—or turned more to the Renaissance ([[Giacomo Manzù]], [[Venanzo Crocetti]]) or stayed the same ([[Charles Despiau]], [[Marcel Gimond]]).

In the early days of the 20th century, [[Pablo Picasso]] revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his ''constructions'' fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; the sculptural equivalent of the [[collage]] in two-dimensional art. The advent of [[Surrealism]] led to things occasionally being described as "sculpture" that would not have been so previously, such as "involuntary sculpture" in several senses, including [[coulage]]. In later years Picasso became a prolific [[pottery|potter]], leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of [[ceramic art]], with figures such as [[George E. Ohr]] and subsequently [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Kenneth Price]], and [[Robert Arneson]]. [[Marcel Duchamp]] originated the use of the "[[found object]]" (French: objet trouvé) or ''readymade'' with pieces such as ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917).

Similarly, the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late-19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his ''[[Bird in Space]]'' series (1924).&lt;ref&gt;Visual arts in the 20th century, Author Edward Lucie-Smith, Edition illustrated, Publisher Harry N. Abrams, 1997, Original from the University of Michigan, {{ISBN|978-0-8109-3934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as [[Gaston Lachaise]], [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Serrano]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists, Author Ann Lee Morgan, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2007, Original from the University of Michigan,{{ISBN|0-19-512878-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by [[Alexander Calder]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jean Tinguely]], and [[Frederick Kiesler]] who were pioneers of [[Kinetic art]].

Modernist sculptors largely missed out on the huge boom in public art resulting from the demand for [[war memorial]]s for the two World Wars, but from the 1950s the public and commissioning bodies became more comfortable with Modernist sculpture and large public commissions both abstract and figurative became common. Picasso was commissioned to make a [[maquette]] for a huge {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}}-high public sculpture, the so-called ''[[Chicago Picasso]]'' (1967). His design was ambiguous and somewhat controversial, and what the figure represents is not clear; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman or a totally abstract shape.

During the late 1950s and the 1960s abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Richard Lippold]], [[George Rickey]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.

By the 1960s [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Geometric abstraction]] and [[Minimalism]], which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features, predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of [[Sir Anthony Caro]], as well as [[welded sculpture]] by a large variety of sculptors, the large-scale work of [[John Angus Chamberlain|John Chamberlain]], and environmental installation scale works by [[Mark di Suvero]]. Other Minimalists include [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], Donald Judd, [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Giacomo Benevelli]], [[Arnaldo Pomodoro]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], and [[John Safer]] who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line.&lt;ref&gt;National Air and Space Museum Receives ''Ascent'' Sculpture for display at Udvar-Hazy Center [http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroomreleaseDetail.cfm?releaseID=49]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by modernist artists in stylized forms was made by artists such as [[Leonard Baskin]], [[Ernest Trova]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Paul Thek]], [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] in a classic articulated style, and [[Fernando Botero]] bringing his painting's 'oversized figures' into monumental sculptures.

Artists created [[environmental sculpture]] on expansive sites in the '[[Land Arts of the American West|land art in the American West]]' group of projects. These [[land art]] or 'earth art' environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[James Turrell]] ([[Roden Crater]]). [[Eva Hesse]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Jackie Winsor]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Bruce Nauman]] and [[Dennis Oppenheim]] among others were pioneers of [[Postminimalist]] sculpture.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Chryssa]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Edward Kienholz]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Duane Hanson]], and [[John DeAndrea]] explored abstraction, imagery and figuration through [[video art]], environment, light sculpture, and [[installation art]] in new ways.

[[Conceptual art]] is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'', 1965, is by [[Joseph Kosuth]], and ''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], and those of [[Joseph Beuys]], [[James Turrell]] and [[Jacek Tylicki]].

====Contemporary genres====
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|right|''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' by [[Robert Smithson]], in 2005]]
Some modern sculpture forms are now practiced outdoors, as [[environmental art]] and [[environmental sculpture]], often in full view of spectators. [[Light sculpture]], [[Lock On (street art)|street art sculpture]] and [[site-specific art]] also often make use of the environment. [[Ice sculpture]] is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. [[Kinetic art|Kinetic sculptures]] are sculptures that are designed to move, which include [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]. [[Snow sculpture]]s are usually carved out of a single block of snow about {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m}} on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall. [[Sound sculpture]]s take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as aeolian harps, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. [[Art toys]] have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by [[Takashi Murakami]] and [[Kid Robot]], designed by [[Michael Lau]], or hand-made by [[Michael Leavitt (artist)]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Army by Michael Leavitt", '' hypediss.com''[http://www.hypediss.com/art_army_by_michael_leavitt], December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|thumb|Visible damage due to [[acid rain]] on a sculpture]]
Sculptures are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to light and [[ultraviolet light]]. [[Acid rain]] can also cause damage to certain building materials and historical monuments. This results when [[sulfuric acid]] in the rain chemically reacts with the calcium compounds in the stones (limestone, sandstone, marble and granite) to create [[gypsum]], which then flakes off.

At any time many contemporary sculptures have usually been on display in public places; [[theft]] was not a problem as pieces were instantly recognisable. In the early 21st century the value of metal rose to such an extent that theft of massive bronze sculpture for the value of the metal became a problem; sculpture worth millions being stolen and melted down for the relatively low value of the metal, a tiny fraction of the value of the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16266378 BBC: Barbara Hepworth sculpture stolen from Dulwich Park, 20 December 2011]. Example of theft of large bronze sculpture for the value of the metal.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Section_break_01_by_Pengo.jpg|thumb|Open pages of the book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', showing an ornate section break on the lower left page created from [[asterisk]]s. It is used to signal a pause for the reader and a [[transition (fiction)|transition]] in the narrative.]]
In [[book]]s and [[document]]s, a '''section''' is a subdivision, especially of a [[Chapter (books)|chapter]]. 

Sections are visually separated from each other with a '''section break''', typically consisting of extra space between the sections, and sometimes also by a '''section heading''' for the latter section. They are a concern in the process of [[typography]] and [[pagination]], where it may be desirable to have a [[page break]] follow a section break for the sake of aesthetics or readability.

In [[fiction]], sections often represent [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], and accordingly the space separating them is sometimes also called a  '''scene break'''.

==Section form and numbering==

In written narrative such as fiction, sections are not usually numbered or named. Section breaks are used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, [[Point of view (fiction)|point-of-view character]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[tone (literature)|tone]], [[emotion]], and [[pace (speed)|pace]]. As a [[fiction-writing mode]], the section break can be considered a [[transition (fiction)|transition]], similar to a chapter break.

Some documents, especially legal documents, may have numbered sections, such as ''[[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' or ''[[Internal Revenue Code section 183]]''. The [[section sign]] (§) may be used to reference sections and subsections. Subsections are often written in lowercase [[Roman numerals]], e.g. [[Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution]].

A document may also be considered to be divided into sections by its headings and subheadings, which may be used for a [[table of contents]]. For example, the hierarchical sections used in [[Wikipedia]] can be compiled into a table of contents for an article. Many books, however, only have chapter headings in the table of contents.

While a chapter may be divided by section breaks, a group of chapters is conventionally called a "part", often identified with a Roman numeral, e.g. "Part II".

Reference material may be divided into sections. The [[section headers of a Chinese dictionary]] are one example.

== Flourished section breaks ==

Space between paragraphs in a section break is sometimes accompanied by an [[Asterism (typography)|asterism]] (either proper ⁂ or manual * * *), a horizontal rule, [[fleuron (typography)|fleuron]]s, or other ornamental symbols. An ornamental symbol used as section break does not have a generally accepted name. Such a typographic device can be specifically referred to as ''dinkus'', ''space break symbol'', ''paragraph separator'', ''paragraph divider'', ''horizontal divider'', ''thought break'', or as an instance of ''filigree'' or ''flourish''. Ornamental section breaks can be created using [[glyph]]s, rows of [[lozenge]]s, [[dingbat]]s, or other [[miscellaneous symbols]]. Fonts such as [[Webdings]] and [[Wingdings]] include many such glyphs.

In [[HTML]], horizontal rules can be generated using the &lt;code&gt;hr&lt;/code&gt; tag, which generates a paragraph-level thematic break. For more ornate presentation, [[CSS]] can be used to replace the line with an image.

The '''Tactical Air Control Party''', commonly abbreviated '''TACP''', is a small team of [[air force]] or [[marine (military)|marine]] personnel who provide airspace deconfliction, [[command and control]] communications, and terminal control of [[close air support]] at [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] level or below.

==United States==
===Air Force TACP===

A [[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|USAF TACP]] is usually a team of two or more [[United States Air Force]] enlisted TACP journeymen or craftsmen ([[Air Force Specialty Code|AFSC]] 1C4X1) aligned with a conventional or special operational [[United States Army]] [[United States Army#Combat maneuver organizations|combat maneuver unit]] to advise ground commanders on the best use of air power, establish and maintain command and control communications, and provide precision [[terminal attack control|terminal attack guidance]] of U.S. and [[coalition]] fixed-wing and rotary-wing [[close air support]] aircraft, [[artillery]], and [[naval gunfire]].

A TACP always includes at least one Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) who is qualified to perform terminal control of aircraft. It can also include an [[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|Air Liaison Officer]] (ALO). Formerly limited to commissioned officer who were aeronautically rated (as a pilot or navigator/combat systems officer) serving in a short-term special duty assignment, in 2009 the Air Force created  a full-time ALO career (AFSC 13L).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Air Force Careers - Air Liaison Officer|url=https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/air-liaison-officer|publisher=U.S. Air Force|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 13L is also known as a Tactical Air Control Officer (TACO) and if JTAC qualified they are known as a JTACO.  Those 13Ls who are selected for AFSOC duties are referred to as SOF TACOs.  JTAC teams are primarily stationed with and support Army combat units.

===Marine Corps FAC===
Traditional [[USMC|Marine Corps]] infantry battalions each have a Forward Air Controller (FAC), who is a Marine Corps [[Naval Aviator]] or [[Naval Flight Officer]] acting liaison between their fighter/attack jets and/or attack helicopters and the infantry battalion. A Marine Corps FAC (7502 MOS) is commonly referred to as the Air Officer. Underneath him, he has two other FACs and three [[Joint Terminal Attack Controller]]s (JTACs – 8002 MOS). Ideally the three FACs (including the Air Officer) come from three different aviation backgrounds: one tactical jet pilot or NFO (F/A-18 or AV-8B), one tactical helicopter pilot (AH-1W or UH-1Y), and one assault support pilot (CH-46, CH-53, KC-130 or MV-22). Ideally, the three JTACs come from an artillery background (Forward Observer – 0861 MOS).

In addition to the three FACs and three JTACs, the infantry battalion also has eight [[Joint Fires Observer]]s (JFOs) distributed among the rifle companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12215">'''Topicalization''' is a mechanism of [[syntax]] that establishes an expression as the sentence or [[clause]] [[topic (linguistics)|topic]]; in English, by having it appear at the front of the sentence or clause (as opposed to in a canonical position further to the right). Topicalization often results in a [[discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuity]] and is thus one of a number of established discontinuity types (the other three being [[wh-movement|''wh''-fronting]], [[Scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], and [[extraposition]]). Topicalization is also used as a [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituency test]]; an expression that can be topicalized is deemed a constituent.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of topicalization used as a constituency test, see for instance Allerton (1979:114), Borsley (1991:24), Napoli (1993:422), Burton-Roberts (1997:17), Poole (2002:32), Radford (2004:72), Haegeman (2006:790).&lt;/ref&gt; The topicalization of [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] in English is rare, whereas circumstantial [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]] are often topicalized. Most languages allow topicalization, and in some languages, topicalization occurs much more frequently and/or in a much less [[markedness|marked]] manner than in English. Topicalization in English has also received attention in the pragmatics literature.&lt;ref&gt; Concerning topicalization as discussed in the pragmatics literature, see for example Prince (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Typical cases of topicalization are illustrated with the following examples:

::a. The boys roll rocks '''for entertainment'''.
::b. '''For entertainment''', the boys roll rocks.&lt;small&gt; -Topicalization of the adjunct ''for entertainment''&lt;/small&gt;

::a. Everyone refused to answer '''because the pressure was too great'''.
::b. '''Because the pressure was too great''', everyone refused to answer. &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization of the adjunct ''because the pressure was too great''&lt;/small&gt;

::a. I won't eat '''that pizza'''.
::b. '''That pizza''', I won't eat. &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization of the object argument ''that pizza''&lt;/small&gt;

::a. I am terrified of '''those dogs'''.
::b. '''Those dogs''', of which I am terrified. &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization of the object argument ''those dogs''&lt;/small&gt;

Assuming that the a-sentences represent canonical word order, the b-sentences contain instances of topicalization. The constituent in bold is fronted in order to establish it as topic. The two former examples with a topicalized adjunct are typical, whereas the two latter examples with a topicalized object argument are comparatively rare. The appearance of the demonstrative determiners ''that'' and ''those'' is important, since without them, topicalization of an argument seems less acceptable, e.g. ?''A pizza I won't eat''.

Topicalization can occur across long distances, e.g.

::a. I thought you said that Tom believes the explanation needs '''such examples'''.
::b. '''Such examples''' I thought you said that Tom believes the explanation needs. &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization of the object argument ''such examples'' over a long distance&lt;/small&gt;

==Further examples==
Topicalization is similar to ''wh''-movement insofar as the constituents that can be ''wh''-fronted can also be topicalized, e.g.

::a. Bill is living in '''that one house on the hill'''.
::b. '''Which house''' is Bill living in? - &lt;small&gt;''Wh''-fronting of NP resulting in preposition stranding&lt;/small&gt;
::c. '''That one house on the hill''' Bill is living in. - &lt;small&gt;Topicalization of NP resulting in preposition stranding&lt;/small&gt;

::a. Shelly has indeed uncovered part of '''our plan'''.
::b. '''What''' has Shelly indeed uncovered part of? &lt;small&gt;- ''Wh''-fronting out of object NP resulting in preposition stranding&lt;/small&gt;
::c. '''Our plan''' Shelly has indeed uncovered part of. &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization out of object NP resulting in preposition stranding
&lt;/small&gt;
And topicalization is similar to ''wh''-fronting insofar as the islands and barriers to ''wh''-fronting are also islands and barriers to topicalization, e.g.

::a. The description of '''his aunt''' was really funny.
::b. *'''Whose aunt''' was the description of really funny? - &lt;small&gt;''Wh''-fronting impossible out of a subject in English&lt;/small&gt;
::c. *'''His aunt''' the description of was really funny. - &lt;small&gt;Topicalization impossible out of a subject in English&lt;/small&gt;

::a. He relaxes after he's played '''Starcraft'''.
::b. *'''What''' does he relax after he's played? &lt;small&gt;- ''Wh''-fronting impossible out of adjunct clause&lt;/small&gt;
::c. *'''Starcraft''' he relaxes after he's played. &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization impossible out of adjunct clause&lt;/small&gt;

::a. She approves of the suggestion to make '''pasta'''.
::b. *'''What''' does she approve of the suggestion to make?  &lt;small&gt;- ''Wh''-fronting impossible out of complex NP&lt;/small&gt;
::c. *'''Pasta''' she approves of the suggestion to make. &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization impossible out of complex NP&lt;/small&gt;

These examples illustrate the similar behavior of topicalization and ''wh''-fronting. Further data, which will not be produced here, could show, however, that topicalization is unlike the other two major [[discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuity]] types, i.e. [[Scrambling_(linguistics)|scrambling]] and [[extraposition]].

==Theoretical analyses==
The theoretical analysis of topicalization can vary greatly depending in part on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. If one assumes the layered structures associated with many [[phrase structure grammar]]s, all instances of topicalization will involve a discontinuity. If, in contrast, less layered structures are assumed as for example in [[dependency grammar]], then many instances of topicalization do not involve a discontinuity, but rather just [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesnière (1959) and Ágel (2003/6).&lt;/ref&gt; This point is illustrated here first using flatter structures that lack a finite VP-constituent (which means the entire sentence has the status of a large VP). Both constituency- and dependency-based analyses are given. The example itself is a piece of Yoda wisdom (as he speaks to Anakin), and is certainly of questionable acceptability in this regard. It is, however, perfectly understandable:

::[[File:E-top-01.jpg|Topicalization in flat constituency and dependency structures]]

The upper two trees show the analysis using flat constituency-based structures that lack a finite VP [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], and the lower two trees are dependency-based,&lt;ref&gt;See Mel'čuk (2003: 221) and Starosta (2003: 278) for dependency grammar analyses of topicalization similar to the ones shown here.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby dependency inherently rejects the existence of finite VP-constituents.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the rejection of a finite VP constituent in dependency grammar, see Tesnière (1959:16ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; The noteworthy aspect of these examples is that topicalization does not result in a discontinuity, since there are no crossing lines in the trees. What this means is that such cases can be analyzed purely in terms of inversion. The topicalized expression simply "inverts" to the other side of its head.&lt;ref&gt;See Groß and Osborne (2009:64-66) for such an analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of the flat trees just examined, most constituency grammars posit more layered structures that include a finite VP constituent. These more layered structures are likely to address topicalization in terms of [[Syntactic movement|movement]] or copying, as illustrated with the following two trees:&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Grewendorf (1988:66ff.), Ouhalla (1998: 136f.), Radford (2004: 123ff).&lt;/ref&gt;

::[[File:E-top-02.jpg|Topicalization in layered constituency structures]]

Tree a. shows the canonical word order again, and tree b. illustrates what is known as the movement or copying analysis. The topicalized expression is first generated in its canonical position but is then copied to the front of the sentence, the original then being deleted.

The movement analysis of discontinuities is one possible way to address those instances of topicalization that cannot be explained in terms of inversion. An alternative explanation is feature passing. One assumes that the topicalized expression is not moved or copied to the clause-initial position, but rather it is "base" generated there. Instead of movement, there is feature passing, however.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the account of functional uncertainty in Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan 2001:64-69).&lt;/ref&gt; A link of a sort is established between the topicalized expression and its [[Government (linguistics)|governor]]. The link is the path along which information about the topicalized expression is passed to the governor of that expression. A piece of Yoda wisdom is again used for illustration, the full sentence being ''Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin'':

::[[File:E-top-03.jpg|Feature passing (constituency and dependency)]]

The nodes in red mark the path of feature passing. Features (=information) about the topicalized expression are passed rightward through (and down) the tree structure to the governor of that expression. This path is present in both analyses, i.e. in the constituency-based a-analysis on the left and in the dependency-based b-analysis on the right. Since topicalization can occur over long distances, feature passing must also occur over long distances. The final example shows a dependency-based analysis of a sentence where the feature passing path is quite long:
  
::[[File:E-top-04.jpg|Long distance feature passing (dependency)]]

Information about the topicalized ''such nonsense'' is passed along the path marked in red down to the governor of the topicalized expression ''spouting''. The words corresponding to the nodes in red form a [[catena (linguistics)|catena]] (Latin for 'chain', plural ''catenae'').&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne et al. (2013) concerning catenae.&lt;/ref&gt; A theory of topicalization is then built up in part by examining the nature of these catenae for feature passing.

In professional team sports, a '''traveling team''' (also called a '''road team''') is a member of a professional league that never or rarely competes in its home arena or stadium. This differs from a [[barnstorm (athletics)|barnstorming team]] in that the latter does not compete within a [[league (sports)|league or association]] framework. While leagues may designate a traveling team prior to the start of competition, some teams become road teams by simply not scheduling any home games.

While the use of traveling teams has been sparing on the upper levels of professional sports, the [[National Football League]] had such road teams (such as the [[Hammond Pros]], [[Oorang Indians]], and [[Columbus Panhandles]]) in the formative years of the league.

==Traveling teams in major professional American football==
&lt;!-- Please do not include minor league teams in the list - there are way too many of them. Just Wikilink "traveling team" in the article instead --&gt;
Below is a list of the traveling teams that were members of the [[National Football League]], the [[American Football League (1926)|first American Football League]], or the second [[American Football League (1936)|American Football League]]. No other major professional league of American football had such road teams, the last of which was the 1952 [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] of the National Football League. To qualify for the list, the team must have played a complete season of at least four games on the road. Teams that had the traveling team status imposed upon them in midseason are noted.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Neft, Richard S.

There have been no NFL traveling teams since 1952, owing to the increased stability of the league. Even in cases when an NFL team's home stadium has been rendered unusable due to damages or renovations, the teams have arranged and designated temporary home stadiums in each case and no NFL team has had to play more than two designated home games (out of eight in a season) outside their home stadium.

In the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Las Vegas Posse]] were converted to a road team near the end of the 1994 season, their sole season in the league because of low attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/22/sports/las-vegas-loses-its-cfl-team.html Las Vegas loses CFL team].

==Traveling teams in baseball==

Traveling teams have existed at many times in baseball history, even into the 21st century. Traveling teams are periodically used by [[independent baseball leagues]] to maintain an even number of teams for scheduling purposes. Examples include the [[Pennsylvania Road Warriors|Road Warriors]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]], the [[Frontier Greys]] of the [[Frontier League]], and [[The Grays]] of the [[Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball|Can-Am League]]. 

In 1994, after a roof collapse occurred at the [[Kingdome]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Seattle Mariners]] were forced to play the remainder of the season on the road after the players' union rejected a number of proposed temporary homes. However, the season was cut short due to a player's strike, which resulted in the Mariners playing only 20 games as a road team.

'''William Gwavas''' (1676–1741) was an English barrister and writer in the [[Cornish language]].
[[File:William Gwavas 1873.jpg|thumb|William Gwavas, 19th-century portrait]]

==Life==
The eldest son of William Gwavas, by Eliza, daughter of Sir Thomas Arundell of [[Tolverne]], near [[Truro]], he was born at [[Huntingfield, Suffolk|Huntingfield Hall]], [[Suffolk]], 6 December 1676, and baptised in Huntingfield Church on 1 January following. He was articled to James Holt, an attorney in [[Lyon's Inn]], and then entered the [[Middle Temple]], where he purchased a ground chamber, No. 4 Brick Court.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gwavas, William|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gwavas moved back to Cornwall, living in a house in Chapel Street, [[Penzance]]. His father had left his Cornish property with debts, but he paid off the incumbrances, and redeemed the mortgage on the rectory of [[Paul, Cornwall|Paul]]. With this rectory he had inherited a chancery suit, begun on 14 June 1680, as to the right of the rector to take [[tithe]] of fish landed at [[Newlyn]] and [[Mousehole]]. The case came before the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] on 26 February 1730, and went against the fishermen. Nevertheless, at the entrance to Newlyn there was for many years a notice affixed to a house which said "One and All, No tithe of fish".&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Gwavas was buried on 9 January 1741 in [[St Pol de Léon's Church, Paul|Paul Church]], where a marble monument was erected to his memory.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
About 1710 [[Edward Lhuyd]] visited Cornwall, and conferred with Gwavas, [[Thomas Tonkin]], and [[John Keigwin]] as to the formation of a "Cornu-British vocabulary". At this period they were the main authorities in the county on the old Cornish language, collectors of mottoes, proverbs, and idioms. In the dedication to Tonkin's ''Parochial History of Cornwall'',' 1733, the only part of the work that was printed, the author said Gwavas had helped him with Cornish vocabulary and texts.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Gwavas's Cornish writings in manuscript went to the [[British Museum]] (Addit. MS. 28554). His [[commonplace book]], dated 1710, was in the sale of W. C. Borlase's library on 22 February 1887, and was purchased by [[Bernard Quaritch]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
On 29 April 1717 Gwavas married Elizabeth, daughter of Christopher Harris of [[St. Ives, Cornwall]], with whom he received a portion of £1,500. He left two daughters: Anne, who married the Rev. Thomas Carlyon, and died in 1797, and Elizabeth, who married William Veale, and died in 1791.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

{{Wittgenstein|Later}}
'''''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''''' is a 1982 book by [[philosopher of language]] [[Saul Kripke]], in which the author contends that the central argument of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' centers on a devastating rule-following paradox that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language. Kripke writes that this paradox is "the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date" (p.&amp;nbsp;60). He argues that Wittgenstein does not reject the argument that leads to the rule-following paradox, but accepts it and offers a "skeptical solution" to alleviate the paradox's destructive effects.

==Kripkenstein: Kripke's skeptical Wittgenstein&lt;!--'Kripkenstein' redirects here--&gt;==
While most commentators accept that the ''Philosophical Investigations'' contains the rule-following paradox as Kripke presents it, few have concurred in attributing Kripke's skeptical solution to Wittgenstein. Kripke expresses doubts in ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'' as to whether Wittgenstein would endorse his interpretation of the ''Philosophical Investigations''. He says that the work should not be read as an attempt to give an accurate statement of Wittgenstein's views, but rather as an account of Wittgenstein's argument "as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). The [[portmanteau]] "'''Kripkenstein'''
&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" has been coined as a nickname for a fictional person who holds the views expressed by Kripke's reading of the ''Philosophical Investigations''; in this way, it is convenient to speak of Kripke's own views, Wittgenstein's views (as generally understood), and Kripkenstein's views.  Wittgenstein scholar David G. Stern considers the book to be the most influential and widely discussed work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David G. 2006. ''Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations: An Introduction''. Cambridge University Press. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== The rule-following paradox&lt;!--'Rule-following paradox' redirects here--&gt; ==

In ''PI'' 201a Wittgenstein explicitly states the '''rule-following paradox'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: "This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because any course of action can be made out to accord with the rule". Kripke gives a mathematical example to illustrate the reasoning that leads to this conclusion. Suppose that you have never added numbers greater than 50 before. Further, suppose that you are asked to perform the computation '68 + 57'. Our natural inclination is that you will apply the addition function as you have before, and calculate that the correct answer is '125'. But now imagine that a bizarre skeptic comes along and argues:

# That there is no fact about your past usage of the addition function that determines '125' as the right answer.
# That nothing justifies you in giving this answer rather than another.

After all, the skeptic reasons, by hypothesis you have never added numbers greater than 50 before. It is perfectly consistent with your previous use of 'plus' that you actually meant it to mean the 'quus' function, defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;x~\mathrm{quus}~y = \begin{cases} x + y &amp; \text{if }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The skeptic argues that there is no fact about you that determines that you ought to answer '125' rather than '5'. Your past usage of the addition function is susceptible to an infinite number of different quus-like interpretations. It appears that every new application of 'plus', rather than being governed by a strict, unambiguous rule, is actually a leap in the dark.

The obvious objection to this procedure is that the addition function is not defined by a number of examples, but by a general rule or algorithm. But then the algorithm itself will contain terms that are susceptible to different and incompatible interpretations, and the skeptical problem simply resurfaces at a higher level. In short, rules for interpreting rules provide no help, because they themselves can be interpreted in different ways. Or, as Wittgenstein himself puts it, "any interpretation still hangs in the air along with what it interprets, and cannot give it any support. Interpretations by themselves do not determine meaning" (''PI'' 198a).

Similar skeptical reasoning can be applied to any word of any human language. The power of Kripke's example is that in mathematics the rules for the use of expressions appear to be defined clearly for an infinite number of cases.  Kripke doesn't question the validity in mathematics of the '+' function, but rather the meta-linguistic usage of 'plus': what fact can we point to that shows that 'plus' refers to the mathematical function '+'.

== The skeptical solution ==

Kripke, following [[David Hume]], distinguishes between two types of solution to skeptical paradoxes. Straight solutions dissolve paradoxes by rejecting one (or more) of the premises that lead to them. Skeptical solutions accept the truth of the paradox, but argue that it does not undermine our ordinary beliefs and practices in the way it seems to. Because Kripke thinks that Wittgenstein endorses the skeptical paradox, he is committed to the view that Wittgenstein offers a skeptical, and not a straight, solution.&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;{{Cite book  | title = Saul Kripke | year = 2004 | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | location = Montreal  | isbn = 0-7735-2885-7| author = Fitch, G. W.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule-following paradox threatens our ordinary beliefs and practices concerning meaning because it implies that there is no such thing as meaning something by an expression or sentence. [[John McDowell]] explains this as follows. We are inclined to think of meaning in contractual terms: that is, that meanings commit or oblige us to use words in a certain way. When you grasp the meaning of the word "dog", for example, you know that you ought to use that word to refer to dogs, and not cats. Now, if there cannot be rules governing the uses of words, as the rule-following paradox apparently shows, this intuitive notion of meaning is utterly undermined.

Kripke holds that other commentators on ''Philosophical Investigations'' have believed that the [[private language argument]] is presented in sections occurring after §243.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kripke|first1=Saul A.|title=Wittgenstein on rules and private language : an elementary exposition|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-13521-9|page=2|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kripke reacts against this view, noting that the conclusion to the argument is explicitly stated by §202, which reads “Hence it is not possible to obey a rule ‘privately’: otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same as obeying it.” Further, in this introductory section, Kripke identifies Wittgenstein’s interests in the philosophy of mind as being related to his interests in the foundations of mathematics, in that both subjects require considerations concerning rules and rule-following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kripke|first1=Saul A.|title=Wittgenstein on rules and private language : an elementary exposition|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-13521-9|page=4|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke's skeptical solution is this: A language-user's following a rule correctly is not justified by any fact that obtains about the relationship between his candidate application of a rule in a particular case, and the putative rule itself (as for Hume the causal link between two events ''a'' and ''b'' is not determined by any particular fact obtaining between them ''taken in isolation''), but rather the assertion that the rule that is being followed is justified by the fact that the behaviors surrounding the candidate instance of rule-following (by the candidate rule-follower) meet the expectations of other language users.  That the solution is not based on a fact about ''a particular instance'' of putative rule-following—as it would be if it were based on some mental state of meaning, interpretation, or intention—shows that this solution is skeptical in the sense Kripke specifies.

==The "straight" solution==
In contrast to the kind of solution offered by Kripke (above) and [[Crispin Wright]] (elsewhere), John McDowell interprets Wittgenstein as correctly (by McDowell's lights) offering a "straight solution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=John|title=WIttgenstein on following a Rule|journal=Synthese|date=March 1984|volume=58|issue=4|pages=325–363.|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/x2k8345332703122.pdf|doi=10.1007/bf00485246}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McDowell argues that Wittgenstein does present the paradox (as Kripke argues), but he argues further that Wittgenstein rejects the paradox on the grounds that it assimilates understanding and interpretation. In order to understand something, we must have an interpretation.  That is, to understand what is meant by "plus," we must first have an interpretation of what "plus" means.  This leads one to either skepticism—how do you know your interpretation is the correct interpretation?—or relativity  whereby our understandings, and thus interpretations, are only so determined in so far as we have used them.  In this latter view, endorsed by Wittgenstein in Wright's readings, there are no facts about numerical addition that man has so far not discovered, so  when we come upon such situations, we can flesh out our interpretations further.  Both of these alternatives are quite unsatisfying; the latter because we want to say that the objects of our understandings are independent from us in some way: that there are facts about numbers, that have not yet been added.

McDowell writes further, in his interpretation of Wittgenstein, that to understand rule-following we should understand it as resulting from inculcation into a custom or practice.  Thus, to understand addition, is simply to have been inculcated into a practice of adding.

{{Redirect-distinguish|Production title|Production logo}}

A '''working title''', sometimes called a '''production title''' or a '''tentative title''', is the temporary [[Title (publishing)|title]] of a product or project used during its development, usually used in [[filmmaking]], [[television production]], [[novel]], [[video game development]], or music [[album]].

== Purpose ==
{{unsourced|section|date=November 2018}}
Working titles are used primarily for two reasons – the first being that an official [[title (publishing)|title]] has not yet been decided upon, with the working title being used purely for identification purposes, and the second being a ruse to intentionally disguise the real nature of a project.

Examples of the former include the film ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', which was produced under the title ''Die Hard: New York'' and the [[James Bond]] films, which are commonly produced under titles such as ''Bond 22'' until an official title is decided upon.
 
Examples of the latter include ''[[Jurassic World]]'', produced under ''Ebb Tide''; ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', which was produced under the title ''Blue Harvest''; 2009's ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', which was produced under the title ''Corporate Headquarters''; and the [[Batman]] films ''[[Batman Forever]]'', ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', which were produced under the titles ''Blinko'', ''Dictel'', ''The Intimidation Game'', ''Rory's First Kiss'' and ''Magnus Rex'',&lt;ref&gt;Nolan Fans article [http://www.nolanfans.com/2011/02/10/the-dark-knight-rises-as-magnus-rex/ "The Dark Knight Rises As Magnus Rex"]&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

In some cases a working title may ultimately be used as the official title, as in the case of the films ''[[Cloverfield]]'', ''[[Project X (2012 film)|Project X]]'' (2012), ''[[High School Musical]]'', and ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (at the insistence of leading man [[Samuel L. Jackson]], who joked that he took the role for the working title alone, after he learned the title was going to be changed to ''Pacific Air Flight 121'' upon release), the [[television show]]s ''[[The Mindy Project]]'' and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', and video games ''[[Quake II]]'', ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', ''[[Silent Hill: Origins]]'' and ''[[Epic Mickey]]''.

== Title ruse ==
A title ruse is a practice by which a high-profile film or [[television series]] is given a fake working title to keep its production a secret, and to prevent [[price gouging]] by suppliers,&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Jim, Production Supervisor; Ch. 9, bonus material disc of the 2004 Star Wars Trilogy DVD box set.&lt;/ref&gt; casual theft and undesirable attention.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Purchase order]]s from vendors, outdoor signs, [[videocassette]]s and [[DVD]] labels will use the cover title of a film.
