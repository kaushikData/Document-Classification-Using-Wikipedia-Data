'''''15 Minutes''''' is a 2001 German-American [[crime film|crime]] [[action thriller]] film directed by [[John Herzfeld]] and starring [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Edward Burns]]. Its story revolves around a homicide [[detective]] (De Niro) and a [[New York City fire marshals|fire marshal]] (Burns) who join forces to apprehend a pair of Eastern European murderers ([[Karel Roden]] and [[Oleg Taktarov]]) videotaping their crimes in order to become rich and famous. The title is a reference to the [[Andy Warhol]] quotation, "[[15 minutes of fame|In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes]]."

==Plot==
Ex-convicts Emil Slovak ([[Karel Roden]]) and Oleg Razgul ([[Oleg Taktarov]]) arrive in the United States to claim their part of a bank heist in [[Russia]] (or in the [[Czech Republic]]). Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. At the rundown apartment of their old partner, they are denied their share, so Emil fatally stabs him and his wife as Oleg tapes it with the camera. [[Czech American|Czech immigrant]] Daphne Handlova ([[Vera Farmiga]]) witnesses the murders from the bathroom, then escapes before they can kill her as well. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment.

Jordy Warsaw ([[Edward Burns]]) is an arson investigator assigned to the case. Eddie Flemming ([[Robert De Niro]]) is a flamboyant New York City detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity that he is followed around by a reporter from a tabloid TV show, ''Top Story'', hosted by the arrogant Robert Hawkins ([[Kelsey Grammer]]). Everywhere he goes, citizens cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw agree to work the case together. While checking out the crowd, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention, but she disappears.

Emil calls an [[escort service]] and asks for a "Czech girl." One calling herself Honey (Noelle Evans) arrives, whom he kills but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. He continually films everything, claiming he wants to be the next [[Frank Capra]].

Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder, visiting the escort service. Rose Hearn ([[Charlize Theron]]), who runs it, tells them that the girl Warsaw described doesn't work for her but rather a hairdresser. She mentions a couple of other guys having just asked her the same questions. Flemming and Warsaw arrive at the hair salon just after Emil and Oleg have warned Daphne to keep quiet. Flemming notices someone filming them from across the street. A foot chase begins, Flemming's regular partner Leon Jackson ([[Avery Brooks]]) being hit with a glass bottle and his wallet stolen. Emil finds a card with Flemming's name and address. He is jealous of Flemming's celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in America can get away with anything.

On the night Flemming is to propose to his girlfriend Nicolette Karas ([[Melina Kanakaredes]]), Oleg and Emil sneak into his house and bind Flemming to a chair. While Oleg is recording, Emil explains his plan to Flemming: He will kill him and sell the tape to ''Top Story''. After being committed to an [[insane asylum]], he will declare that he is actually sane. Since he can't be tried again, he will get off, collecting royalties from his books and movies. Fleming attacks them with his chair (while still taped to it), but Emil gets the upper-hand and stabs him in the chest, mortally wounding him. Emil then suffocates and kills Flemming with a pillow.

The entire city is in mourning. Emil calls Hawkins to offer a tape of the killing that he is willing to sell to ''Top Story''. Hawkins pays him $1 million for it. Warsaw and the entire police force are furious, unable to believe that the TV show would air it, especially since Hawkins's main reporter is Nicolette.

Emil and Oleg sit in a [[Planet Hollywood]] to watch the show in public. Halfway through the broadcast, customers realize that Emil and Oleg are right there with them and panic. Police arrive and arrest Emil, while Oleg escapes. Instead of delivering his suspect to the police station, Warsaw takes Emil to an abandoned warehouse to kill him. Other police arrive just in time and take Emil into custody. Everything goes as planned for Emil, now a celebrity who is pleading insanity. His lawyer agrees to work for 30% of the royalties Emil will receive for his story. Meanwhile, in hiding, Oleg becomes jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving.

While the lawyer is leading Emil away, surrounded by the media, Warsaw provokes an argument, with the ''Top Story'' crew recording the whole thing. Oleg quietly approaches Hawkins and hands him the tape of Emil explaining his plan to Flemming, proving he was sane the whole time. Hawkins shouts out to Emil about the evidence in his possession. Emil grabs a policeman's gun, shoots Oleg and grabs Nicolette, who is covering the story, threatening to shoot her. Against orders, Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest to avenge Flemming's murder.

An officer observes that Oleg is still alive. Hawkins rushes to his side, where Oleg says a final few words about the movie that is still being taped,  just before he dies. Hawkins attempts to get a comment from Warsaw, who punches him and walks away as the police all smile with approval.

It was originally slated to be released by [[New Line Cinema]] in the spring of 2000, with theatrical trailers appearing in late 1999. For reasons unknown, the film was pulled from the spring 2000 schedule and then delayed until the following year, on March 9, 2001.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film grossed $24,403,552 domestically in the United States and Canada. It made a further $31,956,428 internationally, for a worldwide total of $56,359,980 against a production budget of $42 million.&lt;ref name="mojo"/&gt;

===Critical response===
Review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 123 critics, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's consensus reads, "As critical as it is about sensationalism in the media, ''15 Minutes'' itself indulges in lurid violence, and its satire is too heavy-handed to be effective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/15_minutes/|title=15 Minutes (2001)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently holds a 34 out of 100 rating on [[Metacritic]], based on 32 critical reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/15-minutes|title=15 Minutes Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it three out of four stars, calling it "a cynical, savage satire about violence, the media and depravity." Ebert felt "It doesn't have the polish of "[[Natural Born Killers]]" or the wit of "[[Wag the Dog]]," but it's a real movie, rough edges and all, and not another link from the sausage factory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/15-minutes-2001|title=15 Minutes|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the negative side, [[Stephen Hunter]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote:
{{blockquote|For a while, as long as it's cops vs. scum, "15 Minutes" bangs along pretty spectacularly. The contrived script gets Brooks out of the picture fast, so that De Niro and Burns can have a nice male bonding moment or two, if that's the sort of thing that brings tears to your eyes. ... But like oh-so-many movies in today's film culture, where nobody ever met a story he could tell, this one becomes so jammed up with subplots it seems to run out of room, space and time. ... it ruins the movie, leaving it without its engine, without its rooting interest, without, really, much of anything going for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/15minuteshunter.htm|title=15 Minutes|first=Stephen|last=Hunter|website=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Owen Gleiberman]]of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated: "At the movies, we’re now bamboozled into expecting not drama but sensation, and so it’s no surprise that the plot of a movie like ''15 Minutes'' is less an end in itself than an excuse, a jumping-off point for showy, contrived, borderline-exploitation sequences that fail to tie together because they’re not really there to do anything but sell themselves as money-shot thrills. ... ''15 Minutes'' is a glum and sadistic mess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2001/03/16/15-minutes-4/|title=15 Minutes|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She evades them, but the [[commando]]s crack her wall safe and steal her most prized valuables.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Arkham Unhinged'' #1 (October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Furious, she confronts Two-Face while he is examining stolen blueprints of the Arkham City security facilities.

The music video for this song has been written and directed by [[Mikey McCleary|Mikey]] and features celebrities such as [[Ranveer Singh]], [[Kalki Koechlin]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Shaan (singer)|Shaan]], [[Sapna Bhavnani]], [[Gabriella Demetriades]] and [[Anushka Manchanda]] along with several other people from around [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Press Trust of India |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/mikey-mccleary-turns-ad-jingles-into-songs-for-new-album-114063000629_1.html |title= Mikey McCleary turns ad jingles into songs for new album |publisher=www.business-standard.com |date=2014-06-30 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
"Chase Every Dream" was originally composed in December 2010 for a [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi's]] Curve ID advertisement that featured 3 girls taking a road-trip and then opening a restaurant on a beach. The ad left a lot of people asking for the full song and the name of the artist who had composed the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Dhara Vora |url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/sing-along-with--the-kiwi-jingle-man/15389170 |title= Sing along with the Kiwi jingle man |publisher=www.mid-day.com |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikey McCleary|Mikey]] chose to include this track on ''TV Dinners'' since it was a tune people would find familiar, but didn't have any lyrics specifically connecting the song with the original brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Swati Daftuar |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/jingles-and-music/article6134071.ece |title= Jingles and Music |publisher=www.thehindu.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The song "Chase Every Dream" is about believing in yourself and making your dreams happen regardless of how difficult or crazy they are. Since the song evokes an inspirational feeling, [[Mikey McCleary|Mikey]] wanted to make an uplifting video featuring many diverse people. “I've always enjoyed the idea of many people, all lip syncing to one song. It's a simple concept, with a mixture of celebs, friends of mine and also random people we met on the streets of [[Mumbai]]” says [[Mikey McCleary|Mikey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Rajlaxmi Arora |url=http://www.sakaaltimes.com/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=5636257472827411913&amp;SectionId=4720227693873964122&amp;SectionName=Sunday%20Features&amp;NewsDate=20140619&amp;NewsTitle=Working%20with%20Mikey%20McCleary%20is%20a%20lot%20of%20fun:%20Anushka%20Manchanda |title= Working with Mikey McCleary is a lot of fun: Anushka Manchanda |publisher=www.sakaaltimes.com |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The video features well-known [[Bollywood]] actors such as [[Ranveer Singh]], [[Kalki Koechlin]] and [[Shraddha Kapoor]] singing along to the song.

The music video also features several other people from around [[Mumbai]] including an [[auto rickshaw]] driver, tourists, [[Expatriate|expats]], kids and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Prajakta Pandhare |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-let-the-jingles-play-1997354 |title= Let the Jingles Play |publisher=www.dnaindia.com |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
This video was shot at various places in [[Mumbai]] including [[Colaba Causeway]] and [[Castella de Aguada|Bandra Fort]].

[[File:ChesterBrownMarkAndMatthew.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Two images of Jesus drawn in different styles by Chester Brown|Brown's depiction of Jesus in the Gospels of Mark ''(left)'' and Matthew ''(right)'']]

[[Chester Brown]] adapted [[Gospel of Mark]] and part of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] to comics; installments appeared in his [[comic book]]s ''[[Yummy Fur (comics)|Yummy Fur]]'' and ''[[Underwater (comics)|Underwater]]''.  Brown ran the first installment of the Gospel of Mark  in ''Yummy Fur'' #4 in 1987, and left ''Matthew'' unfinished after cancelling ''Underwater'' in 1997.  Brown had planned to do all four of the canonical gospels,&lt;ref name="DD143"&gt;Juno, pg 143&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2011 stated that it is unlikely he will finish even Matthew.&lt;ref name="AJohnsGospel3" /&gt;

===Brown's beliefs===
{{Main|Chester Brown#Religious beliefs}}
Brown was brought up in a strictly Christian [[Baptist]]&lt;ref name="DD143" /&gt; household.&lt;ref name="citypages" /&gt; Over his career, he has gone back and forth between belief and non-belief in Christianity.&lt;ref name="SethInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GivingAndTaking" /&gt;

Brown took on his retelling of the [[Gospels]] to try to figure out what he really believed.&lt;ref name="TwoHandedMan" /&gt;

Begun in issue #4 of ''[[Yummy Fur (comics)|Yummy Fur]]'' in 1987, ''Mark'' started as a more-or-less straight, abridged illustration&lt;ref name="OldWineIllustrationQuote" /&gt; of the [[Gospel of Mark]].  The adaptation became more idiosyncratic as it developed, however.  On pages 55 and 56 Brown wove into the story a passage from the [[Secret Gospel of Mark]], a highly contentious and disputed document said to have been written by [[Clement of Alexandria]] that Professor [[Morton Smith]] claimed to have discovered in 1958.

===''Mark'' Sources===
When asked, Brown wrote in ''Yummy Fur'' #15 that he had a large number of sources for his adaptation of ''Mark''.  The most books he referred to most frequently were:&lt;ref name="YF15-24" /&gt;

The Gospel of Matthew started in issue #15 of ''[[Yummy Fur (comics)|Yummy Fur]]'' in 1989 and continued through to the premature end of ''[[Underwater (comics)|Underwater]]'' in 1997.  As of 2011, it has yet to be finished.

Brown's gospels gained a reputation for being "ingeniously blasphemous" mainly from his ''Matthew'' retellings.  In contrast to ''Mark'''s Jesus, who is "serene and always in control," in ''Matthew'' he is a scowling, balding figure, and "there is a more radicalized disbelief and a greater focus on the fleshy and earthly aspects of the story."&lt;ref name="OldWine" /&gt;  Brown's depiction of the Matthew's version of the Saviour is "a Jesus that shouts. He's a Jesus that screams", his face "haggard and worn, his dark hair matted and stringy".&lt;ref name="citypages" /&gt;

The [[Disciples of Christ|disciples]] are depicted as awkward, fearful and full of doubt, who are "barely able to reconcile the greatness of God with the miseries of their existence".&lt;ref name="citypages" /&gt;

As Brown has pointed out, starting with the full-issue installment of ''Matthew'' in ''Yummy Fur'' #32, he deliberately changed Jesus' third-person references to himself to first-person references in the dialogue.&lt;ref name="UW7-26" /&gt;

===''Matthew'' sources===
Amongst the books Brown cited for his ''Matthew'' adaptation are:
*Shaberg, Jane. ''The Illegitimacy of Jesus: A Feminist Theological Interpretation of the Infancy Narratives''. [[HarperCollins|Harper &amp; Row]] (1987)&lt;ref name="YF15-24" /&gt;
*[[Hyam Maccoby|Maccoby, Hyam]]. ''The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity''. Harper &amp; Row (1986)&lt;ref name="UW7-26" /&gt;
*[[Willis Barnstone|Barnstone, Willis]] (editor). ''The Other Bible: Jewish Pseudepigrapha, Christian Apocrypha, Gnostic Scriptures, Kabbalah, Dead Sea Scrolls''. Harper &amp; Row (1984)&lt;ref name="UW7-26" /&gt;
*[[Hugh J. Schonfield|Schonfield, Hugh]]. ''The Original New Testament''. Harper &amp; Row (1985)&lt;ref name="UW9-26" /&gt;

===Unfinished state===
Matthew has been on hiatus since 1997, with the story left with Jesus about to enter [[Jerusalem]].  Brown had long said he planned on coming back to the story, but in an interview at ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' in 2011, he said he would not likely finish it, as his heart was no longer in it.&lt;ref name="AJohnsGospel3" /&gt;

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
The Gospel adaptations have generally been well-accepted by fans and critics.  John Bell calls them Brown's most important uncollected work.&lt;ref name="Invaders160" /&gt;

To Francis Hwang of [[City Pages]], "the paradox of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] is brilliantly, heartbreakingly depicted" in the ''Gospel of Matthew''.&lt;ref name="citypages" /&gt;

==Relation to Brown's other work==
[[Religion|Religious]] and [[Bible|biblical]] elements have found their way into almost all of Brown's work:
*"[[The Little Man (comics)#The Twin|The Twin]]", a story of young Jesus adapted from a story from the [[Gnostic]] text ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', which appears in ''[[The Little Man (comics)|The Little Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Little Man'', page 163&lt;/ref&gt;
*Various religious imagery in ''[[Ed the Happy Clown]]'', especially Jesus' quote, "If thy hand offend thee cut it off", and the character Chet's religious remorse over having sex with Josie the vampire that leads to him murdering her
*his thinking about buying an issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' while sitting in [[Church (building)|church]] that opens ''[[The Playboy: A Comic Book|The Playboy]]''
*his battles with his mother over wearing his Sunday clothes in ''[[I Never Liked You]]''
*[[Louis Riel]]'s talking with [[God]] in the [[graphic novel]] of the [[Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography|same name]].
*''[[Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus]]'', which features adaptation of various biblical episodes

A '''coconut shy''' (or '''coconut shie''') is a traditional game frequently found as a sidestall at [[funfair]]s and [[fête]]s. The game consists of throwing wooden balls at a row of [[coconut]]s balanced on posts. Typically a player buys three balls and wins each coconut successfully dislodged. In some cases other prizes may be won instead of the coconuts.

The word "[[Wiktionary:shy#Verb|shy]]" in this context means to toss or throw.

==Origins==
The origins of the game are unclear, but early references to it appear in the late 1800s. It probably derives from the game of [[Aunt Sally]], with coconuts being seen as an exotic prize in the late 19th century and into the 20th century. The National Fairground Archive holds a photograph of a coconut shy dating from 1890.&lt;ref name="harries"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harries |first1=Hugh C. |year=2004 |title=Fun Made The Fair Coconut Shy |journal=Palms |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=77–82 |publisher=The International Palm Society |url=http://www.palms.org/palmsjournal/2004/vol48n2p77-82.pdf |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is mentioned by [[H. G. Wells]] in his book ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' in 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=H.G. |title=The Invisible Man |year=1897 |chapter=XII |isbn=1-58734-078-X |quote=The first to appear was the proprietor of the cocoanut shy, a burly man in a blue jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by [[E. Nesbit]] in ''[[The Story of the Treasure Seekers]]'' in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nesbit |first1=Edith |title=The Story of the Treasure Seekers |year=1899 |chapter=12 |quote=This was the case with H. O.'s idea of setting up a coconut-shy on this side of the Heath, where there are none generally.  We had no sticks or wooden balls, and the greengrocer said he could not book so many as twelve dozen coconuts without Mr Bastable's written order.  And as we did not wish to consult my Father it was decided to drop it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by P.G. Wodehouse in his short story, "The Purity of the Turf". The term is first listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 1903.

One theory suggests the coconut shy may have originated at the annual Pleasure Fair in [[Kingston upon Thames]] in 1867.&lt;ref name="harries" /&gt; That event took place on the town's Fairfield, not far from a coconut fibre mill on the Hogsmill river. The Surrey Comet reported how "for the small sum of one penny, you could have three throws with sticks with the prospect of getting a cocoa nut...". The coconuts could have come from nearby Middle Mill that advertised in the Surrey Comet as "The Patent Cocoa Fibre Co Ltd the only cocoa nut fibre manufactory in Surrey. All descriptions of mats in cocoa nut fibre made to order wholesale". Today the only reminder of Kingston's association with coconuts is a pub in Mill Street, which was the principal route between Fairfield and Middle Mill for several centuries. Called "The Cocoanut", it is not only spelled the old way but is furthermore the only pub in Britain with that name.

However, there is a similar game shown in etchings by Thomas Rowlandson. 1804 "Sketch on York Race Ground" shows a carnival game where sticks are thrown at various shaped objects atop posts; the drawing was etched and printed in 1805 titled "Gaffers at a Country Fair", and a revised version was printed in 1808 titled "Doncaster Fair the Industrious Yorkshirebites" (source: British Museum). An image in the lower left corner of "A Prospect of Greenwich Fair", from Manners and Cvstoms of ye Englyshe in 1849, no 13, Getty Images, shows the same game with taller poles and the coconuts shown atop them.

==Popular culture==
In the first episode of the second season of ''Midsomer Murders'', a murder takes place at a church charity fair while Detective Sgt. Troy is shown repeatedly attempting (and failing) to win at coconut shy. At one point he finally asks the children running the game, "Are these things nailed on!?"

The game is celebrated in the 1944 [[music hall]] song "[[I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts]]", best known from recordings and performances by [[Merv Griffin]] in the 1950s. More recently the song was used by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] in the film ''[[The Lion King]]''.

In [[Rumer Godden]]'s short story "Candy Floss," the titular Candy Floss is a doll who "assists" in running a coconut shy along with her owner. The story describes the set-up and management of an early 20th century coconut shy and life on the road as the group follows the fair in a van.

On ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]'', [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Howard Moon|Howard Moon]] makes a joke to Vince's coconut friend, Precious, about being "coconut shy", in the episode entitled "The Nightmare of Milky Joe".

In the song he wrote as part of the ''[[Submarine (2010 film)|Submarine]]'' OST, "Hiding Tonight", [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] talks about playing the coconut shy, winning a prize even if it's rigged, and not knowing when to stop

In an episode of the first series of ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', [[Lady Mary Crawley]] and [[List of Downton Abbey characters#Matthew Crawley|Matthew Crawley]] meet at a coconut shy at the village fair.  In the eighth episode of the final season, while discussing whether the unconscious Thomas would mind if his wet clothes were removed, [[List of Downton Abbey characters#Mrs Hughes|Mrs Hughes]] remarks, "He's past minding if we put him in a shy and threw coconuts."

The 1981 [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] song "[[Vanity Fair (Squeeze song)|Vanity Fair]]" contains the lyrics "Coconut shy but vanity fair".

In the episode "Coconut Shy" of ''[[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|Mr. Bean: The Animated Series]],'' Mr. Bean plays a coconut shy at a funfair, but, after failing to win, he sneaks inside and finds it is a cheat.

==Other countries==
[[File:Dosenwerfen 2 2008 036.jpg|thumb|German ''Dosenwerfen'']]

In German-speaking countries the game of ''Dosenwerfen'' is popular for school parties as well as in professional stalls at fairgrounds. It involves throwing balls at stacks of empty tin cans. In France, a similar game known as ''Chamboule-Tout'' is frequently found at fun fairs.

'''''Destricted''''' is a British-American [[Drama film|drama]] [[film series]] that explores the line where art and [[pornography]] intersect. The UK and US film releases had overlapping but different film lineups.

The UK version released in 2006 runs at 112 minutes and includes seven [[short film]]s: [[Marina Abramović]]'s ''Balkan Erotic Epic'', [[Matthew Barney]]'s ''Hoist'', [[Marco Brambilla]]'s ''Sync'', [[Larry Clark]]'s ''Impaled'', [[Gaspar Noé]]'s ''We Fuck Alone'', [[Richard Prince]]'s ''House Call'', and [[Sam Taylor-Johnson|Sam Taylor-Wood]]'s ''Death Valley''.

The US version (2010) runs at 129 minutes and includes eight short films: [[Marilyn Minter]]'s ''Green Pink Caviar'', Barney's ''Hoist'', [[Cecily Brown]]'s ''Four Letter Heaven'', Clark's ''Impaled'', Noé's ''We Fuck Alone'', Prince's ''House Call'', [[Sante D'Orazio]]'s ''Scratch This'', and [[Tunga (artist)|Tunga]]'s ''Cooking''.

==Plot==
''Destricted'' can be described as seven short art-house porn films:

* ''Balkan Erotic Epic'' (Marina Abramović) - An erotic comedy about myths from the Balkan around the sexual organs. (13 min 04s).
* ''House Call'' (Richard Prince) - A vintage sex scene recontextualized with edits and music. (12min 29s).
* ''Sync'' (Marco Brambilla) - Consists of very fast cuts from different porn films. (2min 15s).
* ''Hoist'' (Matthew Barney) - A juxtaposition of sexuality and industrial machinery. (14min 37s).
* ''Death Valley'' (Sam Taylor-Wood) - A man masturbates in the desert. (8min 25s).
* ''We Fuck Alone'' (Gaspar Noé) - A man and a woman masturbate to the same porn film in different rooms. (23min 31s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13633">'''Contrast''' in [[visual perception]] is the difference in appearance of two or more parts of a field seen simultaneously or successively (hence: brightness contrast, lightness contrast, color contrast, simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, etc.). 

'''Contrast''' in [[physics]] is a quantity intended to correlate with the perceived [[brightness]] contrast, usually defined by one of a number of formulae (see below) which involve e.g. the [[luminance]]s of the stimuli considered, for example: ΔL/L near the luminance threshold (known as Weber contrast&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynton.com/notes/Timo/Weber_and_contrast_ratio.html Charles Poynton on Weber contrast]&lt;/ref&gt;), or L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; for much higher luminances.&lt;ref&gt;IEC(50)845-02-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''contrast''' can also be due to differences of [[chromaticity]] specified by colorimetric characteristics (e.g. the [[color difference]] ΔE CIE 1976 UCS).

Visual [[information]] is always contained in some kind of visual contrast{{Clarify|date=February 2016}}, thus '''contrast''' is an essential performance feature of [[electronic visual display]]s.

The '''contrast''' of electronic visual displays depends on the electrical driving (analog or digital input signal), on the ambient illumination and on the direction of observation (i.e. [[viewing cone|viewing direction]]). 

==Luminance contrast==

The "luminance contrast" is the ratio between the higher luminance, L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;, and the lower luminance, L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, that define the feature to be detected. This ratio, often called '''contrast ratio''', CR, (actually being a [[luminance]] [[ratio]]), is often used for high luminances and for specification of the [[contrast ratio|contrast]] of [[electronic visual display]] devices. The luminance contrast (ratio), CR, is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless number]], often indicated by adding ":1" to the value of the quotient (e.g. CR = 900:1).

&lt;math&gt;CR = \frac{L_H}{L_L}&lt;/math&gt; with 1 ≤ CR ≤ &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;

A "contrast ratio" of CR = 1 means no contrast.

The contrast can also be specified by the '''contrast modulation''' (or '''Michelson contrast'''), C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, defined as:

&lt;math&gt;C_M = \frac{L_H -L_L}{L_H+L_L}&lt;/math&gt; with 0 ≤ C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1.

C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 means no contrast.

Another contrast definition sometimes found in the electronic displays field, K, is:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{L_H -L_L}{L_H}&lt;/math&gt; with 0 ≤ K ≤ 1.

K = 0 means no contrast, the maximum possible contrast, K&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; equals one.

==Color contrast==

Two parts of a [[visual field]] can be of equal luminance, but their color ([[chromaticity]]) is different. Such a ''color contrast'' can be described by a distance in a suitable chromaticity system (e.g. CIE 1976 UCS, [[Lab color space|CIELAB]], CIELUV). 

A metric for ''color contrast'' often used in the electronic displays field is the [[color difference]] ΔE*uv or ΔE*ab.

==Full-screen contrast==

During measurement of the luminance values used for evaluation of the contrast, the active area of the display screen is often completely set to one of the optical states for which the contrast is to be determined, e.g. completely white (R=G=B=100%) and completely black (R=G=B=0%) and the luminance is measured one after the other (time sequential).

This way of proceeding is suitable only when the display device does not exhibit ''loading effects'', which means that the luminance of the test pattern is varying with the size of the test pattern. Such loading effects can be found in [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-displays and in [[Plasma display|PDP]]s. A small [[test pattern]] (e.g. 4% window pattern) displayed on these devices can have significantly higher luminance than the corresponding full-screen pattern because the supply current may be limited by special electronic circuits.

==Full-swing contrast==
Any two test patterns that are not completely identical can be used to evaluate a contrast between them. When one test pattern comprises the completely bright state (full-white, R=G=B=100%) and the other one the completely [[dark state]] (full-black, R=G=B=0%) the resulting contrast is called ''full-swing contrast''. This contrast is the highest (maximum) contrast the display can achieve. If no test pattern is specified in a data sheet together with a contrast statement, it will most probably refer to the ''full-swing contrast''.

==Static contrast==

The standard procedure for contrast evaluation is as follows:

1 apply the first test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state,

2 measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the first test pattern and record the result,

3 apply the second test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state,

4 measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the second test pattern and record the result,

5 calculate the resulting ''static contrast'' for the two test patterns using one of the metrics listed above (CR,C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; or K).

When luminance and/or chromaticity are measured before the optical response has settled to a stable steady state, some kind of ''transient contrast'' has been measured instead of the ''static contrast''.

==Transient contrast==

When the image content is changing rapidly, e.g. during the display of video or movie content, the optical state of the display may not reach the intended stable steady state because of slow response and thus the apparent contrast is reduced if compared to the [[#Static_contrast|static contrast]].

|This illustration shows the repetitive impulse response between several states of gray when each state is applied for one frame only. It is obvious that the stationary luminance levels (indicated by dashed horizontal lines) are not reached within a single frame.
|}

==Dynamic contrast==

This is a technique for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens.
 
LCD-screens comprise a backlight unit which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel in front of it which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight can be (globally) dimmed when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity. In such a way the dark regions in dark images can be improved and the contrast between subsequent frames can be substantially increased.&lt;ref&gt;T. Shiga and S. Mikoshiba: "Reduction of LCTV Backlight Power and Enhancement of Gray Scale Capability by Using an Adaptive Dimming Technique", SID03 Digest, pp. 1364-1367&lt;/ref&gt; Also the contrast within one frame can be expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed). There is quite some [[digital signal processing]] required for implementation of the ''dynamic contrast control technique'' in a way that is pleasing to the human [[visual system]] (e.g. no flicker effects must be induced). 

The contrast within individual frames (''simultaneous contrast'') can be increased when the backlight can be locally dimmed. This can be achieved with backlight units that are realized with arrays of LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;H. Chen, et al.: "Locally pixel-compensated backlight dimming on LED-backlit LCD TV", JSID 15/12(2007), pp. 981-988&lt;/ref&gt; High-dynamic-range (HDR) LCDs are using that technique in order to realize (static) contrast values in the range of CR &gt; 100.000.&lt;ref&gt;H. Seetzen, et al.: "A [[High dynamic range rendering|High Dynamic Range]] Display System Using Low and High Resolution Modulators", SID03 Digest&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark-room contrast==

In order to measure the highest contrast possible, the dark state of the display under test must not be corrupted by light from the surroundings, since even small increments ΔL in the denominator of the ratio (L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; + ΔL) / (L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + ΔL) effect a considerable reduction of that quotient. This is the reason why most contrast ratios used for advertising purposes are measured under dark-room conditions (illuminance E&lt;sub&gt;DR&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 lx).

All emissive electronic displays (e.g. CRTs, PDPs) theoretically do not emit light in the black state (R=G=B=0%) and thus, under darkroom conditions with no [[Low-key lighting|ambient light]] reflected from the display surface into the light measuring device, the luminance of the black state is zero and thus the contrast becomes infinity.

When these display-screens are used outside a completely dark room, e.g. in the living room (illuminance approx. 100 lx) or in an office situation (illuminance 300 lx minimum), ambient light is reflected from the display surface, adding to the luminance of the dark state and thus reducing the contrast considerably.

A quite novel TV-screen realized with OLED technology is specified with a ''dark-room contrast'' ratio CR = 1.000.000 (one million). In a realistic application situation with 100 lx illuminance the contrast ratio goes down to ~350, with 300 lx it is reduced to ~120.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specsmanship.com STOP Specsmanship]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|ambient_contrast}}

=="Ambient contrast"==

The contrast that can be experienced or measured in the presence of ambient illumination is shortly called "ambient contrast".&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Kelley: "Diffuse Reflectance and Ambient Contrast Measurements Using a Sampling Sphere", SID ADEAC06 Digest, pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt; A special kind of "ambient contrast" is the contrast under outdoor illumination conditions when the illuminance can be very intense (up to 100.000 lx). The contrast apparent under such conditions is called "daylight contrast".&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Kelley, et al.: "Display Daylight Ambient Contrast Measurement Methods and Daylight Readability", JSID 14, 11, pp. 1019-1030&lt;/ref&gt;

Since always the dark areas of a display are corrupted by reflected light, reasonable "ambient contrast" values can only be maintained when the display is provided with efficient measures to reduce reflections by anti reflection and/or anti-glare coatings.

==Concurrent contrast==

When a test pattern is displayed that contains areas with different luminance and/or chromaticity (e.g. a checkerboard pattern), and an observer sees the different areas simultaneously, the apparent contrast is called ''concurrent contrast'' (the term ''[[simultaneous contrast]]'' is already taken for a different effect). Contrast values obtained from two subsequently displayed full-screen patterns may be different from the values evaluated from a checkerboard pattern with the same optical states. That discrepancy may be due to non-ideal properties of the display-screen (e.g. crosstalk, halation, etc.) and/or due to straylight problems in the light measuring device.

==Successive contrast==

When a contrast is established between two optical states that are perceived or measured one after the other, this contrast is called ''successive contrast''. The contrast between two full-screen patterns (full-screen contrast) always is a ''successive contrast''.

==Methods of measurement==

* contrast of direct-view displays
* contrast of projection displays

Depending on the nature of the display under test (direct-view or projection) the contrast is evaluated as a quotient of luminance values (direct-view) or as a quotient of illuminance values (projection displays) if the properties of the [[projection screen]] is separated from that of the projector. In the latter case, a checkerboard pattern with full-white and full-black rectangles is projected and the illuminance is measured at the center of the rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI IT7.215-1992: Data Projection Equipment and Large Screen Data Displays -- Test Methods and Performance Characteristics&lt;/ref&gt; The standard ANSI IT7.215-1992 defines test-patterns and measurement locations, and a way to obtain the [[luminous flux]] from illuminance measurements, it does not define however a quantity named "ANSI lumen".

If the reflective properties of the projection screen (usually depending on direction) are included in the measurement, the luminance reflected from the centers of the rectangles has to be measured for a (set of) specific [[viewing cone|directions of observation]].

[[Luminance]], contrast and [[chromaticity]] of [[Liquid crystal display|LCD-screens]] is usually varying with the [[viewing cone|direction of observation]] (i.e. [[viewing cone|viewing direction]]). The variation of electro-optical characteristics with [[Viewing cone|viewing direction]] can be measured sequentially by mechanical scanning of the [[viewing cone]] (''gonioscopic'' approach) or by simultaneous measurements based on [[conoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Becker: "Viewing-cone Analysis of LCDs: a Comparison of Measuring Methods", Proc. SID'96, pp. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FIRST LEGO League Open Championships''' are [[robotics]] competitions held and managed by [[FIRST LEGO League]] (FLL) Partners to bring FLL teams from many states, regions and countries together to compete in host cities around the world. These are the highest level of FLL competitions that are managed by organizations other than [[FIRST]]. The FIRST-managed global competition for FLL is [[FLL World Festival]]. There are usually multiple Open Championships each year.

==FIRST LEGO League Open European Championship==

A heavyweight bout between [[Mike Bernardo]] and [[Sergei Gur]] served as the event headliner. 

The event featured seven [[kickboxing]] matches, two of which were [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] title bouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=K-1 STar Wars|url=http://k-1sport.de/en/database/show_tournament.php?id=24|publisher=K-1 Sport.de|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight card included international fighters like [[Mike Bernardo]], [[Sergei Gur]], Phillip Trapani and [[Vitali Akhramenko]], as well as local fighters who were given a chance to prove themselves on their own turf, namely Ivica Perković, Ante Bilić and [[Josip Bodrožić]]. A German fighter of [[Croats|Croatian]] descent, [[Stefan Leko]] won his fight and in the final bout of the evening South African [[K-1]] [[Mike Bernardo]] defeated [[Sergei Gur]] of Belarus via TKO in the second round.

===FFC era===

In March 2013, Fight Channel announced a series of events under the Final Fight brand, with the addition of the word "[[Championship]]" (C) in the promotion's name, revealing its intention to organize title bouts in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redzic|first=Dea|title=Croatia gets serious fighting promotion|url=http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/hrvatska-dobila-ozbiljnu-borilacku-promociju-final-fight-serija-krece-19-travnja-u-splitu/670989.aspx|publisher=Index.hr|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also revealed was its new updated logo. FFC President Orsat Zovko announced that the promotion would hold at least 10 events in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hebar|first=Srđan|title=Domaći UFC debitira na Gripama|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/sport/vijesti/domaci-ufc-debitira-gripama-clanak-540976|publisher=Večernji list|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would feature [[kickboxing]] and [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] bouts in equal measure. Each event was to have ten fights, four on the preliminary [[fight card]] and six on the main card. This was a novelty considering that the first two Final Fight events featured only [[kickboxing]] matches. The events were to be broadcast [[live television|live]] on Fight Channel in Croatia, but also on many other international cable platforms. Zovko relied on the success of [[K-1 WGP|K-1 WGP Final]] event in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]], also produced and co-organized by Fight Channel in 2003 and ultimately won by [[Mirko Cro Cop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snidaric|first=Marko|title=Sensation: Zagreb gets K-1 WGP Final|url=http://www.24sata.hr/fight-club/senzacija-finale-k-1-s-mirkom-u-glavnoj-ulozi-u-areni-zagreb-298810|publisher=24 Sata|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first [[K-1 WGP]] Final ever held outside Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scalia|first=Rian|title=K-1 WGP Final in Zagreb|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2241:k-1-wgp-2012-finals-in-zagreb-on-march-15&amp;catid=36:k-1|publisher=Liverkick|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====FFC 3: Jurković vs. Cătinaș====
'''''FFC 3: Jurković vs. Cătinaș''''' was a mixed martial arts and kickboxing event produced by the Final Fight Championship that was held on April 19, 2013 at Gripe in [[Split, Croatia]]

The event was headlined by a heavyweight [[kickboxing]] bout between [[Igor Jurković]] and Raul Cătinaș.

Local fighter [[Agron Preteni]] who defeated favourite Romanian [[Andrei Stoica]] at the [[K-1 WGP]] Final several weeks earlier was also to fight at the event but he was forced to withdraw citing an injury. The promotion was unable to find a last-minute replacement for Preteni, which is why FFC 3 featured nine instead of the scheduled 10 fights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Site|first=Fight|title=We reveal fight card for FFC03|url=http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/otkrivamo-redoslijed-borbi-final-fighta-3-u-splitu/672940.aspx|publisher=Index.hr|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FFC03 Jurkovic vs Catinas.jpg|thumb|FFC 3: [[Igor Jurković]] vs. Raul Cătinaș]]

In the first preliminary MMA bout of the evening, Ivan Gluhak defeated Dejan Milošević via stoppage at the end of the second round. Gluhak vs. Milošević was the first [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] bout in Final Fight Championship's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zdelar|first=Zoran|title=Fantastic night with KO's and big win for Jurkovic|url=http://www.fightsite.hr/vijesti-iz-regije/fantasticna-noc-s-brutalnim-nokautima-i-velikom-pobjedom-jurkovica|publisher=FightSite|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the main event, [[Igor Jurković]] defeated Romanian Cătinaș via decision, while in the co-main event [[K-1 WGP]] Final semifinalist [[Pavel Zhuravlev (kickboxer)|Pavel Zhuravlev]] KO'ed Italy's Luca Panto.

FFC 3 was broadcast live in more than fifty countries, including [[TV station|national TV stations]] in Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Croatian national TV network [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]] later reported that FFC 3 had a 32% share in [[Nielsen ratings|TV ratings]], making the event the most watched show of that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Site|first=Fight|title=FFC in Osijek was seen by half a million TV viewers|url=http://fightsite.rs/vijesti/ponovo-odlicni-rezultati-ffc-u-osijeku-gledalo-pola-miliona-ljudi|publisher=FightSite.rs|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After numerous cancellations and injuries, Maro Perak. Perak called out Denis Stojnić, a former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter, but Stojnić refused the offer. Stojnić told the media that his goal was to make it back to the UFC and for that he needed a win over a big name like [[Mirko Cro Cop]], [[Mustapha Al Turk]], [[Andrei Arlovski]] or [[Jeff Monson]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spahic|first=Emir|title=Stojnić: I'm not afraid of anyone but I want to go back to UFC|url=http://www.sport24.ba/index.php/arhivavijesti21/item/2408-za-sport24-ba-denis-stojnic-nikog-se-ne-bojim-ali-zelim-povratak-u-ufc|publisher=Sport24.ba|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zdelar|first=Zoran|title=Zovko: In any serious promotion outsiders can't dictate terms|url=http://www.fightsite.hr/ufc/orsat|publisher=Fight Site|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Rights Distribution==


Final Fight Championship live shows media rights are distributed worldwide by Fighting Spirit.

==Rules==

The FFC holds fights at its events under the rules of [[Kickboxing rule sets|kickboxing]] and those of [[mixed martial arts]]. There is no standardized ratio between kickboxing and MMA fights; it varies from one event to another. The FFC [[Kickboxing rule sets|kickboxing rules]] are the modified rules of the legendary Japanese kickboxing promotion [[K-1]]. These include a [[10-point must system]], three rounds plus one extra round in case of a draw and no clinch allowed. Each round in a kickboxing fight has the duration of three minutes, and intermissions between each round are one minute long.

The FFC's [[MMA rules]] are the modified rules of the legendary Japanese MMA promotion [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]]. These include a [[10-point must system]] taken from the [[Mixed martial arts rules|Unified Rules of MMA]], but also allow soccer kicks and stomps, which are excluded from the [[Mixed martial arts rules|Unified Rules of MMA]]. The rules do not allow elbow strikes to the head. Each of the three rounds (there are no extra rounds) last five minutes, and intermissions between each round are one minute long.

The president of the promotion Orsat Zovko stated that the FFC was considering additional innovations in terms of rules to bring the promotion closer to the standards required by public TV networks that broadcast the event live during primetime hours. Specifically, he said that in the future the FFC could exclude techniques that may be considered excessively violent by the mainstream audience, such as soccer kicks and stomps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zdelar|first=Zoran|title=Are you a fan of soccer kicks and stomps?|url=http://www.fightsite.hr/vijesti-iz-regije/jeste-li-fan-soccer-kickova-i-stompova|publisher=Fight Site|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight classes and champions==
{{See also|List of FFC champions}}

The FFC is currently using six weight classes for its MMA fights and five weight classes for its kickboxing fights. Non-title fights have a one-pound leniency.

A '''flea circus''' is a [[circus (performing art)|circus]] [[sideshow]] attraction in which [[flea]]s are attached (or appear to be attached) to miniature carts and other items, and encouraged to perform circus acts within a small housing.

== History ==
[[File:The Go-As-You-Please Race, as seen through a Magnifying Glass.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|"The Go-As-You-Please Race, as seen through a Magnifying Glass", engraved by J. G. Francis, from an article by [[Charles Frederick Holder|C. F. Holder]] in ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'', 1886]]

The first records of flea performances were from [[watchmaker]]s who were demonstrating their metalworking skills. In 1578, Mark Scaliot produced a lock and chain that were attached to a flea. The first recorded flea circus dates back to the early 1820s, when an Italian impresario called Louis Bertolotto advertised an “extraordinary exhibition of industrious fleas” on [[Regent Street]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawton |first=Graham |last2= |first2= |date=22 December 2012|title=Fleadom or death: Reviving the glorious flea circus |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |volume= |issue=2896 |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some flea circuses persisted in very small venues in the United States as late as the 1960s. The flea circus at [[Belle Vue Zoological Gardens]], Manchester, England, was still operating in 1970. At least one genuine flea circus still performs (at the annual [[Oktoberfest]] in Munich, Germany&lt;ref name="Birk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flohcirkus.de/geschichte |title=Geschichte |publisher=Flohcirkus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Svensons in the UK occasionally use real fleas, but most flea circuses are a sideline of magicians and clowns, and use electrical or mechanical effects instead of real fleas.

== Techniques with real fleas ==

Fleas typically live only for a few months and are not trained.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  Fleas are observed to see if they have a predisposition for jumping or walking. Once sorted, they are harnessed by carefully wrapping a thin gold wire around their neck.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', May 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the harness, the fleas usually stay in it for life. The harnesses are attached to the props and the strong legs of the flea allow them to move objects significantly larger than themselves. Jumping fleas are used for kicking small lightweight balls. They are carefully given a ball; when they try to jump away (which is not possible because of the harness), they shoot the ball instead. Running fleas can pull small carts and vehicles or rotate a [[Ferris wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hund, Katze, Maus. 10 February 2010 VOX&lt;/ref&gt;

There are historical reports of fleas glued to the base of the flea circus enclosure. Miniature musical instruments were then glued to the flea performers and the enclosure was heated. The fleas fought to escape, giving the impression of playing instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noonco.com/flea/faq.htm |title=Flea-Circus.com |publisher=Noonco.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques without real fleas ==

Some flea circuses may appear to use real fleas, but in fact do not. A variety of electrical, magnetic, and mechanical devices have been used to augment exhibits. In some cases, these mechanisms are responsible for all of the "acts", with loose fleas in the exhibit maintaining the illusion. These circuses are known as "Humbug" flea circuses. [[Michael Bentine]] gave a mechanical flea circus a regular slot on his television show, ''[[It's a Square World]]'' in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2LF04Y9n5hJTHK1l6ffLhPc/the-rise-and-demise-of-the-flea-circus |title=The rise and demise of the flea circus |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=BBC Radio4 |publisher=BBC |access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much the same way that viewers know that a woman will not actually be [[Sawing a woman in half|cut in half]], the magician's showmanship allows viewers to [[Suspension of disbelief|suspend disbelief]] in order to enjoy the show.

[[File:FourArgumentsForTheEliminationOfTelevision 0.jpg|thumb|1st edition (publ. [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]])]]
'''''Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television''''' (1978) is a book by [[Jerry Mander]], who argues that many of the problems with television are inherent in the medium and technology itself, and thus cannot be reformed.

Mander spent 15 years in the advertising business, including five as president and partner of [[Freeman, Mander &amp; Gossage]], San Francisco, a nationally-known advertising agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television|last= Mander|first= Jerry|authorlink= Jerry Mander|year= 1978|origyear= First copyright 1977|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|location= [[New York City|New York, New York]]|isbn= 978-0-688-08274-1|page= 375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's summary==

In an interview with Nancho.net's W. David Kubiak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nancho.net/advisors/mander.html |title=Nancho Consults Jerry Mander |author=W. David Kubiak |accessdate=2010-11-09 |quote=They give power to a very small number of people to speak into the brains of everyone else in the system night after night after night with images that make people turn out in a certain kind of way. It affects the psychology of people who watch. It increases the passivity of people who watch. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908003052/http://www.nancho.net/advisors/mander.html |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mander summarizes his book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Well, one of the points of the book is that you really can't summarize complex information. And that television is a medium of summary or reductionism – it reduces everything to slogans. And that's one criticism of it, that it requires everything to be packaged and reduced and announced in a slogan-type form.

But let me say this: the book is not really four arguments, it's really hundreds of arguments broken down into four categories. And the categories have to do with a variety of effects that are not normally discussed. Most criticisms of television have to do with the [[television program]] content. People say if there is less violence on television or less sexism on television, or less this or less that, television would be better. If there were more programs about this or more programs about that, then we'd have "good television".

My own feeling is that that is true – that it's very important to improve the program content  – but that television has effects, very important effects, aside from the content, and they may be more important. They organize society in a certain way. They give power to a very small number of people to speak into the brains of everyone else in the system night after night after night with images that make people turn out in a certain kind of way. It affects the psychology of people who watch. It increases the passivity of people who watch. It changes family relationships. It changes understandings of nature. It flattens perception so that information, which you need a fair amount of complexity to understand it as you would get from reading, this information is flattened down to a very reduced form on television. And the medium has inherent qualities which cause it to be that way.

And the book is really about television considered from a holistic point of view, from a biological point of view – perceptual, environmental, political, social, experiential, as well as the concrete problems of whether a program is silly or not. But other people deal with that very well. My job was to talk about television from many of these other dimensions which are not usually discussed.

The '''Gold Cup''' is the premier open British&lt;!--Great Britain or UKGBNI?--&gt;
[[contract bridge]] competition for [[Duplicate bridge#Team game|teams of four]]. (Teams may comprise up to six players but only four take part at any one time.) It was first contested in the 1931/32 season, making it one of the oldest contract bridge tournaments anywhere. The event was run by the [[British Bridge League]] through 1999 and subsequently by [[Bridge Great Britain]], a newly formed not-for-profit organisation. Except for 1933/34 the format has always been [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] (knock-out).

The 2013 Gold Cup was the 76th. There were eight annual competitions before 1940 and 68 more have been completed since its resumption in 1946.&lt;ref name=winners&gt;[http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/Gold%20Cup%20Roll%20of%20Honour.htm Archives: Gold Cup Roll of Honor].

[[File:Islas Canarias-Tenerife-La Victoria de Acentejo-Guachinche- Casa Pepe 2013-05-21 13-18.jpg|thumb|]]
A '''guachinche''' is a typical [[Canary Island]] establishment, more widely spread on the island of [[Tenerife]] and to a lesser extent in [[Gran Canaria]], where a locally produced wine is served accompanied by homemade traditional food.

== History ==
The origins of guachinches lie in the wine-tasting parties that the local wine growers organized at certain dates of the year to sell their products (in particular the famous [[malvasia]] wine) directly to the British buyers and later to the local consumers, to avoid having to deal with intermediaries. 
The guachinches are usually situated next to important wine regions of the Island of Tenerife: especially in the northern municipalities, such as Tacoronte, El Sauzal, Tegueste, La Matanza de Acentejo, La Victoria de Acentejo, Santa Úrsula, La Orotava and Los Realejos. A few of them can also be found in the Güímar Valley (that is in Arafo, Candelaria and Güímar municipalities).

== Etymology ==
The word '''“bochinche”''', mainly used in Gran Canaria, and its variant '''“guachinche”''', more typical of Tenerife, is used in the Canarian dialect of Spanish to refer to a popular establishment where local wine and typical foods are served. According to the historical-etymological dictionary of Canarian dialect, by Marcial Morera, it derived from the Latin American Spanish word “bochinche” (derived from “buche” – “sip, gulp”), which means 'a poor tavern'. The other version claims that the word "guachinche" comes from the English expression "I'm watching you!", apparently used by the British buyers to indicate that they were ready to try the local products and the Canarian farmers understood the phrase as "Is there a guachinche?", that is if there was a party nearby (or a stand or shop) set up to taste the wine before finally making the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academiacanarialengua.org/consultas/2010/11/sobre-bochinche |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029044131/http://www.academiacanarialengua.org/consultas/2010/11/sobre-bochinche/ |archivedate=2016-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Long before the Canarian wines received their first [[Appellation]] of Origin (this was the region of Tacoronte-Acentejo), the guachinches were mounted in a room or a garage in the family house, where the wife of the winemaker offered some tapas made in the family kitchen to accompany the home-made wine.

The guachinche's clients don’t look for an exquisite service or commodities, they value above all the unique local wines and a familiar and traditional cuisine: rich homemade stews, such as chickpeas with smoked meats (garbanzas), rabbit in spicy salmorejo sause, pork ribs with potatoes and corn on the cob, stuffed aubergines (bubangos), potatoes with mojo sause, carne fiesta (fried marinated pork and potatoes), carne de cabra (goat’s meat), churros de pescado (local battered fish), etc. For dessert you can taste the baked milk flan or a typical local dessert called bienmesabe, or you can also enjoy the locally grown fruits like mango, bananas, etc.
In essence, the guachinches have emerged as an offshoot of wine production activity, and not as proper restaurants or food establishments. For this reason, they have never been regulated and guachinche owners didn’t pay any taxes for this activity, although over the time many winemakers and their families became restaurateurs on a professional basis. So with the time along with legal guachinches plenty of clandestine establishments started to appear which served cheap wine from Latin America as their own and actually functioned as restaurants but without the obligations to comply with the fiscal and health requirements applicable to restaurants.
In recent years, legal restaurants and bars have complained heavily about the unfair competition from guachinches, since those attracted customers by ridiculously low prices and a wide range of dishes on the menu. So in 2013, the Canarian government has issued a decree 83/2013 regulating the guachinche activity as a complementary tourist activity aimed at a preservation of local traditions and the natural rural environment and introducing a number of rules that limit the food and beverages that can be served at a guachinche and define its operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/boc/2013/153/001.html |title=BOC - 2013/153. Viernes 9 de Agosto de 2013 - Anuncio 4276 |publisher=Gobiernodecanarias.org |date=2013-08-09 |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules include, but are not limited to, the following:
[[File:Placa distintivo Guachinche.jpg|thumb|a distinctive guachinche plaque]]
# The wine to be marketed must come from vineyards belonging to or exploited by the person who runs the activity and must be of own production; the winery must be duly registered in the Register of Agrarian Industries and in the Register of wine producers.
# The person who runs the activity must accredit the origin of the wine through the harvest and production declarations that must be presented in accordance with European regulations.
# The personnel of the establishment must be certified for sanitary food manipulation training according to the applicable specific regulations.
# The wine marketed in the establishment must meet the safety and quality characteristics of this type of product according to the applicable legislation. 
# The opening period of the establishment must not exceed four months a year; in any case, ceasing the activity from the moment the home-grown wine is depleted. 
# A maximum of three different culinary dishes can be offered and served, as well as pickles, nuts and fruit grown by the owner of the activity or produced in the area. The food must be made mainly with ingredients also grown or produced by the owner of the activity or with local products or rooted in the local culinary tradition. The supply of beverages shall be limited to home-grown wine and water. 
# The owner must inform customers of the prices of products offered through a listing placed in the exterior and interior of the establishment and invoice the services in accordance with the prices of that listing. 
# The owner must inform customers of the opening period of the establishment and of the days and hours of operation, by placing an information poster at the entrance.
# The owner must display the distinctive plaque at the entrance (in the photo).

== Curiosities ==
*Traditional guachinche opening day is the day of St. Andres, 30 November, otherwise called the young wine festival. The wine of the new harvest is traditionally served with roasted chestnuts, maturing at the same time, and grilled sardines. Most guachinches open on that day and close when all their wine is sold out. For this reason, a guachinche season normally lasts from late autumn till early spring, as with the onset of summer they would have either run out of wine or would be obliged to comply with the maximum permitted opening time.
*Canarians love their guachinches so much that they have traditional "guachinche routes» (rutas de guachinches), when in a single day they visit several places at once. To avoid getting lost on the way, they even created a special mobile application Guachapp.
*Despite the fact that guachinches represent the cultural heritage of Tenerife, the word «guachinche» cannot be legally used by Canarians. In 2009 it was registered as a trademark by an individual, and since then the Canary Islands government is trying to challenge the registration, and in parallel to register the expression «guachinches de Tenerife», so that the legal establishments of this category can use it in their business names&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.eldia.es/tenerife/2015-04-10/5-empresa-registra-marca-guachinche.htm |title=Una empresa registra la marca guachinche. eldia.es |publisher=Web.eldia.es |date=2015-04-10 |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2015/08/icca-tumba-registro-marca-guachinche-tenerife/ |title=El ICCA ‘tumba’ el registro de la marca Guachinche de Tenerife |publisher=Diario de Avisos |date=2016-03-01 |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Most guachinches do not accept credit cards.

'''''Heracles’ Bow''''' is a collection of ten essays, written by [[James Boyd White]] in 1985, that examine [[forensic rhetoric]] as it creates community, as an example of what White calls [[constitutive rhetoric]].  White supported the [[Law and literature|Law and Literature Movement]]. This movement was in contradiction to two other movements of the 1970/80s: [[Law and economics]] and [[critical legal studies|Critical Legal Studies (CLS)]], holding that a scientific view of law left little room to examine the rhetoric of written and spoken law itself.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard A. “Law and Literature: A Relation Reargued.” Virginia Law Review 72.8 (1986): 1351-1392. JSTOR. Web. 23. April. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content Summary==

In ''Heracles' Bow: Persuasion and Community in Philoctetes'',  through an analysis of the ancient Greek play [[Philoctetes]], distinguishes between two methods of persuasion, dolos (deceitful persuasion) and peitho (genuine statements made for the purpose of forming community).  White compares using rhetoric on another person as a [[means-to-an-end]] against viewing the person as an [[end-in-itself]].  He relates this to the teaching of law through a discussion of methods that an attorney should use in the art of persuading others.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;White, James Boyd. Heracles' Bow: Essays on the Rhetoric and Poetics of the Law. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In, ''Rhetoric and Law: The Arts of Cultural and Communal Life'', White compares two definitions of law: his own, which is that law is a branch of rhetoric, and the traditional view of law as institutional authority.  He outlines three elements specific and necessary to legal rhetoric: first, that lawyers need to speak the language of their [[audience]], or that law is culture-specific; second, that law is always a creative performance; and third, that legal rhetoric contains an ethical identity, or [[ethos]].&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

''The Study of Law as an Intellectual Activity'', originally a lecture given to a class of first-year law students, outlines how learning law is not simply memorizing a set of rules. White claims that, in learning law, it is imperative that students first identify their own ethos to become effective practitioners.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

In ''The Invisible Discourse of the Law'', originally a lecture given to educators on writing, White argues that [[legal language]] is difficult to understand because the law is generalized and non-specific.  These characteristics mean that legal language is always subject to the interpretation of the reader, thus creating a rhetorical situation.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

White contends in ''Reading Law and Reading Literature'' that law is a language and a lawyer must also operate as a [[literary critic]]. He explains how law is its own form of language, which means that it is subject to open interpretation. The language of the law creates a [[legal culture]] just as spoken languages have cultures associated with them.  A lawyer must use good judgment in interpreting the law just as individuals use good judgment in interpreting how to speak to one another.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

In ''The Judicial Opinion and the Poem'' White examines how reading poems and cases during his legal training enforced his belief that the practice of law is an art, and one can use this training to discover Truth.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

In the next essay, White reasons that it is impossible for a narrative to exclude the author’s values, no matter how factual it may be.  Using [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbons]]’ [[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]] as an example, he illustrates how the form, syntax, and presentation of any writing necessarily shape the way a reader receives the facts. As a result, the opinion of the reader is shaped by the opinion of the writer.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

''Telling Stories in the Law and Ordinary Life'' explores how legal stories take root in the stories told by [[Layperson|laypeople]] in social situations. He argues that it is impossible to tell a story in the language of the law without relying on a non-legal situation.

Does [[criminal law]] make sense as a system of meaning? White seeks to answer that question through an examination of the purpose of criminal law, which he concludes to be placing blame. He examines the rhetoric of criminal law in order to identify its true audience.

In the last essay, White constructs his own [[Socratic dialogue]] to determine whether the ancient [[Platonian]] argument of rhetoric vs. dialectic can be applied to modern law. He argues that today’s attorneys are a modern day version of Plato's "[[Gorgias]]" and concludes with the importance of maintaining ethics in the practice of law.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

==Scholarly Review==

[[David D. Cole|David Cole]] argues that White’s view and the [[Critical legal studies|CLS]] are not that different; both are built on [[ideology]]. Cole criticizes White for relying too much on law as an end in itself, and failing to address the practical application of tangible, [[codified law]].&lt;ref&gt;Cole, David. "Against Literalism." Stanford Law Review 40.2 (1988): 545-60. JSTOR. Web. 25 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Richard Weisberg|Weisberg]]’s main criticism of ''Heracles’ Bow'' is that White’s explanation remains too abstract. He contends that White does not express any knowledge of the actual law or the application thereof. Weisburg argues that White relies on law too much as a function of pure rhetoric, and that he ignores the scientific aspect of the discipline. This is a common criticism of the [[Law and literature|Law and Literature Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, Richard H. "Law and Rhetoric." Michigan Law Review 85.5/6 (1987): 920-29. JSTOR. Web. 26 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria Kahn]] claims that White’s view of the law ignores the relationship of law and inequality. She criticizes his work for its lack of explaining how the rhetoric of law is applied to different genders, races, and classes in different ways. She argues that seeing law simply as a [[rhetorical situation]] ignores the real-life power struggles within the application of law to society.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Victoria. “Rhetoric and the Law.” The Johns Hopkins University Press 19.2 (1989): 21-34. JSTOR. Web. 23. April. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hexbug''' is a brand of toy [[automaton]]s developed and distributed by Innovation First. Hexbug was inspired by [[BEAM robotics]], and uses many elements of it.  Originally released in the US through [[RadioShack]], it is now sold in most major retail stores.  The original was based on 6-legged arthropods, but now comes in several different varieties. The name "Hexbug", however, has more to do with the shape of the packaging it is sold in than the number of legs it has.

== Varieties ==
[[File:Hexbug Spider.JPG|thumb|Hexbug Spider, as available in December 2010.]]

===Original Hexbug===
This '''Hexbug''' is an autonomous toy bug that reacts to loud sounds and pressure on the antennae and scurries around the room. It was the first Hexbug made and is classified by the [[NATO Phonetic Alphabet]] rather than color; Alpha (orange), Bravo (green), Charlie (blue), Delta (yellow), and Echo (red). There are 5 different original hexbugs and all are different shapes.  Released in 2007 at [[RadioShack]].

===Spider===
The Spider is a remote-controlled hexapod robot. The movement is remote controlled, capable of changing direction by its head rotation. The head determines the direction by pressing the leg joints into moving forward as the head pointed. It is powered by three replaceable LR44 (AG13) [[Button cell]] batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hexbug.com/mechanical/spider|accessdate=17 September 2016|title=Spider design reference from HEXBUG.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle Spider===
The Battle Spider is a variant of the Spider. Equipped with LED light and sensor, it can engage in laser-tag battle. Unlike the standard Spider and the Battle Spider 2.0, the first edition of Battle Spider can only move forward. It is powered by three replaceable LR44 (AG13) batteries.&lt;ref name="Battle Spider from HEXBUG.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hexbug.com/battlespider|accessdate=17 September 2016|title=Battle Spider from HEXBUG.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle Spider 2.0===
The Battle Spider 2.0 is a revised edition of the Battle Spider, it is capable of walking backward like the standard Spider. It is powered by three replaceable LR44 (AG13) batteries.&lt;ref name="Battle Spider from HEXBUG.com"/&gt;

===Scarab===
The Scarab is a fast moving mechanical robot made to resemble a beetle with six legs.  The movement is autonomous and random, reacting to obstacles with a rapid change in direction.  The Scarab will automatically get back onto its feet if it is upside-down. Internal gears and motors are visible through its translucent shell. It is powered by three replaceable LR44 (AG13) batteries.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major improvement is that they have five spines on their back compared to the three spines on the v2. Other improvements include less oscillation. With less oscillation, they can move faster. Their spines gives them the ability to climb vertically between two suitably spaced plates or tube walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/122121-hexbug-nano-v2-now-they-climb-as-well|title=Hexbug nano V2: Now they climb as well - Pocket-lint|website=www.pocket-lint.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the back now have five spines, they are very stable on their backs compared to the v2 and self-righting on their backs is now very stable.

A variety of clear plastic tube habitats are offered with them. These range from a simple vertical tube to demonstrate climbing, through to multi 'bot habitats with multiple horizontal arenas linked by curved climbing tubes in clear plastic. A variety of additional [[construction set]] tube parts are available, including twisted tubes and funnels also black holes.

===Crab===
The crab was the second bot manufactured for HEXBUG. It could only move from side to side and reacted to obstacles and sound. It was most likely removed due to a common defect with its back legs. Removal Date: Sep 2014

===Larva===
Larva was a worm-like robot that had an infrared eye and avoided objects in its path. However, its battery usage was very strong. Removal Date: Feb 2015

''Hyper Force'' received mixed to positive reception from critics since its release, with praise towards the graphics, controls and gameplay, while the music, sound effects and technical shortcomings of the game were regarded as negative points.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:JAG Hyper Force.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of the game. The status bar shows the score, player's health, number of lives, weapon energy and money earned.]]
''Hyper Force'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]], side-scrolling, action-adventure platform game which takes places on the fictional planet Terran where the player controls a lone soldier from the Interstellar Special Forces across four areas, each having a set of six levels to travel through on a mission to destroy the megacorporation Trans Con, who plans to launch a attack against [[Earth]]. Progress is manually kept by the cartridge's [[EEPROM]] by saving on either of the three slots available by pausing the game at any time and pressing Option on the controller and they are allowed to resume their last game by pressing Option at the title screen and choosing either saved slot to continue. The game cartridge also keeps [[Score (game)|high-scores]] and settings made by the player as well.

Throughout the course of the game, the player fights against a variety of enemies and robots, who randomly drop power-ups, health, tech items that increase the score and money to pick up after being destroyed, with the later being used at the Interstellar Special Forces shop after finishing a level to buy new weapons and their respective upgrades, health recharge and lives, though items are also scattered in the level to pick up as well. After finishing six levels, a story cutscene is shown to progress the story. In various levels there hidden locations that contains items and other important elements introduced later in the game. Introduced in the first level are ropes that the player can hang on and traverse through the level while also shoot enemies when hanging, but players can also hang off from them by pressing down or jump from them by pressing both the jump and the shoot buttons at the same time. 

Also scattered through the level are obstacles such as spikes and traps, with more obstacles such as destructible blocks and colored barriers that obstruct the pathway of the player, with the later becoming more important when other colored barriers are introduced and these can be opened by finding their respective colored switch. When shooting at the enemies on the ground, players can also aim their shots by crouching or looking up. Players can also collide with enemies but they do not receive points by doing so and if they die, they are sent back to the start of the level but item pick ups are not respawned and the game is over once all lives are lost.

== Plot ==
In the year 2099 before the start of a new century, [[Human|mankind]] has managed to expand into the [[star]]s through development of devices that allows [[interstellar travel]] possible and at a short time, with technological breaktroughs creating new levels of [[Health care|medical care]] and [[automation]] but [[megacorporation]]s have unlimited desires to expand their operations in [[outer space]], with Trans Con being the most ruthless by decimating multiple [[planet]]s and harnessing resources to break the restrains of the Terran High Command. Not wanting to lose corporative support, politicians chosed to ignore the situation, which became more delicated and as a result they turn to the Interstellar Special Forces to erradicate Trans Con and their empire, by destroying their multiple [[Headquarters|bases of operations]] and affiliated cops, guardians and soldiers without involvement of the population by sending a lone soldier from the [[special forces]], who faces the possibility of being [[disowned]] by the government if he fails in completing the task.&lt;ref&gt;Hyper Force game manual (Atari Jaguar, US)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lone soldier destroys Trans Con's [[Mining#Mining industry|mining bases]] and crosses through Varmox City, he receives a message from ISF that the megacorporation has created a [[supersoldier]] after arriving at their [[Rocket garden|rocket garden fortress]] and by the time he arrives at their secret laboratories, receives another message that Trans Con is preparing to start a clone war against Earth unless he stops their scientists in the area. Although the lone soldier succeeds in stopping the scientists on the laboratories, one of the supersoldiers named the Trans Con Warrior manages to escape. After destroying it, the soldier activates a [[Self-destruct|self-destruct button]] that annihilates Trans Con alongside their empire with the lone soldier escaping from their homeworld, returning to Earth and he is honored for his work.

== Development and release ==
''Hyper Force'' was first previewed in 1994 on French magazine ''CD Consoles'', featuring a different graphical artstyle from the final release.&lt;ref name="CDChf"/&gt; Their preview article also mentioned Visual Impact working on a second project for the Jaguar, which was inspired by ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''.&lt;ref name="CDChf"/&gt; It was primarily developed in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="CDChf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/CD%20Consoles/cdconsoles_numero05/Page%20076.jpg|title=Dossier - Ils Arrivent Sur Jaguar - Hyper Force/Jaguar|magazine=CD Consoles|issue=5|publisher=Pressimage|date=March 1995|page=76|lang=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Edge_UK_020#page/n61/mode/2up|title=Europe: the state of play|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=20|date=May 1995|pages=62–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal testing reports in regards to the game from [[Atari Corporation]] indicated that many elements of the game were criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-jaguar-hyper-force_30121.html|title=Atari Jaguar - Hyper Force|website=''atarimania.com''|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was showcased in a playable state at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 1995|E3 1995]], where it was slated to be published by Computer West, who published both ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]'' and  ''[[Pinball Fantasies]]'' for the Jaguar in 1995 respectively&lt;ref name="E31995hf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MANIAC.N020.1995.06/MANIAC.N020.1995.06-DURiAN_Searchable#page/n39/mode/1up|title=Feature - XT Generation Report - Atari Jaguar|magazine=[[:de:M!

''Hyper Force'' received mixed to positive reviews since its release. Eric Mylonas of ''[[GameFan]]'' gave a positive outlook to the game and compared it with ''[[Contra (series)|Contra]]'', praising the graphics and difficulty while criticizing the color choices in the game and limited sprite animations, remarking that "What here is good but a little more animation would have been nice".&lt;ref name="DHGFhf"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=C.

David Sherwin of ''The Atari Times'' gave positive remarks to the gameplay, controls and graphics but criticized the music, sound effects, the process of saving the game and bugs in regards to restoring the game. He summarized by saying "''Hyper Force'' doesn't bring very many new things to modern console gaming and, with its somewhat dated side-scrolling blaster action and limited graphic environments, is definitely showing its age. That being said, ''Hyper Force'' is a polished and professional effort that will provide hours of entertainment for most Jaguar gamers".&lt;ref name="TAThf"/&gt;

'''''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action''''' is a 1998 [[autobiography]] written by [[Jackie Chan]] with help from [[Jeff Yang]], written before Chan's success ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]''&amp;ndash;a special edition of the book was released in 1999 telling events occurring after Chan's success with the movie. The book tells of Chan's life story from when he was born to several months after ''Rush Hour'' was made. The last few pages of the book contain a Top 10 list of Chan's favorite stunts and fights and an almost complete [[Jackie Chan Filmography|filmography]] of him. The book was dedicated to his parents.

On January 7, 2010, on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', Chan stated that he has had plans since around 2008 to produce a musical film of his life based on the book, which would be entitled ''I Am Jackie Chan: The Musical''. The film was inspired due to Chan's early love for musicals, with such films as ''[[The Sound of Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?entry_id=54906 |title=Jackie Chan planning musical |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle| date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2010-01-09 | first=Steve | last=Schultz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">The '''International Association of Women in Radio and Television''' (IAWRT) is a women's organization involved in the [[broadcasting]] industry. [https://www.iawrt.org/about More]
The organisation of professional women working in, or educating about, electronic and allied media, has a mission to strengthen initiatives which ensure women’s views and values are integral to media programming and to advance the impact of women in media.

IAWRT has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council ([[United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council|ECOSOC]])

==History==

IAWRT was founded in 1949 and held the first [[Academic conference|conference]] of its own in 1951.

One of the founders of the [[organization]], [[Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/bwsa/bios/goot.html Willemien Hendrika (Posthumus-) van der Goot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; left an extensive collection of papers from its early years, which are housed in the [[International Archives for the Women's Movement]] ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Informatiecentrum en Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IIAV)}}), located within the [[Atria Institute on gender equality and women's history|Atria Institute]], a major women's archive based in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiav.nl IIAV homepage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s through 1980s, IAWRT was a friendship organization between women [[journalists]] on either side of the [[Iron Curtain]], intended to promote peace.  At first, only one member from each country was permitted to join.  As times changed, IAWRT became more of a networking organization for [[Mass media|media]] women, &lt;ref&gt;http://iawrt.org/sites/default/files/field/pdf/2014/02/Bok_IAWRT%5B1%5D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

As IAWRT continued to evolve it included female digital journalists and  media academics, and IAWRT began implementing media projects in various parts of the global south, supported by [[Forum_for_Women_and_Development|FOKUS]] in Norway. It has run projects and reported on [https://www.iawrt.org/sites/default/files/field/pdf/2016/08/IAWRTGenderMediaReport_2015_final_allcorr.pdf gender representation on the media] and released a free [https://www.iawrt.org/sites/default/files/field/pdf/2017/11/IAWRT%20Safety%20Manual.Download.10112017.pdf safety handbook for women journalists.] As well it has taken an increasing participatory role in the annual [[NGO_Committee_on_the_Status_of_Women,_New_York|NGO-CSW]] and [[United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women|CSW]] held annually around and in UN headquarters in New York, USA.

==Current status==
{{update|date=November 2010}}

The organisation today has 14 chapters across the world and continues to organise regional and international conferences, film festivals, workshops and training for the professional development of its members, including safety training. https://www.iawrt.org/events

The '''Jon Sims Center for the Performing Arts''' (JSCPA) was a multidisciplinary [[performing arts]] center in [[San Francisco, California]] that supported artistic voices of the [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) communities.  The Center provided resources to support and promote new and existing arts programs.  JSCPA was the "official" home to many groups, including City Swing with Gail Wilson, the original award-winning [[Vocal Minority (singing group)|Vocal Minority]] (one of the nation's first openly LGBT mixed jazz/popular vocal ensembles), the Fakir Intensives Body Piercing Seminars and the [[San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus]] (prior to the formation of a competing organization, Golden Gate Performing Arts, Inc. and the SFGMC defection from The Center.)

At its height, the resources JSPCA provided artists included four performance spaces/rehearsal studios as well as funding for at least one artist-in-residence annually.

The Center opened in 1978 following the formation of the [[Pride parade|Gay Freedom Day]] Marching Band and Twirling Corps (now the [[San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band]].  Founder Jon R. Sims, who died of [[AIDS]] in 1984, also began the [[San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus]]. 

The Center closed in November 2006 following a financial crisis that included the disappearance of $35,000 in grant money.  Longer term problems included the lack of a stable, long-term board and executive director, despite determined efforts to keep the institution alive.  

The Sims Center was located at 1519 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA 94103.

'''Monsoon Multimedia''' is a company that manufactures, develops and sells [[video streaming]] and [[place-shifting]] devices that allow consumers to view and control live [[television]] on [[personal computer|PC]]s connected to a local (home) network or from remotely from a [[broadband]]-connected PC or [[mobile phone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/07/02/monsoon-multimedia-launches-new-hava-video-streamers/ Monsoon Multimedia launches new HAVA video streamers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The devices enable streaming and [[Video recording|recording]] of video content from video sources including live TV, [[DVD]] players, [[video game]] consoles, and [[TiVo]] to multiple PCs wirelessly. Multiple users can connect to the HAVA from any [[Internet]] connection simultaneously with channel-changing capabilities and full operation of the video source. The devices allow a PC to operate as a [[personal video recorder]] with pause, fast forward and rewind functions. The HAVA device also works as a TV tuner for [[Windows Media Center]]-enabled PCs without being directly connected to a video source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,128053-page,1-c,personalvideorecorders/article.html First Look Battle of the Placeshifting Devices]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Monsoon Multimedia was created in 2004 by the founders of Dazzle and [[Emuzed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indusview.com/RED_HERRING___Hava_Faces_off_with_Slingbox.pdf Hava Faces off with Slingbox]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; HAVA's main engineering and development operations are based in [[Tomsk, Russia]] and [[New Delhi, India]]. In 1996, the founder of Monsoon Multimedia, Prabhat Jain, founded Dazzle, where he developed the PC hardware and software products to compress video based on [[MPEG]] standards. In 2000, he founded Emuzed, where Prabhat Jain created a [[TiVo]]-type product for the PC based on [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Media Center|Media Center]] Edition PC operating system.

In November 2008, Prabhat Jain announced the appointment of consumer technology industry veteran William Loesch as CEO of the company. Loesch brought 30 years of experience in the computer software and hardware industries, primarily in the consumer digital video sector.  Loesch is not currently listed on the company website as an active member of the team (11/2/2011).

==GPL and Patent lawsuits==
What was claimed to be the first US lawsuit over a GPL violation concerned use of [[BusyBox]] in an embedded device. The lawsuit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2007/sep/20/busybox/ On Behalf of BusyBox Developers Andersen and Landley, SFLC Files First Ever U.S. GPL Violation Lawsuit] (Software Freedom Law Center 20 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; case 07-CV-8205 in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] was filed on 20 September 2007 by the [[Software Freedom Law Center]] (SFLC) on behalf of the Busybox developers against Monsoon Multimedia Inc., after BusyBox code was discovered in a [[firmware]] upgrade and attempts to contact the company had apparently failed. The case was settled with release of the Monsoon version of the source and payment of an undisclosed amount of money to Andersen and Landley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.com/feature/120629 Settlement reached in Busybox-Monsoon GPL case] (Bruce Byfield, Linux.com, 30 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 [[Sling Media]] filed suit alleging infringement of five patents, against both [[Belkin International]] and Monsoon Multimedia in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Casey|title=Sling Media sues Belkin, Monsoon for patent infringement|url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/sling-media-sues-belkin-monsoon-for-patent-infringement/|website=Cnet|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belkin part of the suit was settled in May 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donahue|first1=Bill|title=Belkin Settles Out Of Slingbox ITC Patent Probe|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/443740/belkin-settles-out-of-slingbox-itc-patent-probe|website=[[Law360]]|publisher=LexisNexis|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2013 the [[United States International Trade Commission]] found that Monsoon was indeed violating the patents. The commission issued cease-and-desist orders and banned the importation of Monsoon Multimedia products into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawson|first1=Alex|title=Video Streaming Cos. Hit With Import Bans In Slingbox Row|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/493818/video-streaming-cos-hit-with-import-bans-in-slingbox-row|website=[[Law360]]|publisher=LexisNexis|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devices==
{{update section|date=July 2014}}
Monsoon Multimedia's line of place-shifting devices enable multiple networked PCs within the home to simultaneously view live TV or [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] content. The number of PCs and mobile device that can connected to a single Monsoon device are limited only by the bandwidth of the network or broadband connection. Only one remote client at a time can view a place-shifted program, but the remote device can be watching while multiple home PCs watch the same program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i4u.com/article12670.html Monsoon Announces HAVA Titanium HD]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulkano===
Released in August 2010, the Vulkano adds an [[electronic program guide]] to its PC software, as well as support for [[YouTube]] video streaming on TV with an included remote control, as well as future support for [[Netflix]] and other streaming video services. Future [[Google TV]] web-browsing support is planned for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monsoonmultimedia.com/press_releases_072710.html Vulkano – World's First Universal and Affordable Video Platform for Smartphones, PC/Macs, iPads and TVs]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Vulkano model that includes a 500 [[gigabyte|GB]] external hard drive for DVR recordings, which can be accessed from mobile devices. The Vulkano does not support [[Windows Media Center]] integration as the previous HAVA models did, but includes [[UPnP]] technology for photo, music, and video streaming from PCs and mobile devices. In November 2010, Monsoon added a Vulkano Platinum model, which does not include any storage drive, program guide, or recording capabilities.

===Vulkano Flow===
Announced at the 2011 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the Vulkano Flow is a [[Mobile phone accessories|mobile accessory]]. When connected to any set-top box the Vulkano Flow can stream TV content to mobile devices inside or outside of the home. It will soon be available for $99.

===Vulkano Blast===
Also announced at the 2011 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the Vulkano Blast integrates [[Digital video recorder|DVR]], web video, [[placeshifting]], Universal Plug and Play streaming [[UPnP]], Mobile Video Recording and 160 GB internal storage. Its approximate price is $200.

===HAVA Gold===
Controls [[digital cable]], [[satellite]], or DVR TV programming on any PC or mobile device.

===HAVA Platinum HD===
Controls [[High-definition television|high-definition]] digital cable, satellite or DVR TV programming on any PC or mobile phone. Turns a PC into [[personal video recorder]] (PVR) by recording TV shows to the hard disk or watch TV from [[Microsoft]]’s [[Windows Media Center|Media Center]] in any room within a home.

The HAVA Platinum HD also includes component inputs and has ability to transmit a HD program in widescreen aspect ratio, though not in full HD resolution. The HAVA Platinum takes a 720p or 1080i signal and converts it to standard-definition resolution before streaming it over a network or over the Internet. This device also adds PC software that stores streamed content, enabling the PC or laptop to pause, rewind and fast-forward streamed content. The stored program can also be burned to [[DVD]].

===HAVA Wireless HD===
Controls HD digital cable, satellite, or DVR programs [[wireless]]ly on any [[WiFi]]-enabled PC or mobile phone. It can stream wirelessly, DVD-quality video direct from the TV source to multiple Media Center PCs simultaneously. It can also pause, rewind, fast forward, and record live TV programs on a PC.

===HAVA Titanium HD WiFi===
Controls HD digital cable, satellite, or DVR programs wirelessly on any WiFi enabled PC or mobile phone. Streams wirelessly, DVD quality video direct from the TV source to multiple [[Windows Vista]] or Media Center PCs simultaneously.

The HAVA Titanium HD adds Wi-Fi to make a wireless connection to a Wi-Fi-equipped broadband router or modem, and it features two USB ports. One is for plugging in an external USB HDD drive that can then be used as a DVR. The other USB port is for the included Wi-Fi 802.11g adapter, which sits in a cradle and is connected to a 3-foot USB cable so the adapter can be located in a spot with good reception.

==Software interface==
The HAVA devices come with a HAVA Player software interface that is downloaded onto the user's PC or mobile phone. This interface enables the user to send remote control commands from their PC to their TV source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tabletblog.com/2008/04/tabletblog-premiere-stream-your-home.html TabletBlog Premiere - Stream your home Satellite/Cable/DVR to your tablet with HAVA]&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through the included wide range of virtual remote control designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/news_press_release,254169.shtml Monsoon Multimedia Announces HAVA Development Initiatives for Microsoft's Windows Rally Platform]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulkano device includes an electronic program guide (EPG) enabled software player.

==Mobile players==
{{update section|date=July 2014}}

===Vulkano players===
With the release of the Vulkano in August 2010, Monsoon introduced free Vulkano players for the [[iPad]] and [[iPhone]], which only support WiFi, and not yet 3G connections. Monsoon also released an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[BlackBerry]] player, and plans a future release for [[Symbian]].

===HAVA players===
Monsoon Multimedia announced support for Windows Mobile in May 2007 enabling users to connect to the HAVA and view video content from video sources such as live TV from a [[smartphone]], [[pocket PC]] or [[PDA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news98525513.html|title=Windows Mobile Devices Get HAVA Support}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Monsoon Media announced HAVA Player support for the [[Nokia]] [[N800]], [[N810]] and [[N810]] [[WiMax]] Internet Tablets&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/01/hava-player-hits-nokias-internet-tablets/ HAVA player hits Nokia's internet tablets]&lt;/ref&gt; enabling users to connect to a HAVA device to view and control video content from video sources such as live TV from a [[Nokia]] Internet Tablet.

In May 2008, Monsoon Multimedia announced the HAVA Player for S60, HAVA support for Symbian S60 3rd edition mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/05/28/hava-mobile-player-comes-to-s60-handsets/ HAVA Mobile Player comes to S60 handsets]&lt;/ref&gt; The HAVA Player for S60 enables users to connect to a HAVA device to view and control their home TV from S60 mobile phones.

In September 2009, the HAVA Player was released to the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]] and the [[iPod Touch]]. The app is free, but is not 3G-enabled.

In 2018 the company disappeared; because by design all the players were using the company's central server to locate devices for remote viewing, when the server went down all Hava and Vulkano devices have become useless.
The company left all device owners disappointed with no alternative solution: could have been a direct connection based on IP address without a central server like Slingbox player option.
It is unknown if some knowledgeable users or anyone else was able to come up with a way to use these devices again, as the forum (hosted on the company's website) is gone too.

A '''movie star''' (also known as a '''film star''' and '''cinema star''') is an actor who is [[celebrity|famous]] for their starring, or leading, roles in [[motion picture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=S|title=Movie Stars and the Distribution of Financially Successful Films in the Motion Picture Industry|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=22|issue=4|pages=249–270|doi=10.1023/A:1007511817441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=S|title=Movie Stars and the Distribution of Financially Successful Films in the Motion Picture Industry|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=23|issue=4|pages=325–329|doi=10.1023/A:1007584017128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used for actors who are marketable stars and whose names are used to promote movies, for example in trailers and posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shugan|first1=S|editor1-last=Moul|editor1-first=C|title=A Concise Handbook of Movie Industry Economics|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

===Hollywood's early years===
[[File:Less Than the Dust 2.jpg|thumb|Poster advertising a 1916 film with [[Mary Pickford]], one of the first movie stars]]
In the early days of [[silent film|silent movies]], the names of the actors and actresses appearing in them were not publicized or credited because producers feared this would result in demands for higher salaries.&lt;ref name="100years"&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/100-years-of-movie-stars-19101929-1876290.html 100 years of movie stars: 1910-1929]", ''The Independent'', January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, audience curiosity soon undermined this policy. By 1909, actresses such as [[Florence Lawrence]] and [[Mary Pickford]] were already widely recognized, although the public remained unaware of their names. Lawrence was referred to as the “Biograph Girl” because she worked for [[D. W. Griffith]]'s [[Biograph Studios]], while Pickford was "Little Mary." In 1910, Lawrence switched to the [[Independent Moving Pictures|Independent Moving Pictures Company]], began appearing under her own name, and was hailed as "America's foremost moving picture star" in IMP literature.&lt;ref name="100years"/&gt; Pickford began appearing under her own name in 1911.

The Independent Moving Pictures Company promoted their "picture personalities", including Florence Lawrence and [[King Baggot]], by giving them [[billing (filmmaking)|billing]], [[motion picture credits|credits]] and a [[marquee (sign)|marquee]]. [[promotion (marketing)|Promotion]] in advertising led to the release of stories about these personalities to newspapers and fan magazines as part of a strategy to build brand loyalty for their company's actors and films. By the 1920s, Hollywood film company promoters had developed a "massive industrial enterprise" that "...peddled a new intangible—fame."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Mitchell A. Flagg, "[http://www.adidem.org/articles/MF1.html Star Crazy: Keeping The Right Of Publicity Out Of Canadian Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020323005903/http://www.adidem.org/articles/MF1.html |date=March 23, 2002 }}" (1999) Ad IDEM&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Hollywood studios tightly controlled who was a movie star, as only they had the ability to place stars' names above the title; according to film historian [[Jeanine Basinger]], this was done "only for economic reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Star Machine|last=Basinger|first=Jeanine|authorlink=Jeanine Basinger|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2008|isbn=9780307491282|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4q1WWk9BggC&amp;pg=PT40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood "image makers" and promotional agents planted rumors, selectively released real or fictitious biographical information to the press, and used other gimmicks to create [[Glamour (presentation)|glamorous]] personas for actors. Publicists thus "created" the "enduring images" and public perceptions of screen legends such as [[Judy Garland]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Grace Kelly]]. The development of this "[[star system (filmmaking)|star system]]" made fame "something that could be fabricated purposely, by the masters of the new 'machinery of glory'."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; However, regardless of how "...strenuously the star and their media handlers and press agents may ... try to 'monitor' and 'shape' it, the media and the public always play a substantial part in the image-making process."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; According to Madow, "fame is a 'relational'  phenomenon, something that is conferred by others. A person can, within the limits of his natural talents, make himself strong or swift or learned. But he cannot, in this same sense, make himself famous, any more than he can make himself loved."

Madow goes on to point out "fame is often conferred or withheld, just as love is, for reasons and on grounds other than 'merit'." According to Sofia Johansson the "canonical texts on stardom" include articles by Boorstin (1971), Alberoni (1972) and Dyer (1979) that examined the "representations of stars and on aspects of the Hollywood star system". Johansson writes that "more recent analyses within media and cultural studies (e.g. Gamson 1994; Marshall 1997; Giles 2000; Turner, Marshall and Bonner 2000; Rojek 2001; Turner 2004) have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive, contemporary, '[[celebrity culture]]'." In the analysis of the celebrity culture, "fame and its constituencies are conceived of as a broader social process, connected to widespread economic, political, technological and cultural developments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmin.ac.uk/mad/pdf/Sofia.pdf Editorial] by Sofia Johansson from the Communication and Media Research Institute of the University of Westminster&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, entertainment companies began using stars for a range of publicity tactics including press releases, movie junkets, and community activities. These promotional efforts are targeted and designed using market research, to increase the predictability of success of their media ventures. In some cases, publicity agents may create “provocative advertisements” or make an outrageous public statement to trigger public controversy and thereby generate "free" news coverage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Movie studios employed performers under long-term contracts. They developed a star system as a means of promoting and selling their movies. "Star vehicles" were filmed to display the particular talents and appeal of the most popular movie stars of the studio.

==Asia==

Movie stars in other regions too have their own star value. For instance, in [[Asian cinema|Asian film]] industries, many movies often run on the weight of the star's crowd pulling power more than any other intrinsic aspect of film making.

===China===
A number of [[Cinema of China|Chinese film]] actors have become some of the most popular movie stars in [[East Asia|Eastern Asia]], and several are also well known in the Western world. They include [[Jackie Chan]], [[Jet Li]], [[Chow Yun-fat]], [[Stephen Chow]], [[Sammo Hung]], [[Gong Li]], [[Ziyi Zhang]], [[Maggie Cheung]], and the late [[Bruce Lee]].

The [[Cinema of India|Indian film]] industry, of which one is commonly known as [[Bollywood]], has its own set of rules in this aspect. There are often [[superstar]]s in this region who command premium pay commensurate with their [[box office]] appeal. Male Indian actors who are among the most popular movie stars in India and [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] include [[Rajesh Khanna]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Raj Kapoor]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Jeetendra]], [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Raj Babbar]], [[Mohanlal]], [[Amol Palekar]],[[Aamir Khan]], [[Shahrukh Khan]], [[Salman Khan]], [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Arjun Rampal]], [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]], [[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Anil Kapoor]].

===Southeast-Asian archipelago===

The film industry of the Malay Archipelago (also known as [[Nusantara]]) consists primarily of film industries in [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]]. Over the past century, these four cinemas have collaborated on a number of projects. A number of actors from this region have become some of the most sought-after movie stars in southeast Asia, commonly in [[Malay language|Malay]]-speaking countries.

Actors such as [[P. Ramlee]], Rano Karno, [[Rima Melati]], [[Deddy Mizwar]], Jins Shamsuddin, Eman Manan, Alex Komang, [[Christine Hakim]], Fauziah Ahmad Daud, [[Nora Aunor]], [[Joseph Estrada]], [[José Padilla, Jr.|Jose Padilla]], Nordin Ahmad, [[Saadiah]], [[Fernando Poe Jr.]], [[Roy Marten]], and [[Yusof Haslam]] are considered movie stars of the 20th century, some of them having acted in all four countries.

Other, more recent movie stars include Romalis Syafril, [[Erra Fazira]], [[Rosyam Nor]], [[Shaheizy Sam]] and [[Maya Karin]], from Malaysia; [[Nicholas Saputra]], Vino G. Bastian, [[Dian Sastrowardoyo]], [[Tora Sudiro]], and [[Iko Uwais]], from Indonesia; Claudine Baretto, [[Piolo Pascual]], [[John Lloyd Cruz]], [[Jericho Rosales]], [[Aga Muhlach]], Kristine Hermosa, [[Dingdong Dantes]], and [[Bea Alonzo]], from the Philippines; and a few from Singapore, such as [[Aaron Aziz]] and Adi Putra.

A '''novelette''' is "a short piece of [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] music, especially one for the [[piano]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/novelette|title=Definition of novelette|work=Collins English Dictionary|publisher=Collins|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was used by the composer [[Robert Schumann]] as a title for some piano pieces, a choice that reflected his literary background and interests. The music in question (op. 21, and op. 99 no. 9) is episodic, however, and does not especially resemble a narrative. The name may also allude to [[Clara Novello]].&lt;ref name="Ostwald1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostwald|first=Peter F.|title=Schumann: The Inner Voices of a Musical Genius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yVTo_GHbihoC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=20 January 2013|date=1987-03-02|publisher=UPNE|isbn=9781555530143|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schumann was followed by [[Niels Gade]], [[Theodor Kirchner]], [[Stephen Heller]] and much later by [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] (''[[Trois novelettes (Poulenc)|Trois novelettes]]''), [[Witold Lutosławski|Lutosławski]] ("Novelette for Orchestra"), [[Cécile Chaminade|Chaminade]], [[Alexander Tcherepnin|Tcherepnin]], [[Josef Tal]] and [[George Gershwin]] ("Novelette in Fourths").

=== Now TV proprietary devices ===  
Four propriety Now TV boxes and one proprietary streaming stick have been launched. The Now TV "White" Box is no longer officially available as it is succeeded by the Now TV "Black" Box. All of the Now TV boxes and the Now TV Streaming Stick provide access to live television channel [[Streaming media|streams]] and video on demand content courtesy of the available Entertainment, [[Sky Cinema]], [[Sky Sports]], and Kids Passes. There is limited access to the Roku Channel Store in which an approved list of [[application software]] can be downloaded such as [[BBC iPlayer]],  [[ITV Hub]], [[All 4]], [[My5]], [[Sky Box Office|Sky Sports Box Office]] and the [[Sky News|Sky Store]]. Users were able to side-load apps via developer mode, but this was disabled by Sky in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/16/now-tv-update-kills-plex/|title=A sly Now TV update is culling sideloaded apps like Plex|work=Engadget|access-date=25 June 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 Now TV launched the Now TV "white" box (based on the 2011 [[Roku#Feature comparison|Roku LT]]) allowing consumers when connected to [[Wi-Fi]] to stream Now TV content to their television via an [[Analog signal|analogue]] audio/video output or an [[HDMI]] connection capable of outputting up to 720p video resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawler |first=Richard |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/07/26/sky-now-tv-box-9-99/ |title=Sky's Now TV box is a £9.99 Roku clone that streams iPlayer and more |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 Now TV launched the Now TV "black" Box (based on the 2015 [[Roku#Feature comparison|Roku 2]]). It offers the same user interface as the original Now TV "white" box, but with updated technical specifications such as a higher performance [[Central processing unit|CPU]], an [[Ethernet]] port (in addition to Wi-Fi), a [[USB]] port (not currently functional), a [[Secure Digital#Mini- and micro-cards|microSD card]] slot (not currently functional), the capability of outputting up to 1080p video resolution via an HDMI connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/134825-now-tv-box-2015-vs-now-tv-box-vs-roku-2-what-s-the-difference|title=Now TV Box (2015) vs Now TV Box vs Roku 2: What's the difference? - Pocket-lint|website=Pocket-lint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It does not have an analogue audio/video output connection like its "white" box predecessor. The Now TV "black" Box is currently the only Now TV device available in Ireland and Italy.

In July 2016 Now TV launched the first generation Now TV Smart Box (based on the 2015 [[Roku#Feature comparison|Roku 4]]) providing the same access as previous boxes, but with updated technical specifications, such as a higher performance CPU and an internal [[DVB-T]]/[[DVB-T2]] [[Digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial television tuner]] giving the ability to access [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and [[Freeview HD]] television channels that can be paused and rewound up to 30 minutes. Red Button and interactive services are accessible by pressing the asterisk ('''✱''') button on the Now TV remote control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtv.com/tv-boxes|title=Now TV Boxes - find out about our media streaming boxes|website=@NowTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 Now TV launched the Now TV Smart Stick (based on the 2017 [[Roku#Feature comparison|Roku Streaming Stick]]). It is quick and easy to plug it into any display with an HDMI port and offers plug and play portability. The Now TV "Smart Stick" is the first Now TV device to include a [[Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi Direct]] [[remote control]] with [[voice search]] allowing users to search movies and shows by name, or by favourite actors or directors, by talking into the "Smart Stick" remote. Apps can also be launched via voice search by users saying the name of the app they wish to launch. The Now TV "Smart Stick" has a feature called "Hotel connect" which allows users to connect to Wi-Fi networks that require signing in to the Wi-Fi network through a web browser.

In September 2018 Now TV launched the second generation Now TV Smart Box (Based around the 2016 [[Roku#Feature comparison|Roku Premiere+]]). The second generation Smart box is much smaller in size compared to it's original predecessor mainly due to the removal of the internal [[DVB-T]]/[[DVB-T2]] [[Digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial television tuner]] that gave it the ability to access Freeview and Freeview HD television channels. The new Smart box features the same [[Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi Direct]] [[remote control]] with [[voice search]] that is included with the Now TV Smart Stick. The new Smart Box is capable of outputting at up to [[4K resolution|2160p]] (4K) at [[Frames per second|60fps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2018/09/now-tv-launch-new-smart-box-with-4k-ultrahd-and-voice-search.html|title=NOW TV Launch New Smart Box with 4K UltraHD and Voice Search - ISPreview UK|last=Jackson|first=Mark|website=www.ispreview.co.uk|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Now TV television content ===
Now TV offers four ''channel packages''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cable.co.uk/providers/now-broadband/|title=NOW Broadband Packages|website=cable.co.uk|language=en|access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, three channel packages in Ireland, and four channel packages in Italy, all providing live streaming and video on demand. 

==== Now TV television content in the UK and Ireland ====
The subscriptions in both the UK and Ireland are branded as "Now TV Passes": Entertainment Pass, [[Sky Cinema]] Pass, [[Sky Sports]] Pass, [[Sky Sports]] Mobile Pass, a Kids Pass, and a [[Hayu (subscription service)|hayu]] Pass&lt;ref name="Filmoria"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.filmoria.co.uk/new-content-on-now-tv-this-september/|title=Hayu Pass - New Content on NOW TV|publisher=''Filmoria.co.uk''|date= |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The "White" Now TV box does not support the hayu pass).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">'''''Oceania''''' is a board game by [[Klaus Teuber]], published by [[Mayfair Games]].  It is a simpler version of [[Entdecker]], and is played with one or two players.  The solitaire version's objective is completely different from the two player version's.

==Two-Player Version==
Each player, in turn, places a wooden ship on one of the starting spaces or on a tile already placed.  At the beginning of the game, of course, the only spaces available are starting spaces.  These spaces appear on three sides of the board; the fourth side is a continuation of the ocean frame, but the ship cannot start there.  Then, the player picks one tile from the top of the pile.  Each tile has four sides, with water or land on each side.  All of the possible combinations that have water on at least one side are included, with varying frequencies, in the pile.  (The water, land, water, land tiles show two island fragments, one on each side with a strait going down the middle, not the other way around.)  Tiles placed into the board must match water to water and land to land.  If a tile fits, the player must place it.  Each player has pieces in one of the two colors (white or black) depicting one, two, or three scouts.  Players may place one scout piece on the tile that was placed if it has land on it (if it is the WLWL piece, the scout piece may be placed on either side).  If a tile does not fit, it is placed in front of the player.  Later in the game, the player may choose to give up one scout piece from the supply in order to place one of these pieces on the board.  If an empty space is completely surrounded, it is filled with reserve tiles of the correct variety, which are next to the board.  If a number of spaces are surrounded with only land, they are filled with tiles from the reserve pile that have land on all four sides.

The game can end in three ways:
#When the tiles in the pile are used up.
#When the entire board is filled.
#When there are spaces that cannot be filled because of the side of the board that is considered water, but where the ship cannot start.  If there are two or more consecutive spaces surrounded only by land and this fourth side, they cannot be filled.

On each island where one player has a majority of the scouts, that player receives points equal to the number of the tiles in the island.  If the two island fragments of a WLWL tile are joined by other pieces that go around them, the tile still only counts as one tile.  If the players are tied, nobody scores points.  Tiles in front of a player because they could not be placed are each worth -2 points if the player has not given up a scout piece to place them.  The winner is the player with the most points.

==One-Player Version==
The scouts are not used in this game.  The player repeatedly places the ship on the board and puts tiles out.  A tile that does not fit is placed in a discard pile.  The score is the sum of the squares of the number of tiles in each island, minus twenty points for each space that is not filled at the end of the game.

This version of the game can be played online at [http://www.playcatan.com PlayCatan], even though it is not strictly a [[Settlers of Catan|Catan]] game.  This is because of its relationship to the [[List of Settlers of Catan games|Catan series]] (also created by Klaus Teuber and published by Mayfair Games), and because its parent game, [[Entdecker]], can be viewed as the discovery of the island of Catan, as the publisher says at this link: [http://www.mayfairgames.com/news/news-arc/newscatan-ent-dom2.htm].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24698">The original use of the term [[Parody music|"parody" in music]] referred to re-use for wholly serious purposes of existing music. In popular music that sense of "parody" is still applicable to the use of folk music in the serious songs of such writers as [[Bob Dylan]], but in general, "parody" in popular music refers to the humorous distortion of [[musical idea]]s or [[lyrics]] or [[music genre|general style]] of music.

==Origins==
Before the 20th century [[popular song]] frequently borrowed [[hymn tune]]s and other [[church music]] and substituted secular words. ''[[John Brown's Body]]'', the marching song of the American Civil War, was based on the tune of an earlier camp-meeting and revival hymn, and was later fitted with the words "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord", by Julia Ward Howe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e3575?q=John+Brown%27s+Body&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit "John Brown's Body"], Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice continued into the First World War I, with many of the soldiers' songs being based on hymn tunes (for instance "When this lousy war is over", to the tune of "[[What a Friend We Have in Jesus]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/education/tutorials/intro/trench/songs.html#lousy "Trench Songs – When this Lousy War is Over "], The First World War Poetry Digital Archive, accessed 19 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and "We are Fred Karno's Army", to the tune of "[[The Church's One Foundation]]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/education/tutorials/intro/trench/songs.html#fred "Trench Songs – We are Fred Karno's Army"], The First World War Poetry Digital Archive, accessed 19 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Folk song]] has often been written to existing tunes, or slight modifications of them. This is another very old (and usually non-humorous) kind of musical parody that still continues.  For instance, [[Bob Dylan]] took the tune of the old slave song "No more auction block for me" as the basis for "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/bob-dylan-blowin-in-the-wind-19691231 "Bob Dylan, Blowin' in the Wind"], ''Rolling Stone'', accessed 19 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==1918–1959==
The emerging form of [[Jazz|Jazz music]] frequently recycled themes from the staider "white" popular music of the time, as well as producing occasional parodies (usually called [[Burlesque|"travesties"]]) of well known classical themes.

In the 1940s, [[Spike Jones]] and his ''City Slickers'' parodied popular music in their own unique way, not by changing lyrics, but adding wild sound effects and comedic stylings to formerly staid old songs such as "Cocktails for Two" and "April Showers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t270.e81882 "Jones, Spike - Spiked! The Music Of Spike Jones"], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. Ed Colin Larkin. Muze Inc and Oxford University Press, Inc. 2009, accessed 21 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1949, [[Homer and Jethro]] did [[country music]] arrangements of popular songs, with parody lyrics, such as "Hart Brake Motel" (for "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]") and "The Battle of Kookamonga" (after [[Johnny Horton]]'s "The Battle of New Orleans").

The comedy pianist [[Victor Borge]] coined some of his signature bits on [[Bing Crosby]]'s radio show during the 1940s, and later popularized them on TV on [[Dean Martin]]'s show. Borge parodied classical composition styles by taking a very well known tune like "[[Happy Birthday to You]]" and playing it in the styles of [[Mozart]], [[Brahms]], [[Wagner]], [[Beethoven]] and others.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1085722.stm|title=Victor Borge: The Great Dane|last=Higham|first=Nick|date=December 24, 2000|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.amazon.com/Variations-Theme-incorporation-Happy-Birthday/dp/B005XM005K|title=Variations on a Theme (incorporation of: "Happy Birthday")|publisher=[[Jasmine Records]]|people=[[Victor Borge|Borge, Victor]]|year=2011|asin=B005XM005K|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would also parody two compositions simultaneously by finding common melody notes and using them for transitioning one composition into another, the most famous example being "[[Moonlight Sonata]]" transitioning into "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]" (or a [[major and minor|minor]] version of "Happy Birthday to You").&lt;ref name="NME"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/NMVatrCsz0Y|title=Victor Borge - His Greatest Piano Jokes video|publisher=[[NME]]|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iTunes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/classical-keys/id358680944|title=Victor Borge &amp;ndash; Classical Keys|date=February 1, 2010|publisher=[[iTunes Store]]|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1957 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Jamaica (musical)|Jamaica]]'' parodied the then very fashionable commercial variety of [[Calypso music]].&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, Thomas. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t282.e919 "Jamaica"],  ''The Oxford Companion to the American Musical'', Oxford University Press 2009, Oxford Reference Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; A musical using heavy parody was the 1959 show ''[[Little Mary Sunshine]]'', which poked fun at old-fashioned [[operetta]].&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, Thomas. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t282.e1104 "Little Mary Sunshine"],  ''The Oxford Companion to the American Musical'', Oxford University Press 2009, Oxford Reference Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960–1980==
[[Stan Freberg]] created parodies of popular songs in the 1950s and 1960s, mocking the musical conventions of the day, such as [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t270.e9398 "Freberg, Stan" ], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. Ed Colin Larkin. Muze Inc and Oxford University Press, Inc. 2009, accessed 21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the vocalist rips his jeans from too much hip-swiveling and drowns in reverberative sound effects at the end. Another major parodist was [[Allan Sherman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t270.e25532 "Sherman Allan" ], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. Ed Colin Larkin. Muze Inc and Oxford University Press, Inc. 2009, accessed 21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; who began making hit records with parodies such as the now-classic "[[Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh|Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)]]" (to the tune of [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]'s "[[Dance of the Hours]]" from the opera La Gioconda) and "When I Was A Lad" (after [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]]'s "Ruler of the Queen's Navee" from "[[HMS Pinafore]]").

Bandleader and pianist [[Paul Weston]] and his wife, singer [[Jo Stafford]], created the musical duo, "Jonathan and Darlene Edwards", as a parody of bad [[cabaret]] acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t270.e30046 "Weston, Paul" ], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. Ed Colin Larkin. Muze Inc and Oxford University Press, Inc. 2009, accessed 21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially it began as a private party joke but they recorded several albums and one, ''Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris'', won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1961 for best comedy record.

The self-described "[[piano]]-wielding fugitive from [[Harvard]]", [[Tom Lehrer]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t270.e47902 "Lehrer, Tom" ], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. Ed Colin Larkin. Muze Inc and Oxford University Press, Inc. 2009, accessed 21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Victor Borge, originally from Denmark, who switched from a concert piano career to comedy, have also created parodies of classical piano pieces and opera.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael and Joyce Kennedy. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t76.e1215 "Borge, Victor"],  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music.'' Oxford University Press, 2007. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed  21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, musical satirist [[Peter Schickele]] created [[P. D. Q. Bach]], a supposedly newly discovered member of the [[Bach family]], whose creative output parodies [[musicology|musicological]] scholarship, the conventions of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|classical]] music, as well as introducing elements of [[slapstick]] comedy. Schickele continues to tour and record under the pseudonym P. D. Q. Bach to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael and Joyce [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t76.e8050 " Schickele, Peter "],  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music.'' Oxford University Press, 2007. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed  21 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Stevens]] became a country star in the 1970s and 1980s with a few serious songs (such as "[[Everything is Beautiful]]"), more novelty songs (such as "[[The Streak]]", "[[Shriner's Convention]]", and "Mississippi Squirrel Revival") and many parody songs, such as the adult-contemporary send-up "I Need Your Help Barry Manilow", and the [[Beach Boys]] parody "Surfin USSR".

The [[Barron Knights]] became famous for their parodies of pop songs in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t270.e36291 "Barron Knights" ], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. Ed Colin Larkin. Muze Inc and Oxford University Press, Inc. 2009, accessed 21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[A Little Green Rosetta]]" from the [[Frank Zappa]] album ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' lampoons [[Steve Gadd]]'s status as one of the highest-paid session drummers in popular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Little Green Rosetta: Notes About This Song|url=http://wiki.killuglyradio.com/wiki/A_Little_Green_Rosetta#Notes_About_This_Song|website=Zappa Wiki Jawaka|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music parodies a number of styles including reggae and lounge jazz.

==1980–present==
A successful parodist is [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], now in his fourth decade of writing song parodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t270.e62453 "Yankovic,  'Weird Al'" ], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. Ed Colin Larkin. Muze Inc and Oxford University Press, Inc. 2009, accessed 21 February 2012  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got his start sending tapes to be played by Barret Hansen, AKA [[Dr. Demento]], on his nationally syndicated [[radio]] show. [[Seattle, WA]]-based disc jockey and longtime parodist [[Bob Rivers]] records parodies of hit songs from a variety of genres and periods satirizing current events. Dabbling in topical parodies is [[Buffalo, New York]]-based humorist [[Mark Russell]], who appears several times a year on [[PBS]] television.  The [[New York, NY]] performing troupe [[Forbidden Broadway]] annually parodies the Great White Way's most popular current musicals and their songs on stage and recordings.

In the [[science fiction]] fan community [[filk music]] thrives as a source of both parodies and original music, as it has since at least the 1930s.

[[Tom Lehrer]] song "The Elements" adapts a tune from [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] to the periodic table, and more recently he turned "That's Entertainment" into a précis on his real vocation, "That's Mathematics" (carefully altering the melody to avoid litigation).

[[Ray Charles]] wrote his hit song "[[I Got a Woman]]" as a paraphrase on [[Gospel music|Gospel]] songs, which provoked anger from the Christian community. The 1992 film "[[Sister Act]]" had [[Whoopi Goldberg]]'s character do the opposite with [[Mary Wells]]' "[[My Guy]]", rewriting its lyrics (and subsequently re-titling it as "My God") to accommodate the nun choir.

[[Richard Cheese]] and [[The Lounge Kittens]] produce parodies not in the traditional sense of someone like Yankovic, but rather derive their humor from exactly the opposite means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/aug/21/meet-richard-cheese-hell-grate-you-make-you-laugh "Meet Richard Cheese: He'll grate on you, make you laugh and sing along"]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Las Vegas Sun'', 21 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional parody puts new lyrics to largely unchanged music, they keep the lyrics intact but alter the musical style, thus altering the intent of the song. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of very familiar lyrics from popular [[Hip Hop music|rap]], [[Heavy metal music|metal]], and [[Rock music|rock]] songs (particularly containing profane, violent, or sexually explicit lyrics) with their exceedingly clean, "white bread", [[campy]], [[lounge music|lounge]] style. [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]] does likewise in a complete opposite manner: they perform hard, sped-up [[punk rock|punk]] renditions of [[folk songs]], [[soft rock]], [[showtunes]], [[R&amp;B]], and other genres not usually associated with punk. Yankovic has also ventured into this practice; all but two of his albums feature medleys of either classic rock or then-current hit songs done as fast [[polka]]s.  [[Ray Stevens]] has had hits of [[Glenn Miller]]'s "[[In the Mood]]" done in the style of clucking chickens, and a honky-tonk or bluegrass version of [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]".

Musical parody in recent years has included the 2005 musical [[Altar Boyz]], which parodies both [[Christian rock]] and the "[[boy band]]" style of pop,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altarboyz.com/about-the-show.html "About the show"], Altar Boyz, accessed 21 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  the Christian parody band [[Apologetix]], who have targeted popular music from the 1950s to the present, and the [[Capitol Steps]], a group of current and former [[U.S. Congress]] staff members based in [[Washington, DC]] who focus on politics and other public figures. [[Mac Sabbath]], a tribute band who perform [[Black Sabbath]] songs with rewritten lyrics satirizing the fast food industry in [[McDonald's]]-themed costumes and stage theatrics, went viral in late 2014, bringing the band notable press coverage and enabling them to tour internationally.

In 2009 a group from London, [[The Midnight Beast]], gained fame after posting on YouTube their parody of the song [[Tik Tok (song)|"Tik Tok"]] by [[Kesha|Ke$ha]]. Since then, the group has parodied other pop songs. Another major Parody Music Artist called [[Rucka Rucka Ali]] also made a Parody of [[Tik Tok (song)|"Tik Tok"]] by [[Kesha|Ke$ha]] called "Go Cops", [[Rucka Rucka Ali]]s "Go Cops" song has accumulated over 11 million hits on YouTube (Not including Re-Uploads). A popular theme of parodies on [[YouTube]] today is video games, with the most common ones being [[Call of Duty]], [[Grand Theft Auto]] and (the most common) [[Minecraft]].

As it has become easier to publish songs quickly, online increasing volumes of topical, comic parodies have begun to emerge. In the UK these have tended to be similar in nature to the type of news inspired songs which have regularly appeared on BBC Radio 4 comedy [[The Now Show]] since 1998. [[The Amateur Transplants]], one group which produce these, came to public attention in 2005 with a song “London Underground”, satirizing the then strikes, and parodying the [[Jam song]] "Going Underground" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A26655645|title='London Underground' by Amateur Transplants |publisher= BBC h2g2 |work= |date=21 September 2007| accessdate=22 March 2014|editor=Ashman, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; London writing team, Kathryn and Nick, have also produced a wide range of satirical songs to raise awareness for their other writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/03/prweb11669390.htm|title= ‘Spamming’: New Single from Kathryn &amp; Nick Tackles Artistic Democracy  |publisher=PR Web|work= |date= 17 March 2014| accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2013, Bitcoin Examiner listed their song “Coin Fever” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-song-commemorates-bitcoin-fever/| title=7 Bitcoin Songs to Listen to Before 2013 is Over |publisher=Bitcoin Examiner|work= |date=31 December 2013 | accessdate=22 March 2014|editor=Bonney, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a wry take on the Bitcoin hype—to the tune of "Goldfinger",  as its top Bitcoin song of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-song-commemorates-bitcoin-fever/|title=Bitcoin Song Commemorates a Year of Bitcoin Fever |publisher=Coin Desk|work= |date=31 December 2013 | accessdate=22 March 2014|author=Ashton, Danny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
''[[Mad Magazine]]'' provoked an early legal backlash against parody when in 1961 the magazine published a songbook in which various topical ditties such as "[[The Last Time I Saw Paris|The Last Time I Saw]] [[Roger Maris|Maris]]", "Albert Einstein", and "[[There's No Business Like Show Business|There's No Business Like No Business]]"  were included (in poem format; with a parenthetical phrase after each title, stating "Sung to the tune of..."). Several music publishers joined in [[Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc.|a lawsuit]] taking the magazine to court. The matter eventually reached the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which declined to review the decision by a lower court dismissing the suit against ''Mad.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hajdu|first1=David|title=How Parody Videos Transformed Pop Music—for Better and Worse|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/119590/parody-videos-weird-al-yankovic-make-pop-music-ridiculous|accessdate=8 September 2017|agency=New Republic|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical parody was briefly threatened in the mid-1990s when a case ([[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]) was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court by [[country music]] [[Roy Acuff]]'s music publishing company against the lead singer of the rap music group [[2 Live Crew]] for recording a lewd version of one of Acuff's songs without his permission. However, the ruling was in favor of the rappers, finding that the [[fair use]] doctrine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Fair Use Doctrine and Copyright Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/intellectual_property/fair_use.html|website=ExpertLaw|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended to parody as protected [[derivative work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenhouse|first1=Linda|title=Ruling on Rap Song, High Court Frees Parody From Copyright Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/us/ruling-on-rap-song-high-court-frees-parody-from-copyright-law.html|accessdate=8 September 2017|agency=New York Times|date=8 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October&amp;nbsp;3, 2007, [[Bourne Co. Music Publishers]] filed a lawsuit accusing the [[FOX]] show ''[[Family Guy]]'' of [[copyright infringement|infringing its copyright]] on the song "[[When You Wish upon a Star]]", through a parody song entitled "I Need a Jew" appearing in the episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerstenberger|first1=Tim|title=The Three Family Guy Episodes That Got FOX Sued|url=http://www.tvovermind.com/family-guy/three-family-guy-episodes-got-fox-sued|website=TV Overmind|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a "thinly veiled" copy of their music with [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics.&lt;ref name="bournevfox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bourne v.

'''''Perils of Nyoka''''' is a 1942 [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] [[Serial film|serial]] directed by [[William Witney]]. It starred [[Kay Aldridge]] as [[Nyoka the Jungle Girl]], a character who first appeared in the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]-inspired serial ''[[Jungle Girl (serial)|Jungle Girl]]''.

==Plot==
[[Nyoka the Jungle Girl|Nyoka]], with help from Larry Grayson, attempts to discover the Golden Tablets of [[Hippocrates]]. The tablets contain the medical knowledge of the Ancients — not to mention being buried along with [[gold]] and other [[treasure]]. Also hunting for the tablets are Queen Vultura ("Ruler of the Arabs") and Cassib.

==Cast==

===Main cast===
*[[Kay Aldridge]] as [[Nyoka the Jungle Girl|Nyoka Gordon]]. Aldridge replaced [[Frances Gifford]] as Nyoka. The success and popularity she gained from her role in this serial made Kay Aldridge the star of several of the better Republic serials for years after its release.&lt;ref name="Cline1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cline, William C.|title=In the Nick of Time|year=1984|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=0-7864-0471-X|chapter=3. The Six Faces of Adventure|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, director William Witney stated that the studio decided to use a different actress just to further ensure that there would be no actionable copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="Witney"&gt;{{cite book|author=Witney, William|authorlink=William Witney|title=In a Door, Into a Fight, Out a Door, Into a Chase: Moviemaking Remembered by the Guy at the Door|year=2005|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7864-2258-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Stedman, however, writes that Gifford was not cast in this serial because she had been on loan from another studio for Jungle Girl and was not available for the filming of this serial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stedman, Raymond William|title=Serials: Suspense and Drama By Installment|year=1971|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-0927-5|chapter=5. Shazam and Good-by|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cline partially backs this point of view, saying that Gifford was unavailable to reprise her role because she had moved on to feature films.&lt;ref name="Cline1"/&gt;
*[[Clayton Moore]] as Dr Larry Grayson
*[[Lorna Gray]] as Vultura, Ruler of the Arabs
*[[Charles B. Middleton|Charles Middleton]] as Cassib
*[[William Benedict]] as Red Davis
*[[Forbes Murray]] as Prof Douglas Campbell
*[[George Pembroke]] as John Spencer
*[[Tris Coffin|Tristram Coffin]] as Benito Torrini
*[[Forrest Taylor]] as Translator

*[[Ken Terrell]] as Ahmed, Arab henchman
*[[John Bagni]] as Ben Ali
*[[Kenne Duncan]] as Abou, expedition headman
*[[Arvon Dale]] as Bedouin 1
*[[Emil Van Horn]] played the gorilla "Satan" just as he had played the gorilla in Jungle Girl.&lt;ref name="GMS"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harmon, Jim |author2=[[Donald F.

The Girls "Who Is That Girl in the Buzz Saw?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Perils of Nyoka'' was budgeted at $169,296 although the final [[negative cost]] was $175,010 (a $5,714, or 3.4%, overspend).  It was the most expensive Republic serial of 1942.&lt;ref name=mathis/&gt; It was filmed between March 20 and May 2, 1942,&lt;ref name=mathis/&gt; with the outdoor action sequences shot primarily at the [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth, Calif.]] The serial's production number was 1197.&lt;ref name=mathis/&gt; The success of the original serial ''Jungle Girl'' prompted the sequel, but the studio did not want to pay licensing fees to Burroughs again, so it avoided any repetition of the term "Jungle Girl," to which he had the rights. Instead, "Nyoka," the name of the main character in the first film, was placed in the title of the sequel, because that name was an original creation of Republic's writers, not of Burroughs.&lt;ref name="GMS"/&gt;

==Release==

===Theatrical===
''Perils of Nyoka'''s official release date is 27 June 1942, although this is actually the date the seventh chapter was made available to film exchanges.&lt;ref name=mathis/&gt; The serial was re-released on 2 April 1952, under the new title ''Nyoka and the Tigermen'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mayer, Geoff|title=Encyclopedia of American Film Serials|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|year=2017|page=299|isbn=978-0-7864-7762-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the first runs of ''[[Radar Men from the Moon]]'' and ''[[Zombies of the Stratosphere]]''.&lt;ref name=mathis/&gt;

A version for French territories was titled "KING -KONG CHEZ LES ARABES / KING KONG bij de ARABIEN

===Television===
''Perils of Nyoka'' was one of twenty-six Republic serials re-released as a film on television in 1966. The title of the film was changed to ''Nyoka and the Lost Secrets of Hippocrates''. This version was cut down to 100-minutes in length.&lt;ref name=mathis/&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Jim Harmon]] and [[Donald F. Glut]] write that this is probably the best Jungle serial ever made and that it "lavished in increased production values."&lt;ref name="GMS"/&gt; Cline notes that ''Perils of Nyoka'' stands out in the memories of the original serial audiences despite the strong competition of 1942.&lt;ref name="Cline1"/&gt;

'''Pirate decryption''' most often refers to the [[decryption]], or decoding, of [[pay TV]] or pay radio signals without permission from the original broadcaster. The term "pirate" in this case is used in the sense of [[copyright infringement]] and has little or nothing to do with [[Pirate|sea piracy]], nor with [[pirate radio]], which involved the operation of a small broadcast [[radio station]] without lawfully obtaining a license to transmit.  The [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] and other groups which lobby in favour of [[intellectual property]] (specifically [[copyright]] and trademark) regulations have labelled such decryption as "signal theft"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpaa.org/piracy_other.asp mpaa.org], [[Motion Picture Association of America]] - Who Are Movie Thieves?&lt;/ref&gt; even though there is no direct tangible loss on the part of the original broadcaster, arguing that losing out on a potential [[market capitalization|chance to profit]] from a [[consumer]]'s subscription fees counts as a loss of actual profit.

== History ==
The concept of pay TV involves a broadcaster deliberately transmitting signals in a non-standard, scrambled or encrypted format in order to charge viewers a [[subscription]] fee for the use of a special decoder needed to receive the scrambled [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] signal. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Early pay TV broadcasts in countries such as the [[United States]] used standard over-the-air transmitters; many restrictions applied as [[anti-siphoning law]]s were enacted to prevent broadcasters of scrambled signals from engaging in activities to harm the development of standard [[free-to-air]] commercial broadcasting. Scrambled signals were limited to large communities which already had a certain minimum number of unencrypted broadcast stations, relegated to certain frequencies. Restrictions were placed on access of pay TV broadcasters to content such as recent feature films in order to give free TV broadcasters a chance to air these programs before they were siphoned away by pay channels.

Under these conditions, the pay TV concept was very slow to become commercially viable; most television and radio broadcasts remained in-the-clear and were funded by commercial [[advertising]], individual and corporate donations to [[educational]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]], direct funding by governments or license fees charged to the owners of receiving apparatus (the [[BBC]] in the UK, for example).

Pay TV only began to become common after the widespread installation of [[cable television]] systems in the 1970s and 1980s; early premium channels were most often movie broadcasters such as the US-based [[Home Box Office]] and [[Cinemax]], both currently owned by [[Time Warner]]. Signals were obtained for distribution by cable companies using C-band satellite dish antennae of up to ten feet in diameter; the first satellite signals were originally unencrypted as extremely few individual end-users could afford the large and expensive satellite receiving apparatus.

As satellite dishes became smaller and more affordable, most satellite signal providers adopted various forms of [[encryption]] in order to limit reception to certain groups (such as hotels, cable companies, or paid subscribers) or to specific political regions. Early encryption attempts such as [[Videocipher II]] were common targets for pirate decryption as dismayed viewers saw large amounts of formerly-unencrypted programming vanishing. Nowadays some free-to-air [[satellite]] content in the USA still remains, but many of the channels still in the clear are ethnic channels, local over-the-air TV stations, international broadcasters, religious programming, backfeeds of network programming destined to local TV stations or signals uplinked from mobile satellite trucks to provide live news and sports coverage.

Specialty channels and premium movie channels are most often encrypted; in most countries, broadcasts containing explicit [[pornography]] must always be encrypted to prevent reception by those who wish children not to be exposed to this sort of "adult content."

== Technical issues ==
Initial attempts to encrypt broadcast signals were based on analogue techniques of questionable security, the most common being one or a combination of techniques such as:
* Weakening or attenuating specific portions of the video signal, typically those required to maintain [[synchronization]].
* Inverting video signals so that white becomes black (and vice versa).
* Adding an interfering signal at one specific frequency which could be simply filtered out at a suitably equipped receiver.
* Moving the audio portion of the signal to some other frequency or sending it in a non-standard format.

These systems were designed to provide decoders to cable operators at low cost; a serious tradeoff was made in security. Some analogue decoders were addressable so that cable companies could turn channels on or off remotely, but this only gave the cable companies control of their own descramblers &amp;mdash; valuable if needed to deactivate a stolen cable company decoder but useless against hardware designed by signal pirates.

The first encryption methods used for big-dish satellite systems used a hybrid approach; analogue video and digital encrypted audio. This approach was somewhat more secure, but not completely free of problems due to piracy of video signals.

Direct broadcast satellites and [[digital cable]] services, because of their digital format, are free to use more robust security measures such as the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES) or the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] and [[International Data Encryption Algorithm|IDEA]] digital encryption standards. When first introduced, digital [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] broadcasts were touted as being secure enough to put an end to piracy once and for all. Often these claims would be made in press releases.

The enthusiasm was short-lived. In theory the system was an ideal solution, but some corners had been cut in the initial implementations in the rush to launch the service. The first US DirecTV smart cards were based on the [[BSkyB]] [[VideoCrypt]] card known as the Sky 09 card. The Sky 09 card had been introduced in 1994 as a replacement for the compromised Sky 07 card. It, the Sky 09 card, had been totally compromised in Europe at the time (1995). The countermeasure employed by [[NDS Group]], the designers of the VideoCrypt system was to issue a new smartcard (known as the Sky 10 card) that included an [[application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] in addition to the card's [[microcontroller]]. This innovation made it harder for pirates to manufacture pirate VideoCrypt cards. Previously, the program in the Sky card's microcontroller could be rewritten for other microcontrollers without too much difficulty. The addition of an [[application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] took the battle between the system designers and pirates to another level and it bought BSkyB at least six months of almost piracy-free broadcasting before the pirate Sky 10 cards appeared on the market in 1996. Initial pirate Sky 10 cards had an implementation of this ASIC but once supplies ran out, pirates resorted to extracting the ASICs from deactivated Sky cards and reusing them.

The first US DirecTV "F" card did not contain an ASIC and it was quickly compromised. Pirate DirecTV cards based on microcontrollers that were often ironically more secure than that used in the official card became a major problem for DirecTV. Similar errors had been made by the developers of the UK's terrestrial digital [[Xtraview Encryption System]], which provided no encryption and relied on hiding channels from listings.

The DirecTV "F" card was replaced with the "H" card, which contained an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] to handle decryption. However, due to similarities between the "H" and other existing cards, it became apparent that while the signal could not be received without the card and its [[application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]], the card itself was vulnerable to tampering by reprogramming it to add channel tiers or additional programming, opening TV channels to the prying eyes of the pirates.

Two more card swaps would be necessary before the piracy headaches at DirecTV would finally go away; a number of other providers are also in the middle of swapping out all of their subscribers' smartcards due to compromised [[encryption]] methods or technology.

A number of vulnerabilities exist even with digital encryption:

* The same algorithm is used, potentially, for millions of subscribed receivers and or smartcards. The designers have the choice of using their own custom, secret algorithm or using a publicly tested one. The first approach is often referred to as [[security by obscurity]]. It can work well if the technology and the algorithm are robust. This approach also has a hidden catch for any potential pirate in that he would have to understand and emulate the custom algorithm in order to implement a pirate device.
* With many digital TV encryption systems relying on smartcards for their security, any compromise of the smartcard would require a complete replacement of all smartcards being used. That could potentially involve the replacement of millions of smartcards. On a system with a low number of subscribers, the smartcards can be replaced periodically. However, as the number of subscribers grows, the cost of replacing the smartcards and the logistics of the replacement encourages the system users to try to get the longest use out of the smartcards before replacement. The chances of a fatal compromise on the smartcard increases as the time between replacement increases.
* Any compromise of the smartcard or algorithm will become public quickly. [[Computer]]s and [[Internet]] can be used to make crucial design details publicly available. Internet sites may be located offshore in countries where local laws permit the information and [[Computer software|software]] to be distributed openly; some of the more notorious software distributed to pirates ranges from NagraEdit (a program intended to edit the information stored on [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-designed Kudelski NagraVision 1 smartcards) to firmware which may be used to reprogram some [[free-to-air]] set-top boxes or desktop PCs equipped with [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) tuner cards to permit them to decode encrypted broadcasts.
* The secrecy of any algorithm is only as trustworthy as the people with access to the algorithm; if any of them were to divulge any of the design secrets, every card with the compromised [[algorithm]] may need to be replaced for security to be restored. In some cases, outside personnel (such as those employed by lawyers in the NDS vs. DirecTV [[intellectual property]] [[lawsuit]] over the P4 card design) may obtain access to key and very sensitive information, increasing the risk of the information being leaked for potential use by pirates.
* If less secure encryption is used due to processor limitations on the smartcards, the system is vulnerable to [[:Category:cryptographic attacks|cryptographic attack]] using [[distributed processing]]. While most secure Internet and online banking transactions require 128-bit encryption, 56-bit codes are not uncommon in video encryption. A cryptographic attack against a 56-bit [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] code would still be prohibitively time-consuming on a single processor. A distributed approach in which many users each run software to scan just a portion of the possible combinations, then upload results to one or more central points on a network such as the [[Internet]], may provide information of value to pirates who wish to break [[security]]. Distributed processing attacks were used, successfully in some cases, against the D2-MAC/EuroCrypt system used in Europe during the 1990s.
* The resources available for [[reverse engineering]] increase significantly if a direct competitor with [[smartcard]] manufacturing knowledge were to attempt to maliciously compromise the system. [[Integrated circuits]] may be vulnerable to microprobing or analysis under an electron microscope once acid or chemical means have been used to expose the bare silicon circuitry. One lawsuit has already been launched by [[Canal+]], dropped as the result of the one billion Euro deal to sell TelePiu (Italy), then continued by Echostar (USA). The suit alleged that competitor [[NDS Group]] had maliciously used reverse engineering to obtain the computer programs contained within various pay-TV smartcards (including [[Mediaguard|SECA]] and Nagra cards) and allowed the results had been posted to Internet sites such as the notorious DR7.com.

On May 15, 2008, a jury in the Echostar vs NDS civil lawsuit (8:2003cv00950) awarded Echostar just over US$1500 in damages; Echostar originally sought $1 billion in damages from NDS. However, a jury was not convinced of the allegations Echostar had made against NDS and awarded damages only for the factual claims that were proven and for which the jury believed an award should be given in accordance with the laws of the United States.

* The signals moving between the smartcard and the receiver can be easily intercepted and analyzed.  They can be vulnerable to a "glitch" by which the incoming power and clock signals are disrupted for a short and carefully timed length of time (such as a millionth of a second) in order to cause the processor to skip an instruction. In many cases, off-the-shelf hardware with modified firmware designed to exploit this weakness was sold to pirates for use in tampering with cards for the US-based [[DirecTV]] system.
* In some cases, [[buffer overflow]] exploits have been used to gain access to otherwise locked cards in order to reprogram them.
* A scheme to monitor the exact instantaneous power consumption of smartcards as they make their computations also provides clues as to what type of computations are being performed.

In some cases, [[fraudulent cloning]] has been used to assign identical serial numbers to multiple receivers or cards; subscribe (or unsubscribe) one receiver and the same programming changes appear on all of the others. Various techniques have also been used to provide [[write protection]] for memory on the smartcards or receivers to make deactivation or sabotage of tampered cards by signal providers more difficult.

Systems based on removable smartcards do facilitate the implementation of [[renewable security]], where compromised systems can be repaired by sending new and redesigned cards to legitimate subscribers, but they also make the task of replacing smartcards with tampered cards or inserting devices between card and receiver easier for pirates. In some European systems, the [[conditional-access module]] (CAM) which serves as a standardized interface between smartcard and DVB receiver has also been targeted for tampering or replaced by third-party hardware.

Improvements in hardware and system design can be used to significantly reduce the risks of any encryption system being compromised, but many systems once thought secure have been proven vulnerable to sufficiently sophisticated and malicious attackers.

Two-way communication has also been used by designers of proprietary digital cable TV equipment in order to make tampering more difficult or easier to detect. A scheme involving the use of a [[high-pass filter]] on the line to prevent two-way communication has been widely promoted by some unscrupulous businesses as a means of disabling communication of billing information for [[pay-per-view]] programming but this device is effectively worthless as a cable operator remains free to unsubscribe a digital set-top box if two-way communication has been lost. As a device intended to pass signals in one direction only, the line filters offer nothing that couldn't be done (with the same results) by an inexpensive signal booster - a simple one-way RF amplifier already widely available cheaply and readily for other purposes. Also, many such boxes will disallow access to pay-per-view content after a set number of programs are watched before the box can transmit this data to the headend, further reducing the usefulness of such a filter.

==Terminology and Definitions==

Some of the terminology used to describe various devices, programs and techniques dealing with Pay-TV piracy is named for the particular hacks. The "Season" interface for example is named after the Season7 hack on Sky TV which allowed a PC to emulate a legitimate Sky-TV smartcard. The Season7 referred to the seventh and final season of [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]] which was then showing on Sky One. The "Phoenix" hack was named after the mythical bird which can reanimate itself. The hack itself reactivated smartcards that had been switched off by the providers.

Some of the terminology used on Internet discussion sites to describe the various devices, programs and techniques used in dealing with video piracy is strange, non-standard, or specific to one system.  The terms are often no different from the brand names used by legitimate products and serve the same function.

===ISO/IEC 7816 smartcard terminology===

* [[Answer to reset|ATR]] is the answer-to-reset data from an ISO/IEC 7816-compliant smartcard. A card reader would provide power, clock and reset signals to a smartcard, along with a bidirectional serial data interface to permit communication. On reset, the card would send a standard block of serial data (nominally at 9600 bit/s) to identify the card type and indicate the desired bitrate for further communication. The frequency of clock to be supplied may vary from one system or card type to another as it appears not to have been specified in the ISO standard.
* A smart [[card reader]] is a device that allows a computer to communicate with a smartcard. Technically, these are simple devices consisting of a smartcard socket, some voltage level conversion circuitry and a crystal oscillator to supply the card with its clock signal. Early models were connected to the serial port on computers so the interface circuitry had to convert between the [[ISO/IEC 7816]] card voltage levels and the [[RS-232]] voltage levels used by the computer's serial port. More recent models use a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connection to the computer. The simplest of earlier devices was the ''Phoenix interface''. More sophisticated readers are often used in systems where the personal computer itself is to be secured using smartcard systems.
* ''AVR'' and ''ATmega'' are trade names for a series of general-purpose 8-bit [[microcontroller]] chips manufactured by [[Atmel]] Corporation. The terms have been misused widely to refer to blank smartcards or various other hardware devices which were built around these processors. The widely available European ''funcard'' series of blank generic ISO/IEC 7816 smartcards were based upon the Atmel processor series; there was also a ''PIC card'' based on the [[Microchip Technology|Microchip]] Corporation PIC series of processors.
* [[emulator|Emulation]] refers to the use of a personal computer in place of a smartcard using an [[ISO/IEC 7816]]-compatible "Season" interface. The PC, as far as the decoder is concerned, becomes a legitimate smartcard due to the program running on it. The program responds like a legitimate smartcard. Sometimes, for development purposes, the PC is programmed to simulate the entire instruction set of the smartcard's [[microcontroller]] to allow smartcard code to be developed more readily. As some encryption systems require an application-specific IC ([[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]) on the card to perform decryption, a pirate would also use a card which had been "auxed" (reprogrammed to pass received computer data directly to the application-specific decryption chip) in order to employ such an emulation system. Alternatively, pirates can sometimes emulate the functionality of the ASIC itself to gain access to the encrypted data.
* A [[looped smartcard]] is one where defective or malicious program code written to [[non-volatile memory]] causes the smartcard's [[microcontroller]] to enter an [[endless loop]] on power-up or reset, rendering the card unusable. This is typically a countermeasure used by encryption system owners to permanently deactivate smartcards. In many cases, not even the [[ISO/IEC 7816]] ATR message would be sent. ''Unloopers'' were smartcard repair stations intended to cause the card to skip one or more instructions by applying a "glitch" in some form to the power or clock signal in the hope of allowing the smartcard's microcontroller to exit from the endless loop.
* ''Bootloaders'' were hardware which used a similar "glitch" to break a card out of an endless loop on power-up each time the card was used; these did not provide any smartcard reprogramming ability. These could permit DirecTV "H" cards (now no longer in use) to operate despite the permanent damage done by malicious code during the "Black Sunday" attack of 2001. These devices are currently believed to be obsolete.

===Receiver (IRD) and microprocessor terminology===

* [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] is an international standard for digital video broadcasting used by virtually all European broadcasters; some North American providers use incompatible proprietary standards such as [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSS]] (DirecTV) or [[DigiCipher 2|DigiCipher]] (Motorola) which predate the DVB standardisation effort. The packet size, tables and control information transmitted by proprietary systems require proprietary non-DVB receivers, even though the video itself nominally in some form will often still adhere to the [[MPEG-2]] image compression standard defined by the Moving Picture Experts Group.
* An [[Integrated receiver/decoder|IRD]] is an integrated receiver-decoder, in other words a complete digital satellite TV or radio receiver; "decoder" in this context refers not to decryption but to the decompression and conversion of MPEG video into displayable format.
* [[free-to-air|FTA]] is often used to refer to receivers and equipment which contain no decryption hardware, built with the intention of being able to receive unencrypted [[free-to-air]] broadcasts; more properly FTA refers to the unencrypted broadcasts themselves.
* A [[conditional-access module|CAM]] or conditional-access module is defined by the DVB standard as an interface between a standardised DVB [[Common Interface]] receiver and one or more proprietary smartcards for signal decryption. It is not the smartcard itself. The standard format of this module follows [[PCMCIA]] specifications; some receivers bypass the requirement for a separate module by providing embedded CAM functionality in the receiver to communicate with specific proprietary smartcards such as [[Nagravision]], [[Conax]], Irdeto, [[Viaccess]], [[Betacrypt]]. In the North American market, most "package receivers" sold by signal providers provide embedded CAM operation; terminology is therefore often misused to misidentify the smartcard as a CAM.
* [[JTAG]] is a standard test interface defined by the Joint Test Action Group and supported on many late-model digital receivers for factory test purposes. Operating using a six-wire interface and a personal computer, the JTAG interface was originally intended to provide a means to test and debug embedded hardware and software. In the satellite TV world, JTAG is most often used to obtain read-write access to nonvolatile memory within a digital receiver; initially programs such as Wall and JKeys were used to read box keys from receivers with embedded CAMs but JTAG has since proven its legitimate worth to satellite TV fans as a repair tool to fix receivers where the firmware (in flash memory) has been corrupted.
* The ''Sombrero de Patel'' is another device used to obtain [[direct memory access]] to a receiver without physically removing memory chips from the board to place them in sockets or read them with a specialized device programmer. The device consists of a standard PLCC [[integrated circuit]] [[Jack (connector)|socket]] which has been turned upside-down in order to be placed directly over a [[microprocessor]] already permanently soldered to a [[printed circuit board]] in a receiver; the socket makes [[electrical contact]] with all pins of the microprocessor and is interfaced to one or more microcontrollers which use direct memory access to pause the receiver's microprocessor and read or write directly to the memory. The term ''sombrero'' is used for this hack as the novel use of an inverted IC socket somewhat resembles a [[hat]] being placed upon the main processor.

== SmartCard piracy ==
Smart card piracy involves the unauthorised use of conditional-access [[smart card]]s, in order to gain, and potentially provide to others, unauthorised access to pay-TV or even private [[Mass media|media]] broadcasts. Smart card piracy generally occurs after a breach of security in the smart card, exploited by computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] in order to gain complete access to the card's [[encryption]] system.

Once access has been gained to the smart card's encryption system, the hacker can perform changes to the card's internal information, which in turn tricks the conditional-access system into believing that it has been allowed access, by the legitimate card provider, to other television channels using the same encryption system. In some cases, the channels do not even have to be from the same television provider, since many providers use similar encryption systems, or use cards which have the capacity to store information for decoding those channels also. The information on how to hack the card is normally held within small, underground groups, to which public access is not possible. Instead, the hacking groups may release their hack in several forms. One such way is simply to release the encryption algorithm and key. Another common release method is by releasing a [[computer program]] which can be used by the smart card user to reprogram their card. Once complete, the now illegally modified smart card is known as a "MOSC." (Modified Original Smart Card). A third such method, more common in recent times, is to sell the information gained on the encryption to a third party, who will then release their own smart card, such as the K3 card. This third party, for legal reasons, will then use a fourth party to release encrypted files, which then allow the card to decode encrypted content.

Along with modifying original cards, it is possible to use the information provided by the smart card to create an encryption emulator. This, in turn, can be [[Computer programming|programmed]] into a cable or satellite receiver's internal software, and offered for download on the internet as a [[firmware]] upgrade. This allows access to the encrypted channels by those who do not even own a smart card. In recent times, many underground [[Internet forum|forum]] websites dedicated to the hobby of satellite piracy and encryption emulated [[Free To Air]] (FTA) receivers have been set up, giving up-to-date information on [[Satellite television|satellite]] and [[Cable television|cable]] [[Copyright infringement|piracy]], including making available firmware downloads for receivers, and very detailed encryption system information available to the public.

Upon gaining the knowledge that their system has been compromised, the smart card providers often have several counter measure systems against unauthorised viewing, which can be put in place over the air, in most cases causing virtually no disruption to legitimate viewers. The simplest form of counter measure is a key change. This simply halts viewing for those viewing without authorisation temporarily, since the new key can easily be accessed in the hacked card, and implemented. There are often other more complicated procedures which update a part of the smart card in order to make it inaccessible. These procedures can also, however, be hacked, once again allowing access. This leads to a game of "[[cat and mouse]]" between the smart card provider, and the hackers. This, after several stages of progression, can leave the smart card provider in a situation where they no longer have any further counter measures to implement. This leaves them in a situation where they must perform a card and encryption change with all legitimate viewers, in order to eliminate the viewing of the service without permission, at least for the foreseeable future.

Such has been the success of implementing new smart card systems, that another form of smart card piracy has grown in popularity. This method is called [[card sharing]], which works by making available the smart card decoding information in real time to other users, via a computer network. Police monitoring of unsecured card sharing networks has led to prosecutions.

Virtually every common encryption system is publicly known to have been compromised. These include [[Viaccess]], [[Nagravision]], SECA [[Mediaguard]] and [[Conax]]. The MediaCipher system, owned by Motorola, along with Scientific Atlanta's PowerKEY system, are the only digital TV encryption systems which have not publicly been compromised. This is largely thanks to there being no [[PC card]] [[conditional-access module]]s (CAMs) available for either encryption system.

Despite the unauthorised decryption of media being illegal in many countries, smart card piracy is a crime which is very rarely punished, due to it being virtually undetectable, particularly in the case of [[Satellite television|satellite]] viewing. Laws in many countries do not clearly specify whether the decryption of foreign media services is illegal or not. This has caused much confusion in places such as Europe, where the proximity of many countries, coupled with the large land mass covered by satellite beams, allows signal access to many different providers. These providers are reluctant to pursue criminal charges against many viewers as they live in different countries. There have, however, been several high-profile prosecution cases in the [[United States|USA]], where satellite dealers have been taken to court resulting in large fines or jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Bob |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3078496 |title=Satellite TV hackers nabbed by FBI |publisher=NBC News |date=2003-02-11 |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet key sharing ==
{{main article|card sharing}}
An Internet key sharing scheme consists of one smart card with a valid, paid subscription which is located on an Internet server. It generates a stream of real-time decryption keys which are broadcast over the Internet to remotely located satellite receivers. Limiting factors in the number of remotely located satellite receivers are the network latency and the period between the updated keys and the ability of the card client's receiver to use the decrypted key stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openu.ac.il/personal_sites/tamirtassa/download/conferences/dtt_conf.pdf|title=Dynamic Traitor Tracing|first1=Amos |last1=Fiat|first2=Tamir|last2=Tassa|publisher=[[Tel Aviv University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each receiver is configured in an identical manner, a clone receiving the same television signal from a satellite and, from the internet server, the same decryption keys to unlock that signal. As the server must have individually subscribed smart cards for each channel to be viewed, its continued operation tends to be costly and may require multiple subscriptions under different names and addresses. There is also a risk that as the number of card clients on the card sharing network grows, it will attract the attention of the satellite TV service provider and law enforcement agencies and the monitoring of IP addresses associated with this card sharing network may identify individual users and server operators who then become targets for legal action by the satellite TV service provider or by legal authorities.

Key sharing schemes are typically used where replacement of compromised smart card systems (such as the deprecation of Nagra 1/2 in favour of Nagra 3) has made other pirate decryption methods non-functional.

In February 2014, an episode of [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s "Inside Out" disclosed that the complete [[BSkyB|Sky TV]] package could be obtained from black-market sources for as little as £10 per month through Internet key sharing, [[Swansea]] and [[Cardiff]] were highlighted with significant activity in pubs using cracked boxes to show Premier League football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-26052012 |title=Pirated Sky TV sold for £10 a month |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political issues ==
In some countries such as [[Canada]] and many [[Caribbean]] nations (except for the [[Dominican Republic]]), the [[black market]] in satellite TV piracy is closely tied to the [[gray market]] activity of using direct broadcast satellite signals to watch broadcasts intended for one country in some other, adjacent country. Many smaller countries have no domestic DBS operations and therefore few or no legal restrictions on the use of decoders which capture foreign signals.

The refusal of most providers to knowingly issue subscriptions outside their home country leads to a situation where pirate decryption is perceived as being one of the few ways to obtain certain programming. If there is no domestic provider for a channel, a grey market (subscribed using another address) or black market (pirate) system is prerequisite to receive many specific ethnic, sport or premium movie services.

Pirate or grey-market reception also provides viewers a means to bypass [[Blackout (broadcasting)|local blackout]] restrictions on [[sports|sporting events]] and to access [[hard-core pornography]] where some content is not otherwise available.

The grey market for US satellite receivers in Canada at one point was estimated to serve as many as several hundred thousand English-speaking Canadian households. Canadian authorities, acting under pressure from cable companies and domestic broadcasters, have made many attempts to prevent Canadians from subscribing to US direct-broadcast services such as AT&amp;T's DirecTV and Echostar's Dish Network.

While litigation has gone as far as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], no judicial ruling has yet been made on whether such restrictions violate the safeguards of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] which are intended to protect [[freedom of expression]] and prevent [[linguistics|linguistic]] or [[ethnic discrimination]]. Domestic satellite and cable providers have adopted a strategy of judicial delay in which their legal counsel will file an endless series of otherwise-useless motions before the courts to ensure that the proponents of the grey-market systems run out of money before the "Charter Challenge" issue is decided.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

According to K. William McKenzie, the Orillia Ontario lawyer who won the case in the Supreme Court of Canada, a consortium headed by David Fuss and supported by Dawn Branton and others later launched a constitutional challenge to defeat section 9(1)(c) of the Radiocommunication Act on the basis that it breached the guarantee of Freedom of Expression enshrined in section 2 (c) of the Canadian Charter of Rights.

The evidence compiled by Mr. McKenzie from his broadcasting clients in opposition to this challenge was so overwhelming that it was abandoned and the Court ordered that substantial costs be paid by the applicants.

In most cases, broadcast distributors will require a domestic billing address before issuing a subscription; post boxes and commercial mail receiving agencies are often used by grey-market subscribers to foreign providers to circumvent this restriction.

The situation in the US itself differs as it is complicated by the legal question of subscriber access to distant local TV stations. Satellite providers are severely limited in their ability to offer subscriptions to distant locals due to the risk of further lawsuits by local affiliates of the same network in the subscribers home [[designated market area]]. California stations have sued satellite providers who distributed New York signals nationally, as the distant stations would have an unfair advantage by broadcasting the same programming three hours earlier.

There is also a small "reverse gray market" for Canadian signals, transmitted with a footprint which sends full-strength DBS signals to many if not all of the contiguous 48 [[US states]]. This is desirable not only to receive Canadian-only content, but because some US-produced programs air in Canada in advance of their US broadcast. The question of [[signal substitution]], by which Canadian cable and satellite providers substitute the signal of a local or domestic channel over a foreign or distant channel carrying the same program, is rendered more complex by the existence of a reverse grey market. Signal substitution had already been the cause of strong diplomatic protests by the United States, which considers the practice to constitute theft of advertising revenue.

The lack of domestic competition for premium movie channels in Canada is one factor encouraging grey-market reception; language is another key issue as most Spanish-language programming in [[North America]] is on the US system and most French-language programming is on the Canadian system. A larger selection of sports and ethnic programming is also available to grey-market subscribers.

It could be said that the 1000-channel universe is a "reality" in North America, but only for the signal pirates as many legal and geographic restrictions are placed on the ability to subscribe to many if not most of the physically available channels.

Other countries such as [[Nicaragua]] during Sandinista rule, [[Cuba]], [[Iran]] (Islamic Republic of Iran) and [[Afghanistan]] during [[Taliban]] rule and [[Iraq]] during the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime, have attempted to prohibit their citizens from receiving any satellite broadcasts from foreign sources.

The situation in [[Europe]] differs somewhat, due to the much greater linguistic diversity in that region and due to the use of standardized DVB receivers capable of receiving multiple providers and free-to-air signals. North American providers normally lock their subscribers into "package receivers" unable to tune outside their one package; often the receivers are sold at artificially low prices and the subscription cost for programming is increased in order to favour new subscribers over existing ones. Providers are also notorious for using sales tactics such as [[Product bundling|bundling]], in which to obtain one desired channel a subscriber must purchase a block of anywhere from several to more than a hundred other channels at substantial cost.

Many European companies such as British Sky Broadcasting prohibit subscriptions outside the UK and Ireland. But other satellite providers such as [[Sky Deutschland]] do sell yearly subscription cards legally to customers in other European countries without the need for an address or other personal information.  The latter also applies to virtually all the Adult channel cards sold in Europe.

==Counter-piracy techniques==
A number of strategies have been used by providers to control or prevent the widespread pirate decryption of their signals.

One approach has been to take legal action against dealers who sell equipment which may be of use to satellite pirates; in some cases the objective has been to obtain lists of clients in order to take or threaten to take costly legal action against end-users. Providers have created departments with names like the "office of signal integrity" or the "end-users group" to pursue alleged pirate viewers.

As some equipment (such as a computer interface to communicate with standard ISO/IEC 7816 smartcards) is useful for other purposes, this approach has drawn strong opposition from groups such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. There have also been US counter-suits alleging that the legal tactics used by some DBS providers to demand large amounts of money from end-users may themselves appear unlawful or border on extortion.

Much of the equipment is perfectly lawful to own; in these cases, only the misuse of the equipment to pirate signals is prohibited. This makes provider attempts at legal harassment of would-be pirates awkward at best, a serious problem for providers which is growing due to the Internet distribution of third-party software to reprogram some otherwise legitimate free-to-air DVB receivers to decrypt pay TV broadcasts with no extra hardware.

US-based Internet sites containing information about the compromised [[encryption]] schemes have also been targeted by lawyers, often with the objective of costing the defendants enough in legal fees that they have to shut down or move their sites to offshore or foreign Internet hosts.

In some cases, the serial numbers of unsubscribed smartcards have been [[blacklisted]] by providers, causing receivers to display error messages. A "hashing" approach of writing arbitrary data to every available location on the card and requiring that this data be present as part of the decryption algorithm has also been tried as a way of leaving less available free space for third-party code supplied by pirates.

Another approach has been to load [[malicious code]] onto smartcards or receivers; these programs are intended to detect tampered cards and maliciously damage the cards or corrupt the contents of [[non-volatile]] memories within the receiver. This particular [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] attack is often used as an ECM ([[Electronic countermeasures|electronic countermeasure]]) by providers, especially in North America where cards and receivers are sold by the providers themselves and are easy targets for insertion of [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]s in their computer [[firmware]]. The most famous ECM incident was the Black Sunday attack launched against tampered DirecTV "H" on 3 January 21, 2001 and intended to destroy the cards by overwriting a non-erasable part of the cards internal [[computer storage|memory]] in order to lock the processor into an [[endless loop]].

The results of a provider resorting to the use of malicious code are usually temporary at best, as knowledge of how to repair most damage tends to be distributed rapidly by hobbyists through various [[Internet]] forums. There is also a potential legal question involved (which has yet to be addressed) as the equipment is normally the property not of the provider but of the end user. Providers will often print on the smartcard itself that the card is the property of the signal provider, but at least one legal precedent indicates that marking "this is mine" on a card, putting it in a box with a receiver and then selling it can legally mean "this is not mine anymore". Malicious damage to receiver firmware puts providers on even shakier legal ground in the unlikely event that the matter were ever to be heard by the judiciary.

The only solution which has shown any degree of long-term success against tampered smartcards has been the use of digital [[renewable security]]; if the code has been broken and the contents of the smartcard's programming widely posted across the Internet, replacing every smartcard in every subscriber's receiver with one of different, uncompromised design will effectively put an end to a piracy problem. Providers tend to be slow to go this route due to cost (as many have millions of legitimate subscribers, each of which must be sent a new card) and due to concern that someone may eventually crack the code used in whatever new replacement card is used, causing the process to begin anew.

Premiere in Germany has replaced all of its smartcards with the Nagravision Aladin card; the US DirecTV system has replaced its three compromised card types ("F" had no encryption chip, "H" was vulnerable to being reprogrammed by pirates and "HU" were vulnerable to a "glitch" which could be used to make them skip an instruction). Both providers have been able to eliminate their problems with signal piracy by replacing the compromised smartcards after all other approaches had proved to provide at best limited results.

[[Dish Network]] and [[Bell TV]] had released new and more tamper-resistant smart cards over the years, known as the ROM2, ROM3, ROM10, ROM11 series.  All these cards used the [[Nagravision|Nagravision 1]] access system.  Despite introducing newer and newer security measures, older cards were typically still able to decrypt the satellite signal after new cards were released (A lack of [[EEPROM]] space on the ROM2 cards eventually led to them being unable to receive updates necessary to view programming).  In an effort to stop piracy, as by this point the Nagravision 1 system had been thoroughly reverse-engineered by resourceful hobbyists, an incompatible [[Nagravision|Nagravision 2]] encryption system was introduced along with a smart card swap-out for existing customers.  As more cards were swapped, channel groups were slowly converted to the new encryption system, starting with [[pay-per-view]] and [[HDTV]] channels, followed by the premium movie channels.  This effort culminated in a complete shutdown of the Nagravision 1 datastream for all major channels in September, 2005.  Despite these efforts to secure their programming, a software hack was released in late August, 2005, allowing for the decryption of the new Nagravision 2 channels with a [[DVB-S]] card and a [[Personal computer|PC]]. Just a few months later, early revisions of the Nagravision 2 cards had been themselves compromised. Broadcast programming currently{{When|date=November 2010}} uses a [[simulcrypt]] of Nagravision 2 and Nagravision 3, a first step toward a possible future shutdown of Nagravision 2 systems.

=== Litigation ===
Various groups have been targeted for lawsuits in connection with pirate decryption issues:
* In 2006, a decision in ''Snow v.

DirecTV cannot sue on this theory, dismissing DirecTV's attempt to punish individuals twice for a single offense and upholding a lower court decision that 47 U.S.C., section 605(e)(4) does not apply to individuals owning interception devices solely for personal use.

* Québécor-owned [[cable television]] operator Videotron sued [[Bell TV]] on the grounds that free signals from compromised satellite TV encryption unfairly cost the cable company paid subscribers. After multiple appeals and rulings against Bell, Québécor and [[TVA Group]] were ultimately awarded $141 million in 2015.&lt;ref name="rc-bell-videotron"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Economie/2015/10/15/002-videotron-bell-expressvu-cour-supreme-refuse-entendre-appel.shtml |title=Bell ExpressVu devra verser des millions à Vidéotron |publisher=Radio-Canada |date=2015-05-22 |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most severe sentences handed out for satellite TV piracy in the United States was to a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman, Martin Clement Mullen, widely known for over a decade in the satellite industry as "Marty" Mullen.

Mullen was sentenced to seven years in prison with no parole and ordered to pay DirecTV and smart card provider NDS Ltd. US$24 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty in a Tampa, Florida court in September 2003 after being arrested when he entered the United States using a British passport in the name "Martin Paul Stewart".

Mr. Mullen had operated his satellite piracy business from Florida, the Cayman Islands and from his home in London, Ontario, Canada. Testimony in the Florida court showed that he had a network of over 100 sub-dealers working for him and that during one six-week period, he cleared US$4.4 million in cash from re-programming DirecTV smartcards that had been damaged in an electronic counter measure.

NDS Inc. Chief of Security John Norris pursued Mullen for a decade in three different countries. When Mullen originally fled the United States to Canada in the mid-1990s, Norris launched an investigation that saw an undercover operator (a former Canadian police officer named Don Best) become one of Mullen's sub-dealers and his closest personal friend for over a year. In summer of 2003 when Mullen travelled under another identity to visit his operations in Florida, US federal authorities were waiting for him at the airport after being tipped off by Canadian investigators working for NDS Inc.

Ironically the [[NDS Group]] were accused (in several lawsuits) by Canal+ (dismissed as part of an otherwise-unrelated corporate takeover deal) and Echostar (now Dish Network) of hacking the Nagra encryption and releasing the information on the internet.  The jury awarded EchoStar $45.69 actual damages (one month's average subscription fee) in Claim 3.

[[Bell TV]] (as Bell ExpressVu) was sued by [[Vidéotron]], a Québécor-owned rival which operates [[cable television]] systems in major [[Québec]] markets. Québécor also owns TVA, a broadcaster. Bell's inferior security and failure to replace compromised smartcards in a timely fashion cost Vidéotron cable subscribers, as viewers could obtain the same content for free from satellite under the compromised Nagra1 system from 1999 to 2005; pirate decryption also deprived TVA's [[French language]] news channel LCN of a monthly 48¢/subscriber fee.  The [[Superior Court of Quebec]] awarded [[Canadian dollar|$]]339,000 and $262,000 in damages/interest to Vidéotron and TVA Group in 2012. Québec's Appeal Court ruled these dollar amounts "erroneus" and increased them in 2015; despite an attempt to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], a final award of $141 million in damages and interest was upheld.&lt;ref name="rc-bell-videotron"/&gt;

The '''Polski Związek Krótkofalowców''' ('''PZK''') (in [[English language|English]], '''Polish Amateur Radio Union''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Poland]]. Key membership benefits of the PZK include the sponsorship of [[amateur radio operating award]]s, radio [[contesting|contests]], and a [[QSL card|QSL]] bureau for members who regularly communicate with [[amateur radio operator]]s in other countries.&lt;ref name="pzk_web"&gt;Polskiego Związek Krótkofalowców (2008).

==History==
On February 22–24, 1930 ''Polski Zwiazek Krotkofalowcow'' (Polish Amateur Radio Union) was founded and professor [[Janusz Groszkowski]] of the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] was elected as its first President. [[World War II]] broke out in 1939 and [[amateur radio]] activities were ordered out of existence in Poland.  It took years for PZK to be reborn on January 11, 1957 and to have amateur radio licenses being issued.  PZK activities were financed by the government then on and the membership was obligatory for those who wanted to enjoy amateur radio privileges. Anatol Jeglinski (SP5CM) was elected as the new PZK President. Since 1990, PZK is financed by members &amp; donors and its membership is no longer a requirement for licensing in Poland.&lt;ref name="PZK"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://international.pzk.org.pl/index.html | title=Polski Związek Krótkofalowców (Polish Amateur Radio Union) | accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational Structure==
The PZK National Convention is supreme decision making body, while daily affairs are run by Headquarters, the 5 member Presiding Committee. Committee members are elected for four years terms by the general membership delegates during National Convention and 33 field divisions directors. Executive officers are elected or appointed by the Committee itself.&lt;ref name="PZK"/&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=390|caption=The [[A minor]] melodic minor scale, ascending and descending}}In [[music theory]], a '''scale''' is any set of musical [[note (music)|notes]] ordered by [[fundamental frequency]] or [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a  descending scale. Some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending, for example, the [[melodic minor scale]].

Often, especially in the context of the [[common practice period]], most or all of the [[melody]] and [[harmony]] of a [[musical work]] is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] with a standard [[key signature]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward, Bruce and Saker, Marilyn Nadine (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', seventh edition: vol. 1, p. 25. Boston: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the principle of [[octave]] equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave, with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or [[interval (music)|interval]]) between two successive notes of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Michael (2013). ''Musical Scales of the World'', pp. 2–3. The Note Tree. {{ISBN|978-0-9575470-0-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no need for scale steps to be equal within any scale and, particularly as demonstrated by [[microtonal music]], there is no limit to how many notes can be injected within any given musical interval.

A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale each scale step represents a [[semitone]] interval, while a [[major scale]] is defined by the interval pattern T–T–S–T–T–T–S, where T stands for [[whole tone]] (an interval spanning two semitones), and S stands for semitone. Based on their interval patterns, scales are put into categories including [[diatonic scale|diatonic]], [[chromatic scale|chromatic]], [[major scale|major]], [[minor scale|minor]], and others.

A specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its first [[Degree (music)|degree]] (or [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, [[C major]] indicates a major scale with a C tonic.

==Background==

===Scales, steps, and intervals===
[[File:Major scale in the chromatic circle.png|thumb|Diatonic scale in the [[chromatic circle]]]]

Scales are typically listed from low to high pitch. Most scales are ''[[octave]]-repeating'', meaning their pattern of notes is the same in every octave (the [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]] is one exception). An octave-repeating scale can be represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major scale is C–D–E–F–G–A–B–[C], with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major scale is C–B–A–G–F–E–D–[C], with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.

The distance between two successive notes in a scale is called a [[Degree (music)|scale step]].

The notes of a scale are numbered by their steps from the root of the scale. For example, in a C major scale the first note is C, the second D, the third E and so on. Two notes can also be numbered in relation to each other: C and E create an interval of a third (in this case a major third); D and F also create a third (in this case a minor third).

===Pitch===
A single scale can be manifested at many different pitch levels. For example, a C major scale can be started at C4 (middle C; see [[scientific pitch notation]]) and ascending an octave to C5; or it could be started at C6, ascending an octave to C7. As long as all the notes can be played, the [[octave]] they take on can be altered.

===Types of scale===

  }
}
&lt;/score&gt;|width=350|caption=The [[chromatic scale]], ascending}}Scales may be described according to the number of different pitch classes they contain:

* [[chromatic scale|Chromatic]], or dodecatonic (12 notes per octave)
* [[octatonic scale|Octatonic]] (8 notes per octave): used in [[jazz]] and [[modernism (music)|modern classical music]]
* [[heptatonic scale|Heptatonic]] (7 notes per octave): the most common modern Western scale
* [[hexatonic scale|Hexatonic]] (6 notes per octave): common in Western folk music
* [[pentatonic scale|Pentatonic]] (5 notes per octave): the anhemitonic form (lacking semitones) is common in folk music, especially in Asian music; also known as the "black note" scale
* [[tetratonic scale|Tetratonic]] (4 notes), [[tritonic scale|tritonic]] (3 notes), and [[ditonic scale|ditonic]] (2 notes): generally limited to [[prehistoric music|prehistoric]] ("primitive") music
* [[monotonic scale|Monotonic]] (1 note): limited use in liturgy, and for effect in modern art music{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!--Monotonicity is not controversial, but who claims there is such a thing as a "monotonic scale"?--&gt;

Scales may also be described by their constituent intervals, such as being [[hemitonia|hemitonic]], [[cohemitonia|cohemitonic]], or having imperfections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthescales.org/intro.html#Perfection|title=All The Scales|author=|date=|website=www.allthescales.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015071228/http://allthescales.org/intro.html#Perfection|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many music theorists concur that the constituent intervals of a scale have a large role in the cognitive perception of its sonority, or tonal character.

"The number of the notes that make up a scale as well as the quality of the intervals between successive notes of the scale help to give the music of a culture area its peculiar sound quality."&lt;ref&gt;Nzewi, Meki, and Odyke Nzewi (2007), ''A Contemporary Study of Musical Arts''. Pretoria: Centre for Indigenous Instrumental African Music and Dance. Volume 1 p. 34 {{ISBN|978-1-920051-62-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The pitch distances or intervals among the notes of a scale tell us more about the sound of the music than does the mere number of tones."&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno, and Helen Myers (1976). ''Folk Music in the United States'', p.39. {{ISBN|978-0-8143-1557-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales may also be described by their symmetry, such as being [[palindrome|palindromic]], [[Chirality|chiral]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/#chirality {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330211555/https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |date=30 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, or having rotational symmetry as in Messaien's [[modes of limited transposition]]. 

Scales can also be described by their distribution patterns and possibilities for notation. For example, a [[heliotonic]] scale is one that can be notated with one note head on each line and space, using only single and double alterations (flats, double-flats, sharps, and double-sharps). Thus all heliotonic scales are [[heptatonic scale|heptatonic]], but not all heptatonic scales are heliotonic. Since heliotonia is a metric of a scale's tone distribution pattern, is related to evenness, coherence, spectra variation, and the [[Generic_and_specific_intervals|Myhill Property]].

===Harmonic content===
The notes of a scale form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in [[combination]].  A 5-note scale has 10 of these [[Harmony|harmonic]] intervals, a 6-note scale has 15, a 7-note scale has 21, an 8-note scale has 28.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', pp.7ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the scale is not a [[Chord (music)|chord]], and might never be heard more than one note at a time, still the absence, presence, and placement of certain [[key (music)|key]] intervals plays a large part in the sound of the scale, the natural movement of melody within the scale, and the selection of [[Chord (music)|chords]] taken naturally from the scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A musical scale that contains [[tritone]]s is called tritonic (though the expression is also used for any scale with just three notes per octave, whether or not it includes a tritone), and one without tritones is ''atritonic''.  A scale or [[Chord (music)|chord]] that contains semitones is called hemitonic, and without semitones is [[Anhemitonic scale|anhemitonic]].

===Scales in composition===
Scales can be abstracted from [[performance]] or [[musical composition|composition]]. They are also often used [[precompositional]]ly to guide or limit a composition. Explicit instruction in scales has been part of compositional training for many centuries. One or more scales may be used in a composition, such as in [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[L'Isle Joyeuse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Western music==
{{See also|Musical mode}}
Scales in [[European classical music|traditional Western music]] generally consist of seven notes and repeat at the octave. Notes in the commonly used scales (see just below) are separated by [[Music Terminology|whole and half step]] [[interval (music)|intervals]] of ''tones'' and ''semitones.'' The harmonic minor scale includes a three-semitone step; the anhemitonic pentatonic includes two of those and no semitones.

Western music in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] periods (1100–1600) tends to use the white-note [[diatonic scale]] C–D–E–F–G–A–B. [[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]] are rare, and somewhat unsystematically used, often to avoid the [[tritone]].

Music of the common practice periods (1600–1900) uses three types of scale:
* The [[diatonic scale]] (seven notes)—this includes the major scale and the natural minor
* The melodic and harmonic [[minor scale]]s (seven notes)

These scales are used in all of their transpositions. The music of this period introduces ''modulation,'' which involves systematic changes from one scale to another. Modulation occurs in relatively conventionalized ways. For example, major-mode pieces typically begin in a "tonic" diatonic scale and modulate to the "dominant" scale a fifth above.{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {

&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=The [[whole tone scale]] starting on F, ascending}}In the 19th century (to a certain extent), but more in the 20th century, additional types of scales were explored:

* The [[chromatic scale]] (twelve notes)
* The [[whole tone scale|whole-tone scale]] (six notes)
* The [[pentatonic scale]] (five notes)
* The octatonic or [[diminished scale]]s (eight notes)

} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=The [[Hungarian minor scale]] starting on C, ascending}}A large variety of other scales exists, some of the more common being:

* The [[Phrygian dominant scale]] (a mode of the harmonic minor scale)
* The [[Arabic maqam|Arabic scales]]
* The [[Hungarian minor scale]]
* The [[Byzantine music]] scales (called echoi)
* The [[Persian scale]]
Scales such as the pentatonic scale may be considered ''gapped'' relative to the diatonic scale. An ''auxiliary scale'' is a scale other than the primary or original scale. See: [[modulation (music)]] and [[Petrushka chord|Auxiliary diminished scale]].

==Note names==
In many musical circumstances, a specific note of the scale is chosen as the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]—the central and most stable note of the scale. In Western tonal music, simple songs or pieces typically start and end on the tonic note. Relative to a choice of a certain tonic, the notes of a scale are often labeled with numbers recording how many scale steps above the tonic they are. For example, the notes of the C [[major scale]] (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) can be labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, reflecting the choice of C as tonic. The expression [[scale degree]] refers to these numerical labels. Such labeling requires the choice of a "first" note; hence scale-degree labels are not intrinsic to the scale itself, but rather to its modes. For example, if we choose A as tonic, then we can label the notes of the C major scale using A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and so on. When we do so, we create a new scale called the A [[minor scale]]. See the [[musical note]] article for how the notes are customarily named in different countries.

The scale degrees of a heptatonic (7-note) scale can also be named using the terms [[tonic (music)|tonic]], [[supertonic]], [[mediant]], [[subdominant]], [[Dominant (music)|dominant]], [[submediant]], [[subtonic]]. If the subtonic is a semitone away from the tonic, then it is usually called the [[leading-tone]] (or leading-note); otherwise the leading-tone refers to the raised subtonic. Also commonly used is the (movable do) [[Solfège#Movable do solfège|solfège]] naming convention in which each scale degree is denoted by a syllable. In the major scale, the solfège syllables are: do, re, mi, fa, so (or sol), la, ti (or si), do (or ut).

In naming the notes of a scale, it is customary that each scale degree be assigned its own letter name: for example, the A major scale is written A–B–C{{music|sharp}}–D–E–F{{music|sharp}}–G{{music|sharp}} rather than A–B–D{{music|flat}}–D–E–E{{music|doublesharp}}–G{{music|sharp}}. However, it is impossible to do this in scales that contain more than seven notes, at least in the English-language nomenclature system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;!--Who says it is not possible to name notes with letters of the alphabet following G? German nomenclature, at least, uses eight letters, A through H.--&gt;

Scales may also be identified by using a binary system of twelve zeros or ones to represent each of the twelve notes of a [[chromatic scale]]. It is assumed that the scale is tuned using [[12-tone equal temperament]] (so that, for instance, C{{Music|sharp}} is the same as D{{Music|flat}}), and that the tonic is in the leftmost position. For example, the [[binary number]] 101011010101, equivalent to the [[decimal number]] 2773, would represent any major scale (such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B). This system includes scales from 100000000000 (2048) to 111111111111 (4095), providing a total of 2048 possible [[Combinatorial species|species]], but only 351 unique scales containing from 1 to 12 notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A more mathematically flexible schema for binary representation, espoused by theorist Ian Ring in his study of musical scales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ring |first=Ian |title=A Study of Scales |url=http://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |publisher=Ian Ring |access-date=18 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106060403/https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |archivedate=6 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; has bits representing ascending tones, with the smaller bits representing lower pitches and higher bits representing higher pitches. This causes the bits to appear reversed compared with Duncan's system. Under this schema, a major scale is 101010110101 = (2741), a single root tone is 1, and a chromatic scale is still 111111111111 (4095). All the tone possibilities that begin with a root tone, and are thus scale-like, are odd-numbered.

Scales may also be shown as [[semitones]] from the tonic. For instance, 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 denotes any major scale such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which the first degree is, obviously, 0 semitones from the tonic (and therefore coincides with it), the second is 2 semitones from the tonic, the third is 4 semitones from the tonic, and so on. Again, this implies that the notes are drawn from a chromatic scale tuned with 12-tone equal temperament. For some fretted string instruments, such as the guitar and the [[bass guitar]], scales can be notated in [[tabulature]], an approach which indicates the fret number and string upon which each scale degree is played.

==Transposition and modulation==
{{confusing section|reason=transposition and modulation are different; first sentence introduces yet another term 'transform'; explanation then confuses all these|date=August 2018}}
Composers transform musical patterns by moving every note in the pattern by a constant number of scale steps: thus, in the [[C major]] scale, the pattern C–D–E might be shifted up, or [[transposition (music)|transposed]], a single scale step to become D–E–F. This process is called "scalar transposition" or "shifting to a new key" and can often be found in [[sequence (music)|musical sequences]] and patterns. (It is D-E-F# in Chromatic transposition). Since the steps of a scale can have various sizes, this process introduces subtle melodic and harmonic variation into the music. In Western tonal music, the simplest and most common type of modulation (or changing keys) is to shift from one major key to another key built on the first key's fifth (or dominant) scale degree. In the key of C major, this would involve moving to the key of G major (which uses an F#). Composers also often modulate to other related keys. In some [[Romantic music era]] pieces and contemporary music, composers modulate to "remote keys" that are not related to or close to the tonic. An example of a remote modulation would be taking a song that begins in C major and modulating (changing keys) to F# major.

==Jazz and blues==
{{See also|Jazz scales}}{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c' { 
  \clef treble \time 6/4
  c4 es f fis g bes c2
} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=A hexatonic [[blues scale]] on C, ascending}}Through the introduction of [[blue note]]s, jazz and [[blues]] employ scale intervals smaller than a semitone. The blue note is an [[interval (music)|interval]] that is technically neither [[major and minor|major nor minor]] but "in the middle", giving it a characteristic flavour. A regular [[piano]] cannot play blue notes, but with [[electric guitar]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]] and [[trumpet]], performers can "bend" notes a fraction of a tone sharp or flat to create blue notes For instance, in the key of E, the blue note would be either a note between G and G{{music|sharp}} or a note moving between both. 

In blues, a [[pentatonic scale]] is often used. In jazz, many different [[musical mode|modes]] and scales are used, often within the same piece of music. Chromatic scales are common, especially in modern jazz.

==Non-Western scales==
===Equally tempered===
In Western music, scale notes are often separated by [[Equal temperament]] tones or semitones, creating 12 intervals per octave each separating two tones where the higher tone has a oscillation frequency of a fixed ratio (by a factor equal to the twelfth root of two, or approximately 1.059463) higher than the frequency of the lower one. A scale uses a subset consisting typically of 7 of these 12 as scale steps. Other traditional tempered scale systems divide the octave to equal intervals by numbers other than 12. Examples are 53 in the [[Middle East]], and 72 in southern [[India]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Other===
Many other musical traditions use scales that include other intervals. These scales originate within the derivation of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. [[Interval (music)|Musical intervals]] are complementary values of the [[harmonic]] [[overtone]]s series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html Explanation of the origin of musical scales clarified by a string division method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824020439/http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html |date=24 August 2012 }} by [[Yuri Landman]] on furious.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many musical scales in the world are based on this system, except most of the musical scales from [[Indonesia]] and the [[Indochina]] Peninsulae, which are based on inharmonic resonance of the dominant metalophone and xylophone instruments.

===Intra-scale intervals===
Some scales use a different number of pitches. A common scale in Eastern music is the pentatonic scale, which consists of five notes that span an octave.

Some scales span part of an octave; Several such short scales are typically combined to form a scale spanning a full octave or more, and usually called with a third name of its own. The Middle Eastern music has around a dozen such basic short scales that are combined to form hundreds of full-octave spanning scales. Among these middle eastern scales [[Hejaz scale]] has one scale step spanning 14 intervals (of the middle eastern type found 53 in an octave) roughly similar to 3 semitones (of the western type found 12 in an octave), while [[Saba scale]], another of these middle eastern scales, has 3 consecutive scale steps within 14 commas, i.e. separated by roughly one western semitone either side of the middle tone.

[[Gamelan]] music uses a small variety of scales including [[Pélog]] and [[Sléndro]], none including equally tempered nor harmonic intervals. [[Indian classical music]] uses a moveable [[swara|seven-note scale]]. Indian [[Rāga]]s often use intervals smaller than a semitone.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Edwaard M. 1998. "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning.", p.247. In ''The Psychology of Music'', second edition, edited by Diana Deutsch, 215–64. New York: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-213564-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic music]] [[Arabic maqam|maqamat]] may use [[quarter tone]] intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Zonis [Mahler], Ella. 1973. ''Classical Persian Music: An Introduction''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2014}} In both rāgas and maqamat, the distance between a note and an inflection (e.g., [[Śruti (music)|śruti]]) of that same note may be less than a semitone.

'''Screen Producers Ireland''' is the national representative organisation of independent film, television and animation production companies and it exists primarily to advocate on behalf of its members. In 2012, then chief executive Barbara Galavan explained the role of the organisation as follows: ''SPI's role is to represent the views of our members to state, semi-state and industry bodies. We provide human resources and industrial relations supports producers; we negotiate collective agreements with the unions who work on behalf of film and television crews; and we also negotiate Terms of Trade agreements on behalf of our members, with the broadcasters, [[RTÉ]] and [[TG4]]. for instance.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date= 2012 |title= Production Values |magazine= Film Ireland |location= Dublin |publisher= Filmbase }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a continuity between SPI and earlier organisations of Irish film producers, dating from the 1978 formation, the ''Irish Association of Independent Producers''. In particular, the SPI was created in 2003 by the renaming of the ''Film Makers of Ireland'', in order to reflect the fact that many of FMI's members were focused on the television sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Dobson |first= Nichola |date= 2010 |title= The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons |location= Lanham, MD |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages= 325–7 |accessdate= 30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screen Producers Ireland organises a variety of events for its members, such as the 2008 training event in making pitches, which was a part of the ''Stranger than Fiction'' documentary festival that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Creely |first= Niamh | date= 2008 |title= Perfect Pitch |magazine= Film Ireland |location= Dublin |publisher= Filmbase }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know''''' was a musical comedy [[revue]] which opened [[off Broadway]] in 1997. It was based on Wendy Perrin's travel book. It depicted the woes of a group of travellers on their worldwide journeys, intercepted by short sketches based around amusing airport announcements, travel company phonelines and announcements by the 'pilot'.

The show's European premiere was in [[Cambridge, England]], at the Playroom at [[Cambridge Arts Theatre]], presented by the Cambridge University Musical Theatre Society.

==Original Off-Broadway production==
''Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know'' originally opened Off-Broadway at the [[Triad Theater]] on October 30, 1997. The original cast included James Darrah, Kathy Fitzgerald, [[Stan Freeman]], [[Jay Leonhart]], Liz McConahay and [[Michael McGrath (actor)|Michael McGrath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/shows/cast.php?showid=325070 |title=Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know - 1997 Off-Broadway - Original Off-Broadway Cast |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the show transferred from the Triad Theater to the Ibis Supper Club where it remained until the end of its run. In all it ran for 953 performances before its closing in February 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;title=Secrets%20Every%20Smart%20Traveler%20Should%20Know |title=Lortel Archives-The Internet Off-Broadway Database |publisher=Lortel.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Act one===
Flight Attendant (LIZ) announces the beginning of the show and instructs the audience to "fasten our seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night." The CAST sings "I've Got A Secret" introducing us to the perils of travel and some savvy tips to avoid the pitfalls.

A distraught Business Traveler (JAMES) appears to be naked except for undershorts, or a towel around his waist. In "Naked in Pittsburgh" he laments the state and whereabouts of his luggage.

Next we see a hip and happy Traveler (MICHAEL) on the phone with an automated reservationist (KATHY). The reservationist guides an increasingly frustrated Traveler through options and automated loops until finally the weary Traveler's time limit expires and he is disconnected.

In "Star Search", an excited passenger (LIZ) sings about the riveting talent in the cruise ship talent show.

Then JAY details the unusual items he's managed to pick up from his travels. In "Customs", he can't understand why officials are giving him such a hard time.

A Car-Renter (MICHAEL) laments his exorbitant car rental bill with a sexy Hertz Reservations Clerk (LIZ) in "Hertz".

A tourist (KATHY) in "Acapulco" sings about the stunning and handsome souvenirs she brought back from her vacation.

Then, in the high style of a Noël Coward play, Amanda (LIZ) and Elyot (JAMES), two ex-spouses, are horrified to find out that they share adjoining balconies with each other on their current honeymoons. As a faint piano plays strains of "Someday I'll Find You", Amanda and Elyot reminisce about the past and talk of their current loves.

Next, MICHAEL and KATHY are dressed to resemble the husband and wife in the Grant Wood painting, American Gothic. They sing about the joys and challenges of "Seeing America First."

JAMES tries to remember what he left behind in "What Did I Forget?"

In "Reservations: Part 2" our hip and anxious traveller (MICHAEL) tries another go with the automated reservationist (KATHY). He ends up holding for the next available operator.

A French Chanteuse (LIZ) sings about her lover and his little idiosyncrasies in "The French Song" while (KATHY) translates.

An elegant Gambler (MICHAEL), a loud housewife (KATHY), a kid with a lollipop (LIZ), and an old man with a cane(JAMES) sing about their favorite part of cruise-ship life in "Buffet".

===Act two===
The CAST encourages the audience to see the wonders of the world before it all comes crumbling down in "See It Now."

Then we see MICHAEL asleep near the phone as [[Elevator music|Canned Music]] plays in the background. The automated receptionist asks him to continue to hold and asserts that his call is important.

A sad and forlorn country and western girl (LIZ) sings an ode to "Mr. Trailways" and tells of her illicit love gone wrong in "Please Mr. Trailways."

Carmen Miranda (KATHY) and two jungle-outfitted men sing about their tropical island and its pressing problem in "Red Hot Lava".

STAN sings about the love he feels for his special island, [[Uzbekistan]] in "Paradise Found".

A tourist (LIZ) has a run-in with a fierce-looking Border Guard on her first vacation in years.

In "Me and Margarita" JAY laments the unhappy situation of bringing back more than he gastronomically bargained for on his nine-day eating and drinking spree in Mexico.

After a brief message from the captain of an Air India flight, a member of the CAST sets a [[candelabra]] on the piano. The rest of the CAST follow her and gather around the piano to sing "Salzburg"; a bright number extoling the virtues and vices of Mozart and his festival in [[Salzburg]].

MICHAEL awakes as Sharon (KATHY), a real, live operator finally answers the phone. Sharon (KATHY) flirts with MICHAEL as she suggestively takes his details for his flight to [[Nome, Alaska]]. She has almost completed the reservation when she begins to repeat herself over and over and MICHAEL is unsure of whether she was a real person or not.

JAMES sings about the joys of flying in "Aging Planes".

A shy and unassuming man with a [[lisp]] (MICHAEL) sings about his perfect match; a woman he met on his vacation to Spain in "She Spoke Spanish".

LIZ gives us another travel secret. This one is about finding the best travel agent. Then three savvy, high-powered travel agents (JAMES, MICHAEL, and KATHY) all compete for the best deals for their customers in "Honey, Sweetie, Baby".

The CAST reminds us of the importance to "See it Now" (Reprise) before the wonders of the world disappear.

As the CAST finishes their bows they sing about their favorite place toward which to travel, "Home".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000196 "''Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know''"], MTI, accessed August 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Takarazuka Revue'''|宝塚歌劇団|Takarazuka Kagekidan}} is a [[Japan]]ese all-female musical theater troupe based in [[Takarazuka, Hyōgo|Takarazuka]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Women play all roles in lavish, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style productions of Western-style musicals, and sometimes stories adapted from [[shōjo]] manga and Japanese folktales. The company is a division of the [[Hankyu Railway]] company; all members of the troupe are employed by the company.

==History==
[[File:Donburako-Takarazuka1914.jpg|thumb|The first performance ''Donburako'', 1914]]

The Takarazuka Revue was founded by [[Ichizo Kobayashi]], an industrialist-turned-politician and president of [[Hankyu Railways]], in [[Takarazuka, Hyogo|Takarazuka]], [[Japan]] in 1913. The city was the terminus of a Hankyu line from Osaka and already a popular tourist destination because of its hot springs. Kobayashi believed that it was the ideal spot to open an attraction of some kind that would boost train ticket sales and draw more business to Takarazuka. Since Western song and dance shows were becoming more popular and Kobayashi considered the [[Kabuki]] theater to be old and elitist,&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi Ichizo. "Takarazuka Manpitsu (1955)". Tokyo, Daiyamondsha. 1961. Kobayashi Ichizo 2: 445-46.&lt;/ref&gt; he decided that an all-female theater group might be well received by the general public.

The Revue had its first performance in 1914. Ten years later, the company had become popular enough to obtain its own theater in Takarazuka, called the ''Dai Gekijō'' meaning "[[Takarazuka Grand Theater|Grand Theater]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kawatake, Toshio. "A History of Japanese Theater II: Bunraku and Kabuki". Kokusai Bunka Shinkokai. Tokyo. 1971. pp.15-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the company owns and operates another theater, the Takarazuka Theater, in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;Takahara, Kanako, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090623i1.html Fans make troupe phenomenon it is]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', June 23, 2009, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Takarazuka performs for 2.5 million people each year{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} and the majority of its fans are women.

Part of the novelty of Takarazuka is that all the parts are played by women, based on the original model of [[Kabuki]] before 1629 when women were banned from the theater in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Leupp, Gary P. ''Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan.'' University of California Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-520-20900-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The women who play male parts are referred to as ''otokoyaku'' ({{nihongo|男役}}, literally "male role") and those who play female parts are called ''musumeyaku'' ({{nihongo|娘役}}, literally "daughter's role"). The costumes, set designs and lighting are lavish, the performances [[melodrama]]tic. Side pathways extend the already wide proscenium, accommodating elaborate processions and choreography.

Regardless of the era of the musical presented, period accuracy is relaxed for costumes during extravagant finales which include scores of glittering performers parading down an enormous stage-wide staircase and a [[The Rockettes|Rockette]]-style kick line. Lead performers portraying both male and female roles appear in the finale wearing huge circular feathered back-pieces reminiscent of Las Vegas or Paris costuming.

Before becoming a member of the troupe, a young woman must train for two years in the Takarazuka Music School, one of the most competitive of its kind in the world. Each year, thousands from all over Japan audition. The 40 to 50 who are accepted  are trained in music, dance, and acting, and are given seven-year contracts. The school is famous for its strict discipline and its custom of having first-year students clean the premises each morning.

The first year, all women train together before being divided by the faculty and the current troupe members into ''otokoyaku'' and  ''musumeyaku'' at the end of the year. Those playing ''otokoyaku'' cut their hair short, take on a more masculine role in the classroom, and speak in the masculine form.

The company has five main troupes: {{Nihongo|Flower|花|hana}}, {{Nihongo|Moon|月|tsuki}}, {{Nihongo|Snow|雪|yuki}}, {{Nihongo|Star|星|hoshi}}, and {{Nihongo|Cosmos|宙|sora}}; as well as superior members, a collection for senior actresses no longer part of a regular troupe who still wish to maintain their association with the revue and perform from time to time. Flower and Moon are the original troupes, founded in 1921. Snow Troupe began in 1924. Star Troupe was founded in 1931, disbanded in 1939, and reestablished in 1948. Cosmos, founded in 1998, is the newest troupe.

==Actors==
[[File:Akino, Katayama and Miyajim.jpg|right|thumb|A musumeyaku is flanked by two otokoyaku, circa 1935.]]
While on the surface it would appear that the Takarazuka Revue was intended to grant Japanese women freedom from social oppression, ironically, it began as quite the opposite. According to Takarazuka scholar Lorie Brau, "The production office and corporate structure that control Takarazuka are overwhelmingly patriarchal."&lt;ref name=TDR&gt;Lorie Brau. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1146045 "The Women’s Theatre of Takarazuka.]" TDR 34.4 :79-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Takarazuka embodies Shiraishi’s idea that the actresses become "[[good wives and wise mothers]]" upon leaving the company, it also simultaneously represents progressive feminist points of view. Some believe that its appeal to the female audience is on account of the perceived link to freedom from traditional Japanese society’s imposed ideas of gender and sexuality. So while Takarazuka "reinforces the status quo and sublimates women's desires through its dreamy narratives, there remains some possibility that certain spectators find it empowering simply to watch women play men."&lt;ref name=TDR/&gt;

Some Takarasienne shows, such as ''[[The Rose of Versailles musicals|The Rose of Versailles]]'' and ''[[Elisabeth (musical)|Elisabeth]]'', feature androgynous characters. The ''otokoyaku'' represents the woman’s idealized man without the roughness or need to dominate, the "perfect" man who can not be found in the real world. It is these male roles that offer an escape from the strict, gender-bound real roles lauded in Japanese society.&lt;ref name=TDR/&gt; In a sense, the otokoyaku provides the female audience with a "dream" of what they desire in reality.

In addition to their claim to "sell dreams", the actresses of the Takarazuka Revue take on another role, empowering themselves as women in a male-dominated culture. Kobayashi's desire to make his actresses into good wives and mothers has often been hindered by their own will to pursue careers in the entertainment business. It is becoming increasingly more common for women to stay in the company well into their thirties, beyond the conventional limits of marriageable age. The actresses’ role within the Takarazuka Revue thus overlaps into the culture surrounding it, adding to their appeal to the female-dominant audience. "In fact, it is the carrying over of this 'boyishness' into everyday life and the freedom that this implies that captures the attention of some fans."&lt;ref name=TDR/&gt;
The ''otokoyaku'', however, is not bound to her assigned male role in the theater. Tsurugi Miyuki, top ''otokoyaku'' star of the Moon Troupe, said that she conceived male impersonation as just a "role" that she wore like the makeup and costume that helped create her ''otokoyaku'' image. She said she reverts to her nonperforming "feminine" self after performance.&lt;ref name=TDR/&gt; Other ''otokoyaku'' feel uncomfortable switching to female roles. ''Otokoyaku'' Matsu Akira, who retired in 1982, stated: "Even though I am a female, the thing called 'female' just won't emerge at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robertson, Jennifer|title=Gender-Bending in Paradise: Doing 'Female' and 'Male' in Japan.|year=1989|volume=5|pages=50–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although traditionally an all-female troupe, in 1946 the Takarazuka employed male performers who were trained separately from the female members of the troupes. Ultimately, however, the female members opposed these new male counterparts, and the department was dissolved, the last male department terminating in 1954. A recent{{when|date=October 2018}} Japanese musical, ''Takarazuka Boys'', was based on this chapter of the company's history.

While the casts are all-female, the staff (writers, directors, choreographers, designers, etc.) and orchestra musicians may be male or female. It is not uncommon in Takarazuka for a predominantly male orchestra to be led by a female conductor.

==Troupes==
The five troupes of the Takarazuka Revue have certain differences of style and material which make each unique.

===Flower Troupe (Hana)===
The Flower Troupe is considered the "treasure chest" of ''otokoyaku''. Many of the most popular former and current top stars of the company originated in Flower Troupe; these include [[Miki Maya]] (who held the first Budokan solo concert in Takarazuka's history), [[Sumire Haruno]] and [[Tomu Ranju]] of Flower, [[Jun Shibuki]], [[Jun Sena]] and [[Kiriya Hiromu]] of Moon, and [[Hikaru Asami]] of Snow. Their performances tend to have larger budgets, with lavish stage and costume designs, and are often derived from operatic material.

===Moon Troupe (Tsuki)===
While tending to be a home for young performers (with [[Yūki Amami]] in her sixth year reaching the status of top star in the 1990s), the members of Moon Troupe are also strong singers. The term "Musical Research Department" is occasionally used in articles about the troupe, underscoring the troupe's focus on music. Their material tends toward drama, Western musicals, and modern settings, such as ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' and ''[[Me and My Girl]]''. During the era of [[Makoto Tsubasa]] as top star, they had at least two musicals adopted from classic western novels.

===Snow Troupe (Yuki)===
Snow Troupe is considered the upholder of traditional dance and opera for the whole company, being the vanguard of traditional Japanese drama in a company that tends towards Western material. They were the first troupe to perform ''[[Elisabeth (musical)|Elisabeth]]'' in Japan. The troupe has been moving towards the opera and drama style of Moon and Flower.

===Star Troupe (Hoshi)===
Star Troupe tends to be the home of Takarazuka's [[star]]s. They, along with Flower Troupe, have very strong ''otokoyaku'' players. In recent years, many of the company's prominent ''musumeyaku'' have also originated from Star Troupe, such as Hana Hizuki, Shizuku Hazakura, and Yuki Aono.

===Cosmos Troupe (Sora)===
Cosmos, the newest troupe, is less traditional and more experimental. When it was first formed, it culled talent from the other troupes. The Cosmos style is influenced by performers like [[Asato Shizuki]], the founding ''otokoyaku'' top star; [[Yōka Wao]] and [[Mari Hanafusa]], the "Golden Combi" who headed the troupe for six of its first eight years. Cosmos were the first troupe to perform ''[[Phantom (musical)|Phantom]]'' and to have a Broadway composer ([[Frank Wildhorn]]) write their musical score. Most of the ''otokoyaku'' in this troop are above 170&amp;nbsp;cm (the most notable is [[Hiro Yuumi]], the tallest in the company since she joined in 1997 until her retirement in 2013). While it had a troupe-born actress become ''musumeyaku'' top back in 2006 with [[Asuka Toono]], it wasn't until 2014 that an actress originating from this troupe became an ''otokoyaku'' top star: [[Seina Sagiri]], the former top star of Yukigumi(2014-2017).

===Adaptations of Japanese works===
[[File:4 Fantasia Takarazuka 1951-3.jpg|thumb|''Four Fantasia'' 1951]]

Stories based in Japan and modeled on historical accounts or traditional tales, are often referred to as {{Nihongo|''nihonmono''|日本物}} or, less frequently, {{Nihongo|''wamono''|和物}}. Among the most common of these adapted to the Takarazuka stage is {{Nihongo|''[[The Tale of Genji]]''|源氏物語|Genji Monogatari}}.

Popular [[manga]] series have often shaped Takarazuka, such as in the case of [[Riyoko Ikeda]]'s ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]''. Other manga adaptations include [[Orpheus no Mado|''The Window of Orpheus'']], also by Ikeda, [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s [[Black Jack (manga)|''Black Jack'']] and ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]'', and [[Yasuko Aoike]]'s ''El Halcón''.

Recent examples of works adapted from Japanese novels or short stories include Moon Troupe's {{Nihongo|''Osaka Samurai''|大阪侍|Oosakazamurai}}, based upon the short story by [[Ryōtarō Shiba]], and Flower Troupe's {{Nihongo|''Black Lizard''|黒蜥蜴|Kurotokage}}, based upon the [[Kogoro Akechi]] story by [[Edogawa Rampo]].

In 2009, Takarazuka Revue performed two shows based on an adaptation of [[Capcom]]'s videogame series ''[[Phoenix Wright]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/gyakutensaiban/takarazuka_index.html|title=株式会社カプコン：ゲーム：逆転裁判シリーズ：タイトルラインナップ|work=capcom.co.jp|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They took the stage in January 2013 to represent the courtroom game again with the production titled "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth: Ace Attorney 3".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e120731.html|title=CAPCOM - Takarazuka Revue Will Present Third Show in the "Ace Attorney" Series|work=capcom.co.jp|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the Revue would debut at Tokyo's [[TOKYU THEATRE Orb]] an adaptation of another Capcom videogame, ''[[Sengoku Basara]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e121102.html|title=CAPCOM - Capcom and Takarazuka Revue Will Present the First Musical Based on the "Sengoku BASARA" Series - First production by the Takarazuka Flower Troupe based on a game is expected to further raise the value of Capcom content -|work=capcom.co.jp|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; done by the Flower Troupe. This focused on character [[Yukimura Sanada]], played by [[Tomu Ranju]], the same actress who had taken the role of Phoenix Wright prior to becoming a top star.

===Adaptations of other Asian works===
[[File:Gubijin Feast at Hong Gate Takarazuka 1951-8.jpg|thumb|''Gubijin'' ([[Xiang Yu]] and [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]]) 1951]]

Among works adapted from other Asian sources is the Beijing opera ''[[Farewell My Concubine (play)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', detailing the romance between General [[Xiang Yu]] and his lover Madam Yu.

===Original stories and historical adaptations===
Musicals have also been performed throughout the years based upon people and events in American, European, and Asian history. Among the more recognizable of these biographical adaptations are ''Last Party: S. Fitzgerald's Last Day'', about [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], ''Valentino'', about [[Rudolph Valentino]], ''Dean'', about [[James Dean]], and ''Saint-Exupéry -The Pilot Who Became "The Little Prince"-'', about [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]].

Finally, original stories round out Takarazuka fare, including musicals such as ''Boxman'' by Cosmos Troupe, ''Too Short a Time to Fall in Love'' performed by Star and Moon Troupes, and ''Silver Wolf'' by Moon and Snow Troupes.

===Collaborations===
Takarazuka has occasionally worked with notable writers, composers, and choreographers to create original content for the revue. In 1993, [[Tommy Tune]] wrote, directed and choreographed the revue ''Broadway Boys'' to accompany Moon Troupe's rendition of ''[[Grand Hotel (musical)|Grand Hotel]]''. In 2006, Takarazuka worked with [[Frank Wildhorn]], musical writer and composer of ''[[Jekyll &amp; Hyde (musical)|Jekyll &amp; Hyde]]'' and ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel (musical)|The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', to create  ''[[Never Say Goodbye (musical)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' for Cosmos Troupe.

===Seniority===
The terms [[senpai|upperclassmen]] (上級生) and lowerclassmen (下級生) (the Japanese terms are gender-neutral) are used to distinguish senior and junior members of Takarazuka. Lowerclassmen are the actresses who have been performers in Takarazuka for less than seven years. They are employees of the company, and usually work as background dancers and in ''shinjin kōen'' (performances exclusively for underclassmen). After the seventh year they become upperclassmen, and negotiate contracts with the company instead of being employed by it.

==Audience==
Women make up the primary audience of Takarazuka; in fact, some estimates say the audience is 90 percent female.&lt;ref name=TDR/&gt; There exist two primary theories as to what draws these women to Takarazuka. These theories, put forward by Western scholars, complement each other, drawing on the traditional homoerotic elements of Japanese performing arts, and the ancient subversive nature of the feminine in Japan. One is that the women are drawn to its inherent lesbian overtones. One author states, "It was not masculine sexuality which attracted the Japanese girl audience but it was feminine eroticism".&lt;ref name="Flower Tales"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dollase|first=Hiromi|title=Early Twentieth Century Japanese Girls' Magazine Stories: Examining Shōjo Voice in ''Hanamonogatari'' (Flower Tales)|journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]|year=2003|volume=36|issue=4|pages=724–755|oclc=1754751|doi=10.1111/1540-5931.00043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that the girls are not drawn to the implicit sexuality of Takarazuka, but instead are fascinated by the ''otokoyaku'' (the women who play male roles) "getting away with a male performance of power and freedom".&lt;ref name="Abbitt"/&gt;

Favoring the first theory, American Jennifer Robertson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/jennifer.robertson/jennifer_robertson|title=Jennifer Robertson: Jennifer Robertson|work=umich.edu|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that lesbian themes occur in every Takarazuka performance, simply by virtue of the fact that women play every role. The audience clearly picks up on it and responds. Within the first ten years of Takarazuka's founding, the audience was vocally responding to the apparent lesbianism. Female fans wrote love letters to the ''otokoyaku''. In 1921 these letters were published and several years later newspapers and the public rallied a cry against Takarazuka, claiming it was quickly becoming a "symbol of abnormal love". In order to combat this, the producers kept its actresses in strict living conditions; they were no longer allowed to associate with their fans.&lt;ref name="Robertson, Jennifer 1998"/&gt; Robertson mentions a phenomenon of "S" or "[[Class S (genre)|Class S]]" love, a particular style of love wherein women who have been influenced by Takarazuka return to their daily lives feeling free to develop crushes on their female classmates or coworkers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} This type of romance is typically fleeting and is seen in Japanese society as more of a phase in growing up rather than "true" homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Flower Tales"/&gt; Robertson sums up her theory thus: "Many [women] are attracted to the Takarazuka ''otokoyaku'' because she represents an exemplary female who can negotiate successfully both genders and their attendant roles and domains."&lt;ref name="Robertson, Jennifer 1998"&gt;Robertson, Jennifer. "Takarazuka: Sexual Politics and Popular Culture in Modern Japan." Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other theory, supported by Canadian [[Erica Abbitt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athena.uwindsor.ca/units/drama/drama_main_web/DramaticArt.nsf/main/17C9BB356468D8D385256FEE006232C5?OpenDocument|title=Prof. Erica Abbitt's webpage at the University of Windsor, Canada|work=uwindsor.ca|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the female audience of Takarazuka is drawn not exclusively by lesbian overtones, but rather by the subversion of stereotypical gender roles. Japan is a society notorious for its rigid conception of gender roles. While the original goal of the show may have been to create the ideal [[Women in Japan|good wife and wise mother]],  off stage, on-stage gender roles are, by necessity, subverted. The ''otokoyaku'' must act the way men are supposed to act. Abbitt insists that a large portion of the appeal of Takarazuka comes from something she calls "slippage", referring to the enjoyment derived from a character portraying something they are not, in this case a woman portraying a man. While not denying the presence of lesbian overtones within Takarazuka, Abbitt proposes the cause for the largely female audience has more to do with this subversion of societal norms than sexual ones.&lt;ref name="Abbitt"&gt;Abbitt, Erica Stevens.

===Fan clubs===
[[File:Fans of Takarazuka.JPG|thumb|[[Fan club]] members]]

Some fans demonstrate their loyalty to a particular performer by joining her [[fan club]]. Club members can be identified by their wearing scarves of a particular color or even jackets colorfully embroidered with the star's name. Following performances at the Takarazuka Grand Theatre or Tokyo Takarazuka Theatre, as many as several hundred fans congregate in their various club groups  and stand in orderly ranks on either side of the street in front of the theatre. The clubs are arranged by actress seniority within the troupe. Theatre officials set up barricades and oversee the assembly.

Whenever an actress exits the theatre, the frontmost group will sit and all the others follow suit (much like the "[[Audience wave|wave]]" seen in athletic arenas) with subsequent intervals of standing and sitting. The fans wait patiently, with little conversation, for their favorites to exit the theatre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2006/06/11/2003313013|title=The feminine `kabuki' alternative|work=taipeitimes.com|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  their decorum contrasting markedly to the noisy, competitive and often pushy autograph-seekers who wait outside stage doors in the West. An almost eerie ritualistic calm prevails. As the stars come out of the building one by one, some alone but most accompanied by staff members of their club, orderly quiet continues to prevail. The glamorous performers, now mostly in slacks or jeans with high heels and wearing oversize visored "newsboy" caps to hide their hair (and some with sunglasses even at night), move along to their own particular fan clubs.  Rather than requesting autographs, the fans proffer cards, which are gathered efficiently by each star, who may say a few words but then waves and moves on. Once the last stars have emerged and departed, the clubs disband quietly.

==Influence==
Takarazuka has had a profound influence on the history of [[anime]] and [[manga]], especially [[shōjo manga]].&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; [[Osamu Tezuka]], a highly influential manga creator, grew up in the town of Takarazuka. His mother knew many of the Takarazuka actresses, and as a child he knew them and watched many of their performances.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravett p.77"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gravett, Paul|authorlink=Paul Gravett|year=2004|title=[[Manga: 60 Years of Japanese Comics]]|publisher=Harper Design|isbn=1-85669-391-0|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their stories of noble princes played by female actresses,&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randall|first=Bill|date=May 15, 2003|title = Three By Moto Hagio|journal=The Comics Journal|issue=252|url= http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=283&amp;Itemid=48|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka created ''[[Princess Knight]]''&lt;ref name="Beautiful, Borrowed, and Bent"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welker |first=James |year=2006 |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=31 |issue=3|title=Beautiful, Borrowed, and Bent: "Boys' Love" as Girls' Love in Shōjo Manga|doi=10.1086/498987|page=841}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first manga aimed at a female audience, which tells the story of Princess Sapphire, a girl born with both a male and female heart who struggles between the desire to fight as a noble prince and to be a tender, gentle princess.  The great success of ''Princess Knight'' and other Tezuka stories began the tradition of manga written for a female audience, especially the very influential ''[[Rose of Versailles]]'' and ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' series, both of which borrow directly from ''Princess Knight'' by including specific Tezuka images, character designs and names. ''Rose of Versailles'' is one of Takarazuka's best-known musicals. Women in masculine roles continue to be a central theme in shōjo manga and anime as well as some shōnen, and Tezuka himself explored the theme in many of his later works, including ''[[Dororo]]'', ''Phoenix'' and ''Black Jack''.

While the influence of [[Osamu Tezuka]] and Takarazuka on anime and manga is general, there are still many series which show more specific influences.  The Takarazuka Revue inspired the plot of the original ''[[Sakura Wars]]'' video game, along with additional inspiration from Takarazuka's one-time competitor the [[Shochiku Kagekidan]] (Shochiku Revue).&lt;ref name="STinspiration"&gt;[http://www.mbs.jp/sakura/Report1.html Interview with Ouji Hiroi], partially translated at the [http://community.livejournal.com/takarazuka/16166.html Takarazuka Revue Community LiveJournal page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205095655/http://community.livejournal.com/takarazuka/16166.html |date=2008-02-05 }}. With regards to ''Sakura Wars'', not only did the Kagekidan inspire the plot for the series, it also strongly influenced the organization of the characters, namely the Hanagumi. Retrieved on 19 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zuka Club in ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]'' is based on the Takarazuka Revue. The characters [[Sailor Uranus|Haruka Tenoh]] and [[Michiru Kaioh]] of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' were loosely based on the actors of the Takarazuka Revue.&lt;ref name = "Sailor Moon"&gt;{{Cite book

''The Virgin's Mask'' by [[Jūrō Kara]], a significant work of post-war theater, features an aging "''Zuka''-girl" attempting to reclaim her youth through ritualistic bathing in a tub of virgins' tears.

===Takarazuka and homosexuality in Japanese society===
{{See also|Homosexuality in Japan}}

After the scandal of women writing [[love letter]]s to the ''otokoyaku'' and the revelation of an actual lesbian relationship between a ''otokoyaku'' and a ''musumeyaku'',{{When|date=February 2018}} the revue greatly limited itself in order to do away with the lesbian image. Women wore [[Military uniform|militaristic uniform]]s, heightening the attraction even more among some audience goers. There was another scandal in 1932 when, for the first time, one of the ''otokoyaku'' cut her hair short (previously all of the actresses had their hair long and the ''otokoyaku'' simply hid their hair under hats).&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 1998, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1940, the actresses were even forbidden to answer [[fan mail]] and socialize with their admirers.&lt;ref name="Robertson, Jennifer 1998"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} In the years since then, the regulations have relaxed but not by much.

==Legacy==
A 1996 black-and-white photograph of a Takarasienne, taken by [[Daido Moriyama]], appeared on the October 1999 cover of ''[[Art in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cover entitle "Osaka," Art in America, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tickled''''' is a 2016 New Zealand [[documentary]] about "competitive endurance [[tickling]]" and videos featuring it, and the practices of those producing the videos, directed by [[David Farrier]] and Dylan Reeve. The film explores possible legal and ethical issues with certain individuals making the videos, and has itself been the subject of legal challenges. A follow-up special, ''The Tickle King'', aired on [[HBO]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tickled|title=The Tickle King|date=2017-06-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K88xF9mOUjc|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/tickled-documentary-draws-controversy-1.13185248|title=Controversy surrounds ‘Tickled’ documentary|author=|date=|website=newsday.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
David Farrier, a New Zealand television reporter whose beat focuses on "quirky and odd stories",&lt;ref name="KS"/&gt; sees videos online about an activity described as "competitive endurance tickling", in which young athletic men are restrained and tickled by each other; he begins to research it for a story. He requests for an interview with the videos' producer Jane O'Brien Media, but the company refused to "associate with a homosexual journalist"&lt;ref name="hollywood reporter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/is-tickled-next-catfish-892892|title=Is 'Tickled' Poised to Be the Next 'Catfish'?|author=|date=|website=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Farrier is actually bisexual&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11459066|title=Why David Farrier gave up med school for journalism|last=Perrott|first=Alan|date=2015-06-06|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Since Farrier considers the act of tickling other men "pretty gay," he is confused and offended by the hostile response, but intrigued.&lt;ref name="hollywood reporter" /&gt; Farrier partners with television producer Dylan Reeve to learn more about tickling videos and the people who produce them.

After blogging about the incident, they receive legal threats from Jane O'Brien Media, who send Kevin Clarke and two other representatives to New Zealand. Although their interactions are superficially cordial, the Jane O'Brien Media people seem intent on bullying the investigators into dropping the project. Farrier and Reeve respond by traveling to Los Angeles, and find the representatives at a site where the company records videos, but are turned away at the door.

Researching the phenomenon further, they uncover information about a person known as Terri DiSisto (alias "Terri Tickle"), who pioneered recruiting and distributing tickling videos online in the 1990s. They interview independent tickling-video producer Richard Ivey whose operations are a low-key affair with an acknowledged homoerotic aspect. They speak to a few former participants in Jane O'Brien Media's videos who describe coercive and manipulative treatment by the producers, such as defamation campaigns against them, exposing their personal information and contacting school or work associates to discredit them as homosexual or as sexual deviants, in retaliation for challenging or speaking out against the company. A local recruiter in [[Muskegon, Michigan]], describes "audition" videos he had helped make, which were published by O'Brien Media without the participants' consent.

Farrier and Reeve chance upon documents on a defunct tickling-video web site, which link Jane O'Brien Media to [[David D'Amato]], the former school administrator behind the "Terri Tickle" alias. They learn that D'Amato had served a six-month prison sentence for disabling computer systems at two different universities on multiple dates, in retaliation against an 18-year-old male student who attempted to terminate their online relationship, begun when the young man was 17.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McWilliams (2004).

Before returning to New Zealand, Farrier contacts D'Amato's stepmother for comment; she implicitly confirms her stepson's "tickling" past, and Farrier informs her that he believes D'Amato is still involved in it.

Under the working title ''Tickle King: The Hunt for the Truth in Competitive Tickling'', Farrier and Reeve raised [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]29,570 on [[Kickstarter]] in June 2014, intended primarily to cover the costs of the crew traveling to the United States for a week.&lt;ref name="KS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dylanreeve/tickle-king-the-hunt-for-the-truth-in-competitive|title=Project page on kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also received funding from the [[New Zealand Film Commission]].&lt;ref name="indiewire0131" /&gt;

The soundtrack includes music from ''[[Upstream Color]]'' by [[Shane Carruth]].

The film was screened at the January 2016 [[Sundance Film Festival]], after which [[Magnolia Pictures]] picked up distribution and HBO picked up US TV rights.&lt;ref name="indiewire0131"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/01/magnolia-pictures-and-hbo-pick-up-sundance-doc-tickled-28418/|title=Magnolia Pictures and HBO Pick Up Sundance Doc ‘Tickled’|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=31 January 2016|work=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 it was presented as part of the [[True/False Film Festival]].

==Reception==
''Tickled'' has received critical acclaim. In a review headlined "fetish documentary goes from giggly to grim", Nigel Smith of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gives the movie four (of five) stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/08/tickled-documentary-review-david-farrier-cyberbullying|title=Tickled review: fetish documentary goes from giggly to grim|last=Smith|first=Nigel|date=8 Mar 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' states the onscreen presence of the filmmakers "is justified because the harassment they experience in pursuing the story becomes a big part of its narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/markets-festivals/tickled-review-1201685765/|title=‘Tickled’ Review: An Engrossing Investigative Doc|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|date=24 Jan 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', giving it 4.5 stars, said it was "an act of journalistic courage" and that they "reveal the harm that can be done by an individual with a lot of money and a vindictive streak".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/blogs/3480007-155/sundance-16-review-tickled|title=Sundance '16 review: 'Tickled'|date=30 January 2016|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', giving it a Critic's Pick, said "Farrier and Mr. Reeve see the humor, but they also see the pathos—because it's all fun and giggles until someone gets hurt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/movies/tickled-review.html|title=Review: ‘Tickled’ Is Fun and Giggles Until It Isn’t Anymore|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|date=16 June 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/tickled-sundance-review-857740|title='Tickled': Sundance Review|author=|date=|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armond White]] of ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine was critical of the movie, commenting that it "zips past its sexual aspects", and concluding that it is ultimately "frustrating, a blue-balls documentary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.out.com/armond-white/2016/6/24/tickling-hbo-documentary-gay|title=Sports Documentary 'Tickled' Exploits Fetishism and Gay Teasing|last=White|first=Armond|date=24 June 2016|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 106 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tickled|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tickled/|language=en|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gives the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tickled|title=Tickled|author=|date=|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The shocking truth is uncomfortably pursued to its fullest, and the result is a riveting piece of investigative journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2017/03/weekend-stream-the-tickle-king-gorrilaz/|title=Weekend Stream: This Tickling Documentary and Its Even More Bizarre Follow-Up|author=|date=24 March 2017|website=[[New York Observer]]|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from the documentary's subjects==
In the movie, D'Amato is seen accusing Farrier of being in America illegally, by using a [[travel visa#Short-stay or visitor visas|tourist visa]] for journalism. Farrier, who routinely travels internationally on assignment, states he was on a [[travel visa#Long-stay visas|journalist visa]]. Farrier also shows documents from O'Brien Media, coaching international video participants to travel under a tourist visa when coming to the US for paid performances.

After the premiere screening at Sundance, in March 2016, D'Amato filed a federal lawsuit against the filmmakers for making false accusations, including the implication that D'Amato used extortion and abused minors, and stating that D'Amato has no relationship with O'Brien Media. In response, Farrier told ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' that "given the number of hollow legal threats we faced during the making of it, it's almost refreshing to see a real case being filed by real lawyers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/3635058-155/sundance-film-on-competitive-endurance-tickling?fullpage=1|title=Sundance film on 'competitive endurance tickling' is defamatory, suit alleges|last=Manson|first=Pamela|date=11 March 2016|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Kevin Clarke of O'Brien Media created a website to counter the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/05/tickled-campaign-launched-to-try-to-discredit-provocative-competitive-tickling-documentary-288905/|title=‘Tickled’: Campaign Launched To Try To Discredit Provocative Competitive Tickling Documentary|last=Winfrey|first=Graham|date=23 May 2016|work=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Amato attended the 18 June 2016 screening at the [[Nuart Theater]] in Los Angeles, and confronted Dylan Reeve, saying, "You need to lawyer up. You need to get criminal counsel." Clarke argued with Reeve during a public question-and-answer session after the film, saying "The film is a piece of garbage full of lies. Release the audio tapes that show you're lying. And if you don't release it, it's the same as admitting you're lying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/81212098/tickled-creator-dylan-reeve-confronted-by-subject-of-movie-at-premiere|title=Tickled creator Dylan Reeve confronted by the subject of his documentary at premiere|last=Fagan|first=Josh|date=18 June 2016|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

D'Amato filed a $40 million defamation and slander lawsuit in Nassau County court alleging that his stepmother Dorothy D'Amato made statements in the film with the intention to injure his business, causing mental distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegler|first1=Mara|title=Competitive tickling film sparks another defamation suit|url=http://pagesix.com/2016/06/15/competitive-tickling-film-sparks-another-defamation-suit/|accessdate=26 February 2017|work=Page Six|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Michael|title=He made a movie about competitive tickling.

D'Amato died at age 55, on 13 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/19-06-2017/life-after-the-tickle-kings-death/|title=Life after the Tickle King's death|date=2017-06-19|work=The Spinoff|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers posted a statement on their web site that they were "incredibly sad" to learn of it, and asking that his death be treated with respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tickledmovie.com/statement/|title=Tickled|work=Tickled|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7737">'''Worm charming''', '''worm grunting''', and '''worm fiddling''' are methods of attracting [[earthworm]]s from the ground.  The activity is usually performed to collect [[fishing lure|bait]] for [[fishing]] but can also take the form of a competitive [[sport]] in areas such as [[east Texas]].  As a skill and profession worm charming is now very rare, with the art being passed through generations to ensure that it survives.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;Sutton, Keith.  [[ESPN]].  20 March 2007.  "[http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing/columns/story?columnist=sutton_keith&amp;page=g_col_Sutton_fiddling_for_worms Fiddling For Worms]".

==Methods==
[[File:Florida worm charming example.webm|frame|right|Two people worm grunting to collect bait in the [[Apalachicola National Forest]]. The worms respond to vibrations created by rubbing the top of a wooden stake with a flat piece of metal]]
Most worm charming methods involve [[vibration|vibrating]] the [[soil]], which encourages the worms to the surface.  In 2008 researchers from Vanderbilt University claimed that the worms surface because the vibrations are similar to those produced by digging [[mole (animal)|moles]], which prey on earthworms.&lt;ref&gt;Catania KC (2008) [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003472 "Worm Grunting, Fiddling, and Charming—Humans Unknowingly Mimic a Predator to Harvest Bait."] PLoS ONE 3(10): e3472. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0003472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fountain, Henry. ''The New York Times.'' 17 October 2008. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/science/21wormgrunting.html "Worm Grunting: A Mystery Solved"]&lt;/ref&gt; The same technique is used by many species of bird, which devour the worms as they appear above ground.&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt;

The activity is known by several different names and the apparatus and techniques vary significantly.&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MotherEarth" /&gt;  "Worm grunting" generally refers to the use of a "stob", a wooden stake that is driven into the ground, and a "rooping iron" which is used to rub the stob.&lt;ref name="sptimes"&gt;Tobin, Thomas C.  ''St. Petersburg Times''.  14 April 2002.  "[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/04/14/State/Gruntin__and_gatherin.shtml Gruntin' and gathering]".  Accessed 7 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Worm fiddling" also uses a wooden stake but utilises a dulled [[saw]] which is dragged along its top.&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt;

Techniques vary from sprinkling the turf with water, tea and beer, to music or just "twanging" with a garden fork.&lt;ref name=Berrington&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960428/ai_n14451942 ''Sunday Mirror'', "The war of the worms" article by Lucy Berrington, April 28, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;  In some organized competitions, detergents and mechanical diggers have been banned.&lt;ref name=Berrington/&gt;

==Animal behavior==
Worm charming is a behavior also observed in the animal kingdom, especially among birds. The methods used vary; however, tapping earth with feet to generate vibrations is widespread. One common example is the "[[Seagull]] dance". The [[wood turtle]] also seems to be adapted for worm charming, as it is known to stamp its feet – a behavior that attracts worms to the surface and allows the turtle to prey on them.

==Soil conditions==
Worms are most commonly found in damp or wet conditions and tend to move away from dry soil.  The success of worm charming can often depend on these soil conditions, with charmers choosing damp locations or using water to attract the worms.&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MotherEarth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sptimes" /&gt;

==Worm charming as a profession==
Worms are sold as a live bait for fishermen, and many sellers use worm charming techniques to gather their stock.  In some locations professional worm grunters need to obtain a permit in order to ply their trade.&lt;ref name="sptimes" /&gt;

==Competitive worm charming==
In most competitions the fiddlers  with the collector (or collectors) of the most worms in a set time being declared as the winners.  They usually have a zone in which to perform their charming, measuring three yards square.

[[File:Willaston_-_Worm_Charming.jpg|thumb|Competitive worm charming at Willaston]]
One of the first worm charming events took place in a school [[fête]] at Willaston County Primary School in [[Willaston, Cheshire East|Willaston]], [[Cheshire]].  The  
World Worm Charming Championships started in 1980 and is now an annual event that celebrates the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wormcharming.com:80/index.html |archivedate=2016-09-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912170513/http://www.wormcharming.com/index.html |title=The World Worm Charming Championship |publisher=International Federation of Charming Worms and Allied Pastimes |accessdate=21 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organised by then-deputy headmaster John Bailey, who wrote the original rules for the competition.

The current world record was established on June 29, 2009, by 10-year-old Sophie Smith of Willaston, England, who raised 567 worms during Britain's World Worm Charming Championship.&lt;ref name="NewRecord"&gt;

Rules of The British and European Federation of Wormcharmers include a plot no greater than 3 metres by 3 metres, a five-minute warm up period, a three-person team of charmer, catcher and counter and that all worms must be returned to the ground after the contest according to the British Association of Worm Length Supporters (BAWLS).
