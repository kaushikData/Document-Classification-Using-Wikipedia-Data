'''''A Movie''''' (styled as '''''A MOVIE''''') is a 1958 experimental [[collage film]] by American artist [[Bruce Conner]]. It combines pieces of found footage taken from various sources such as [[newsreel]]s, soft-core [[pornography]], and [[B movie]]s, all set to a score featuring [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Pines of Rome]]''.

The film is recognized as a landmark work in American experimental cinema, particularly as an early example of [[found footage (appropriation)|found footage]]. ''A Movie'' was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]] in 1994.

==Content==
[[File:A Movie The End.png|thumb|''A Movie'' has multiple false endings announced in its intertitles.]]
''A Movie'' opens with its longest shot, an extended production credit with Bruce Conner's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Horne |first=Jennifer |date=March 2000 |title=Guilt by Association |magazine=[[Afterimage (magazine)|Afterimage]] |volume=27 |issue=5 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the opening credits, the countdown leader is interrupted by a shot of an undressed woman removing her stockings. Once the countdown completes, an intertitle falsely announces "The End" of the film. The film moves into a montage of cavalry, tanks, race cars, and a charging elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Sterritt 2013, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another false ending precedes footage of zeppelins and tightrope walkers. In one well-known sequence, a man in a submarine looks through a periscope to see a woman posing in a bikini, leading to the launch of a torpedo and a mushroom cloud. This leads to water sporting accidents and racing mishaps. As the musical score swells, a succession of violent scenes ensues, including aerial bombings, the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]], and firing squads. The film closes with a scuba diver exploring a shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;Sterritt 2013, pp. 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Bruce Conner developed the concept for ''A Movie'' many years before he began working on it. He was inspired early on by a battle scene in the [[Marx Brothers]]' ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' that builds a montage from stock footage.&lt;ref name="culpa-damage"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Culpa |first=Mia |date=January 1980 |title=Bruce Conner: Part Two |magazine=Damage |pages=7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned a film combining images and sounds from many different movies and, when watching movies, often imagined possible sequences that could be created from them.&lt;ref name="radical-light-93"&gt;Conner 2010, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conner and [[Larry Jordan]] began the Camera Obscura Film Society during the late 1950s. Conner was interested in the [[film leader]] used by projectionists that went unseen by the audience. He had a filmstrip given to him by writer Lee Streiff which showed a nude woman, and he thought about inserting the strip in the countdown leader at a Camera Obscura screening of ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. When Jordan found out about the plan, he threatened to quit the society. Conner decided that the only way for him to carry out this vision would be to insert such a sequence in a film of his own.&lt;ref name="radical-light-93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bass-jotufa"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bass |first=Warren |year=1981 |title=The Past Restructured: Bruce Conner and Others |journal=[[Journal of Film and Video|Journal of the University Film Association]] |volume=33 |issue=2 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Jordan showed Conner how to edit film and offered him the use of a Griswold film splicer.&lt;ref&gt;Wees 1993, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing cinema as "a rich man's art form", Conner looked to store-bought footage as an economical alternative to shooting original material.&lt;ref&gt;Sterritt 2013, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased a condensed [[Hopalong Cassidy]] western, a short novelty film called ''Thrills and Spills'', a [[Castle Films|Castle]] home movie containing German propaganda, and a newsreel compilation titled ''Headlines of 1953''.&lt;ref&gt;Piranio 1999, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flaherty-172"&gt;Zimmermann and MacDonald 2017, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conner primarily worked in [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] at the time, and he originally planned to use the film as part of an installation piece.&lt;ref name="bass-jotufa"/&gt; The installation would fill a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} cube into which people could walk. The film would have no soundtrack; instead, the installation would play the film as a loop with sound coming from tape players, radio, and television. However, Conner was not able to fulfill his original vision. The cost of a rear projection machine for the installation was prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref name="culpa-damage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aitken 2006, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen|filename=Respighi Pines of Villa Borghese.ogg|title="Pines of the Villa Borghese"|description=A performance of the first movement of ''[[Pines of Rome]]'' (1924)}}
He decided to make the film a stand-alone work and edited the segments together using a radio to time them. During one editing session, Respighi's ''Pines of Rome'' came on the radio and synced well with the ending. ''Pines of Rome'' had been used ten years earlier by [[Kenneth Anger]] for his avant-garde short film ''[[Fireworks (1947 film)|Fireworks]]''.&lt;ref name="culpa-damage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piranio 1999, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Conner made a recording from the first, second, and fourth movements and added the music to the completed image track.&lt;ref name="culpa-damage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerlach |first=John |year=1973 |title=A Movie is a Movie is a Movie |journal=[[Journal of Film and Video|Journal of the University Film Association]] |volume=25 |issue=3 |page=54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was unsure how to clear the rights to the music and used the recording without authorization.&lt;ref name="flaherty-172"/&gt; He completed the film on a budget of $350.&lt;ref name="culpa-damage"/&gt;

==Release==
''A Movie'' premiered June 10, 1958, at the East and West Gallery in San Francisco. It was part of a reception for Conner's first solo art show.&lt;ref name="radical-light-93"/&gt; Shortly after, the film was acquired for distribution by [[Cinema 16]] in New York. When local distributor [[Canyon Cinema]] emerged in the early 1960s, ''A Movie'' was one of its more well-known offerings.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2008, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
At its 1960 Creative Film Awards Presentation, the Creative Film Foundation gave ''A Movie'' an Award of Distinction, with [[Michael McClure]] describing its comedy "not [as] a free laugh but the reconstruction of human depth, achievement and emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Vogel 2002, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thurston |first=Wallace |year=1961 |title=Creative Film Award Winners: 1959 and 1960 |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |page=34 |doi=10.2307/1210066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has gone on to be recognized as a landmark piece of avant-garde cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Frieling and Garrels 2016, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, ''A Movie'' was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ |title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Peter Hutton (filmmaker)|Peter Hutton]] has cited ''A Movie'' as an influence on his work.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1998, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Christian Marclay]] first saw the film as a student, and it influenced his own practice of appropriating materials and establishing new connections between them.&lt;ref&gt;Frieling and Garrels 2016, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Berliner]]'s 1985 film ''Everywhere at Once'' uses ''Pines of Rome'' for its soundtrack in an homage to ''A Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2006, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Proctor remade it in 2010 as ''A Movie by Jen Proctor''. Her digital remake follows the original nearly shot for shot, using footage downloaded from [[YouTube]] and [[LiveLeak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baron |first=Jaimie |year=2012 |title=The Experimental Film Remake and the Digital Archive Effect: ''A Movie by Jen Proctor'' and ''Man with a Movie Camera: The Global Remake'' |journal=Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media |volume=53 |issue=2 |page=468|doi=10.1353/frm.2012.0020  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artist's statement''' (or '''artist statement''') is an artist's written description of their work. The brief verbal representation is for, and in support of, his or her own work to give the viewer understanding. As such it aims to inform, connect with an art context, and present the basis for the work; it is, therefore, didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature.

==Description==
The artist's text intends to explain, justify, extend, and/or contextualize his or her body of work. It places or attempts to place the work in relationship to art history and theory, the art world and the times. Further, the statement serves to show that the artist is conscious of their intentions, aware of their practice and its position within art parameters and of the discourse surrounding it. Therefore not only does it describe and place, but it indicates the level of the artist's own comprehension of their field and making. The artist statement serves as a "vital link of communication between you [the artist], and the rest of the world." &lt;ref&gt; College Art Association (Producer). (2011, Jan 26). "Developing Your Artist Statement" [Audio Podcast]. Retrieved from http://www.collegeart.org/podcasts/ &lt;/ref&gt; Most people encounter a work of art through a reproduction first, and there are many elements that are not present within a reproduction. That is why it is imperative that the artist knows how to properly convey their work through their own words. What the artist writes in their statement may be integrated in wall text, hand outs at an exhibition or a paragraph in a press release. Judgments will be made based both on the nature of the art, as well as the words that accompany it.   


Artists often write a short (50-100 word) and/or a long (500-1000 word) version of the same statement, and they may maintain and revise these statements throughout their careers. &lt;ref&gt;''Tom Palin: Artist Statements 1992-2012''. Workshop Press Leeds, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;They may be edited to suit the requirements of specific funding bodies, galleries or [[call-out]]s as part of the application process.

==History==
The writing of artists' statements is a comparatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Detterer, Gabriele. Ed.  ''Art Recollection: Artists' Interviews &amp; Statements in the Nineties']'. Florence: Danilo Montanari, Exit, and Zona Archives Editori, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some respects, the practice resembles the [[art manifesto]] and may derive in part from it.  However, the artist's statement generally speaks for an individual rather than a collective, and is not strongly associated with [[polemic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Rather, a [[contemporary art]]ist may be required to submit the statement in order to tender for commissions or apply for schools, residencies, jobs, awards, and other forms of institutional support, in justification of their submission.

In their 2008 survey of North American art schools and university art programs, Garrett-Petts and Nash found that nearly 90% teach the writing of artist statements as part of the curriculum; in addition, they found that, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like prefaces, forewords, prologues, and introductions to literary works, the artist statement performs a vital if complex rhetorical role: when included in an exhibition proposal and sent to a curator, the artist statement usually provides a description of the work, some indication of the work's art historical and theoretical context, some background information about the artist and the artist's intentions, technical specifications – and, at the same time, it aims to persuade the reader of the artwork's value. When hung on a gallery wall, the statement (or "didactic") becomes an invitation, an explanation, and, often indirectly, an element of the installation itself.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett-Petts, W.F., and Rachel Nash. "Re-Visioning the Visual: Making Artistic Inquiry Visible." ''Rhizomes'' 18 (Winter 2008). Spec. issue on "Imaging Place".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As subject matter==
On at least two occasions, artist's statements have been the subject of gallery exhibitions. The first exhibition of artists' statements, ''The Art of the Artist's Statement'',  was curated by Georgia Kotretsos and Maria Pashalidou at the Hellenic Museum, [[Chicago]], in the spring of 2005. It featured the work of 14 artists invited to create artwork offering a visual commentary on the subject of artist statements. The second exhibition, ''Proximities: Artists' Statements and Their Works'', was installed in the fall of 2005 at the Kamloops Art Gallery, [[Kamloops, British Columbia]]. Co-curated by W.F. Garrett-Petts and Rachel Nash, the exhibition asked nine contributing artists to respond to the topic of artists’ statements by taking one or more of their own artist’s statements and working with the text(s) in a manner that documented, represented, and annotated the original work, creating a new work in the process.

Artist's statements have been the subject of a research project on the professional language of the contemporary art world by sociologist Alix Rule and artist David Levine. Presented in their 2012 article ''International Art English,'' published in the American art journal [[Triple Canopy (online magazine)|Triple Canopy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/international_art_english|title=Triple Canopy – International Art English by Alix Rule &amp; David Levine|newspaper=Triple Canopy|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine &amp; Rule collated and analysed thousands of gallery [[Press release|press releases]], published by [[e-flux]] since 1999, in an attempt to dissect and understand the peculiar language of the professional art world. It has since become one of the most widely circulated pieces of online cultural criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/27/users-guide-international-art-english|title=A user's guide to artspeak|last=Beckett|first=Andy|date=2013-01-27|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1785">The '''Baemi''', (Bæmi) or '''Baimoi''', were a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] who are only known by their mention in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''. He described them as a large tribe living on the north side of the Danube, near the [[Luna forest]], and the [[Quadi]], and with the [[Gambreta]] forest of the [[Marcomanni]] to their northwest. This would place them in or around modern [[Slovakia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Lower Austria]].

Commentators generally compare the term to another one found in the same text (but located further north), the "[[Bainochaimai]]". And both terms are considered related to references to similar terms in older authors, [[Strabo]] and [[Tacitus]], who were both referring to a place rather than an ethnic group. Strabo describes Boihaemum, as the domain of [[Marabodus]], in the [[Hercynian forest]], where he had moved some of his Suebian people and based his kingdom. Tacitus describes Boiemum in the same region, and specifically as a name derived from the more ancient Celtic tribe, the [[Boii]], who had lived there in the past. The second element of these names is thought to derive from an old Germanic term meaning "home of" (cf the modern German ''{{lang|de|[[wikt:Heim#German|Heim]]}}'', English "home"; more at ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/haimaz|*haimaz]]'') therefore giving the complete term the meaning "the place where the Boii lived".

These terms survive today in the modern name [[Bohemia]], and more generally the name of the Boii survives not only in "Bohemia" but also in the name of the neighbouring German region of [[Bavaria]].

'''Blonde stereotypes''' are [[stereotype]]s of [[Blond|blond-hair]]ed people, especially women. Sub-types include the "'''[[Blonde bombshell (sex symbol)|blonde bombshell]]'''" and the "'''dumb blonde'''". Blondes are differently stereotyped from [[brown hair|brunettes]] as more desirable and less intelligent. There are many [[blonde joke]]s made on these premises. Although chiefly aimed at women, jokes of this style have also been aimed at similar stereotypes associated with men, such as the "[[Jock (stereotype)|dumb jock]]" and the "[[surfer]] dude".

==Background==
There are several aspects to the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] perception of [[blonde]]-[[hair]]ed women.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;Hornaday, Ann (May 4, 2014) "In Praise of the Dumb Blonde" ''The Washington Post'', page E14. Retrieved May 4, 2014 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-praise-of-the-dumb-blonde-an-archetype-in-need-of-saving/2014/05/01/4fdf67b4-cfbe-11e3-a6b1-45c4dffb85a6_story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, over history, blonde hair in women has often been considered attractive and desirable.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Hair, p. 255"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Hair'', p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Blonde hair has been considered attractive for long periods of time in various European cultures, particularly when coupled with blue eyes. This perception is exploited in culture and advertising.&lt;ref name=eh149&gt;''Encyclopedia of Hair',' [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q=dumb&amp;f=false pp. 149-151]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary popular culture, it is often stereotyped that men find blonde women more attractive than women with other hair colors.&lt;ref name=sherrow&gt;Victoria Sherrow. ''Encyclopedia of hair: a cultural history''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&amp;pg=PA149 Page 149]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Anita Loos]] popularized this idea in her 1925 novel ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]''.&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt; Blondes are often assumed to have more fun; for example, in a [[Clairol]] commercial for hair colorant, they use the phrase "Is it true blondes have more fun?"&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt; Some women have reported they feel other people expect them to be more fun-loving after having lightened their hair.&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt; In much of the Americas, such as in North America, the blonde stereotype is also associated with being less serious or less intelligent.&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt;

On the other hand, a blonde woman is often perceived as making little use of [[intelligence]] and as a "woman who relies on her looks rather than on intelligence."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Hair, p. 255"/&gt; At the same time, people tend to presume that blondes are less serious-minded and less intelligent than [[brunette]]s, as reflected in "blonde jokes".&lt;ref name=eh149/&gt; The roots of this notion may be traced to Europe, with the "dumb blonde" in question being a French [[courtesan]] named [[Rosalie Duthé]], satirised in a 1775 play ''Les Curiosites de la Foire'' for her habit of pausing a long time before speaking, appearing not only stupid but literally [[muteness|dumb]] (in the sense of mute).&lt;ref name=eh149/&gt; The latter stereotype of "dumb blonde"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Regenberg |first=Nina |year=2007 |title=Are Blondes Really Dumb? |journal= |issue= |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/2612795/Are-Blonds-Really-Dumb}}&lt;/ref&gt; is exploited in [[blonde joke]]s. In Brazil, this extends to blonde women being looked down upon, as reflected in sexist jokes, as also sexually licentious.&lt;ref name=giselemaria&gt;Revista Anagrama, Universidade de São Paulo, [http://www.revistas.usp.br/anagrama/article/view/35305 Stereotypes of women in blonde jokes pp. 6-8], version 1, edition 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] preferred to cast blonde women for major roles in his films as he believed that the audience would suspect them the least, comparing them to "virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints", hence the term "Hitchcock blonde".&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, Richard|title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-231-13574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype has become so ingrained it has spawned counter-narratives, such as in the 2001 film ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' in which [[Reese Witherspoon]] succeeds at Harvard despite biases against her beauty and blonde hair,&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt; and terms developed such as cookie cutter blonde (CCB), implying standardized blonde looks and standard perceived social and intelligence characteristics of a blonde. Many actors and actresses in [[Latin America]] and [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic United States]] have blond hair and [[blue eyes]] and/or pale skin,&lt;ref&gt;

[[Annette Kuhn]] divides blonde stereotypes in cinema into three categories in ''The Women's Companion to International Film'':&lt;ref name=kuhn47&gt;Annette Kuhn, ''The Women's Companion to International Film'', page 47, University of California Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08879-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "ice-cold blonde": Kuhn defined it as "a blonde who hides a fire beneath an exterior of coldness". She provided [[Grace Kelly]], [[Veronica Lake]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Mae Murray]], and [[Eva Marie Saint]] as examples.

==="Dumb blonde"===
:''"...We got the bubble-headed bleached-blonde, comes on at five; she can tell you 'bout the plane crash with a gleam in her eye...."''
::— lyrics from ''"[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]"'', [[Don Henley]], 1982

The notion of "dumb blonde" has been a topic of academic research reported in scholarly articles and university symposia, which tend to confirm that many people hold to the perception that light-haired women are less intelligent than women with dark hair.&lt;ref name=eh149/&gt; While there is no evidence that suggests that blondes are less intelligent than other people, it has been suggested that the state of being blond creates opportunities that do not require investing in education and training.&lt;ref name=frank&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/business/07scene.html "Despite the Dumb Jokes, Stereotypes May Reflect Some Smart Choices"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed the originator of the "dumb blonde" was an 18th-century blonde French prostitute named [[Rosalie Duthé]] whose reputation of being beautiful but dumb inspired a play about her called ''Les Curiosites de la Foire'' (Paris 1775).&lt;ref name="sherrow"/&gt; The French tradition may be that blondes are fatally attractive, rather than merely "dumb," as attested by the true story and myths associated with "Casque d'Or," Amélie Hélie (1879-1933), commemorated in a public park in Paris.

A possible explanation is that attractive women have less pressing incentives to cultivate and demonstrate their intellect in order to ensure their future, since attractiveness is an asset, or correlatively that intelligent women have less pressing incentives to dye their hair to a presumed attractive color. The validity of this explanation is corroborated by its applicability to a similar pervasiveness of the "[[dumb athlete]]" stereotype.&lt;ref name="frank"/&gt; The dumb blonde stereotype (and the associated [[cognitive bias]]) may have some negative consequences and it can also damage a blonde person's career prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=The Observer| date=29 July 2001| title=The new blonde bombshell| url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jul/29/featuresreview.review| location=London| work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas 1997 277–313"/&gt; Some blonde jokes rely on [[sexual humor|sexual humour]] to portray or stereotype their subjects as [[sexual promiscuity|promiscuous]].&lt;ref name=kross&gt;Karen Ross, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrXrueVe-0C&amp;pg=PT108 The Handbook of Gender, Sex and Media]'', chapter 6, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, {{ISBN|9781118114223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are rephrased [[sorority]] girl or [[Essex girl]] jokes,&lt;ref name=Kuipers/&gt; much as other jokes about [[dumb blonde]]s are based on long-running ethnic jokes. Many of these jokes are mere variants on traditional [[ethnic joke]]s or jests about other identifiable groups (such as Italian jokes involving [[Carabinieri]], [[Sardarji jokes]] or [[Pathan jokes]]). Similar jokes about stereotyped minorities have circulated since the seventeenth century with only the wording and targeted groups changed.&lt;ref name=Kuipers&gt;Giselinde Kuipers, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uk_WHTCTN9YC&amp;pg=PA24 Good Humor, Bad Taste: A Sociology of the Joke]'', page 24, Walter de Gruyter, 2006, {{ISBN|9783110186154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blonde jokes have been criticized as [[sexism|sexist]] by several authors, as most blondes in these jokes are female, although male variations also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, dumb blonde jokes are overwhelmingly female-specific: according to an extensive search in various publications and on the Internet, about 63% of dumb blonde jokes are directed exclusively at females (compared to less than 5% that directly referenced dumb blond men).&lt;ref name="Takeda 2006 85–99"/&gt; Research indicates that because of this, men report being amused by blonde jokes significantly more than women do.&lt;ref name="autogenerated341"/&gt; The fact that in most of these jokes the target is invariably dim-witted, female and sexually promiscuous makes them even more sexist.&lt;ref name=kross/&gt; In the 20th century, a class of [[meta-jokes]] about blondes (i.e. jokes about blonde jokes) has emerged. In a typical plot of this type a blonde complains about the unfairness of the stereotype propagated by blonde jokes, with a punch line actually reinforcing the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Limor Shifman, Dafna Lemish, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrXrueVe-0C&amp;pg=PT108 "Virtually Blonde: Blonde Jokes in the Global Age and Postfeminist Discourse"], in: ''The Handbook of Gender, Sex and Media''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have been conducted over the years to measure society's attitude toward blondes and brunettes. Many of the studies have shown that men, especially those of European descent, find blonde women more attractive than brunettes, redheads, or women of other races who had darker hair, eyes, or complexion.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Jeffry A. and Douglas T.

French magazine ''[[Le Monde]]'' believes that the rivalry is more prevalent in the United States. In a 2012 article, ''Le Monde'' argued that American TV has almost, without exception, characterized blonde women as having the positive values of purity, goodness, and sincerity, frequently at the expense of their brunette counterparts.&lt;ref name="Leblin"&gt;Leblin, Arnaud (December 20, 2012) "Semaine des lecteurs – Blondes vs. Brunes" ''Le Monde''. Retrieved April 27, 2013 [http://seriestv.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/12/20/semaine-des-lecteurs-blondes-vs-brunes/]&lt;/ref&gt; The article provided several examples including ''[[Bewitched]]'' (where Samantha, the blonde witch, displays a sense of tolerance while her dark haired cousin Serena plays the wild one),&lt;ref name="Leblin"/&gt; ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (where blonde Krystal pitted against brunette Alexis),&lt;ref name="Leblin"/&gt; and ''[[V (TV series)|V]]'' (in both the original series in 1984 and the remake in 2009 shows an intelligent, humanistic blonde battling a brunette leader of the alien cannibals).&lt;ref name="Leblin"/&gt;

In Russia, according to a 2011 survey by the Southern Federal University, brunettes are considered more attractive than blondes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2011/05/20/krasavica.html Исследование. Убойная Сила XXI века.” ''rg.ru'']&lt;/ref&gt; One theory forwards, as an explanation, the concept the feminization of blond hair, which can be seen by the overwhelming association of the dumb blond persona with females. This idea draws on the stereotype that females have a lower psychometric intelligence than males.&lt;ref&gt;

==Counter representation==
At the same time, there are many examples where the stereotype is exploited only to combat it.&lt;ref name=eh149/&gt; The film ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' starring [[Reese Witherspoon]] featured the stereotype as a centerpiece of its plot. However, the protagonist turns out to be very intelligent and is shown to have been underachieving due to society's low expectations of her.

[[Country music]] entertainer [[Dolly Parton]], aware of this occasional characterization of her, addressed it in her 1967 hit "[[Hello, I'm Dolly|Dumb Blonde]]". Parton's lyrics challenged the stereotype, stating "just because I'm blonde, don't think I'm dumb 'cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool". Parton has said she was not offended by "all the dumb-[[blonde jokes]] because I know I'm not dumb. I'm also not blonde."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Thomas.

The author of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'', [[Chic Young]], starting with "Dumb Dora", gradually transformed the titular character into a smart, hard-working, family-oriented woman.&lt;ref&gt;"The Comics", by Coulton Waugh, M.

In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[To Surveil with Love]]" Lisa faces prejudice with her brunette peers because of her blonde hair. She dyes her hair dark brown to prove her point that not all blondes are dumb and people need to look past every stereotype.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Overview==

===Setting===
The story takes place at MJN Air, the world's smallest airline, consisting of just one 16-seater plane: a "Lockheed McDonnell 312", registration Golf Echo Romeo Tango India (G-ERTI), and thus nicknamed "Gerti".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Newcastle|series=Cabin Pressure|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|location=[[London]]|airdate=15 July 2011|seriesno=3|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company name derives from when owner Carolyn Knapp-Shappey (Stephanie Cole) was awarded Gerti as part of her divorce settlement with her awful Australian husband Gordon Shappey ([[Timothy West]]) and thus proudly proclaimed that Gerti was: "My Jet Now". The company is so small, with Carolyn joking that rather than an airline MJN is more of an "airdot" than an "airline", that everything is run on a tight budget and they are willing to take on any job to keep the business going. The company is based in the fictional Fitton Airport, located somewhere in the Midlands.&lt;ref name="Fitton"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Fitton|series=Cabin Pressure|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|location=[[London]]|airdate=6 August 2008|seriesno=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finnemore|first=John|authorlink=John Finnemore (writer)|title=Cabin Pressure: From A To Z Booklet|publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]]|date=5 February 2015|pages=2–3|isbn=978-1-91028-199-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each episode is named after a different city (often a destination for MJN in the episode) each beginning with successive letters of the alphabet. The episodes were not broadcast in alphabetical order, but ''The Complete Cabin Pressure: From A to Z'' collection does play the episodes alphabetically.&lt;ref name="From A To Z"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/cabin_pressure/buy/4190/the_complete_cabin_pressure_from_a_to_z_audiobook/|title=The Complete Cabin Pressure - From A To Z (Audio)|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
{{See also|List of Cabin Pressure characters}}
The story follows the day-to-day working life of MJN Air and its crew of four: Carolyn (Stephanie Cole), the owner and stewardess; First Officer Douglas Richardson (Roger Allam), an experienced pilot formerly at Air England until he was sacked for smuggling; Captain Martin Crieff (Benedict Cumberbatch), whose love of flying and planes is let down by his lack of natural ability; and Arthur Shappey (John Finnemore), Carolyn's overexcited and idiotic son who works as a steward.

Much of the plot revolves around the relationship between Douglas and Martin. While Martin is the captain, Douglas is more experienced, and most people consider Douglas to be superior to him in almost every way. When meeting both men most guests mistakenly believe Douglas to be the captain rather than Martin. Carolyn refers to Douglas as the "good pilot" and Martin as the "safe pilot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Ipswich|series=Cabin Pressure|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|location=[[London]]|airdate=31 July 2009|seriesno=2|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while Douglas gets paid, Martin does not because Carolyn cannot afford it. Thus Martin also has a second job with his own business, Icarus Removals, using a van he inherited from his late father, and lives a life of poverty.&lt;ref name="Qikiqtarjuaq"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Qikiqtarjuaq|series=Cabin Pressure|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|location=[[London]]|airdate=1 July 2011|seriesno=3|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas, meanwhile, has to do his job in order to pay two different alimonies, and tries to keep secret from his third wife Helena that he is not a captain. It is later revealed that Helena is having an affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Limerick|series=Cabin Pressure|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|location=[[London]]|airdate=21 August 2009|seriesno=2|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas is also a recovering alcoholic, having been sober for a period of several years at the time the story begins, although he tries to prevent anyone else from knowing about it, fearing it will tarnish his image.&lt;ref name="Fitton"/&gt;

Much of the time spent on the flight-deck is spent with the crew playing various games to pass the time such as "People Who Aren't Evil But Have Evil Sounding Names", "Brians of Britain", "Books That Sound More Interesting with the Final Letter Knocked Off" (e.g. ''[[Three Men in a Boat|Three Men in a Boa]]'', ''[[Of Mice and Men|Of Mice and Me]]'') and "The Travelling Lemon", in which the crew try to hide a lemon in plain sight of the passengers without anyone complaining. This is the origin of the phrase "The lemon is in play," used by Douglas in the episodes [[Qikiqtarjuaq]] and [[Zurich]] Part 2.  &lt;ref name="Fitton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Qikiqtarjuaq"/&gt;

Though MJN squabble among themselves, in several episodes the crew unite to combat a common enemy or problem. A recurring antagonist is Gordon Shappey ([[Timothy West]]), Carolyn's ex-husband and Arthur's father, who resents Carolyn obtaining the jet in the divorce and frequently tries to reacquire it through fair means and foul. Other recurring characters include Mr Birling ([[Geoffrey Whitehead]]), who every year hires the plane to take him to see the final match in the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] Rugby Union tournament. On "Birling Day", the crew toady to Birling in the hope that he will give them all large tips. Every Birling Day Douglas attempts to steal Birling's whisky and sell it on while Carolyn and the rest of the crew try to stop him.

Another recurring character is Captain Hercules "Herc" Shipwright ([[Anthony Head]]), a former colleague of Douglas who now works at Scottish airline Air Caledonia. Herc is an occasional rival to Douglas and a love interest to Carolyn, though she is reluctant to reciprocate Herc's affections.

Princess Theresa of Liechtenstein ([[Matilda Ziegler]]) appears in the final season, first appearing when she hires MJN to take her younger brother and ruling monarch King Maxi to Fitton so he can return to school. She and Martin begin a romantic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Vaduz|series=Cabin Pressure|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|location=[[London]]|airdate=23 January 2013|seriesno=4|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the two-part series finale Martin is given a paid job at Swiss Air, which means MJN has to close down and Gerti has to be sold. However, when Gordon tries to purchase Gerti, Arthur puts in a gigantic bid to stop his father from buying the plane. Douglas suspects that there is something valuable hidden on the plane and MJN manage to buy back Gerti. His suspicions prove correct when he discovers that Gordon had replaced the wiring of the plane with gold, not expecting that Carolyn would get the plane in their divorce. Martin concludes he is more skilled pilot than he thought, having been struggling in the past years with a poorly weighted plane, and the solution to Carolyn's financial problems has been right under her nose all along. Carolyn uses the money to secure the company's future, renaming it OJS Air ("Our Jet Still"). Martin takes up his new job securing paid employment and living close to Princess Theresa, Douglas is promoted to Captain, and Herc — who accepts a downwards career move due to his affections for Carolyn — is hired as the new First Officer. The series ends with OJS flying to Addis Ababa, bringing the alphabetical progression of cities full circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Zurich, Part 1|series=Cabin Pressure|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|location=[[London]]|airdate=23 December 2014|seriesno=4|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Zurich, Part 2|series=Cabin Pressure|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|location=[[London]]|airdate=24 December 2014|seriesno=4|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, [[Nicholas Lezard]] praised the first series highly, called "the writing and performances&amp;nbsp;... exceptional" and suggested that the show "deserves an award".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Cabin Pressure, Radio 4: Scratch the surface and there's a classic British sitcom beneath |author= Nicholas Lezard |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/cabin-pressure-radio-4-889553.html |newspaper= The Independent |date= 10 August 2008 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillian Reynolds of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called ''Cabin Pressure'' "one of the best written, cast, acted and directed comedies on anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A strike and a scandal keep Radio 4 on its toes |author= Gillian Reynolds |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8646083/A-strike-and-a-scandal-keep-Radio-4-on-its-toes.html |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 18 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">The '''Challenge Index''' is a method for the statistical ranking of top public [[high schools]] in the [[United States]] by [[Washington Post]] columnist [[Jay Mathews]].  This ranking is determined by the extent of availability of the [[Advanced Placement]] and [[International Baccalaureate]] Programs in the school's curriculum and the number of graduating students.  

For each school, the study tallies the total number of AP and IB exams are taken that year in the high school.  This sum is divided by the number of students graduating in that same year.  This ratio is the Challenge Index.  Not incorporated with the study are magnet schools, or any school that accepts over 50% of its students via a placement test or other type of admission criterion.  The study effectively demonstrates the public schools with greatest opportunity for all students to challenge themselves with college level courses.  

However, critics argue that this ranking system does a disservice by not taking into consideration the actual performance of the student exams, but merely the quantity of exams taken.  Administrators of the study acknowledge that the system is "not a measurement of the overall quality of the school but illuminates one factor that many educators consider important."{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}
The validity of the Challenge Index has been strongly criticized by education analysts Andrew J. Rotherham and Sara Mead of Education Sector in Washington, DC.  Their 2006 paper,[http://www.educationsector.org/analysis/analysis_show.htm?doc_id=358299 Challenged Index] showed how many schools that are among the top 100 nationally, according to Newsweek, actually have high dropout rates and wide gaps in achievement separating students by race and income.  A [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/22/AR2007062201321.html summary of their argument] appeared recently in The Washington Post and Jay Mathews [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/22/AR2007062201435.html responded].  

The editors, primarily Jay Mathews, defend their ratings by citing recent studies [http://www.ed.gov/pubs/Toolbox/toolbox.html] by U.S. Department of Education senior researcher Clifford Adelman. In 1999 and 2005, Adelman showed that the best predictor of college graduation was not good high-school grades or test scores, but whether or not a student had an intense academic experience in high school. The demands of higher level, college-type courses in high school would, according to ''Newsweek'', provide that experience. The editors are critical of some other indices of school excellence, such as ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'' “America’s Best Colleges”, as including too many factors, and of American high schools in general, since only 5% of all US high schools make the ''Newsweek'' list by having at least 1 AP or IB test score per each graduating senior.

Tabulated results of the Challenge Index are published for Washington area high schools in the Washington Post annually.  [[Newsweek]] also publishes nationwide results each year.

'''Chinese [[Internet slang]]''' is informal language coined to express ideas on the [[Internet in China|Chinese Internet]] in response to events, the influence of the mass media and foreign culture, and the desire of people to simplify and update the Chinese language. Slang that first appears on the net is often adopted to become current in everyday life. It includes content relating to all aspects of life—social, mass media, economic, and political etc. Internet slang is arguably the fastest-changing aspect of the language, created by a number of different influences—technology (the means used to input and send messages), mass media and foreign culture amongst others.

==Categories==

The categories given below to distinguish the different kinds of Chinese internet slang are not exclusive. Some phrases may belong in more than one category.

===Numbers, representing Chinese words (数字表示汉字 shùzì biǎoshì hànzì)===

*'''213''': 2B, means a person who is very stupid. 
* '''1314''': "For ever", usually preceded by a phrase such as "I love you" or whatever. 1314 (pinyin: yīsānyīsì) represents 一生一世 "one life, one world" (pinyin: yīshēng yīshì).
* '''4242''': "Yes" or "Affirmative" or "It is", 4242 (pinyin: sìèrsìèr) represents 是啊是啊 (pinyin: shìa shìa).
* '''520''': "I love you".  520 (pinyin: wǔ'èrlíng) represents 我爱你 (pinyin: wǒ ài nǐ).&lt;ref name=LLC&gt;[http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ Why Thai Laugh When Chinese Cry? Accessed 4 February 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420091421/http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |date=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''555''': "(crying)". 555 (pinyin: wǔwǔwǔ) represents 呜呜呜 (pinyin: wūwūwū) the sound of tearful crying.
* '''7451''' or '''7456''': "I'm angry". 7451 (pinyin: qīsìwǔyī) or 7456 (pinyin: qīsìwǔliù) represents 气死我了 (pinyin: qìsǐ wǒle).
* '''748''': "Go and die!", 748 (pinyin: qīsìbā)：represents 去死吧 (pinyin: qùsǐba), the equivalent of "Get lost!", or "Go to hell!"
* '''87''': (bitchy, or idiocy/idiot). 87 (pinyin: lit. bāqī, or loosely báichī) represents "bitchy" (English) or 白痴 idiocy/idiot (Mandarin).
* '''88''': "Bye bye" (goodbye). 88 (pinyin: bābā) represents "bye bye" (English).&lt;ref name=LLC /&gt; 886 also has the same meaning as "88".
* '''94''': "So, but etc."  94 jiǔsì represents 就是 (pinyin: jiùshì), the conjunction meaning "so", "but", "just like", "in the same way as" etc.
* '''995''': "Help", "Save me!" 995 (pinyin: jiǔjiǔwǔ) represents 救救我 (pinyin: jiùjiù wǒ).
* '''666''': "you're doing amazing sweetie" 666 (pinyin: liùliùliù) represents 溜溜溜 (pinyin:liùliùliù ).

*'''484''':"if" represents 是不是 (means yes or no)
*'''99''':"the wish for couple being together for long time"

===Latin alphabet abbreviations (字母縮寫 zìmǔ suōxiě)===

Chinese users commonly use a QWERTY keyboard with pinyin enabled. Upper case letters are quick to type and require no transformation. (Lower case letters spell words which are changed into Chinese characters). Latin alphabet abbreviations (rather than Chinese characters) are also sometimes used to evade censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chipchick.com/2012/03/qwerty-keyboards.html How the QWERTY Keyboard Is Changing the Chinese Language, accessed 15 February 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''LZ''':lóu zhǔ, owner of the thread, [[Original Poster|original poster]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3345">[[File:Brahmi Kya (Ka-Ya) conjunct consonant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|"Kya" (Ka+Ya) conjunct consonant in the [[Brahmi script]], consisting in the vertical assembly of consonants "Ka" [[File:Brahmi k.svg|12px]] and "Ya" [[File:Brahmi y.svg|12px]]. Used in the spelling of the word "[[Shakyas|Shakyamuni]]" to designate the [[Buddha]], [[Lumbini|Rummindei pillar]] of [[Ashoka]] (circa 250 BCE).]]
'''Conjunct consonants''' are a type of letters, used for example in [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] or modern [[Devanagari]], to write [[consonant cluster]]s such as {{IPA|/pr/}} or {{IPA|/rv/}}. Although most of the time, letters are formed by using a simple consonant with the inherent value vowel "a" (as with "k" [[File:Brahmi k.svg|12px]], pronounced "ka" in Brahmi), or by combining a consonant with an vowel in the form of an [[diacritic]] (as with "ki" [[File:Brahmi letter Ki.svg|12px]] in Brahmi), the usage of conjunct consonant permits the creation of more sophisticated sounds (as with "kya" [[File:Brahmi Kya.jpg|12px]], formed with the consonants k [[File:Brahmi k.svg|10px]] and y [[File:Brahmi y.svg|10px]] assembled verticaly).&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Conjuncts are often used with loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel.

In modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Michael C. |title=A Primer of Modern Standard Hindi |date=1989 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=9788120805088 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvuP8sD1wloC&amp;pg=PA23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some simple examples of conjunct consonants in Devanagari are: त + व = त्व tva, ण + ढ = ण्ढ ṇḍha, स + थ = स्थ stha, where the vertical stroke of the first letter is simply lost in the combination. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for kṣ is क्ष (क् + ष) and for jñ it is ज्ञ (ज् + ञ). 

Conjunct consonants are used in many other scripts as well, usually derived from the Brahmi script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tuṅga |first1=Sudhāṃśu Śekhara |title=Bengali and Other Related Dialects of South Assam |date=1995 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=9788170995883 |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRRYBHQvXdsC&amp;pg=PA163 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Balinese script|Balinese]], conjunct consonants are called ''Haksara Wrehastra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shadeg |first1=Norbert |title=Tuttle Balinese-English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=9781462910786 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20ktBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjunct consonant are not limited to Brahmic languages, and can be seen in [[Navajo language|Navajo]] for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDonough |first1=J.

'''Cotton recycling''' prevents unneeded wastage and can be a more [[sustainability|sustainable]] alternative to disposal. [[Recycled]] [[cotton]] may come from older, previously used garments or by textile leftovers which are then spun into new yarns and fabrics. There are some notable limitations of recycled cotton, including separation of materials that are cotton/[[polyester]] mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21720200-global-clothing-production-doubled-between-2000-and-2014-looking-good-can-be|title=Looking good can be extremely bad for the planet|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be limits to durability in using recycled cotton.

==Process==
[[Cotton]] can be [[recycling|recycled]] from pre-consumer (post-industrial) and post-consumer cotton waste. Pre-consumer waste comes from any excess material produced during the production of [[yarn]], fabrics and textile products, e.g. [[selvage]] from weaving and fabric from factory cutting rooms. Post-consumer waste comes from discarded textile products, e.g. used apparel and home textiles. During the recycling process, the cotton waste is first sorted by type and color and then processed through stripping machines that first breaks the yarns and fabric into smaller pieces before pulling them apart into fiber. The mix is carded several times in order to clean and mix the fibers before they are spun into new yarns.&lt;ref name="textileexchange.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130610020056/http://textileexchange.org/node/958 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://about.hm.com/en/sustainability/sustainable-fashion/materials/cotton.html|title=H&amp;M group {{!}} Cotton|website=about.hm.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting staple fiber is of shorter length compared to the original fiber length, meaning it is more difficult to spin. Recycled cotton is therefore often blended with virgin cotton fibers to improve yarn strengths.&lt;ref name="textileexchange.org" /&gt; Commonly, not more than 30% recycled cotton content is used in the finished yarn or fabric.

Because waste cotton is often already dyed, re-dyeing may not be necessary.&lt;ref name="textileexchange.org" /&gt; Cotton is an extremely resource-intense crop in terms of water, pesticides and insecticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/about_freshwater/freshwater_problems/thirsty_crops/cotton/|title=Cotton Farming|work=panda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that using recycled cotton can lead to significant savings of natural resources and reduce pollution from agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bir.org/industry/textiles/|title=- BIR – Bureau of International Recycling|website=Bir.org|accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling one tonne of cotton can save 765 cubic metres (202,000 US gal) of water.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Uses ==
Recycled cotton is often combined with [[recycled plastic]] [[plastic bottle|bottles]] to make clothing and textiles, creating sustainable, earth-conscious products. Recycled cotton can also be used in industrial settings as polishing and wiper cloths and can even be made into new, high-quality [[paper]]. When reduced to its fibrous state, cotton can be used for applications like seat stuffing or home and automotive insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = eHow Style: Cotton Recycling Process| accessdate = 2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sold as recycled cotton yarn for consumers to create their own items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lion Brand Yarn: Recycled Cotton Yarn| url = http://www.lionbrand.com/yarns/recycledcotton.html|website=Lionbrand.com | accessdate = 2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, cotton waste can be made into a stronger, more durable paper than traditional wood-pulp based paper, which may contain high concentration of acids. Cotton paper is often used for important documents and also for [[bank notes]] since it does not wear off as easily. Cotton waste can also be used to grow mushrooms (particularly the indoor cultivation of [[Volvariella volvacea]] otherwise known as Straw Mushrooms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cultivation of Edible Mushrooms on Cotton Waste | url = http://fungus.org.uk/nwfg/volv.htm |website=Fungus.org.uk| accessdate = 2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though recycling cotton cuts down on the harsh process of creating brand new cotton products, it is a natural fiber and is [[biodegradable]], so any cotton fibers that cannot be recycled or used further can be composted and will not take up space in landfills.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The '''culture of the [[Falkland Islands]]''' is essentially analogous to that of [[British culture]]. The Falkland Islands have a large non-native born population, mainly white and from [[England]] (and to a much lesser extent, other parts of the [[British Isles]]), but also from [[Saint Helena]].

The native born population is mainly of English and [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, with other strains such as [[Gibraltar]]ian.

==Language==
{{Main|Falkland Islands English|Languages of the Falkland Islands}}
The [[English language]] is used, mainly in its [[British English]] form. However, due to the isolation of the islands, the small population retains its own accent/dialect. In rural areas (i.e. anywhere outside [[Port Stanley]]), known as "[[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]]" (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''campo'', "countryside"), the Falkland accent tends to be stronger. The dialect has resemblances to [[Australian English|Australian]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[West Country dialects|West Country]] and [[Norfolk dialect]]s of English, as well as [[Scots (language)|Lowland Scots]].

Other notable Falkland island terms are the words "[[kelper]]" meaning a person who lives in the Falklands, etymologically, the term comes from the [[kelp]] surrounding the islands (although this term is sometimes considered pejorative); and "[[smoko]]" referring to a smoking break.

The official language of ''Falkland Islands'' is [[English language|English]] and also spoken languages in the [[Falkland Islands]] are [[Scots (language)|Lowland Scots]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (mostly spoken by Chileans, with some Spaniards), [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] and [[French language|French]].

==Literature==
:''For the culture inspired by the [[Falklands War]], see [[Cultural impact of the Falklands War]]''

Due to the low population of the islands, most of the literature of the islands has been written by outsiders, and is non-fiction. However some poetry has been written by [[Falklanders]], including, Ernest Spencer's ''Motherland''.

==Architecture==
{{see also|Listed buildings in the Falkland Islands}}
The ''[[1911 Britannica]]'' states:
:''The houses [of Stanley], mostly white with coloured roofs, are generally built of wood and iron, and have glazed porches, gay with fuchsias and pelargoniums. [[Government House (Falkland Islands)|Government House]], grey, stone-built and slated, calls to mind a [[manse]] in [[Shetland]] or [[Orkney]].  The government barrack is a rather imposing structure in the middle of the town, as is the cathedral church to the east, built of stone and buttressed with brick.''

The government barrack is now a guesthouse and is somewhat more in keeping with the surrounding houses.

Since this date, many more buildings have been erected in Stanley. In 1998, the [[Government of the Falkland Islands]] started a programme to encourage building of private houses, the development is known as '''East Stanley''' as it developed Stanley to the East. This led to a boom in the housing construction market with many new timber kit houses imported, largely from Scotland. These range from single bedroom bungalows to large 4-5 bedroom houses, the style of cladding and colours varying immensely.

Falkland houses are renowned for being brightly painted with immaculately maintained gardens, older houses frequently have intricately carved wooden fascia boards.

The [[Bodie Creek Suspension Bridge]] is sometimes stated to be the most southerly in the world.

There is one major newspaper, the [http://www.penguin-news.com Penguin News] and also a radio station the [http://www.firs.co.fk Falkland Islands Radio Service] (FIRS).

The islands also have their own [[Falkland Islands national football team|national football team]] and [[Falkland Islands cricket team|national cricket team]].

'''Saints Cyprian and Justina''' are honored in the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] as [[Christians]] of [[Antioch]], who in 304, during the persecution of [[Diocletian]], suffered [[martyrdom]] at [[Nicomedia]] (modern-day [[İzmit]], [[Turkey]]) on September 26. It is, however, certain that no Bishop of Antioch bore the name of Cyprian.&lt;ref name=Meier/&gt;

==Origin==
The story must have arisen as early as the 4th century, as it is mentioned both by [[St. Gregory Nazianzen]] and [[Prudentius]]; both, nevertheless, have conflated Cyprian with [[St. Cyprian of Carthage]], a mistake often repeated. The attempt has been made to find in Cyprian a mystical prototype of the [[Faust]]ian legend. The legend is given in [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] in ''Acta SS.'' September, VII. Ancient [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Ethiopic]] versions of it have been published.&lt;ref name=Meier&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04583a.htm Meier, Gabriel. "Sts. Cyprian and Justina." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 5 Jun. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
Cyprian, known by the title of the magician, to distinguish him from [[Cyprian|Cyprian, bishop of Carthage]], received a liberal education in his youth, and particularly applied himself to astrology; after which he traveled for improvement through Greece, Egypt, India, etc.&lt;ref name=tow&gt;"The Lives of Sts. Cyprian and Justina", ''The Orthodox Word, Vol. 12, No. 5 (70) (September-October, 1976), pp. 135-142, 167-176&lt;/ref&gt; Cyprian was a magician in Antioch and dealt in sorcery. 

Justina of Antioch is a Christian saint, known for converting Cyprian, a pagan magician of [[Antioch of Pisidia|Antioch]]. She is said to have been martyred in the year 304 AD. Justina was said to have been a young woman who took private vows of chastity and was killed during the persecutions of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Diocletian]]. 

The outline of the legend or allegory is found with diffuse descriptions and dialogues in the unreliable "''[[Symeon the Metaphrast|Symeon Metaphrastes]]''" and was made the subject of a poem by Empress [[Aelia Eudocia]].&lt;ref name=Meier/&gt;

A would-be suitor sought a magic spell to induce Justina to marry him. The charms had no effect on Justina, who spent her time in prayer and fasting. Brought to despair, Cyprian made the sign of the cross himself and in this way was freed from the toils of [[Satan]]. He was received into the Church, was made pre-eminent by miraculous gifts, and became in succession deacon, priest and, finally, [[bishop]], while Justina became the abbess of a [[convent]].&lt;ref name=oca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oca.org/saints/lives/2016/10/02/102836-virginmartyr-justina-of-nicomedia|title=Virginmartyr Justina of Nicomedia|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She is mentioned in ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]''. It was under the 10th Persecution in 303 AD while Diocletian was Emperor of Rome. It says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;" In the course of time he [Cyprian] became acquainted with Justina, a young lady of Antioch, whose birth, beauty, and accomplishments, rendered her the admiration of all who knew her. A pagan gentleman applied to Cyprian, to promote his suit with the beautiful Justina; this he undertook, but soon himself converted, burnt his books of astrology and magic, received baptism, and felt animated with a powerful spirit of grace. The conversion of Cyprian had a great effect on the pagan gentleman who paid his addresses to Justina, and he in a short time embraced Christianity. During the persecutions of Diocletian, Cyprian and Justina were seized upon as Christians, the former was torn with pincers, and the latter chastised; and, after suffering other torments, both were beheaded."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Diocletian persecution, both were seized and taken to [[Damascus]], where they were tortured. As their faith never wavered, they were brought before Diocletian at Nicomedia, where at his command they were [[decapitation|beheaded]]&lt;ref name=oca/&gt; on the bank of the river Gallus. The same fate befell a Christian, Theoctistus, who observing Cyprian's faith, declared himself a Christian.&lt;ref name=oca/&gt;

After the bodies of the saints had lain unburied for six days, they were taken by Christian sailors to [[Rome]], where they were interred on the estate of a noble lady named Rufina and later were entombed in Constantine's [[basilica]].

[[Image:Cyprianandjustinagoldenlegend.jpg|thumb|Saint Cyprian and the demon, 14th-century manuscript of the ''[[Golden Legend]]''.]]

==Veneration and liturgical celebration==
Their feast day appeared in the [[General Roman Calendar|calendar]] of [[Roman Rite]] celebrations from the thirteenth century until 1969, when it was removed because of the lack of historical evidence of their existence.&lt;ref&gt;"Calendarium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Their names were also removed from the subsequent (2001) revision of the [[Roman Martyrology]], the official but professedly incomplete list of saints recognized by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The Roman Martyrology, however, includes five saints called Cyprian and two named Justina. Some [[traditionalist Catholics]] continue to observe pre-1970 versions of the Roman Calendar.

[[Charles Borromeo]] dedicated the chapel of the [[Collegio Borromeo]] (built in 1561) in [[Pavia]] to her.

Saint Justina's [of Padua???] remains rest in the [[Santo António Church|Church of Saint Anthony]], in [[Lisbon]], after being transferred from St. Lawrence's Cemetery in [[Rome]] by [[Pope Pius VI]] in 1777.

==In popular culture==
The Spanish author, [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], took the story as the basis of a drama: ''El mágico prodigioso''. In 2005, American author Tono Rondone published a novel, ''The Martyrs'', which is a continuation of this tradition.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://piscesbooks.com/themartyrs.html Rondone, Tono. ''The Martyrs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Great Book of Saint Cyprian]]'' is full of prayers and spells, and is widely sold in the Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking world.

''[[Cyprianus]]'' is a popular name for a [[grimoire]] in Scandinavian folklore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10171">'''Ethnoarchaeology''' is the [[ethnographic]] study of peoples for [[archaeology|archaeological]] reasons, usually through the study of the material remains of a society (see David &amp; Kramer 2001).  Ethnoarchaeology aids archaeologists in reconstructing ancient lifeways by studying the material and non-material traditions of modern societies. Ethnoarchaeology also aids in the understanding of the way an object was made and the purpose of what it is being used for.&lt;ref name=paullane&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Paul|title=Barbarous Tribes and Unrewarding Gyration? The Changing Role of Ethnographic Imagination in African Archaeology|publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists can then infer that ancient societies used the same techniques as their modern counterparts given a similar set of environmental circumstances.

One good example of ethnoarchaeology is that of [[Brian Hayden]] (1987), whose team examined the manufacture of [[Mesoamerican]] [[quern-stone]]s, providing valuable insights into the manufacture of [[prehistoric]] quern-stones. Many other studies have focused on the manufacture and use of ceramics, architecture, food, fiber, and other types of material culture.  In the best cases, these studies have involved long term ethnographic fieldwork (for example, Herbich 1987, Kramer 1997, Deal 1998, Dietler &amp; Herbich 1998, Hinshaw 2000, Longacre &amp; Skibo 2000, Kohn 2010).

==Origins and development==
Although [[ethnography]] has long been used by archaeologists to draw analogies to the past, ethnographic data is not gathered with specifically archaeological goals in mind. Ethnoarchaeology developed as a response to the feeling among archaeologists that ethnography did not adequately answer their own specific research questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stiles|first1=Daniel|title=Ethnoarchaeology: A Discussion of Methods and Applications|journal=Man|date=1977|volume=12|issue=1|pages=87–89|jstor=2800996|doi=10.2307/2800996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American archaeologist [[Jesse Walter Fewkes]] first mentioned the "ethno-archaeologist" in 1900, and encouraged archaeologists to conduct their own ethnographic field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fewkes|first1=Jesse|title=Tusayan Migration Traditions|date=1901|publisher=Washington Government Printing Office|location=Washington|page=579|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924104075415|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread acceptance of ethnoarchaeology as a true subdiscipline of archaeology did not emerge until the late 1950s and 1960s, as archaeologists began to explore the different scientific applications it might have.
Ethnoarchaeology today has become a widely accepted research practice, with a few archaeologists even identifying as "ethnoarchaeologists" rather than simply "archaeologists." &lt;ref name="Kramer and David"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David|first1=Nicholas|last2=Kramer|first2=Carol|title=Ethnoarchaeology in action|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0521667798|pages=6–31|edition=Digitally repr., with corr.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogy==
Analogy in archaeology is, essentially, applying observed behavior to non-observed behavior. It is perhaps one of the most used research tools in archaeological interpretation. Analogies can best be drawn between those cultures who share similar environments. More importantly, these cultures must interact with their habitats in ways that are comparable to one another.&lt;ref name=ascher&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ascher|first1=Robert|title=Analogy in Archaeological Interpretation|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|date=Winter 1961|volume=17|issue=4|pages=317–325|jstor=3628943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to keep in mind that analogies can only provide clues and not sound, definitive answers to research questions. For this reason, G.S. McCall calls for a comparative view for analysis in his cross-cultural study of the Gamo and Konso of  southern and central Ethiopia, the Siberian Chukchi, highland New Guinea, highland Maya of Guatemala and Mexico, central, northern, and western arid regions of Australia, the Tjmba of northern Namibia, and the Xeta of Amazonia and their uses of lithics.&lt;ref&gt;McCall, G. S. (2012). Ethnoarchaeology and the organization of lithic technology. Journal of Archaeological Research, 20(2), 157-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal Analogies===
Formal analogies are made with the assumption that, as Paul Lane describes, "because two objects or contexts share a similar appearance or shape, they are likely to share other properties as well, typically that of function."&lt;ref name="paullane"/&gt; One of the major issues with this approach is that often these objects or contexts that initially appeared similar may have been used for very different purposes or served different functions. Perhaps the different objects were even created differently. In a 1971 study, Gould and his team compared working edge angle of Mousterain Quina scrapers and modern Western Desert Aboriginal scrapers and found the Mousterain angles to be steeper.  Gould reasoned this was due to the Western Desert Aborigines retouching the scrapers further than the Hominids of the Mousterian. Gould et al. concluded that this method of studying ethnographic tool use for comparison could be employed to determine what tools were used for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gould|first1=R. A.|last2=Koster|first2=D. A.|last3=Sontz|first3=H. L.|title=The Lithic Assemblage of the Western Desert Aborigines of Australia|journal=American Antiquity|date=1971|volume=36|issue=2|pages=149–169|doi=10.2307/278668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relational Analogies===
Relational analogies are opposite from formal analogies. Instead of just drawing the conclusions, one must prove the relationship, and both sides of the analogy are studied and a relationship must be demonstrated between the ethnographic object and the archaeological object.&lt;ref name="paullane"/&gt;

==Direct Historical Approach==
One popular method in ethnoarchaeology is the use of the [[direct historical approach]]. This approach relies on living cultures that may be closely genetically or spatially related to the archaeological culture of interest in order to form analogies that may be used to explain findings. Gould and his team explains how archaeologists should be able to measure the degree of differences between the tools found with the ethnographic material and the artifacts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gould|first1=Richard|last2=Koster|first2=Dorothy|last3=Sontz|first3=Ann|journal=American Antiquity|date=1971|volume=36|issue=2|pages=149–169|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/278668?uid=3739960&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104933076403|accessdate=October 10, 2014|doi=10.2307/278668|title=The Lithic Assemblage of the Western Desert Aborigines of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this technique may be useful it is important to note that it does not account for cultural change over time.&lt;ref name="paullane"/&gt; The "folk cultural approach" is the Old World equivalent to this and the term may be used in place of the [[direct historical approach]].&lt;ref name="ascher"/&gt;

==Issues==
[[Ethnography]] can provide insights of value to archaeologists into how people in the past may have lived, especially with regard to their social structures, religious beliefs and other aspects of their culture. However, it is still unclear how to relate most of the insights generated by this anthropological research to archaeological investigations. This is due to the lack of emphasis by anthropologists on the material remains created and discarded by societies and on how these material remains vary with differences in how a society is organised.

This general problem has led archaeologists (for example, London &lt;nowiki&gt;[2000]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to argue that [[anthropology|anthropological]] work is not adequate for answering archaeological problems, and that archaeologists should therefore undertake ethnoarchaeological work to answer these problems. These studies have focused far more on the manufacture, use and discard of tools and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and have sought to answer such questions as what kinds of objects used in a living settlement are deposited in [[midden]]s or other places where they may be preserved, and how likely an object is to be discarded near to the place where it was used.

Another issue often faced in ethnoarchaeology is the potential for a single archaeological situation to have multiple possible analogies drawn from it. A process of elimination must take place to narrow down all of the possibilities until the best solution can be discovered.&lt;ref name="ascher"/&gt;

A '''feu de joie''' (French: "fire of joy") is a form of formal [[celebratory gunfire]] consisting of a celebratory [[rifle]] salute, described as a "running fire of guns."  As soldiers fire into the air sequentially in rapid succession, the cascade of blank rounds produces a characteristic "rat-tat-tat" effect.

It is used on rare landmark occasions of national rejoicing.  During the 18th and 19th centuries, a feu de joie has celebrated a military victory or birthday. In recent years, it has marked, in Royal presence, the 80th Birthday and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], as well as the [[Royal Air Force]] Centenary.  Feux de joie also mark annual national or army days in, e.g., Canada, Malta, Nepal and Singapore.

== Historical precedents ==
=== Alliance with France: Valley Forge, 1778 ===
A spectacular feu de joie ran up and down double lines of infantrymen at [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], on 6 May 1778 to celebrate the alliance between the newly independent [[United States of America]] with [[Kingdom of France|France]].&lt;blockquote&gt;The men were placed in specified positions to fire a feu de joie with muskets and cannon—three times three discharges of thirteen cannon. At the first the army huzzaed, "Long live the [[King of France]]"; at the second, "Long live the friendly European powers"; and at the third there was a shout, "The American States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonofthesouth.net/revolutionary-war/battles/valley-forge.htm Valley Forge] description on Son of the South website.  Accessed 31 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Independence Day parade: 4 July 1778 ===
From his headquarters at [[Ross Hall]], General George Washington ordered a ''feu de joie'' to celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].
{{Quote|
Tomorrow, the Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence will be celebrated by the firing thirteen Pieces of Cannon and a ''feu de joie'' of the whole line; the Army will be formed on the [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|Brunswick]] side of the [[Raritan River|Rariton]] at five o'Clock in the afternoon on the ground pointed out by the Quarter Master General. The Soldiers are to adorn their Hats with ''Green-Boughs'' and to make the best appearance possible. The disposition will be given in the orders of tomorrow. Double allowance of rum will be served out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Washington|first1=George|title=General Orders|date=July 3, 1778|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28gw120183%29%29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A Dauphin is born: West Point, 1782 ===
In May 1782 a feu de joie at [[West Point]] celebrated the birth of the [[Dauphin of France]], and was witnessed by a Dr. Thacher.&lt;blockquote&gt;The arbor was, in the evening, illuminated by a vast number of lights, which, being arranged in regular and tasteful order, exhibited a scene vying in brilliancy with the starry firmament. The officers having rejoined their regiments, thirteen cannon were again fired as a prelude to the general feu-de-joie, which immediately succeeded throughout the whole line of the army on the surrounding hills, and being three times repeated, the mountains resounded and echoed like tremendous peals of thunder, and the flashing from thousands of firearms in the darkness of the evening, could be compared only to the most vivid flashes of lightning from the clouds. The feu-de-joie was immediately followed by three shouts of acclamation and benediction for the Dauphin by the united voices of the whole army on all sides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofw00bera/reminiscencesofw00bera_djvu.txt Thacher's Journal], quoted in ''Reminiscences of West Point in the Olden Time''.  Accessed 31 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same event was also recollected by Captain Eben Williams:&lt;blockquote&gt;At a given signal, a running fire began at the south end of the line and extended along the west side of the river to the north end, when the feu-de-joie was caught by the troops on the opposite side of the river and carried south. Thus did the rattle of musketry three times make its distant circuit along the Hudson . . . .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southcoastsar.org/feudejoie.htm#rec Recollections of Captain Eben Williams] from Sons of the American Revolution website.

=== British take Possession of Hong Kong 1841 ===
On Tuesday 26 January 1841, west of the centre of the north shore of Hong Kong Island, British sailors and Marines - under Commodore James John Gordon Bremer of HMS Calliope - went ashore to claim the island for Britain. They gave 'three cheers', drank their queen's health, raised the British flag and gave forth a feu de joie, on the spot that became known as 'Possession Point'. Today, the site is marked by Hollywood Road Park.

=== Empress of India proclamation: Delhi, 1877 ===
In his book ''The King's Shilling,'' Gordon Johnson Walker remembered how the feu-de-joie was incorporated into the annual ceremony held on the first day of every New Year when the reigning Monarch was proclaimed ‘[[Emperor of India]]’. This was known as the Proclamation Parade - "Each soldier had a blank cartridge, which, on the command, he would load into his rifle and fire a salute known as a 'feu-de-joie', which set the seal on the proceedings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar|title=BBC - WW2 People's War|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Victoria]]'s proclamation as [[Empress of India]] in [[Delhi]] on 1 January 1877 was followed by a feu de joie described by Field Marshal Lord Roberts.&lt;blockquote&gt;A salute of one hundred and one salvos of artillery was fired, with a feu-de-joie from the long line of troops. This was too much for the elephants. As the feu-de-joie approached nearer and nearer to them, they became more and more alarmed, and at last scampered off, dispersing the crowd in every direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/india/1877empressvictoria.asp Indian History Sourcebook] from Fordham University website.

==21st century==
===United Kingdom===
Feux de joie have marked occasions of national rejoicing.  These often take place on the Forecourt of [[Buckingham Palace]], in the presence of the Royal Family.

====Queen Elizabeth II 80th Birthday====
As part of [[Elizabeth II]]'s 80th birthday celebrations, a spectacular feu de joie occurred on the Forecourt of [[Buckingham Palace]] on 17 June 2006 following the RAF [[flypast]] after [[Trooping the Colour]]. (Although there was a feu de joie outside the Commonwealth buildings in [[Berlin]], 1953 to mark her coronation, this was the first feu de joie during Her Majesty's reign to be performed in her presence.)

A cascade of rounds was fired by the Old Guard, the New Guard and six Half Companies of Street-Liners in the Forecourt of the Palace.  The cascades of blank gunshots were interspersed with the National Anthem, ''[[God Save the Queen]]''.  After the feu de joie the troops on the Forecourt laid down their weapons, removed their headgear and gave "Three Cheers for Her Majesty The Queen".

====Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee====
On 5 June 2012 a weekend of celebrations for the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II#Extended weekend|Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] culminated in a feu de joie given at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18147354 Diamond Jubilee: Guide to the weekend of events] BBC News. Accessed 5 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed a Service of Thanksgiving at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], reception at [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], a luncheon given in her honour by [[Livery Company|the Livery]] at [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]], and a balcony appearance with [[flypast]] by the [[Red Arrows]] and historic aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18327711 Diamond Jubilee: flypast brings celebrations to an end] BBC News. Accessed 5 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; including the last flying [[Lancaster bomber]] in Britain.

====Royal Air Force Centenary:  "RAF 100"====
On 10th July 2018, this was officially celebrated with a service at [[Westminster Abbey]], attended by the Royal Family.  The Queen presented a new [[Military colours, standards and guidons#The Royal Air Force|Queen's Colour]] to the [[Royal Air Force]].  Then followed a historic [[flypast]] of 100 aircraft over [[Buckingham Palace]], watched by the Royal Family from the Palace balcony and an estimated 70,000 people on [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] and in surrounding streets and [[Royal Parks]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44775939 BBC news item, 10th July 2018], quoting the estimate given by the [[Metropolitan Police]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The celebrations culminated in several feux de joie fired on the Forecourt of the Palace, interspersed with sections of the National Anthem as on the Queen's 80th birthday.

===Canada===
The [[Royal Military College of Canada]] also performs a feu de joie on the annual graduation parade where the graduates are commissioned.  The feu de joie is performed with 500 C7 rifles on average.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Royal Military College of Canada Memorials#Traditions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Cadet Summer Training Centre Blackdown, as well as Cadet Summer Training Centre Vernon, cadets from the Alpha and Foxtrot Companies (Drill &amp; Ceremonial Instructor Course) perform a feu de joie in the camp's annual "Sunset Ceremony." This is performed with Lee–Enfield No.4 rifles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Malta===
The [[Armed Forces of Malta]] performs a feu de joie on [[Republic Day]].

===Nepal===
The [[Nepal Army]] performs a feu de joie as part of the Army Day celebrations that coincide with the [[Hindu]] festival of [[Mahashivaratri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekantipur.com/2015/02/17/top-story/na-observes-army-day-photo-feature/401814.html NA observes Army Day] eKantipur.com. Accessed 18 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The feu de joie is generally performed using the 1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR), a variant of the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]], manufactured in India.&lt;ref&gt;[[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle#India]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue of the celebrations is the Royal Nepal Army Pavilion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Ward+No.+31_46 Ward Profile: Ward No. 31] Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office. Accessed 18 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tundikhel]], a relatively large open space in the city center is the venue of the Army Day celebration and the events there in.

===Singapore===
The Guards-of-Honour (GOH) from the three [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) branches (the Army, the Navy and the Air Force), together with their counterparts from the [[Singapore Police Force]] (SPF), performs the feu-de-joie as a standard element of the country's [[National Day (Singapore)|National Day]] celebrations on the 9th of August every year. This is carried out before the GOH marches past the president's reviewing-stand out from the parade. The tradition began in the 1980 edition as a way to celebrate the first 15 years since Singapore's independence, and became a regular tradition starting 1989.

==Plot==

{{Main|List of Ga-Rei characters}}

Kensuke Nimura is just your average high school student—except for the fact that [[Extrasensory perception|he can see spirits]]. This ability generally hinders him more than it helps him, especially in trying to get a girlfriend. However, everything changes when he encounters Kagura Tsuchimiya while being pursued by evil spirits. They accidentally kiss and manage to destroy a source of energy drawing the evil spirits. A few days later, Kagura transfers into Kensuke's class, much to his surprise.&lt;ref name=v1_c01 /&gt; Kagura is an agent of a government agency that defends the public against supernatural enemies. She wields a ''Ga-rei'', a "spirit devourer," named Byakuei that she uses to fight. Kensuke's spiritual awareness and his attraction to Kagura compels him to follow her to the agency, where he is recruited to fight the supernatural.&lt;ref name="v1_c02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=v1_c03 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v1_c04 /&gt;

Their first enemy is Yomi Isayama, Kagura's best friend, now an evil spirit due to a stone known as a ''[[Kitsune|sesshouseki]]'' embedded in her forehead.&lt;ref name=v1_c04 /&gt;  Also introduced is another old friend, the perverted Izuna Noriyuki.&lt;ref name=v1_c04 /&gt; Yomi tries to release an ancient immortal demon sealed under Tokyo.&lt;ref name=v2_c05 /&gt; The Agency manage to stop her after a long battle, resealing the demon and putting Yomi to rest in the process. A mysterious boy removes her ''sesshouseki'' and disappears.&lt;ref name=v2_c06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v2_c07 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v2_c08 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v3_c09 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v3_c10 /&gt;

The next story arc concerns the re-emergence of the ''Juugondō'' organization and its heir, Shizuru Imawano. She encounters and alternatively threatens and flirts with Kensuke, angering Kagura.&lt;ref name=v3_c11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v3_c12 /&gt; Soon, a contest begins between her and Kagura as to who can collect more ''sesshōseki'', with Kensuke—and the ''Kyūbi-kitsune'' (or nine-tailed fox)—as the prize. The pressure is building as Kagura starts losing control of Byakuei and the ''Juugondō'' arrive in full force.&lt;ref name=v04_c13/&gt;&lt;ref name=v04_c14 /&gt; Shockingly, Shizuru's long-lost sister Setsuna arrives, kills her father and takes over the ''Juugondō''. She attacks and demolishes the Agency and the government try to distance themselves from the Agency for fear of revealing secrets to the public.&lt;ref name=v06_c27 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hajime 2005-2010"&gt;{{Citation|author=|last=Hajime|first=Segawa|year=2005–2010|title=The Enchained Spiritual Beast Ga-Rei|chapter=|type=|series=Ga-rei|volume=|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|publication-place=|language=Japanese|page=|pages=|id=|isbn=|url=|accessdate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kagura, Kensuke, Kyouko and Iwahata survive and meet Izuna and Shizuru at an agency hideout. After resting, the group faces off against Setsuna inside Tamamo-no-Mae's garden, with Kagura as the winner.&lt;ref name=v07_c28 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v07_c29 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v07_c30 /&gt; However, Kensuke was gravely injured in the battle, leading Kagura to use the power of the ''sesshōseki'' to save his life. As a result, she loses control and becomes the core of the newly created Kyūbi, destroying the center of Tokyo. Kensuke manages to reach the Kyūbi, using his new ''Michael Revolution'' sword to free Kagura.&lt;ref name=v07_c31 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v07_c32 /&gt;

Due to her brief time as the Kyūbi's core, Kagura has suffered amnesia, much to everyone's shock. She and Kensuke resume their daily lives at school, but start investigating ghosts alongside Kensuke, Tanaka, and Izumi, a new student who bears a resemblance to Yomi.&lt;ref name=v08_c33 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v08_c34 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v08_c35 /&gt; Investigations lead the group closer to ''Naraku'', the area in Tokyo destroyed by the Kyūbi and now filled with spirits. Kensuke later meets Mikado and Tsuina from the Agency. A few days later, Kensuke and Izumi are attacked by Kirin, a black wolflike monster from ''Naraku'', who cuts Kensuke's right eye.&lt;ref name=v08_c36 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v09_c37 /&gt; Izumi is later revealed to be Yomi, who has [[dissociative identity disorder]], alternating between Yomi and Izumi.&lt;ref name=v09_c40 /&gt; When the revived Agency imprisons Izumi with the intention of exorcising Yomi, which will likely kill Izumi as well, Kagura breaks her free and the two go on the run.&lt;ref name="Hajime 2005-2010"/&gt; Kagura resolves to defend Yomi, disregarding others' opinions. Fending evil spirits and eventually the escorts of the Black Priestess—Yomi—they are cornered on a snow-covered cliff. There, Kensuke and Tsuina arrive to save them, leading to Kagura completely regaining her memories.&lt;ref name="Hajime 2005-2010"/&gt; The ensuing ruckus causes the cliff to collapse, causing them to fall near Micheal Kohara's residence, where Izuna and Shizune find them unconscious.&lt;ref name="Hajime 2005-2010"/&gt;

After recovering, Kensuke and the others learn of Earth's impending destruction at the Black Priestess's (Yomi) hands and the White Priestess's (Kagura) potential to stop it.&lt;ref name="Hajime 2005-2010"/&gt; While everyone recuperates from resulting disbelief, government agents arrive to efface them: Izuna sacrifices himself for Yomi, relieving his guilt at allowing her previous deaths.&lt;ref name="Hajime 2005-2010"/&gt; She retreats with her retainers, mired in sorrow and her miasma, despite Kagura's pleas.&lt;ref name="Hajime 2005-2010"/&gt; After resurrecting Izuna with an escort's soul, Yomi arrives at Tokyo's Naraku, releasing all her miasma and disrupting the ''Reimyaku''. Consequently, this gives rise to Immortals and ''Naraku''s worldwide. Kagura, Micheal, Kensuke, Tsuina and Shizuru search for Yomi. Following clashes with the Tengu, Okama and a revived Kyūbi, they encounter Yomi and Izuna, now a corrupted soul like herself.  During the battle the Black Priestess's Black Kirin (opposing the White Priestess's Byakuei, together they are yin &amp; yang) breaks Byakuei's chains thus tearing apart both Byakuei and Kagura's souls. To save Kagura, Yomi melds with Kagura's soul after comprehending Kagura's devotion to her, as Byakuei dies.&lt;ref name=v12_c52 /&gt; Izuna subsequently vanishes. Two years later, after the miasma clears and society rebuilds itself, Yomi, Kyouko, Kensuke, Kagura, and Izuna, a free-floating ghost, continue exorcism duties and live together, per Kensuke's suggestion. Mikado finally proposes to Tsuina.&lt;ref name=v12_e /&gt;

==Terminology==

; ''[[Sessho-seki|Sesshōseki]]''
: A stone made by the crystallization of the [[Tamamo-no-Mae|Nine-Tailed Fox]]'s spiritual power when it was defeated hundreds of years ago. There are several spread all over the planet. As the power that they are made from is inherently evil, they tend to corrupt their user's minds and consume their bodies and minds, in return for limitless spirit power. Kagura possessed two in her earrings, while Kensuke had one (briefly) buried in his chest, near his heart. Kazuhiro appears to be their "keeper", as he gave one to Yomi and later took it away. They are the reason for Yomi's metamorphosis into an evil spirit and are extremely dangerous.

: A person who possesses ''sesshōseki'' will have advanced regenerative abilities and may even be able to slow his/her aging, as demonstrated by Kazuhiro.

;''Shikigami''
:Paper spirits used by Kyouko and other members of her family. They are made up of ''fuda'', pieces of paper with incantations on them and can be used in several different ways, such as making them into paper giants or barriers.

; Hōjitsu
: Spells, usually preceded by a lengthy [[Buddhist]] chant, that most spirit-users use to create a type of nature-related attack such as a lightning bolt. They are commonly used in conjunction with hand seals.

; {{nihongo|Jūgondō|呪禁道}}
: Taoist magic that was developed in the shadow of Onmyou and was later banned. Its practitioners were driven underground and reformed under the guise of a smuggling syndicate. They have since resurfaced. Shizuru and Setsuna are the daughters of the leader of Juugondo.

; Naraku
: An area of Miasma created from the Kyuubi attack in Tokyo. All living beings within became spirits, though they did not all become evil.

;Supernatural Disaster Countermeasures Division (SDCD)
:A government agency that fights the supernatural under the command of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of Environment]]. Formed after [[World War II]], the agency has experience with fighting the supernatural, thanks to some of its members who are experts in dealing with it. The Division includes members of exorcist families, like Tsuchimiya and Isayama. Despite having hired such talented people into their ranks, the SDCD suffers from low manpower and as such have hired mercenaries or independent exorcists to help them in work especially in tough cases.

;Paranormal Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters (PDCH)
:A special military unit under the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]]. The PDCH was formed to help the SDCD fight against the supernatural yet at the same time prevent the MoE and SDCD from gaining too much power. Unlike the SDCD, the PDCH lack experts who deal with the supernatural, which they make up for it with more manpower and the latest technology in their fights. Due to the actions of Yomi Isayama, the PDCH was almost destroyed and suffered heavy losses in their ranks. It is hinted the PDCH became part of the SDCD when the latter was revived.

''Ga-Rei: Zero'' is directed by Ei Aoki and animated by [[Anime International Company|AIC Spirits]] and [[asread]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga-rei.jp/staffcast/index.html|title=Official Ga-rei -Zero- Cast/Staff Page|accessdate=2008-10-14|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is aired on AT-X, Chiba TV, KBS Kyoto, Sun TV, Tokyo MX TV, TV Aichi, TV Hokkaido, TV Kanagawa, TV Saitama and TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting Co., Ltd.

The adaptation was announced on the promotional sleeve wrapper of ''Ga-rei'''s sixth volume regarding the green lighting of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-04-24/ga-rei-afterschool-spirit-hunting-manga-to-be-animated|title=Ga-Rei Afterschool Spirit-Hunting Manga to be Animated|accessdate=2008-10-14|date=2008-04-24|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Ga-Rei: Zero'' television ad was soon aired to promote the show's upcoming release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-29/ga-rei-zero-anime-tv-ad-posted-online-in-japan|title=Ga-Rei -Zero- Anime TV Ad Posted Online in Japan|date=2008-09-29|accessdate=2008-10-14|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by 30 second commercials that were on the ''Ga-Rei: Zero'' websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga-rei.jp/special/promo_tvcm01.html|title=の番組宣伝スポット映像(30秒VER)を公開中!|accessdate=2008-10-21|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga-rei.jp/new_special/|title=｢番組宣伝スポット映像(30秒VER)｣を公開!|accessdate=2008-10-21|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was announced that the anime would be an original story, suggesting that it had nothing to do with the manga except its setting: however, after the first episode aired, viewers were confused as the entire cast was suddenly killed off. It was only later revealed in the second episode and still later in a radio interview with cast members [[Minoru Shiraishi]], [[Kaoru Mizuhara]] &amp; [[Minori Chihara]], that the anime in fact tells the backstories of Yomi and Kagura before the events of the manga, thus making ''Ga-Rei: Zero'' a prequel to the original ''Ga-Rei'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lantis-net.com/ga-rei/ |title="Ga-Rei - zero -" super-natural disaster Radio Management Office |last= |first= |date=2008-11-08 |website= |publisher=Lantis |language=Japanese |script-title=ja:｢喰霊-零-｣超自然災害ラジオ対策室 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409073614/http://lantis-net.com/ga-rei/ |archive-date=2016-04-09 |accessdate=October 18, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilles''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒil}})—sometimes '''Gille'''—is a [[stock character]] of French [[farce]] and [[Commedia dell'Arte]].  He enjoyed his greatest vogue in 18th-century France, in entertainments both at the fairgrounds of the capital and in private and public theaters, though his origins can be traced back to the 17th century and, possibly, the century previous.  A ''[[zanni]]'', or comic servant, he is a type of bungling clown, stupid, credulous, and lewd—a character that shares little, problematically, with the sensitive figure in [[Watteau]]'s famous portrait that, until the latter half of the 20th century, bore his name alone.&lt;ref&gt;The art historian Pierre Rosenberg notes that, since 1952, "''Pierrot'' clearly has won over ''Gilles''" (p. 430) as the title of Watteau's painting, adding that François Moureau "has proved that Watteau most surely painted a ''Pierrot''" (p. 433).  Moureau's "proof", offered in an appendix to the collection in which Rosenberg's essay appears, rests upon the assumption that Gilles's costume remained invariant throughout his career, beginning with Gilles le Niais (though it is only conjecture—unmentioned by Moureau—that Gilles le Niais formed part of his pedigree): see Moureau's note 14 (p. 526).  Moureau is apparently unaware of the role that Nicolas Maillot played in the evolution of Gilles's character and costume (see [[#Gilles and Pierrot|Gilles and Pierrot]] below).&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilles fades from view in the 19th century, to persist in the 20th and 21st as the Belgian [[Gilles]] of [[Binche Carnival]].

==16th–17th centuries==

Gilles' origins are obscure.  There was a ''[[zanni]]'' Giglio in the Italian troupe of the academic ''Intronati'' as early as 1531, and some historians link him to Gilles.&lt;ref&gt;Doutrepont, II, 74; Mic, p. 33n; Duchartre, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  But no line of succession has been traced.  The French expression "''faire gilles''", meaning "to go bankrupt" or "to run away", dates from the 16th century, and some dictionaries find a source for both the name and the character in the phrase, since "the Gilles of the fair", by their authority, "is he who runs away when he is called."&lt;ref&gt;Doutrepont, II, 73; tr. Storey (1978), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most likely origin of the name and type is the 17th-century Gilles le Niais (Gilles the Simpleton), a character who may or may not have known multiple incarnations.  According to some lines in ''Les Véritables prétieuses'' (1660) by [[Antoine Baudeau de Somaize]], Gilles le Niais was the creation of a single actor, the Sieur de la Force, said to have descended from a venerable line of French ''farceurs'', most immediately from [[:fr:Guillot-Gorju|Guillot-Gorju]].&lt;ref&gt;Fournel, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  His small troupe performed, around 1646, farces that he himself composed, laced with songs that were popular among the idlers and ''[[flâneurs]]'' of the [[Pont-Neuf]].&lt;ref&gt;Fournel, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;  His name appears among several of the [[Mazarinade]]s following the uprising of the [[Fronde]]: ''Le Dialogue burlesque de Gilles le Niais et du capitan Spacamon'' (The Burlesque Dialogue between Gilles le Niais and Captain Spacamon, 1649), ''Les Entretiens sérieux de [[:fr:Jodelet|Jodelet]] et de Gilles le Niais, rétourné de Flandres, sur le temps présent'' (The Serious Discussions of Jodelet with Gilles le Niais, back from Flanders, on the Present Times, 1649), and ''Le Véritable Gilles le Niais, en vers burlesques'' (The Real Gilles le Niais, in Burlesque Verse, n.d.).&lt;ref&gt;Fournel, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

But this claim of single parentage is weakened by Victor Fournel's admission that Gilles le Niais could have been "a sobriquet of a type, applied to several personages".&lt;ref&gt;Fournel, p. 266; tr. Storey (1978), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  What seems most clearly beyond dispute is that the copiously documented appearances of Gilles the comic servant at the Parisian fairs of the 18th century, the [[Théâtre de la foire|Foires Saint-Germain and Saint-Laurent]], owed their origins to an actor-tumbler called Marc, who in 1697 first performed as Gilles at the popular Foire Saint-Germain.&lt;ref&gt;Campardon, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k108375m/f113.image II, 108].&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==

===At the fairgrounds===

Marc's Gilles was followed in quick succession at the fairs by Gilles of other actors and acrobats: the tumblers Benville and Drouin, in the same year as Marc's debut;&lt;ref&gt;[[François Parfaict|Parfaict]], I, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Crespin, called Gilles le Boiteux (Gilles the Gimp), "a performer of 'grace and lightness' despite the infirmity of his body", in 1701;&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), p. 76; "grace and lightness" is from Campardon, [https://archive.org/stream/lesspectaclesde00campgoog#page/n271/mode/2up I, 218].&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolas Maillot, "one of the best Gilles to appear at the Foire", in 1702;&lt;ref&gt;Parfaict and Abguerbe, III, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; and Génois, a grimacing rope-dancer in wooden clogs, in 1711.&lt;ref&gt;Parfaict and Abguerbe, III, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilles was sometimes given a major role in a "regular" comedy, such as ''La Conquête de la Toison d'or'' (The Conquest of the Golden Fleece, 1724) by [[Alain-René Lesage|Lesage]] and Dorneval.&lt;ref&gt;Described in Parfaict and Abguerbe, V, 479ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  But he could be found more commonly at the fairgrounds (as the citations above suggest) at the acrobatic venues and, rather more revealingly, in the entertainments known as ''[[Parade (French street entertainment)|parades]]''.  An outdoor performance, usually on a trestle-stage, that was contrived to lure spectators inside a theater, the ''parade'' was typically comprised, as William Driver Howarth notes, of five standard elements:
*A "send-up of the conventional Italian plot" in which two lovers are united, despite parental opposition, by the machinations of the so-called "first" ''[[zanni]]'', the cleverer of two comic servants.  (In the ''parade'', "the heroine is anything but a virtuous ''ingénue''", unlike her counterpart in conventional comedy.)
*"Disguises, verbal altercations and beatings", in which the "second" ''zanni'', the fool, usually feels the brunt of the mayhem.
*Dialogue "full of sexual innuendo and scatological reference."
*A spoofing of "popular Parisian speech, typified by the ubiquitous use of ''cuirs'' (irregular liaisons, and ... intrusive consonants ...),&lt;ref&gt;The "z" and "-t-" in the title of the one of the most popular ''parades'' of 1758, ''Gilles garçon peintre z'amoureux-t-et rival'', by Antoine Poinsinet, offer a typical illustration: see Storey (1978), pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[malapropism]]s, [[pleonasm]]s and other standard sources of verbal comedy."
*"[L]iterary [[parody]], [[mock-heroic]] and [[burlesque]] devices."&lt;ref name="Howarth, p. 106"&gt;Howarth, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus here is upon that fool who feels the brunt of the mayhem: he was almost invariably Gilles.  In 1756 a three-volume collection of ''parades'' was published anonymously as ''Théâtre des Boulevards'',&lt;ref&gt;According to the [https://archive.org/stream/thtredesboul01gueuuoft#page/n9/mode/2up "Notice"] by Georges d'Heylli (E.-A. Poinsot) in the one-volume reprint of 1881, most, if not all, of these pieces were written (or rewritten, or recorded: their status is ambiguous [see Pucci, p. 116]) by T.-S. Gueullette; four were the (again, ambiguous) work of Charles Collé.  (See the next section, [[#In the salons and private theaters|In the salons and private theaters]].)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r&amp;r"&gt;Barthélemy-Christophe Fagan laid claim to the authorship of ''Isabelle, Grosse par vertu'' (and gave it a date: 1738) by publishing it in volume IV of his ''Théâtre'' (1760) (as ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k82868x/f396.image.r=Gille Isabelle'']).&lt;/ref&gt; and in its pages Gilles acquires a distinct sharpness of outline.  Robert Storey traces it with trenchancy: "A character of more simplicity than sense and of less decency than either, Gilles inherits the ignoble side of the ''commedia'''s comic masks."&lt;ref name="Storey 1978, p. 79"&gt;Storey (1978), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  His inventiveness rarely exceeds the strategem of ''Isabelle, Grosse par vertu'' (Isabelle, Knocked-up by Virtue), in which he advises his mistress to enlarge her belly with a hidden tureen, thereby convincing the amorous Doctor that he has been beaten to the erotic prize.&lt;ref name="r&amp;r"/&gt;  When [[Arlequin]], the first ''zanni'' (and his superior in every way), tells him that shit is fetching high prices on the market, he produces a large batch of it and peddles it through the streets ("Who'd like some of my shit? ... it's nice and fresh"—''Le Marchand de Merde'': The Shit Merchant, scene X).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thtredesbouleva00corbgoog#page/n275/|title=Théâtre des boulevards, ou Recueil de parades|website=www.archive.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilles's appetites are, in one of his chroniclers' words, "prodigiously insatiable",&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), pp. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and his guardian spirits ("''Sainte Merde!''")&lt;ref&gt;''Léandre Fiacre'' (Hackney Léandre, [https://archive.org/stream/thtredesbouleva00corbgoog#page/n41/ Scene IX]).&lt;/ref&gt;  are always provocatively profane.  If his Italian predecessor, [[Pedrolino]], "often shares the ether with [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]]," as Storey writes, he himself "tumbles, with [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]]'s witless companions, among the cornflowers."&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the salons and private theaters===

Quite early in the century, the ''parade'' acquired the status of what Howarth calls a "cult entertainment" among the leisured classes.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas-Simon Gueullette]], a lawyer and "friend of letters, of theater, and of pleasure" (in the words of his biographer, J.-E. Gueullette),&lt;ref&gt;See Gueullette's entry in "References" below.&lt;/ref&gt; was so enamored of a ''parade'' he had seen one night around 1707 at the Foire Saint-Laurent that he and his friends performed it at a private soirée.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978) gives a detailed account: pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;  It proved such a success that Gueullette formed a theater society, built a playhouse at Auteuil, and began receiving "an astonishing concourse of spectators of the first rank" to laugh at the ribaldry of Gilles.&lt;ref&gt;J.-E. Gueullette, p. 63; tr. Storey (1978), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  After he established other theaters at Maisons and Choisy, the ''parade'' "very soon became ''à la mode''."&lt;ref name="Storey 1978, p. 79"/&gt;  Writers of ambition, such as [[Charles Collé]] and [[Barthélemy-Christophe Fagan]], seized upon the entertainment&lt;ref name="r&amp;r"/&gt; and soon "made it one of the favourite genres performed in the 'théâtres de société', or private playhouses, which were to blossom from about 1730 onwards in aristocratic ''châteaux'' and the townhouses of the capital."&lt;ref name="Howarth, p. 106"/&gt;  In the 1760s, the author of ''[[Le Mariage de Figaro]]'', [[Beaumarchais]], set himself to writing ''parades'', most of which were probably performed in the private theater of his friend and patron, [[Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d'Etiolles]], ex-husband of [[Madame de Pompadour]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in a piece like ''Les Bottes de sept lieues'' (The Seven-League Boots), the "least substantial" of Beaumarchais' ''parades'', Gilles gives ample evidence of that winning credulity that "makes him a ready victim for Arlequin's comic invention."&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the boulevard theaters===

Gilles acquired a kind of respectability toward the end of the century, when he was adopted by the [[Boulevard theatre (aesthetic)|boulevard theaters]] that catered to the predominantly middle-class.  We find his name among many of the comedies at the Théâtre de la Cité (1792–1807) and the Variétés Amusantes (1778–89, 1793–98).&lt;ref&gt;Lecomte (1908), pp. 81, 99, 102, 131, 145, 183, 267, and Lecomte (1910), pp. 22, 25, 46, 57, 95, 211, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilles and Pierrot===
[[File:Jean-Antoine Watteau - Pierrot, dit autrefois Gilles.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Watteau]]: ''Gilles (or Pierrot) and Four Other Characters of the Commedia dell'Arte'', c. 1718.  Musée du Louvre, Paris.]]

As the famous portrait by Watteau attests (see inset), Gilles and [[Pierrot]] were often confused during this century.  The scholar Ludovic Celler suggests that the actor Nicolas Maillot, who, as noted above, played Gilles from 1702, was responsible for the confusion: "at first," Celler writes, Maillot&lt;blockquote&gt;played the roles of Pierrot under the pseudonym of Gilles: since he was talented and successful, his ''nom de guerre'' served to designate the employ.  Hence was created the Gilles who took, as a result, a rather important place in the ''parades'' of the Boulevards and caused the French Pierrot to be almost completely forgotten ...&lt;ref&gt;Celler, [https://archive.org/stream/lestypespopulai00cellgoog#page/n142/mode/2up/search/Pierrot p. 120]; tr. Storey (1978), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Apparently, the confusion was abetted by the erosion of integrity of Pierrot's original character: Giuseppe Giaratone, who played Pierrot in the [[Comédie-Italienne]] of the previous century, had brought a rich and unifying consistency to the role.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), pp. 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt;  But as the Pierrots of the Foires began to multiply—among dancers, tumblers, and actors—and to accommodate themselves to the disparate Foire genres—puppet shows, comic operas, and every imaginable permutation of both mute and spoken theater—his character began inevitably to coarsen.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is therefore not surprising that Colombine should call Pierrot a "Gille" in [[Alexis Piron]]'s ''L'Ane d'Or'' (The Golden Ass, 1725) or that a police report detailing the suspicious goings-on in [[Alain-René Lesage|Lesage]]'s prologue to ''Arlequin, valet de Merlin'' (Harlequin, Merlin's Valet, 1718) should refer to Pierrot indiscriminately as "Pierrot" or as "Gilles".&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), p. 77, n. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  (It should also not be surprising that, when the illustrious Pierrot Hamoche was forbidden, in 1721, to play ''opéras-comiques'', impelling Lesage and Dorneval to lay his Pierrot to rest in ''Les Funérailles de la Foire'' [The Foire's Funeral, 1718], Gilles came bustling in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in their subsequent play, ''Le Rappel de la Foire à la Vie'' [The Recall of the Foire to Life, 1721], to take his double's place.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  As late as the second decade of the 19th century, we find Pierrot's name changing inexplicably to "Gilles" in the middle of the script of a pantomime performed at the [[Théâtre des Funambules]].)&lt;ref&gt;''Le Petit Poucet, ou Arlequin écuyer de l'ogre des montagnes'' (Tom Thumb; or Harlequin, Riding-Master of the Mountain Ogre, c. 1818): uncoded MS in the Collection Rondel ("Rec. des pantomimes jouées au Théâtre des Funambules et copiée par Henry Lecomte"), Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, Paris; cited in Storey (1985), p. 12, n. 30.  Storey (1985) notes that, in this era before [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau|Deburau]], "the early scripts [at the Théâtre des Funambules], employ the two types [i.e., Gilles and Pierrot] interchangeably": p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two characters were often so much alike as to be virtually indistinguishable.

As Francis Haskell has pointed out (and the remarks above imply), not only did Gilles "wear the same costume" as Pierrot, but both generally "had the same character" throughout the 18th century: Pierrot, like Gilles, "was a farcical creature, not a tragic or sensitive one".&lt;ref name="Haskell, p. 6"&gt;Haskell, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Pierrot will become tearful and incipiently tragic only in the middle of the 19th century, in the hands of [[Paul Legrand]].)&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1978), pp. 105–106, and Storey (1985), pp. 37–39, 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;  "It is", writes Haskell, "hard to resist the conclusion that the consumptive Watteau has invested the figure of Gilles with some degree of self-identification, and Mrs. [[Erwin Panofsky|[Erwin] Panofsky]] has also pointed out that on many other occasions when painting Pierrot figures Watteau not only gave them a predominance which was absolutely not justified by the nature of the parts they were called upon to act, but may even have hinted at something Christ-like in their role."&lt;ref name="Haskell, p. 6"/&gt;  As Haskell seems to be implying, there may be at least as much Watteau as either Gilles or Pierrot in the portrait.

==19th–21st centuries==

If it was Maillot who "caused the French Pierrot to be almost completely forgotten", it was the Pierrot of the great mime [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau|Deburau]] who turned the tables on Gilles in the early 19th century.  Partly because of Deburau's dominance in both the theatrical and literary imaginations of French enthusiasts of the Commedia dell'Arte,&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1985), especially pp. 3–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilles faded from view in that century, appearing occasionally in a [[vaudeville]] like ''Gilles en deuil de lui-même'' (Gilles in Mourning for Himself, 1847) at the Théâtre de la Rue de Chartres or a farce like [[Mélésville]]'s ''Les Deux Gilles'' (The Two Gilles, 1855) at the [[Folies-Nouvelles]].&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), pp. 121, n. 24, and 111.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the century, he makes a brief spectral appearance in [[Albert Giraud]]'s ''[[Pierrot lunaire (book)|Pierrot lunaire]]'' (overlooked in [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s selective immortalizing of that work).&lt;ref&gt;See the poem [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Pierrot_lunaire "Déconvenue"], translated at [[Pierrot lunaire (book)|Pierrot lunaire]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 20th century and later in the 21st, he survives most robustly at the [[Binche Carnival]] in Belgium—though a redoubtable student of that carnival&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Glotz, as cited in Harris, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; insists that its many [[Gilles]] share with the ''zanni'' of the French fairgrounds only one thing: his name.

'''Goalpara region''', largely congruous to the historical [[undivided Goalpara district]], is a [[Regions of Assam|region]] that is associated with the [[Goalpariya people|people]] and culture of Goalpara.&lt;ref&gt;"Although the old Goalpara district no longer exists,...,"Goalpara" still continues to designate in various contexts the region that almost exactly corresponds to the geographical area covered by the undivided district and at the same time stands for a distinct homogeneous cultural pattern." {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is bounded on the north by [[Bhutan]], on the east by the [[Kamrup region]], in the south by [[Meghalaya]] and in the west by Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri in West Bengal and Rangpur in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dutta|1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The natural landmarks are: [[Sankosh river|Sankosh]] and [[Brahmaputra river|Brahmaputra]] rivers on the west, the [[Manas river]] on the east in the north bank, and a corresponding region in the south bank; the [[Garo Hills]] in the south and Bhutan Hills in the north.

==History==
{{see|Kamarupa|Koch Hajo|Undivided Goalpara district}}
In ancient times, it was part of Ratnapith, a division of the [[Kamarupa kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Kamarupa Pithas]] are defined differently in different sources {{harv|Gait|1906|p=11}}.  Nevertheless, "whatever the alignment of the borders of these portions, the Ratnapith division of Old Kamarupa included the present Goalpara region" {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the fall of the Kamarupa dynasties Sandhya, a later Kamarupa king, moved his capital from Kamarupanagara (present-day [[Guwahati]]) to Kamatapur (near Cooch Behar town) in the middle of the 13th century, and established the [[Kamata kingdom]].  This situation prevailed till the time of Naranarayana, when it became a part of [[Koch Hajo]].  It was defined as an administrative unit for the first time in the 17th century when it was called ''Sarkar Dhekuri'' under the [[Bengal Subah]] of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dutta|1992|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the transfer of the Bengal ''Diwani'' to the [[East India Company]], the Goalpara region, minus the Assam Dooars, then under [[Bhutan]], came to be called Rangamatty, and after 1816, "Northeast Rangpur".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bannerjee|1992|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the British constituted this as a district in 1833 it came to be known after its headquarters which was in Goalpara town.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bannerjee|1992|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A portion of the Assam [[Dooars]] areas were added to this district after the [[Bhutan war]] of 1865.

==Peoples==
{{main|Goalpariya people}}
A majority of the people belong to the [[Rangpuri language|Rajbongshi]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/language/rkt&lt;/ref&gt; speaking [[Koch Rajbongshi people|Koch-Rajbongshi community]],&lt;ref&gt;Though two different names were used in the past, they refer to the same people {{harv|Dutta|1992|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who are converts from [[Mech]], [[Rabha]], [[Jalia Kaibarta|Keot/Kaibarta]] and [[Kachari (disambiguation)|Kachari]] communities in earlier times. [[Goalpariya dialect]] spoken here is a part of Rajbongshi which is a constituent of the [[Bengali-Assamese languages|Bengali-Assamese linguistic group]]. [[Assamese Brahmins]] and [[Kayastha]] communities are small, and even the [[Kalita (caste)|Kalitas]], who have a dominating presence in the adjoining [[Kamrup region]], are not as significant.&lt;ref name="dutta1992p10"&gt;{{harv|Dutta|1992|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bodo people|Bodos]] form a strong presence in the region.  Traditionally, they are called Kacharis in the south and in the rest of [[Assam]], but called Mech in the north bank of the [[Brahmaputra river]] and the whole of [[North Bengal]].&lt;ref name="dutta1992p10"/&gt;  Their strongest presence is in the present Kokrajhar district in the north bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dutta|1992|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rabha]]s, who along with the Bodos, are a semi-Hinduized group concentrated in the south bank.  The [[Garo people|Garos]] and the [[Hajong people|Hajong]]s too are not insignificant in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dutta|1992|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim population, which is not insignificant, a distinction is made between the local (''deshi'') communities that are descendants of early settlers, and non-local (''bhatiya'') who have immigrated in recent times from downstream East Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dutta|1992|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Heathen Gods in Old English Literature''''' is a historical study of the literary references for several [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan deities]] in [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. Written by the [[English studies]] scholar Richard North of [[University College London]], it was first published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 1997. The book was released as the twenty-second monograph in the Press' series, "Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England", edited by [[Simon Keynes]], Michael Lapidge and Andy Orchard. Prior to the book's publication, North had previously authored other studies of Anglo-Saxon paganism, such as ''Pagan Words and Christian Meanings'' (1991).

''Heathen Gods in Old English Literature'' details North's theory that the god [[Yngvi|Ing]] played a prominent role in the pre-Christian religion of Anglo-Saxon England, and highlights references to him in such texts as ''[[Beowulf]]'' and the sole surviving Anglo-Saxon copy of the ''[[Book of Exodus]]''.

The book received a mixed reviewed in peer reviewed journals such as ''[[The Modern Language Review]]''. Critics argued that North's interpretations of the evidence were too speculative.

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=April 2012}}
In the opening chapter, entitled "Nerthus and Terra Mater: Anglian religion in the first century", North begins by describing the approach that he has taken in this particular study of Anglo-Saxon paganism. Highlighting how little information regarding pre-Christian beliefs was recorded in the surviving [[Old English]] literature, all of which was produced in the Christian period, he argues that scholars must approach the subject by looking at the literary evidence produced by related Germanic-language societies elsewhere in Europe. He argues that by studying both the 1st-century accounts of [[Tacitus]] regarding religion in continental [[Germania]] and the Late Medieval accounts from [[Iceland]] and [[Scandinavia]], scholars can shed further light on lost aspects of Anglo-Saxon heathenism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nor97|North 1997]]. pp. 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter two, "Ingui of Bernicia" looks at the concept of an Anglo-Saxon god named Ing. He discusses the existence of the ''[[Ingvaeones]]'', a tribe in first-century Germania, arguing that they may have been devoted to Ing. Drawing comparisons from the cult of [[Dionysus]] in the Classical world, North argues that "''Ing-'' was first a functional term for a human embodiment of [[Nerthus]], then for a man representing Nerthus." Proceeding to discuss the role of the [[Vanir]] in Norse mythology, he deals with Ingvi-Freyr of [[Uppsala]] in Sweden and then Ingui of [[Bernicia]] in Northern England, ultimately concluding that in early Anglo-Saxon history, a deity named Ingui was believed to be the progenitor of Anglian kings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nor97|North 1997]]. pp. 26–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third chapter is entitled "Ingui's cult remembered: Ing and the ''ingefolc''" and deals with the literary evidence for a figure called Ing in Anglo-Saxon England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nor97|North 1997]]. pp. 44–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Ing-===
North spends much of his book devoted to the argument that there was a god known as ''Ing'' in Anglo-Saxon England. He highlights the fact that this ''Ing''-[[hypostasis (linguistics)|hypostasis]] appears in various different contexts within Germanic-speaking Europe; it appears in the name of the [[Ingvaeones]], a tribal grouping referred to in [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', while in the later records of [[Norse mythology]], the son of the god [[Njord|Njǫrð]] is known as [[Freyr|Ignvi-freyr]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nor97|North 1997]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an examination of Tacitus' account, North argues that the Ingvaeone tribe would have worshiped the deity [[Nerthus]], whom Tacitus described as an earth goddess. Although Tacitus never explicitly stated that the Ingvaeone worshiped Nerthus, North considers it likely because they lived ''proximi Oceano'', near the sea, while Tacitus located the temple of Nerthus ''in insula Oceani'', within the land of the [[Suebi]] tribe; North believes that these are sufficiently close to one another that they would have worshiped the same deity.&lt;ref name="North 1997 27"&gt;[[#Nor97|North 1997]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; North translates "Ingvaeone" as meaning "friends of Ing-".&lt;ref name="North 1997 27"/&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===
North's work was reviewed by T.A. Shippey of [[Saint Louis University]] for ''[[The Modern Language Review]]''. Taking a critical approach to the book, Shippey was of the opinion that the author's arguments relied "very heavily on assumptions about the precise (one might say [[gnostic]]) meanings of sometimes rather common words." He argues that many will not accept some of North's "more complex arguments" and that North's interpretation of ''Deor'', 11. 14-6, via ''Hdvamdl'', stanzas 96-102  as a political satire on 
[[Æthelwulf of Wessex]] was "especially strained". However, on a more positive note Shippey accepted the "intrinsic plausibility" of North's presentation of Anglo-Saxon paganism as a "natural religion" which posed little threat or opposition to the incoming Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shi00|Shippey 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider influence===
In his book, ''The Elder Gods: The Otherworld of Early England'' (2011), the English Anglo-Saxonist [[Stephen Pollington]] noted that North's book had been criticised for being "too free" in the interpretation of sources, but felt that it nonetheless "relieved the researcher from the emasculating fear of making an assumption or two and testing them against the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol11|Pollington 2011]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11107">'''Hierotopy''' (from {{lang-grc|ἱερός}}, sacred + {{lang-grc|τόπος}}, place, space) is the creation of [[sacred]] spaces viewed as a special form of human creativity and also a related academic field where specific examples of such creativity are studied. The concept and the term were developed in 2002  by [[Russia]]n art-historian and [[Byzantinism|byzantinist]] [[Alexei Lidov]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy. The creation of sacred spaces as a form of creativity and subject of cultural history" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A.Lidov, Moscow: Progress-Tradition, 2006, pp. 32-58&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopy accounts for the ways in which a vast array of media (e.g. religious [[image]]s, [[ritual]], [[song]], [[incense]], [[light]]) are used to organize sacred spaces. As an academic field, it spans the disciplines of [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnology]] and [[religious studies]], but it possesses an object of study and a methodology of its own. It differs from the phenomenology of the sacred (which has been studied by [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[Pavel Florensky]]) insofar as it focuses on historical examples of hierotopic projects, that is, projects establishing a medium of communication between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. Though related with religious [[mysticism]], hierotopy deals first and foremost with forms of conscious, creative activity. 

According to the hierotopic approach, [[icon]]s and other sacred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are viewed not as isolated objects, but as components of larger hierotopic projects. Though such artifacts often play a prominent role in hierotopic studies, it is these projects themselves – including both their conceptual and artistic aspects, as well as the historical developments leading to their formation – that are the primary focus of study. The role played by the creators of sacred spaces is also of chief importance, and could be compared with that of an artist. The creative element at work here resembles the work of contemporary film directors, for both involve the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176&lt;/ref&gt; As examples of hierotopic projects, one can consider [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], the erection of [[Hagia Sophia]] by [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]], as well as the work of [[Abbot Suger]] in the conception of first [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Hierotopic projects are not limited to churches and sanctuaries; in other cases, landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Tsuji. "Creating an Iconic Space. The Transformation of Narrative Landscape" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 627-642&lt;/ref&gt; architectural compounds &lt;ref&gt;G. Zelenskaya. "New Jerusalem near Moscow. Aspects of the Conception and New Discoveries" in: ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 745-773&lt;/ref&gt; and even cities&lt;ref&gt;E. Kirichenko. "The Church and the City: on the Symbolic and Structural Unity of the Russian Sacred Space" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 292-322&lt;/ref&gt; and countries&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Петрухин, Владимир Яковлевич|V. Petrukhin]]. "Hierotopy of the Russian Land and the Primary Chronicle" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow, 2006, pp. 480-490&lt;/ref&gt; have become products of hierotopic creativity. 

The topics of hierotopic study cover a broad span of interests and range, for example, from the role played by light in church architecture &lt;ref&gt;A. Godovanets. "The Icon of Light in the Architectural Space of Hagia Sophia" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 119-142&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of religious ceremonies, feasts&lt;ref&gt;L. Beliaev. "The Hierotopy of the Orthodox Feast: on the National Traditions in the Making of Sacred Spaces" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 270-291&lt;/ref&gt; and folk customs.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moroz. "Sacred and Horrible Places. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Traditional Culture" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 259-269&lt;/ref&gt;  The comparison of hierotopic models at work in different cultures is another focus of interest.&lt;ref&gt;N. Isar. "Vision and Performance. A Hierotopic Approach to Contemporary Art", in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 341-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Chegodaev. "The Hierotopy of the Ancient Egyptian Sarcophagus" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 18-37&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six international [[symposium|symposia]] (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017) have been organized on hierotopic subjects.

== Spatial icons ==
The concept of the ''[[spatial icon]]'' plays a central role in  hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are understood to play a mediating role between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. They are mediatory images that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009, Ch. 2. Spatial Icons. The miraculous performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople. pp. 39-70, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopic creativity is a sort of art, which can be described as the creation of spatial icons. This concept applies to the way in which the perception of architecture, light, image, ritual practice, as well as various other components forming sacred spaces, is unified into a single vision. It is also used in the study both of "sacred landscapes", such as the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] near [[Moscow]], as well as of various ritual practices creating iconic medium, such as the [[Donkey walk]] in [[medieval]] Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp.533-562&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial icons are essentially dynamic and performative in nature, such that the formal boundary between ‘image’ and ‘beholder’ no longer pertains. Typically, the beholders of spatial icons are actively involved in some way and become, to a certain extent, co-creators of the icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of sacred spaces ==
The transfer of sacred spaces is an important form of hierotopic creativity. While an original sacred space often appears as the result of a [[theophany]], such as a divine visitation or omen, this  primary sacred space is then consciously reproduced in [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] or [[temple]]s as a spatial icon. For example, the construction of the [[First Temple]], as recounted in the [[Old Testament]], can be viewed as the reproduction of the sacred space of the [[Tabernacle]]. Similarly, in the design and construction of many Christian churches, the First Temple itself has been taken as a hierotopic prototype.  Multiple "New Jerusalems" (reproductions of the Holy City of [[Jerusalem]]), aimed to establish a link to the space of the [[Holy Land]], are common both to the Eastern and Western branches of the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image-paradigms ==
The perception of sacred spaces has been analyzed by Lidov in terms of ''image-paradigms''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-paradigms as a category of visual culture. Hierotopic approach to the art history", ''Russian Journal of Art History(Iskusstvoznanie)'', 2011, No 3-4, pp.109-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-Paradigms as a Notion of Mediterranean Visual Culture: a Hierotopic Approach to Art History" in ''Crossing Cultures. Papers of  the International Congress of Art History. CIHA-2008'', Melbourne, 2009, pp.177-183&lt;/ref&gt; According to his conception, an image-paradigm is a guiding image-vision that is created with the help of various media and that is aimed at evoking the same image in the mind of beholders of a sacred space. An image-paradigm, which is essentially different from an illustrative picture or representation, is a means of communication between the creators of sacred spaces and their beholders. It constitutes a kernel of meaning that gives form to an entire hierotopic project. As an example, the image of the [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], which was present in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] churches without being directly represented, is one of the most significant image-paradigms in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009.  Ch. 10, Image-Paradigms as a New Notion of Visual Culture, pp. 293-305, 335-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Kessler. "Seeing Medieval Art", Broadview Press, 2004, ch.5, Church, pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hungarian language}}

The [[phonology]] of the [[Hungarian language]] is notable for its process of [[vowel harmony]], the frequent occurrence of [[Gemination|geminate consonants]] and the presence of otherwise uncommon [[Palatal consonant|palatal stops]].

== Consonants ==
This is the Hungarian consonantal system, using symbols from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA).

*{{note|pal|*}} It is debated whether the palatal consonant pair consists of stops or affricates.&lt;ref name="gosy"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gósy|2004|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered affricates by Tamás Szende,&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Szende|1994|p=91"/&gt; head of the department of General Linguistics at [[PPKE]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyelveszet.btk.ppke.hu/Tanar/szende.html Szende]&lt;/ref&gt; and stops by Mária Gósy,&lt;ref name="gosy"/&gt; research professor, head of the Department of Phonetics at [[ELTE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytud.hu/oszt/fonetika/gosy/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the different analyses is that the relative duration of the friction of {{IPAslink|c}} (as compared to the duration of its closure) is longer than those of the stops, but shorter than those of the affricates. {{IPA|/c/}} has the stop-like nature of having a full duration no longer than those of other (voiceless) stops such as {{IPA|/{{IPAlink|p}}, {{IPAlink|t}}, {{IPAlink|k}}/}} but, considering the average closure time in relation to the friction time of the consonants, its duration structure is somewhat closer to those of the affricates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gósy|2004|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every consonant may be [[Consonant length|geminated]], written by doubling a single letter grapheme: {{angbr|bb}} for {{IPA|[bː]}}, {{angbr|pp}} for {{IPA|[pː]}}, {{angbr|ss}} for {{IPA|[ʃː]}} etc., or by doubling the first letter of a grapheme cluster: {{angbr|ssz}} for {{IPA|[sː]}}, {{angbr|nny}} for {{IPA|[ɲː]}}, etc.

The phonemes {{IPAslink|d͡z}} and {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}} can appear on the surface as geminates: ''bridzs'' {{IPA|[brid͡ʒː]}} ('[[Bridge (game)|bridge]]'). (For the list of examples and exceptions, see [[Hungarian dz]] and [[Hungarian dzs|dzs]].)

[[Hungarian orthography]], unlike that of the surrounding Slavic languages, does not use ''[[caron|háčky]]'' or any other consonant diacritics. Instead, the letters ''c, s, z'' are used alone ({{IPAslink|t͡s}}, {{IPAslink|ʃ}}, {{IPAslink|z}}) or combined in the digraphs ''[[cs (digraph)|cs]], [[sz (digraph)|sz]], [[zs (digraph)|zs]]'' ({{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}}, {{IPAslink|s}}, {{IPAslink|ʒ}}), while ''y'' is used only in the digraphs ''ty, gy, ly, [[ny (digraph)|ny]]'' as a palatalization marker to write the sounds {{IPAslink|c͡ç}}, {{IPAslink|ɟ͡ʝ}}, {{IPAslink|j}} (formerly {{IPAslink|ʎ}}), {{IPAslink|ɲ}}.

The most distinctive [[allophone]]s are:

*{{IPA|/h/}} becomes {{IPA|[xː]}} when geminated, in certain words: ''dohhal'' {{IPA|[ˈdoxːɒl]}} ('with blight'), ''peches'' {{IPA|[ˈpɛxːɛʃ]}} ('unlucky').

==Vowels==
[[Image:Hungarian vowel chart with rounded short a.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|right|The vowel phonemes of Hungarian&lt;ref name="szende92"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Szende|1994|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Hungarian has seven pairs of corresponding [[short vowel|short]] and [[long vowel]]s. Their ''phonetic'' values do not exactly match up with each other, so {{angbr|e}} represents {{IPAslink|ɛ}} and {{angbr|é}} represents {{IPAslink|eː}}; likewise, {{angbr|a}} represents {{IPAslink|ɒ}} while {{angbr|á}} represents {{IPAslink|aː}}.&lt;ref&gt;Short a is slightly rounded {{IPAblink|ɒ}} in the standard language, though some dialects exhibit an unrounded version closer to {{IPAblink|ɑ}} ({{Harvcoltxt|Vago|1980|p=1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; For the other pairs, the short vowels are slightly lower and more central, and the long vowels more peripheral:
* {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} are phonetically near-close {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʏ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}}.&lt;ref name="szende92"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/eː/}} has been variously described as close-mid {{IPAblink|eː}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kráľ|1988|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mid {{IPAblink|e̞ː}}.&lt;ref name="szende92"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and the marginal {{IPA|/ɛː/}} are phonetically near-open {{IPA|[{{IPA link|æ}}, {{IPA link|æː}}]}},&lt;ref name="szende92"/&gt; but they may be somewhat less open {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ}}, {{IPA link|ɛː}}]}} in other dialects.
* {{IPA|/ø/}} is phonetically mid {{IPAblink|ø̞}}.&lt;ref name="szende92"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/aː/}} and the marginal {{IPA|/a/}} are phonetically open central {{IPA|[{{IPA link|äː}}, {{IPA link|ä}}]}}.&lt;ref name="szende92"/&gt;

The sound marked by {{angbr|a}} is considered to be {{IPAblink|ɒ}} by Tamás Szende&lt;ref name="Szende"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Szende|1994|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPAblink|ɔ}} by Mária Gósy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gósy|2004|pp=62, 67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gósy also mentions a different short {{IPAslink|a}} that contrasts with both {{IPA|/aː/}} and  {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, present in a few words like ''Sv'''á'''jc'' ('Switzerland'), ''sv'''á''''' ('[[schwa]]'), '''''a'''dvent'' ('[[advent]]'), ''h'''a'''rdver'' ('[[computer hardware|hardware]]', this usage is considered [[hyperforeign]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gósy|2004|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''h'''a'''lló'' (used when [[Hello#Telephone|answering the phone]]; contrasting with ''haló'' 'dying', and ''háló'' 'web').

There are two more marginal sounds, namely the long {{IPAslink|ɛː}} as well as the long {{IPAslink|ɒː}}. They are used in the name of the letters ''E'' and ''A'', which are pronounced {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/ɒː/}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="szende93"/&gt;

Although not found in [[Budapest]], some dialects contrast three mid vowels  {{IPAslink|e}} (written {{angbr|ë}} in some works, but not in the standard orthography), {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and {{IPA|/eː/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Vago|1980|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''mentek'' could represent four different words: ''mëntëk'' {{IPA|[ˈmentek]}} ('you all go'), ''mëntek'' {{IPA|[ˈmentɛk]}} ('they went'), ''mentëk'' {{IPA|[ˈmɛntek]}} ('I save'), and ''mentek'' {{IPA|[ˈmɛntɛk]}} ('they are exempt'). In Budapest, the first three collapse to {{IPA|[ˈmɛntɛk]}}, while the latter one is unknown, having a different form in the literary language (''mentesek'').

==Vowel harmony==

[[File:HungarianVowelHarmony.png|thumb|A [[Venn diagram]] of Hungarian [[vowel harmony]], featuring front rounded vowels, front unrounded vowels ("neutral" vowels), and back vowels.]]

As in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[vowel harmony]] plays an important part in determining the distribution of vowels in a word. Hungarian vowel harmony classifies the vowels according to front vs. back assonance and rounded vs unrounded for the front vowels.&lt;ref name="Rounds 2001 10"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rounds|2001|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding recent [[loanword]]s, Hungarian words have either only back vowels or front vowels due to these vowel harmony rules.&lt;ref name="Rounds 2001 10"/&gt;

While {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and {{IPA|/eː/}} are all front unrounded vowels, they are considered to be "neutral vowels" in Hungarian vowel harmony.&lt;ref name="Rounds 2001 11"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rounds|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if a word contains back vowels, neutral vowels may appear alongside them. However, if only neutral vowels appear in a stem, the stem is treated as though it is of front vowel assonance and all suffixes must contain front vowels.&lt;ref name="Rounds 2001 10"/&gt;

Vowel harmony in Hungarian is most notable when observing suffixation. Vowel harmony must be maintained throughout the entire word, meaning that most suffixes have variants. For example, the dative case marker {{IPA|[nɒk]}} vs. {{IPA|[nɛk]}}. Stems that contain back vowels affix back vowel suffixes, and stems that contain only front vowels affix front vowel suffixes.&lt;ref name="Rounds 2001 10"/&gt; However, the front vowel stems distinguish rounded vs. unroundedness based on the last vowel in the stem. If the last vowel is front and rounded, it takes a suffix with a front rounded vowel; otherwise it follows the standard rules.&lt;ref name="Rounds 2001 11"/&gt; While suffixes for most words have front/back vowel variants, there are not many that have rounded/unrounded variants, indicating that this is a rarer occurrence.&lt;ref name="Rounds 2001 11"/&gt;

One is able to observe the distinction when looking at the plural affix, either {{IPA|[-ok]}} (back), {{IPA|[-ɛk]}} (front unrounded), or {{IPA|[-øk]}} (front rounded).

As can be seen above, the neutral vowels are able to be in both front and back vowel assonance words with no consequence.

However, there are about fifty monosyllabic roots that only contain {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[iː]}}, or {{IPA|[eː]}} that all take a back vowel suffix instead of the front vowel suffix.&lt;ref name="Vago 1976 244"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Vago|1976|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These exceptions to the rule are hypothesized to have originated from the roots originally having contained a phoneme no longer present in modern Hungarian, the unrounded back vowel {{IPAslink|ɨ}}, or its long counterpart {{IPA|/ɨː/}}. It is theorized that while these vowels merged with {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/iː/}}, less commonly {{IPA|/eː/}} or {{IPA|/uː/}}, the vowel harmony rules sensitive to the backness of the original sound remained in place.&lt;ref name="Vago 1976 244"/&gt; The theory finds support from etymology: related words in other languages generally have back vowels, often specifically unrounded back vowels. For example, ''nyíl'' 'arrow' (plural ''nyíl-ak'') corresponds to [[Komi language|Komi]] ньыл {{IPA|/nʲɨl/}}, Southern [[Mansi language|Mansi]] {{IPA|/nʲʌːl/}}.

==Assimilation==
The overall characteristics of the consonant [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] in Hungarian are the following:&lt;ref name="PHG"&gt;Miklós Törkenczy: Practical Hungarian Grammar. A compact guide to the basics of Hungarian Grammar. Corvina, 2002. pp. 9-12. {{ISBN|963-13-5131-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AkH11"&gt;A magyar helyesírás szabályai. 11.kiadás, 12. lenyomat. Akadémiai Kiadó, 1984-2000. pp. 26-30. {{ISBN|963-05-7735-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Assimilation types are typically regressive, that is the last element of the cluster determines the change.
* In most cases, it works across word boundaries if the sequence of words form an "accentual unity", that is there is no phonetic break between them (and they bear a common phase stress). Typical accentual units are:
** attributes and qualified nouns, e.g. ''hide'''g t'''él'' {{IPA|[hidɛk‿teːl]}} ('cold winter');
** adverbs and qualified attributes, e.g. ''nagyo'''n k'''áros'' {{IPA|[nɒɟoŋ‿kaːroʃ]}} ~ {{IPA|[nɒɟon‿kaːroʃ]}} ('very harmful');
** verbs and their complements, e.g. ''nagyo'''t d'''ob'' {{IPA|[nɒɟod‿dob]}} ('s/he throws long toss'), ''ve'''sz b'''előle'' {{IPA|[vɛz‿bɛløːlɛ]}} ('take some [of it]').
* There are obligatory, optional and stigmatized types of assimilation.
* The palatal affricates behave like stops in assimilation processes. Therefore,  in this section, they will be treated as stops, including their IPA notations {{IPAblink|ɟ}} and {{IPAblink|c}}.

===Voice assimilation===
In a cluster of consonants ending in an obstruent, all obstruents change their voicing according to the last one of the sequence. The affected obstruents are the following:

*In obstruent clusters, retrograde voicing assimilation occurs, even across word boundaries:&lt;ref name="Vago 1980 35"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Vago|1980|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{ref|v}} {{IPAslink|v}} is unusual in that it undergoes assimilation but does not cause voicing,&lt;ref name="Vago 1980 35"/&gt; e.g. ''ha'''tv'''an'' ('sixty') is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈhɒ'''t'''vɒn]}} not {{IPA|*[ˈhɒ'''d'''vɒn]}}. Voicing before {{IPA|[v]}} occurs only in south-western dialects, though it is stigmatized.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* Similarly, {{IPAslink|h}} causes devoicing, but never undergoes voicing in consonant clusters.&lt;ref name="Vago 1980 35"/&gt; e.g. ''do'''hb'''ól'' {{IPA|[ˈdoxboːl]}} 'from (the) musty smell'.
* Other than a few foreign words, morpheme-initial {{IPAslink|d͡z}} doesn't occur (even its phonemic state is highly debated), therefore it is hard to find a real example when it induces voicing (even ''alapdzadzíki'' is forced and not used colloquially). However, the regressive voice assimilation before {{IPA|/d͡z/}} does occur even in nonsense sound sequences.

===Nasal place assimilation===
Nasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the following consonant (even across word boundaries):&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Vago|1980|pp=33, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* only {{IPAblink|ŋ}} precedes a [[velar consonant]] (e.g. ''hang'' {{IPA|[hɒŋɡ]}}, 'voice'), {{IPAblink|ɱ}} precedes a [[labiodental consonant]] (e.g. ''hamvad'' {{IPA|[ˈhɒɱvɒd]}}, 'smoulder'), and {{IPAblink|m}} precedes [[bilabial consonant]]s.
** {{IPAblink|m}} before [[labial consonant]]s {{IPA|/p b m/}}:  ''szí'''np'''ad'' {{IPA|[ˈsiːmpɒd]}} ('stage'), ''külö'''nb''''' {{IPA|[ˈkylømb]}} ('better than'), ''é'''nm'''agam'' {{IPA|[ˈeːmːɒɡɒm]}} ('myself');
** {{IPAblink|ɱ}} before [[labiodental consonant]]s {{IPA|/f v/}}: ''külö'''nf'''éle'' {{IPA|[ˈkyløɱfeːlɛ]}} ('various'), ''ha'''mv'''as'' {{IPA|[ˈhɒɱvɒʃ]}} ('bloomy');
** {{IPAblink|ɲ}} before [[palatal consonant]]s {{IPA|/c͡ç ɟ͡ʝ ɲ/}}: ''pi'''nty''''' {{IPA|[piɲc]}} ('finch'), ''á'''ngy''''' {{IPA|[aːɲɟ]}} ('wife of a close male relative'), ''magá'''nny'''omozó'' {{IPA|[ˈmɒɡaːɲːomozoː]}} ('private detective');

* Nasal place assimilation is obligatory within the word, but optional across a word or compound boundary,{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} e.g. ''szé'''np'''or'' {{IPA|[ˈseːmpor]}} ~ {{IPA|[ˈseːnpor]}} ('coal-dust'), ''nagyo'''n k'''áros'' {{IPA|[ˈnɒɟoŋ‿ˈkaːroʃ]}} ~ {{IPA|[ˈnɒɟon‿ˈkaːroʃ]}} ('very harmful'), ''olya'''n m'''ás'' {{IPA|[ˈojɒm‿ˈmaːʃ]}} ~ {{IPA|[ˈojɒn‿ˈmaːʃ]}} ('so different').
&lt;!-- Shouldn't ''könyv'' be pronounced as [køɱv] according to the rules above? --&gt;

===Sibilant assimilation===
* Voiceless sibilants form a voiceless geminate affricate with preceding alveolar and palatal stops (''d'' {{IPAslink|d}}, ''gy'' {{IPAslink|ɟ}}, ''t'' {{IPAslink|t}}, ''ty'' {{IPAslink|c}}):
** Clusters ending in ''sz'' {{IPAslink|s}} or ''c'' {{IPAslink|t͡s}} give {{IPA|[t͡sː]}}: ''me'''tsz'''et'' {{IPA|[mɛt͡sːɛt]}} 'engraving, segment', ''ötö'''dsz'''ör'' {{IPA|[øtøt͡sːør]}} 'for the fifth time', ''né'''gysz'''er'' {{IPA|[neːt͡sːɛr]}} 'four times', ''fü'''ttysz'''ó'' {{IPA|[fyt͡sːoː]}} 'whistle (as a signal)'; ''á'''tc'''ipel'' {{IPA|[aːt͡sːipɛl]}} 's/he lugs (something) over', ''ná'''dc'''ukor'' {{IPA|[naːt͡sːukor]}} 'cane-sugar'.
** Clusters ending in ''s'' {{IPAslink|ʃ}} or ''cs'' {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}} give {{IPA|[t͡ʃː]}}: ''ké'''ts'''ég'' {{IPA|[keːt͡ʃːeːɡ]}} 'doubt', ''fára'''ds'''ág'' {{IPA|[faːrɒt͡ʃːsaːɡ]}} 'trouble', ''e'''gys'''ég'' {{IPA|[ɛt͡ʃːeːɡ]}} 'unity', ''he'''gycs'''úcs'' {{IPA|[hɛt͡ʃːuːt͡ʃ]}} 'mountain-top'.
* Two sibilant fricatives form a geminate sibilant fricative; the assimilation is regressive as usual:
** ''sz'' {{IPAslink|s}} or ''z'' {{IPAslink|z}} + ''s'' {{IPAslink|ʃ}} gives {{IPA|[ʃː]}}: ''egé'''szs'''ég'' {{IPA|[ɛɡeːʃːeːɡ]}} 'health', ''kö'''zs'''ég'' {{IPA|[køʃːeːɡ]}} 'village, community';
** ''sz'' {{IPAslink|s}} or ''z'' {{IPAslink|z}} + ''zs'' {{IPAslink|ʒ}} gives {{IPA|[ʒː]}}: ''vadá'''szzs'''ákmány'' {{IPA|[vɒdaːʒːaːkmaːɲ]}} 'hunter's game'; ''szára'''z zs'''ömle'' {{IPA|[saːrɒʒ‿ʒømlɛ]}} 'dry bread roll';
** ''s'' {{IPAslink|ʃ}} or ''zs'' {{IPAslink|ʒ}} + ''sz'' {{IPAslink|s}} gives {{IPA|[sː]}}: ''ki'''ssz'''erű'' {{IPA|[kisːɛryː]}} 'petty', ''ro'''zssz'''alma'' {{IPA|[rosːɒlmɒ]}} 'rye straw';
** ''s'' {{IPAslink|ʃ}} or ''zs'' {{IPAslink|ʒ}} + ''z'' {{IPAslink|z}} gives {{IPA|[zː]}}: ''tilo'''s z'''óna'' {{IPA|[tiloz‿zoːnɒ]}} 'restricted zone', ''pará'''zs z'''ene'' {{IPA|[pɒraːz‿zɛnɛ]}} 'hot music'.
** Clusters ''zs+s'' {{IPA|[ʃː]}}, ''s+zs'' {{IPA|[ʒː]}}, ''z+sz'' {{IPA|[sː]}} and ''sz+z'' {{IPA|[zː]}} are rather the subject of the voice assimilation.
* If one of the two adjacent sibilants is an affricate, the first one changes its place of articulation, e.g. ''mala'''cs'''ág'' {{IPA|[mɒlɒt͡ʃːaːɡ]}}, ''halá'''szcs'''árda'' {{IPA|[hɒlaːʃt͡ʃaːrdɒ]}} 'Hungarian fish restaurant'. Sibilant affricate–fricative sequences like {{IPA|/t͡ʃʃ/}} are pronounced the same as geminate affricate {{IPA|[t͡ʃː]}} during normal speech.
* Sibilant assimilation can be omitted in articulated speech, e.g. to avoid homophony: ''ro'''zssz'''alma'' {{IPA|[rosːɒlmɒ]}} ~ {{IPA|[roʃsɒlmɒ]}} 'rye straw' ≠ ''rossz szalma'' {{IPA|[ros‿sɒlmɒ]}} 'straw of bad quality', and  ''rossz alma'' {{IPA|[rosː‿ɒlmɒ]}} 'apple of bad quality' as well.
* NB. Letter cluster ''szs'' can be read either as ''sz+s'' {{IPA|[ʃː]}}, e.g. ''egészség'' {{IPA|[ɛɡeːʃːeːɡ]}} 'health', or as ''s+zs'' {{IPA|[ʒː]}}, e.g. ''liszteszsák'' {{IPA|[listɛʒːaːk]}} 'bolting-bag' depending on the actual [[morpheme]] boundary. Similarly ''zsz'' is either ''zs + z'' {{IPA|[zː]}}, e.g. ''varázszár'' {{IPA|[vɒraːzːaːr]}} 'magic lock', or ''z + sz'' {{IPA|[sː]}}, e.g. ''házszám'' {{IPA|[haːsːaːm]}} 'street-number'; and ''csz'': ''cs + z'' {{IPA|[d͡ʒz]}} ~ ''c + sz'' {{IPA|[t͡ss]}}. Moreover, single digraphs may prove to be two adjacent letters on morpheme boundary, like ''cs'': ''cs'' {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} ~ ''c + s'' {{IPA|[t͡ʃʃ]}}; ''sz: sz'' {{IPA|[s]}} ~ ''s + z'' {{IPA|[zː]}}, ''zs'': ''zs'' {{IPA|[ʒ]}} ~ ''z + s'' {{IPA|[ʃː]}}.

===Palatal assimilation===
Combination of a "palatalizable" consonant and a following palatal consonant results in a palatal geminate. Palatalizable consonants are palatal ones and their non-palatal counterparts: ''gy'' {{IPAslink|ɟ}} ~ ''d'' {{IPAslink|d}}, ''l'' {{IPAslink|l}} ~ ''ly'' {{IPAslink|j}}, ''n'' {{IPAslink|n}} ~ ''ny'' {{IPAslink|ɲ}}, ''ty'' {{IPAslink|c}} ~ ''t'' {{IPAslink|t}}.
* Full palatal assimilation occurs when the ending palatal consonant is ''j'' {{IPAslink|j}}: ''na'''gyj'''a'' {{IPA|[nɒɟːɒ]}} 'most of it', ''a'''dj'''a'' {{IPA|[ɒɟːɒ]}} 's/he gives it'; ''to'''lj'''a'' {{IPA|[tojːɒ]}} 's/he pushes it'; ''u'''nj'''a'' {{IPA|[uɲːɒ]}} 's/he is bored with it', ''há'''nyj'''a'' {{IPA|[haːɲːɒ]}} 's/he throws it'; ''lá'''tj'''a'' {{IPA|[laːcːɒ]}} 's/he sees it', ''a'''tyj'''a'' {{IPA|[ɒcːɒ]}} 'his/her father'. The cluster ''lyj'' {{IPA|[jː]}} is a simple orthographic variant of ''jj'' {{IPA|[jː]}}: ''folyjon'' {{IPA|[fojːon]}} 'let it flow'.
* Partial assimilation takes place if an alveolar stop (''d'', ''t'') is followed by a palatal ''gy'' {{IPAslink|ɟ}}, ''ty'' {{IPAslink|c}}: ''ha'''dgy'''akorlat'' {{IPA|[hɒɟːɒkorlɒt]}} 'army exercises', ''nemze'''tgy'''űlés'' {{IPA|[nɛmzɛɟːyːleːʃ]}} 'national assembly'; ''va'''dty'''úk'' {{IPA|[vɒcːuːk]}} 'wild chicken', ''ha'''t ty'''úk'' {{IPA|[hɒc‿cuːk]}} 'six hens'.
* Some sources&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolnaikata.uw.hu/files/beszmuv_hangok-hangkapcsolatok.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; report that alveolar stops change into their palatal counterparts before ''ny'' {{IPAslink|ɲ}}: ''lú'''dny'''ak'' {{IPA|[luːɟɲɒk]}} 'neck of a goose', ''á'''tny'''úlik'' {{IPA|[aːcɲuːlik]}} 'it extends over'. The majority of the sources don't mention this kind of assimilation.
* When the first consonant is nasal, the partial palatal assimilation is a form of the nasal place assimilation (see above).
* The full palatal assimilation is an obligatory feature in the standard Hungarian: its omission is stigmatized and it is considered as a hypercorrection of an undereducated person. Partial palatal assimilation is optional in articulated speech.
&lt;!-- And how about a palatal consonant followed by a palatalizable one? (as in ''Nagytevel'') --&gt;

===Degemination===
Long consonants become short when preceded or followed by another consonant, e.g. ''fol'''tt'''al'' {{IPA|[foltɒl]}} 'by/with (a) patch', ''va'''rr'''tam'' {{IPA|[vɒrtɒm]}} 'I sewed'.

===Intercluster elision===
The middle alveolar stops may be omitted in clusters with more than two consonants, depending on speed and articulation of speech: ''a'''zt h'''iszem'' {{IPA|[ɒs‿hisɛm]}} ~ {{IPA|[ɒst‿hisɛm]}} 'I presume/guess', ''mi'''ndny'''ájan'' {{IPA|[miɲːaːjɒn]}} 'one and all', ''külö'''nbs'''ég'' {{IPA|[kylømpʃeːɡ]}} ~ {{IPA|[kylømʃeːɡ]}} 'difference'. In morpheme onsets like ''str-'' {{IPA|[ʃtr]}}, middle stops tends to be more stable in educated speech, ''fala'''nxstr'''atégia'' {{IPA|[fɒlɒnʃtrɒteːɡiɒ]}} ~ {{IPA|[fɒlɒŋkʃtrɒteːɡiɒ]}} ~ {{IPA|[fɒlɒŋksʃtrɒteːɡiɒ]}} 'strategy based on [[phalanx]]es'.

===Elision of {{IPA|[l]}}===
*{{IPAslink|l}} assimilates to a following {{IPAslink|r}} (e.g. ''balra'' {{IPA|[ˈbɒrːɒ]}}, 'to the left').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Vago|1980|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA|/l/}} also tends to be omitted between a preceding vowel and an adjacent stop or affricate rapid speech, causing the lengthening of the vowel or diphthongization{{example needed|date=April 2016}} (e.g. ''volt'' {{IPA|[voːt]}} 'was', ''polgár'' {{IPA|[ˈpoːɡaːr]}} 'citizen'). This is considered non-standard.

===Hiatus===
Standard Hungarian prefers hiatus between adjacent vowels. However some optional dissolving features can be observed:
* An optional weak glide {{IPA|[j̆]}} may be pronounced within a word (or a compound element) between two adjacent vowels if one of them is ''i'' {{IPA|[i]}}, e.g. ''fiaiéi'' {{IPA|[ˈfiɒieːi]}} ~ {{IPA|[ˈfij̆ɒj̆ij̆eːj̆i]}} ('the ones of his/her sons'). This, however, is rarely transcribed.
* Adjacent identical short vowels other than ''a'' and ''e'' may be pronounced as the corresponding long vowel, e.g. ''z'''oo'''lógia'' {{IPA|[ˈzo.oloːɡiɒ]}} ~ {{IPA|[ˈzoːloːɡiɒ]}} ('zoology').
* Two adjacent ''i''s are always pronounced as single short {{IPA|[i]}} in the word endings, e.g. ''Hawaii'' {{IPA|[ˈhɒvɒi]}}. This reduction is reflected in the current orthography when the adjective-forming suffix ''-i'' is added to a noun ending in ''i''. In this case suffix ''-i'' is omitted also in writing. e.g. ''[[Lenti]]'' (a placename) + ''-i'' → ''lenti'' 'of Lenti'.

==Stress==
The stress is on the first syllable of the word. The articles ''a'', ''az'', ''egy'', and the particle ''is'' are usually unstressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rounds|2009|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superfamily '''Ichneumonoidea''' contains the two largest families within [[Hymenoptera]]: [[Ichneumonidae]] and [[Braconidae]]. The group is thought to contain as many as 100,000 species, many of which have not yet been described.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennacchio|first=Francesco|last2=Strand|first2=Michael R.|date=2005-12-06|title=Evolution of developmental strategies in parasitic hymenoptera|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.151029|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=51|issue=1|pages=233–258|doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.151029|issn=0066-4170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[parasitoid wasp]]s, they were long placed in the "Parasitica", variously considered as an [[infraorder]] or an unranked [[clade]], now known to be [[paraphyletic]].

==Etymology==

The name is derived from Latin 'ichneumon', from Ancient Greek ἰχνεύμων (ikhneúmōn, "tracker"), from ἴχνος (íkhnos, "track, footstep"). The name is shared with the Egyptian mongoose, ''[[Herpestes ichneumon]]''.

==Description==

The superfamily is defined by fusion of the costal and radial veins of the fore wing, and almost all species have more than 11 [[Antenna (biology)|antennal]] segments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=Goulet,|last2=J.T.|first2=Huber,|date=1993|title=Hymenoptera of the world: An identification guide to families.|url=https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=35617|journal=|chapter=10: Superfamily Ichneumonoidea|language=English|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both included families have a [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] distribution. Ichneumonoids have morphological similarities with relatives within the order Hymenoptera, including [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s. Ichneumonoidea contains a great deal of morphological diversity, with species ranging in size from {{convert|3|to|130|mm|abbr=on}} long. Most are slender, and the females of many species (particularly in the genus ''[[Megarhyssa]]'') have extremely long [[ovipositor]]s for laying eggs.

The ichneumonid wasps may be more familiar to non-[[entomologist]]s than braconids, as they are generally larger. The two families are distinguished from each other primarily by details of wing venation.

=== Braconidae ===
Most are brownish or black, not brightly colored.&lt;ref&gt;Borror and White&lt;/ref&gt; Fore wings lack vein 2m-cu.

=== Ichneumonidae ===

[[Ichneumonidae|Ichneumonids]] vary greatly in size and their color varies from brightly colored yellow to uniform black. Fore wing with vein 2m-cu present and tubular.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Evolution==

Parasitoidism evolved only once in the [[Hymenoptera]], during the [[Permian]], leading to a single [[clade]], the [[Apocrita]]. The Apocrita emerged during the [[Jurassic]].&lt;ref name="BranstetterDanforth2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Branstetter |first1=Michael G. |last2=Danforth |first2=Bryan N. |last3=Pitts |first3=James P. |last4=Faircloth |first4=Brant C. |last5=Ward |first5=Philip S. |last6=Buffington |first6=Matthew L. |last7=Gates |first7=Michael W. |last8=Kula |first8=Robert R. |last9=Brady |first9=Seán G. |year=2017|title=Phylogenomic Insights into the Evolution of Stinging Wasps and the Origins of Ants and Bees |journal=Current Biology |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=1019–1025 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.03.027 |pmid=28376325}}{{oa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schulmeister, S. |date=2003 |title=Simultaneous analysis of basal Hymenoptera (Insecta), introducing robust-choice sensitivity analysis |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=245–275 |doi=10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00233.x}}{{oa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://susanne.schulmeister.com/Symphyta.html |title='Symphyta' |last1=Schulmeister |first1=S. |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peters |first=Ralph S. |last2=Krogmann |first2=Lars |last3=Mayer |first3=Christoph |last4=Donath |first4=Alexander |last5=Gunkel |first5=Simon |last6=Meusemann |first6=Karen |last7=Kozlov |first7=Alexey |last8=Podsiadlowski |first8=Lars |last9=Petersen |first9=Malte |title=Evolutionary History of the Hymenoptera |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.027 |journal=Current Biology |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=1013–1018 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.027 |pmid=28343967 |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parasitic life cycle==
Ichneumonoids are solitary insects, and the vast majority are [[parasitoid]]s; the [[larva]]e feed on or in another insect until it finally dies. Most hosts are [[Endopterygota|holometabolus]] insect larvae, but there are many exceptions. In general, ichneumonoids are host specific, and only attack one or a few closely related host species. Many species use [[polydnavirus]]es to suppress the immune systems of their host insects. Due to the wide variety in hosts and lifestyles, see subfamily pages for more detail.

The female ichneumonoid finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezen|first=Uzay|title=Two ichneumon wasps competing to oviposit|url=http://www.vimeo.com/28911034|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ovipositor]] of ichneumonoids generally cannot deliver a sting as many wasps or bees do. It can be used to bore wood and lay eggs on hosts deep inside, or reach hosts hidden inside leaf shelters. Upon hatching, the larva feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when it is ready to [[pupa]]te.

Various ichneumonoids are used as [[Biological pest control|biological control agents]] in controlling horticultural or forest pests. An example is the relationship between the species ''[[Ichneumon eumerus]]'' and its host butterfly ''[[Phengaris rebeli]]''.&lt;ref name="Hochberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hochberg|first=M|author2=Elmes, G. W. |author3=Thomas, J. A. |author4=Clarke, R. T |title=Mechanisms of local persistence in coupled host-parasitoid associations: the case model of Maculinea rebeli and Ichneumon eumerus|year=1996|volume=351|issue=1348|pages=1713–1724|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/351/1348/1713|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The butterfly larva is a parasite within ''[[Myrmica]]'' ant nests.  The adult ''I. eumerus'' searches for ant nests and only enters when they contain ''P. rebeli''  caterpillars.&lt;ref name="Hochberg" /&gt; Once inside, they oviposit their eggs within the caterpillars and escape the nest by releasing a chemical which causes the worker ants to fight each other rather than the intruding wasp.&lt;ref name="Hochberg"/&gt; The wasp eggs then hatch inside the caterpillar and eventually consume and kill the host.

The Miles District supported the [[Barunggam]] clan of the [[Murri people]] and was a transition stop for other aboriginal tribes. The [[collection (museum)|collection]] of [[Australian Aboriginal artifacts]] from the local area and western Queensland, some of which are extremely rare, has national historic significance by its association with Australia's indigenous peoples.

==Background==
The Barunggam clan lived in the area from [[Tchanning Creek, Queensland|Tchanning Creek]] near [[Yuleba, Queensland|Yuleba]] on the west, to [[Myall Creek, Queensland|Myall Creek]] near [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]] on the east, north to the [[Great Dividing Range]], and south to the [[Moonie, Queensland|Moonie]] and [[Condamine, Queensland|Condamine]] watersheds. There are no known descendents in the area today, as the Barunggam were moved to [[Taroom, Queensland|Taroom]] in 1916, and then eventually to [[Cherbourg, Queensland|Cherbourg]] or [[Woorabinda, Queensland|Woorabinda]].

On the sandstone slabs that abound on the banks of L Tree Creek north of [[Miles, Queensland|Miles]], grooves in the stone are clear evidence that they were popular spear sharpening spots. There were places on Dogwood Creek and Chinaman's Lagoon (about 1&amp;nbsp;km south of Miles) where the aborigines stopped and ate, and there are old middens of mussel shells on the west bank of the river at Condamine, and at the Round Waterhole north of Dulacca.

The region was also a transition stop for other aboriginal tribes as they travelled through every three years until 1876 on their way to the [[Bunya Mountains]] for the ripening of the [[Araucaria bidwillii|bunya]] nuts. The Village collection includes the 'Ilbalunga Cave' as an example of a transition stop. Local aboriginal people were involved in its creation and decorated the cave with their hand prints.

The collection also includes a map showing the tribal areas, an extensive assortment of rubbing stones, boomerangs, stone axes, grinding and milling stones and other tools, predominantly from two major donors – the Keenan and the Mayfield families as well as dilly bags and other handcrafted items. Of particular significance are a Koala skin rug, an original Notice regarding the Aboriginal Protection Act, and a chest plate which are detailed below.

==Koala Skin rug==
[[File:Koala Skin rug.jpg|thumb|Koala Skin rug]]
As few rugs of aboriginal origin are in existence today, this [[koala]] skin rug is rare and of great historical significance as a handcrafted aboriginal artefact. It may also be useful for researching sewing and rug construction techniques. The rug was found in a cave on Mt Moffatt Station, near [[Roma, Queensland|Roma]], by Mr Dayne Vincent. The twine is made of [[boodioorie]] bark and the stitching is particularly unusual. The rug would have provided warmth and comfort due to the thick and soft nature of the koala fur.

Other koala skin rugs exist in Australian Museums, however they are not of aboriginal manufacture but made after [[History of Australia#Colonisation|British colonisation]] when native furs were used in Australia for clothing and other wares. Millions of koalas were killed for their pelts up until the 1930s when protective measures were implemented by State governments to rebuild their numbers and stop the fur trade. Today koala is protected by legislation in all States and Territories where they are found.

==Notice regarding 'The Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897'==
[[File:Notice re Sale of Opium Act 1897.jpg|thumb|left|The notice]]
This notice came from [[Taroom, Queensland|Taroom]] where it had been displayed in the old Police Station for over 50 years, probably since 1897. The Notice is written in English and Chinese, and could be very rare as there are no other known copies.

Eleven of the 32 sections dealt stringently with control of the supply of [[opium]] to Aboriginal people. However the Act had wider social significance as its practical outcome was oppressive and restricted the rights and freedoms of Aboriginal people.

The legislation established reserves – geographically isolated enclaves – to which Aboriginal people could be forcibly removed by designated 'Aboriginal Protectors' – civil servants, police and missionaries. People were restricted to these reserves ostensibly to protect them from the ravages of European immorality and disease. Furthermore, the legislation was used to control Aboriginal people at the workplace and to remove their basic civil rights, reducing them to the position of State wards. This Act was not overturned until the Community Services Act 1984.

==King Dick of Boondie Plate==
[[File:King Dick of Boondie plate.jpg|thumb|King Dick of Boondie Plate]]
[[Aboriginal Breastplate|King plates]] were a form of [[regalia]] used in pre-Federation Australia by white colonial authorities to recognise local Aboriginal leaders. This chest plate belonged to a chief of the [[Palparara]] tribe of western Queensland in the [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] – [[Windorah, Queensland|Windorah]] area, near Julia Creek.

King plates were metallic crescent-shaped plaques worn around the neck which sat across the chest. This chest plate belonged to King Dick of Boondie. A '[[boondie]]' is an Australian term for a sand cake that is carved from, or broken off, a larger, hardened pocket of sand and can be thrown like a snow ball. Boondies are common in Western Queensland.

Known 'Kings' of the Miles district were King Billy of Tiereyboo who came in to live at [[Chinaman's Lagoon]] (near Miles) in the early 1900s, and King Sandy of Moraby. Tiereyboo was one of the early holdings taken up in this area, and was situated between the [[Condamine River]] and [[Dogwood Creek (Queensland)|Dogwood Creek]], and Moraby was an adjoining early holding further west.&lt;ref&gt;Significance Assessment of the Miles &amp; District Historical Society Collections 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53054">'''Instructional scaffolding''' is the support given during the learning process which is tailored to the needs of the student with the intention of helping the student achieve his/her learning goals&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Sawyer|R. Keith Sawyer]] ''The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is designed to promote a deeper level of learning.

Instructional scaffolding provides sufficient support to promote [[learning]] when [[concept]]s and [[skill]]s are being first introduced to students. These supports may include resource, compelling task, templates and guides, and/or guidance on the development of [[cognitive development|cognitive]] and [[social skills]]. Instructional scaffolding could be employed through modeling a task, giving advice, and/or providing [[coaching]].

These supports are gradually removed as students develop [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] learning strategies, thus promoting their own [[taxonomy of education objectives|cognitive]], [[taxonomy of education objectives|affective]] and [[Taxonomy of education objectives|psychomotor]] learning skills and knowledge. Teachers help the students master a task or a concept by providing support. The support can take many forms such as outlines, recommended documents, storyboards, or key questions.

== Essential features ==

There are three essential features of scaffolding that facilitate learning.&lt;ref&gt;Beed, P., Hawkins, M., &amp; Roller, C. (1991). Moving learners towards independence: the power of scaffolded instruction. The Reading Teacher, 44(9), 648–655.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, D., &amp; Wood, H. (1996). Vygotsky, tutoring and learning. Oxford Review of Education, 22(1), 5–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first feature has to do with the interaction between the learner and the expert. This interaction should be collaborative for it to be effective. The second, learning should take place in the learner's [[zone of proximal development]]. To do that the expert needs to be aware of the learner's current level of knowledge and then work to a certain extent beyond that level. The third feature of scaffolding is that the scaffold, the support and guidance provided by the expert, is gradually removed as the learner becomes more proficient. The support and guidance provided to the learner is compared to the scaffolds in building construction where the scaffolds provide both "adjustable and temporal" support to the building under construction.&lt;ref name="Palincsar, A. S. 1986"&gt;Palincsar, A. S. (1986). The role of dialogue in providing scaffolded instruction. Educational Psychologist, 21(1 &amp; 2), 73–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The support and guidance provided to learners facilitate internalization of the knowledge needed to complete the task. This support is weaned gradually until the learner is independent.&lt;ref name="Palincsar, A. S. 1986"/&gt;

== Effective scaffolding ==
For scaffolding to be effective teachers need to pay attention to the following: 
# The selection of the learning task: The task should ensure that learners use the developing skills that need to be mastered.&lt;ref name="Wood, D. 1978"&gt;Wood, D., Bruner, J., &amp; Ross, G. (1976). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1976.tb00381.x/pdf The role of tutoring in problem solving]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 17, 89–100.&lt;/ref&gt; The task should also be engaging and interesting to keep learners involved.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, M., Graves, M., &amp; Braaten, S. (1996). Scaffolding reading experiences for inclusive classes. Educational Leadership, 53(5), 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The anticipation of errors: After choosing the task, the teacher needs to anticipate errors the learners are likely to commit when working on the task. Anticipation of errors enables the scaffolder to properly guide the learners away from ineffective directions.&lt;ref name="Rosenshine, B. 1992"&gt;Rosenshine, B., &amp; Meister, C. (1992). The use of scaVolds for teaching higher-level cognitive strategies. Educational Leadership, 49(7), 26–33.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The application of scaffolds during the learning task: Scaffolds could be organized in "simple skill acquisition or they may be dynamic and generative".&lt;ref name="Rosenshine, B. 1992"/&gt;
# The consideration of emotive or affective factors: Scaffolding is not limited to a [[cognitive skill]] but it also relates to emotive and [[affective|affect]] factors. During the task the ''scaffolder'' (expert) might need to manage and control for frustration and loss of interest that could be experienced by the learner.&lt;ref name="Wood, D. 1978"/&gt; Encouragement is also an important scaffolding strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schetz, K., &amp; Stremmel, A. (1994). Teacher-assisted computer implementation: a Vygotskian perspective. Early Education and Development, 5(1), 18–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory of scaffolding ==
''Scaffolding theory'' was first introduced in the late 1950s by [[Jerome Bruner]],a [[cognitive]] [[psychologist]]. He used the term to describe young children's oral [[language acquisition]]. Helped by their parents when they first start learning to speak, young children are provided with informal instructional formats within which their learning is facilitated. A scaffolding format investigated by Bruner and his postdoctoral student [[Anat Ninio]] whose scaffolding processes are described in detail is joint picture-book reading (Ninio &amp; Bruner, 1978).  By contrast, bed-time stories and read alouds are examples of book-centered parenting events (Daniels, 1994) without scaffolding interaction. Scaffolding is inspired by [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s concept of an expert assisting a novice, or an apprentice.  Scaffolding is changing the level of support to suit the cognitive potential of the child. Over the course of a teaching session, one can adjust the amount of guidance to fit the child's potential level of performance. More support is offered when a child is having difficulty with a particular task and, over time, less support is provided as the child makes gains on the task. Ideally, scaffolding works to maintain the child's potential level of development in the ZPD. An essential element to the ZPD and scaffolding is the acquisition of language. According to Vygotsky, language (and in particular, speech) is fundamental to children's cognitive growth because language provides purpose and intention so that behaviors can be better understood.&lt;ref name="Vygotsky"&gt;Vygotsky, L. (1934/1986). Thought and language. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of speech, children are able to communicate to and learn from others through dialogue, which is an important tool in the ZPD. In a dialogue, a child's unsystematic, disorganized, and spontaneous concepts are met with the more systematic, logical and rational concepts of the skilled helper.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, J (2004). A Topical Approach To Life-Span Development. Chapter 6 Cognitive Development Approaches (200 – 225). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research suggests that the benefits of scaffolding are not only useful during a task, but can extend beyond the immediate situation in order to influence future cognitive development. For instance, a recent study recorded verbal scaffolding between mothers and their 3- and 4-year-old children as they played together. Then, when the children were six years old, they underwent several measures of [[executive function]], such as working memory and goal-directed play. The study found that the children's working memory and language skills at six years of age were related to the amount of verbal scaffolding provided by mothers at age three. In particular, scaffolding was most effective when mothers provided explicit conceptual links during play. Therefore, the results of this study not only suggest that verbal scaffolding aids children's cognitive development, but that the quality of the scaffolding is also important for learning and development.&lt;ref name="Landry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landry | first1 = S.

A construct that is critical for scaffolding instruction is Vygotsky's concept of the [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD). Zone of proximal development is that field between what a learner can do by himself (expert stage) and what can be achieved with the support of a knowledgeable peer or instructor (pedagogical stage) (Ellis &amp; Worthington, 1994).  Vygotsky was convinced that a child could be taught any subject efficiently using scaffolding practices by implementing the scaffolds at the Zone of proximal development. Students are escorted and monitored through learning activities that function as interactive conduits to get them to the next stage.  Thus the learner obtains or raises new understandings by presenting on their prior knowledge through the support delivered by more capable individuals (Raymond, 2000).  Several peer reviewed studies have shown that when there is a deficiency in guided learning experiences and social interaction, learning and development are obstructed (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking, 2000).

In writing instruction, typically support is presented in verbal form (discourse). The writing tutor engages the learner's attention, calibrates the task, motivates the student, identifies relevant task features, controls for frustration, and demonstrates as needed (Rodgers, 2004). Through joint activities, the teacher scaffolds conversation to maximize the development of a child's intrapsychological functioning. In this process, the adult controls the elements of the task that are beyond the child's ability all the while increasing the expectations of what the child is able to do. Speech, a critical tool to scaffold thinking and responding, plays a crucial role in the development of higher psychological processes (Luria, 1979) because it enables thinking to be more abstract, flexible, and independent (Bodrova &amp; Leong, 1996). From a Vygotskian perspective, talk and action work together with the sociocultural fabric of the writing event to shape a child's construction of awareness and performance (Dorn, 1996). Dialogue may range from casual talk to deliberate explanations about features of written language. The talk embedded in the actions of the literacy event shapes the child's learning as the tutor regulates his or her language to conform to the child's degrees of understanding. Clay (2005) shows that what may seem like casual conversational exchanges between tutor and student actually offer many opportunities for fostering cognitive development, language learning, story composition for writing, and reading comprehension. Conversations facilitate generative, constructive, experimental, and developmental speech and writing in the development of new ideas (Smagorinsky, 2007).

In Vygotsky's words, "what the child is able to do in collaboration today he will be able to do independently tomorrow" (Vygotsky, 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;211).

Some ingredients of scaffolding are predictability, playfulness, focus on meaning, role reversal, modeling, and nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, H. (1994). Literature Circles: Voice and choice in the student-centered classroom. Markham: Pembroke Publishers Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Levels and types in the educational setting ==
According to Saye and Brush, there are two levels of scaffolding: soft and hard (2002).  An example of soft scaffolding in the classroom would be when a teacher circulates the room and converses with his or her students (Simon and Klein, 2007).  The teacher may question their approach to a difficult problem and provide constructive feedback.  According to Van Lier, this type of scaffolding can also be referred to as contingent scaffolding.  The type and amount of support needed is dependent on the needs of the students during the time of instruction (Van Lier, 1996).  Unfortunately, applying scaffolding correctly and consistently can be difficult when the classroom is large and students have various needs (Gallagher, 1997).  Scaffolding can be applied to a majority of the students, but the teacher is left with the responsibility to identify additional scaffolding.

In contrast with contingent or soft scaffolding, embedded or hard scaffolding is planned in advance to help students with a learning task that is known in advance to be difficult (Saye and Brush, 2002).  For example, when students are discovering the formula for the Pythagorean Theorem in math class, the teacher may identify hints or cues to help the student reach an even higher level of thinking.  In both situations, the idea of "expert scaffolding" is being implemented (Holton and Clarke, 2006): the teacher in the classroom is considered the expert and is responsible for providing scaffolding for the students.

Reciprocal scaffolding, a method first coined by Holton and Thomas, is a method that involves a group of two or more collaboratively working together.  In this situation, the group can learn from each other's experiences and knowledge.  The scaffolding is shared by each member and changes constantly as the group works on a task (Holton and Clarke, 2006).  According to Vygotsky, students develop higher-level thinking skills when scaffolding occurs with an adult expert or with a peer of higher capabilities (Stone, 1998).  Conversely, Piaget believes that students discard their ideas when paired with an adult or student of more expertise (Piaget, 1928).  Instead, students should be paired with others who have different perspectives.  Conflicts would then take place between students allowing them to think constructively at a higher level.

Technical scaffolding is a newer approach in which computers replace the teachers as the experts or guides, and students can be guided with web links, online tutorials, or help pages (Yelland and Masters, 2007).  Educational software can help students follow a clear structure and allows students to plan properly (Lai and Law, 2006).

===Directive and supportive scaffolding===

Silliman and Wilkinson (1994) distinguish two types of scaffolding: 'supportive scaffolding' that characterises the IRF (Initiation-Response-Follow-up) pattern; and 'directive scaffolding' that refers to IRE (Initiation-Response-Evaluation). Saxena (2010)&lt;ref name="Applied Linguistics pp. 163-184"&gt;Saxena, M. (2010) Reconceptualising teachers' directive and supportive scaffolding in bilingual
classrooms within the neo-Vygotskyan approach. Journal of Applied Linguistics &amp; Professional Practice, 7 (2), pp. 163-184&lt;/ref&gt; develops these two notions theoretically by incorporating Bhaktin's (1981)&lt;ref name="Bakhtin, M.M. 1981"&gt;Bakhtin, M.M. (1981) The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by M. M. Bakhtin. Edited by
M. Holquist and translated by C. Emerson and M. Holquist. Austin: University of
Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and vanLier's (1996)&lt;ref name="Van Lier 1996"&gt;Van Lier, L. (1996) Interaction in the Language Curriculum: Awareness, Autonomy, and
Authenticity. London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; works. Within the IRE pattern, teachers provide 'directive scaffolding' on the assumption that their job is to transmit knowledge and then assess its appropriation by the learners.  The question-answer-evaluation sequence creates a predetermined standard for acceptable participation and induces passive learning. In this type of interaction, the teacher holds the right to evaluate and asks 'known-information' questions which emphasise the reproduction of information. The nature and role of the triadic dialogue have been oversimplified and the potential for the roles of teachers and students in them has been undermined (Nassaji and Wells, 2000).&lt;ref name="Nassaji, H 2000"&gt;Nassaji, H. and Wells, G. (2000) What's the use of "triadic dialogue"? An investigation of teacher-student interaction. Applied Linguistics 21 (3): 376--406.&lt;/ref&gt;

If, in managing the talk, teachers apply 'constructive power' (Saxena, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;Saxena, M. (2009) Negotiating conflicting ideologies and linguistic otherness: codeswitching
in English classrooms. English Teaching: Practice and Critique 8 (2): 167--
187.&lt;/ref&gt; and exploit students' responses as occasions for joint exploration, rather than simply evaluating them, then the classroom talk becomes dialogic (Nystrand, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Nystrand, M. (1997) Opening Dialogue: Understanding the Dynamics of Language and Learning in the English Classroom. New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The pedagogic orientation of this talk becomes 'participation orientation', in contrast to 'display/assessment orientation' of IRE (van Lier, 1996).&lt;ref name="Van Lier 1996"/&gt; In this kind of pattern of interaction, the third part of the triadic dialogue offers 'follow-up' and teachers' scaffolding becomes 'supportive'. Rather than producing 'authoritative discourse' Bakhtin's (1981),&lt;ref name="Bakhtin, M.M. 1981"/&gt; teachers constructs 'internally persuasive discourse' that allows 'equality' and 'symmetry' (van Lier, 1996:175),&lt;ref name="Van Lier 1996"/&gt; wherein the issues of power, control, institutional managerial positioning, etc. are diffused or suspended. The discourse opens up the roles for students as the 'primary knower' and the 'sequence initiator' (Nassaji and Wells, 2000),&lt;ref name="Nassaji, H 2000"/&gt; which allows them to be the negotiator and co-constructor of meaning. The suspension of asymmetry in the talk represents a shift in the teacher's ideological stance and, therefore, demonstrates that supportive scaffolding is more than simply a model of instruction (Saxena, 2010: 167).&lt;ref name="Applied Linguistics pp. 163-184"/&gt;

==The role of guidance==

===Guidance and cognitive load===
Learner support in scaffolding is known as guidance.  While it takes on various forms and styles, the base of guidance is any type of interaction from the instructor that is intended to aid and/or improve student learning.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Wise, A. F., &amp; O'Neill, K. (2009). Beyond more versus less: A reframing of the debate on instructional guidance. Retrieved from http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2009-09809-005&lt;/ref&gt;  While this a broad definition, the role and amount of guidance is better defined by the instructor's approach. Instructionists and constructionists approach giving guidance within their own instructional frameworks.  Scaffolding involves presenting learners with proper guidance that moves them towards their learning goals.  Providing guidance is a method of moderating the [[cognitive load]] of a learner.  In scaffolding, learners can only be moved toward their learning goals if cognitive load is held in check by properly administered support.

Instructionists tend to give a higher level of guidance in light of the inquiry driven style of learning. With each piece of a complex task being broken down, instructors give guidance for each of the separated parts of the learning.  In this way, higher guidance is a function of reducing cognitive load when students are working in a more individual manner.

Constructivists approach guidance differently as a result of their focus on transfer.  The concept of transfer focuses on a learner's ability to apply learned tasks in a context other than the modality in which it was learned.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;  This results in constructivists giving a lower level of guidance, as learners work through a complete task, only being given guidance in transfer. The role of guidance is to ensure that cognitive load is moderated while the learner works at more complete and complex task; guidance is given during aspects of the task that will help enable transfer.

===Amount of guidance===

Research has demonstrated that higher level of guidance has a greater effect on scaffolded learning, but is not a guarantee of more learning.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J., Kirschner, P.A., and Clark, R. E. (2007). Why Minimally Guided Teaching Techniques Do Not Work: A Reply to Commentaries. Educational Psychologist, 42(2), 115–121.&lt;/ref&gt;  The efficacy of higher amount of guidance is dependent on the level of detail and guidance applicability.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;  Having multiple types of guidance (i.e. worked examples, feedback) can cause them to interact and reinforce each other.  Multiple conditions do not guarantee greater learning, as certain types of guidance can be extraneous to the learning goals or the modality of learning.  With this, more guidance (if not appropriate to the learning) can negatively impact performance, as it gives the learner overwhelming levels of information.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;   However, appropriately designed high levels of guidance, which properly interact with the learning, is more beneficial to learning than low levels of guidance.

===Context of guidance===

Constructivists pay close attention to the context of guidance, because they believe instruction plays a major role in knowledge retention and transfer.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Research studies&lt;ref&gt;Wieman, C., &amp; Perkins, K. (2005). Transforming physics education. ''Physics Today'', 59(11), 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hrepic, Z., Zollman, D. A., &amp; Rebello, N. S. (2007). Comparing students' and experts' understanding of the content of a lecture. Journal of Science Education and Technology, 16(3), 213-224.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate how the context of isolated explanations can have an effect on student-learning outcomes. For example, Hake's (1998) large-scale study&lt;ref&gt;Hake, R. R. (1998). Interactive engagement versus traditional methods: A six-thousand-student survey of mechanics test data for introductory physics course. American Journal of Physics, 66(1), 64–74.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated how post-secondary physics students recalled less than 30% of material covered in a traditional lecture-style class. Similarly, other studies&lt;ref&gt;Capon, N., &amp; Kuhn, D. (2004). What's so good about problem-based learning? Cognition and Instruction, 22, 61-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C., Lehman, J., &amp; Koedinger, K. (1999). Goals and learning in microworlds. Cognitive Science, 23, 305-336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, D.L., &amp; Martin, T. (2004). Inventing to prepare for learning: The hidden efficiency of original student production in statistics instruction. ''Cognition and Instruction'', 22, 129–184.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrate how students construct different understandings from explanation in isolation versus having a first experience with the material. A first experience with the material provides students with a "need to know",&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; which allows learners to reflect on prior experiences with the content, which can help learners construct meaning from instruction.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Worked examples&lt;ref name="worked"&gt;[[Worked-example effect]]&lt;/ref&gt; are guiding tools that can act as a "need to know" for students. Worked examples provide students with straightforward goals, step-by-step instructions as well as ready-to-solve problems that can help students develop a stronger understanding from instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, W. (1994). Using worked examples as instructional support in the algebra classroom. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 86, 360–367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trafton, J. G., &amp; Reiser, B. J., (1993). The contribution of studying examples and solving problems to skill acquisition. Paper presented at the 15th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing of guidance===
Guiding has a key role both in constructivism and 'instructivism'. For instructivists the timing of guidance is immediate, either at the beginning or when the learner makes a mistake, whereas in constructivism it can be delayed.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; It has been found that immediate feedback can lead to [[cognitive load|working memory load]] as it does not take in consideration the process of gradual acquisition of a skill,&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;John R. Anderson; Albert T. Corbett; Kenneth R. Koedinger; Ray Pelletier The Journal of the Learning Sciences, Vol. 4, No. 2. (1995), pp. 167-207.&lt;/ref&gt; which also relates to the amount of guidance being given. Research on [[Intelligent tutoring systems|intelligent-tutoring systems]] suggests that immediate feedback on errors is a great strategy to promote learning, as the learner is able to integrate the feedback from short-term memory into the overall learning and problem solving task; the longer the wait on feedback, the harder it is for the learner to make this integration.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; Yet, in another study it was found that providing feedback right after the error can deprive the learner of the opportunity to develop evaluative skills.&lt;ref&gt;Mathan, S., &amp; Koedinger, K. R. (2003). Recasting the feedback debate: Benefits of tutoring error detection and correction skills. In U. Hoppe, F. Verdejo, &amp; J. Kay (Eds.), Artificial intelligence in education: Shaping the future of learning through intelligent technologies (pp. 13-20). Amsterdam: IOS Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wise and O'Neill bring these two, seemingly contradictory findings, and argue that it does not only prove the importance of the role of feedback, but that points out a timing feature of feedback: immediate feedback in the short term promotes more rapid problem solving but delaying feedback can result in better retention and [[Transfer of learning|transfer]] in the long term.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

===Constructivism and guidance===

[[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]] views knowledge as a "function of how the individual creates meaning from his or her own experiences".&lt;ref&gt;Jonassen, D. H. (1991). Objectivism versus constructivism: do we need a new philosophical paradigm? Educational Technology Research and Development, 39 (3), 5-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivists advocate that learning is better facilitated in a minimally guided environment where learners construct important information for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Steffe, L. &amp; Gale, J. (Eds.) (1995). Constructivism in education. New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; According to constructivism, minimal guidance in the form of process or task related information should be provided to learners upon request and [[direct instruction]] of learning strategies should not be used because it impedes the natural processes learners use to recall prior experiences. 
In this view, for learners to construct knowledge they should be provided with the goals and minimal information and support. Applications that promote [[constructivist learning]] require learners to solve authentic problems or "acquire knowledge in information-rich settings".&lt;ref&gt;Kirschner, P. A. (1992). Epistemology, practical work and academic skills in science education. Science and Education, 1, 273– 299.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an application of constructivist learning is science instruction, where students are asked to discover the principles of science by imitating the steps and actions of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;van Joolingen, W. R., de Jong, T., Lazonder, A. W., Savelsbergh, E., &amp; Manlove, S. (2005). Co-Lab: Research and development of an on-line learning environment for collaborative scientific discovery learning. Computers in Human Behavior, 21, 671-688.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instructivism and guidance===
Instructionism are educational practices characterized for being instructor-centered. Some authors see instructionism as a highly prescriptive practice that mostly focuses on the formation of skills, that is very product-oriented and is not interactive;&lt;ref&gt;Jonassen, D. H. (Ed.). (1996). ''Handbook of research for educational communications and technology.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; or that is a highly structured, systematic and explicit way of teaching that gives emphasis to the role of the teacher as a transmitter of knowledge and the students as passive receptacles.&lt;ref name= "johnson"&gt;Johnson, G. (2009). Instructionism and Constructivism: Reconciling Two Very Good Ideas. ''International Journal of Special Education'', 24(3), 90-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'transmission' of knowledge and skills from the teacher to the student in this context is often manifested in the form of drill, practice and rote memorization.&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt; An 'instructionist', then, focuses on the preparation, organization and management of the lesson making sure the plan is detailed and the communication is effective.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, G. L., &amp; Engelmann, S. (1996). Research on Direct Instruction: 25 years beyond DISTAR. Seattle, WA: Educational Achievement Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kameenui, E. J., &amp; Carnine, D. W. (1998). Effective teaching strategies that accommodate diverse learners. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis is on the up-front explicit delivery of instruction.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

Instructionism is often contrasted with constructivism. Both of them use the term guidance as means to support learning, and how it can be used more effectively. The difference in the use of guidance is found in the philosophical assumptions regarding the nature of the learner,&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt; but they also differ in their views around the quantity, the context and the timing of guidance.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; An example of application of instructionism in the classroom is [[Direct Instruction|direct instruction]].

===Applications===
Instructional scaffolding can be thought of as the strategies that a teacher uses to help learners bridge a cognitive gap or progress in their learning to a level they were previously unable to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Pol, Janneke 2010"&gt;van de Pol, Janneke, Volman, Monique, &amp; Beishuizen, Jos. (2010). Scaffolding in Teacher–Student Interaction: A Decade of Research. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 22:271–296 DOI 10.1007/s10648-010-9127-6&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies evolve as the teachers evaluate the learners initial level of ability and then through continued feedback throughout the progression of the task. In the early studies, scaffolding was primarily done in oral, face- to-face learning environments. In classrooms, scaffolding may include modelling behaviours, coaching and prompting, thinking out loud, dialogue with questions and answers, planned and spontaneous discussions, as well as other interactive planning or structural assistance to help the learner bridge a cognitive gap. This can also include peer mentoring from more experienced students.

There are a wide variety of scaffolding strategies that teachers employ. One approach to looking at the application of scaffolding is to look at a framework for evaluating these strategies.
This model was developed based on the theoretical principles of scaffolding to highlight the use of scaffolding for educational purposes.&lt;ref name="Pol, Janneke 2010"/&gt; It highlights two components of an instructors use of scaffolding. The first is the instructors intentions and the second refers to the means by which the scaffolding is carried out.

'''Scaffolding intentions:'''

These groups highlight the ways in which the instructor scaffolds&lt;ref name="Pol, Janneke 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Scaffolding Mean Groups.png|500px|thumb|left|alt=A Groups of scaffolding means]]

Any combination of scaffolding means with scaffolding intention can be construed as a scaffolding strategy, however, whether a teaching strategy qualifies as good scaffolding generally depends upon its enactment in actual practice and more specifically upon whether the strategy is applied contingently and whether it is also part of a process of fading and transfer of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Jumaat, Nurul, Farhana &amp; Zaidatun Tasir (2014). Instructional Scaffolding in Online Learning Environment: A Meta-Analysis. Presented at the 2014 International Conference on Teaching and Learning in Computing and Engineering. doi: 10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.22&lt;/ref&gt;

Instructors can use a variety of scaffolds to accommodate different levels of knowledge. The context of learning (i.e. novice experience, complexity of the task) may require more than one scaffold strategy in order for the student to master new content.&lt;ref name="Ali"/&gt; The following table&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niu.edu/facdev/resources/guide/strategies/instructional_scaffolding_to_improve_learning.pdf Northern Illinois University, Faculty Development and Instructional Design Center.]&lt;/ref&gt; outlines a few common scaffolding strategies:

===Scaffolding mediated by technology===

When we teach students who are not physically present in the classroom, instructors need to adapt to the environment and their scaffolding needs to be adjusted to fit this new learning medium. It can be challenging to find a way to adjust the verbal and visual elements of scaffolding to construct a successful interactive and collaborative learning environment for distance learning.

The recent spread of technology used in education has opened up the learning environment to include hypermedia, hypertext, collaborative learning environments, and web-based learning environments. This challenges traditional learning design conceptions of scaffolding for educators.&lt;ref name="Hannafin, M. 1999"&gt;Hannafin, M., Hill, J. &amp; Land, S. (1999). Student-centered learning and interactive multimedia: Status, issues, and implication. Contemporary Education 68(2): 94–99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pea, R.D. (2004). The social and technological dimensions of scaffolding and related theoretical concepts for learning, education, and human activity. Journal of the Learning Sciences 13: 423–451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, B. (2004). Scaffolding complex learning: The mechanisms of structuring and problematizing student work. Journal of the Learning Sciences 13930: 273–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent review&lt;ref&gt;Jumaat, Nurul, Farhana &amp; Zaidatun, Tasir (2014). Instructional Scaffolding in Online Learning Environment: A Meta-Analysis. Presented at the 2014 International Conference on Teaching and Learning in Computing and Engineering. doi: 10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.22&lt;/ref&gt; of the types of scaffolding used in online learning identified four main types of scaffolding:

*conceptual scaffolding: helps students decide what to consider in learning and guide them to key concepts
*procedural scaffolding: helps students use appropriate tools and resources effectively  
*strategic scaffolding: helps students find alternative strategies and methods to solve complex problems 
*metacognitive scaffolding: prompts students to think about what they are learning throughout the process and assists students reflecting on what they have learnt (self-assessment). This is the most common research area and is thought to not only promote higher order thinking but also students ability to plan ahead. Reingold, Rimor and Kalay have listed seven mechanisms of metacognitive scaffolding that encourage students' metacognition in learning.&lt;ref&gt;R. Reingold, R.Rimor, and A. Kalay, "Instructor's scaffolding in support of student's metacognition through a teacher education online course: a case study," Journal of Intercative Online Learning, vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 139-151, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

These four types are structures that appropriately support students' learning in online environments.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Hannafin, S. Land and K. Oliver, "Open learning environments: Foundations, methods and models," in C.M. Reigeluth (Ed.), Instructional-design theories and models: A new paradigm of instructional theory, Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1999, pp. 115-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scaffolding approaches that were addressed by the researchers included: technical support, content support, argumentation template, questioning and modelling. These terms were rarely used, and it was argued that these areas had unclear structure to guide students, especially in online learning, and were inadequately justified.

As technology changes, so does the form of support provided to online learners. Instructors have the challenge of adapting scaffolding techniques to this new medium, but also the advantage of using new web-based tools such as wikis and blogs as platforms to support and discuss with students.

====Benefits in online learning environments====
As the research in this area progresses, studies are showing that when students learn about complex topics with computer-based learning environments (CBLEs) without scaffolding they demonstrated poor ability to regulate their learning, and failure to gain a conceptual understanding of the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, J. &amp; Hannafin, M. (1997). Cognitive strategies and learning from the World Wide Web. Educational Technology Research &amp; Development 45(4): 37–64.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, researchers have recently begun to emphasize the importance of embedded conceptual, procedural, strategic, and metacognitive scaffolding in CBLEs.&lt;ref name="Hannafin, M. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadwin, A.F., Wozney, L. &amp; Pantin, O. (2005). Scaffolding the appropriation of self- regulatory activity; A socio-cultural analysis of changes in teacher-student discourse about a graduate research portfolio. Instructional Science 33(5–6): 413–450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baylor, A. L. (2002). Agent-based learning environments for investigating teaching and learning. Journal of Educational Computing Research 26(3): 249–270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puntambekar, S. &amp; Hubscher, R. (2005). Tools for scaffolding students in a complex learning environment: What have we gained and what have we missed? Educational Psychologist 40(1): 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the four scaffolding guidelines outlined, recent research has shown:
* scaffolding can help in group discussions. In a recent study,&lt;ref&gt;H. Huang, C. Wu and N. Chen, "The effectiveness of using procedural scaffolding in a paper-plus-smartphone collaborative learning context," Computers &amp; Education, vol. 59, no. 2, pp. 250- 259, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; a significant increase in active participation and meaningful negotiations was found within the scaffolded groups as opposed to the non-scaffolded group.
* metacognitive scaffolding can be used to encourage students in reflecting and help build a sense of a community among learners.&lt;ref name="R. Reingold, R pp. 139-151"&gt;R. Reingold, R.Rimor, and A. Kalay, "Instructor's scaffolding in support of student's metacognition through a teacher education online course: a case study," Journal of Intercative Online Learning, vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 139-151, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Reingold, Rimor and Kalay&lt;ref name="R. Reingold, R pp. 139-151"/&gt; recommend using metacognitive scaffolding to support students working on a common task. They believe this can support learners to experience their work as part of a community of learners.

==== Downfalls in online learning environments ====
An online learning environment warrants many factors for scaffolding to be successful, this includes basic knowledge of the use of technology, social interactions and reliance on student’s individual motivation and initiative for learning.  Collaboration is key to instructional scaffolding and can be lost without proper guidance from an instructor creating and initiating an online social space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Moon-Heum|last2=Cho|first2=YoonJung|date=April 2014|title=Instructor scaffolding for interaction and students' academic engagement in online learning: Mediating role of perceived online class goal structures|url=|journal=The Internet and Higher education|volume=21|pages=25–30|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The instructor’s role in creating a social space for online interaction has been found to increase student’s confidence in understanding the content and goals of the course.  If an instructor does not create this space a student misses out on critical-thinking, evaluating material and collaborating with fellow students to foster learning.  Even with instructors implementing a positive social space online, a research study found that students perceptions of incompetence to other classmates is not affected by positive online social spaces but found this to be less of a problem in face-face courses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Due to the distance learning that encompasses an online environment, self-regulation is essential for scaffolding to be effective, a study has shown that procrastinators are at a disadvantage in online distance learning and are not able to be scaffolded in the same degree as if there was an in-person instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuckman|first=Bruce|date=Summer 2005|title=Relations of academic procrastination, rationalizations, and performance in a web course with deadlines|url=|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=96|pages=1015–1021|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Students who had more desire to master the content than to receive higher grades were more successful in the online courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Moon-Heum|last2=Shen|first2=Demei|date=Summer 2013|title=Self-regulation in online learning|url=|journal=Distance Education|volume=34|issue=3|pages=290–301|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study by Artino and Stephens &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Artino|first=Anthony|last2=Stephens|first2=Jason|date=December 2009|title=Academic motivation and self-regulation: A comparative analysis of undergraduate and graduate students learning online|url=|journal=The Internet and Higher Education|volume=12|pages=146–151|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that graduate students were more motivated in online course than undergraduate students but suggests academic level may contribute to the amount of technological support that is needed for positive learning outcomes, finding that undergraduate students needed less support than graduate students when navigating an online course.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10307">The '''Law of Jante''' ({{lang-da|Janteloven}})&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] {{lang-nb|Janteloven}} {{IPA-no|ˈjɑntəˌloːvn̩|}}, {{lang-nn|Jantelova}}; {{lang-is|Jantelögin}}; {{lang-fo|Jantelógin}}; {{lang-sv|Jantelagen}} {{IPA-sv|²janːtɛˌlɑːɡɛn|}}; {{lang-fi|Janten laki}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[code of conduct]] said to be common in [[Nordic countries]], that portrays doing things out of the ordinary, being overtly personally ambitious, or not conforming, as unworthy and inappropriate. 

The attitudes were first formulated in the form of the ten rules of Jante Law by the [[Denmark|Dano]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] author [[Aksel Sandemose]], in his satirical novel ''A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks'' (''En flyktning krysser sitt spor'', 1933), but the actual attitudes themselves would be older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Mark |last= Scott |title= Signs of Cracks in the Law of Jante | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/signs-of-cracks-in-the-law-of-jante/?ref=technology |quote=Taken from a book by the Danish author Aksel Sandemose, the concept suggests that the culture within Scandinavian countries discourages people from promoting their own achievements over those of others. |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date= 18 December 2003 |accessdate=2013-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His novel portrays the fictional small Danish town Jante, which he modelled upon his native town [[Nykøbing Mors]] in the 1930s, which was typical of all small towns and communities, where nobody was anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Translator note, ''En flygtning krydser sit spor'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Used generally in colloquial speech in the [[Nordic countries]] as a [[sociology|sociological]] term to denote a condescending attitude towards individuality and success, the term refers to a mentality that diminishes individual effort and places all emphasis on the collective, while simultaneously denigrating those who try to stand out as individual achievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.svd.se/kultur/sprakspalt/avundsjukan-har-urgamla-anor_116508.svd |title= Avundsjukan har urgamla anor |trans-title= Jealousy has ancient ancestry | language= Swedish |date= 2 November 2003| first= Viveka |last= Adleswärd |work= [[Svenska Dagbladet]]| accessdate= 28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There are ten rules in the law as defined by Sandemose, all expressive of variations on a single theme and usually referred to as a homogeneous unit: ''You are not to think you're anyone special or that you're better than us.'' &lt;!--The Danish word "loven" means "the law" and can be translated into the English as "code". Like in all [[Scandinavian language]]s, -en is a [[definite article]] suffix.--&gt;
[[File:Sandemose Janteloven.jpg|thumb | Janteloven written by Aksel Sandemose]]

'''The ten rules state:'''
# You're not to think ''you'' are anything special.
# You're not to think ''you'' are as good as ''we'' are.
# You're not to think ''you'' are smarter than ''we'' are.
# You're not to imagine yourself better than ''we'' are.
# You're not to think ''you'' know more than ''we'' do.
# You're not to think ''you'' are more important than ''we'' are.
# You're not to think ''you'' are good at anything.
# You're not to laugh at ''us''.
# You're not to think anyone cares about ''you''.
# You're not to think ''you'' can teach ''us'' anything.

In the book, the Janters who transgress this unwritten 'law' are regarded with suspicion and some hostility, as it goes against the town's communal desire to preserve harmony, social stability and uniformity.

An eleventh rule recognised in the novel as 'the penal code of Jante' is:

&lt;ol start="11"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you don't think ''we'' know a few things about ''you''?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

From the chapter ''Maybe you don't think I know something about you'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"That one sentence (the eleventh rule), which acts as the penal code of Jante, as such was rich in content. It was a charge of all sorts of things, and that it also had to be, because absolutely nothing was allowed. It was also an elaborate indictment, with all kinds of unspecified penalties given to be expected. Furthermore it was useful, depending fully on tone of voice, in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts, and it could also be the best means of defense." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sandemose wrote about the working class in the town of Jante, a group of people of the same social position. He expressly stated in later books that the social norms of Jante were universal and not intended to depict any particular town or country.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Sandemose did not invent the rules; he was seeking to formulate and describe attitudes that had already been part of the Danish and Norwegian psyche for centuries.

== Sociological effects ==
Although intended as criticism, the meaning of the Law of Jante has shifted to refer to personal criticism of people who want to break out of their social groups and reach a higher position in society in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Den løbske Jantelov|trans-title= The Runaway Jante Law| work=Morsø Folkeblad |date= 6 July 1992 |first= Steen |last= Andersen  | url= http://sandemose.dk/projekt99/bibliotek/artikler/jantebrug.html | accessdate= 28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common in Scandinavia to claim the Law of Jante as something quintessentially Danish, Norwegian or Swedish.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The rules are treated as a way of behaving in order to fit in and results in dressing similarly and the types of cars that people buy and buying similar products for their homes.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

It's commonly stated that Jante Law is for people in the provinces, but commentators have suggested that metropolitan areas are also affected.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

While the original intention was as satire, [[Kim Orlin Kantardjiev]], a Norwegian politician&lt;ref&gt;[https://agendamagasin.no/forfatter/kimk/ Agenda Magasin] online&lt;/ref&gt; and educational advisor, claims that the Law of Jante is taught in schools, is treated more as a social code to encourage [[group behaviour]], and has been credited with making Nordic countries more harmonious and equal by pointing out the intrinsic conflicts between individuality and social conformity. He also asserts that the laws may be one of the reasons Nordic countries have high [[happiness score]]s.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/ideas/videos/forget-hygge-the-laws-that-really-rule-in-scandina/p06gtkxt BBC Ideas Forget hygge: The laws that really rule in Scandinavia]&lt;/ref&gt; and feels the law might be summarised as ''"You shouldn't think you're better than everyone else."''&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;{{rp|4:59}} Though the law, as defined by Sandemose, is meant to control and shame achievers of all kinds, regardless of wealth, Kantardjiev makes the association that in countries such as America, being rich allows people to behave differently, and Jante Laws tend to level out society, as the people as a whole get to set the rules, not the rich alone.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

In Scandinavia, articles appear regularly, however, which link the Law of Jante to high suicide rates.&lt;ref name=suicide&gt;[https://www.allehanda.se/artikel/vasternorrland/anita-raddar-mobbade-fran-sjalvmord-det-ringer-hela-tiden-drabbade-som-inte-orkar-leva Klas Leffler] in ''[[:sv:MittMedia|MittMedia]] Allehanda Västernorrland'' 2016-07-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Backlash has occurred against the rules, and in Norway someone even placed a grave for Jante Laws, declaring them dead in 2005. However, others have questioned whether they will ever go away, as they may be firmly entrenched in society.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

'''Legalism''' (or nomism), in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], is the act of putting the [[Law of Moses]] above the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, by establishing requirements for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] beyond [[Sola fide|faith]] (trust) in [[Jesus Christ]], specifically, trust in His finished work - the shedding of His blood for our sins, and reducing the broad, inclusive, and general precepts of the [[Bible]] to narrow and rigid [[Morality|moral]] codes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Reid et al., Dictionary of Christianity in America (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, [[superficiality]], the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the [[divine grace|grace of God]] or [[Letter and spirit of the law|emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit]]. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not [[Faith in Christianity|faith in God's grace]], is the pre-eminent principle of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. On the viewpoint that redemption is not earned by works, but that obedient faith is required to enter and remain in the redeemed state, see [[covenantal nomism]].

==In the New Testament==
The words 'legalism' or 'legalist' do not occur in the Old or New Testaments.  Legalism's root word, "law" (Greek ''nomos''), occurs frequently in the [[New Testament]], and sometimes is interpreted as legalism.  In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in {{bibleverse||Gal.|2:16}}, "''nomou'' is here evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting [[divine law]] viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ernest De Witt, ''The International Critical Commentary, Galatians'', 1921, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] day lacked any term corresponding to the distinct position of "legalism", "legalist", or "legalistic", leading [[C.E.B. Cranfield]] to commend "the possibility that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Pauline statements which at first sight seem to disparage the law]], were really directed not against the law itself but against that misunderstanding and misuse of it for which we now have a convenient terminology" (legalism).&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, C.E.B., ''The International Critical Commentary, Romans'', 1979, p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Messianic Jew]]ish Bible translator [[David H. Stern]] cited these two scholars to support the translation framework that often "&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''nomos''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; means 'legalism' and not God's ''[[Torah]]''", especially in Paul's constructs ''erga nomou'' (literally [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|"works of law"]], rendered by Stern "legalistic observance of ''Torah'' commands") and ''upo nomon'' (literally "under law", rendered by Stern by 13 words, "in subjection to the system which results from perverting the ''Torah'' into legalism").&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H., ''Jewish New Testament Commentary'', 1992, pp. 535–8, 552–3, on Gal. 2:16b, 3:23b.&lt;/ref&gt;

One concept of legalism, the belief that salvation can be earned by obedience to laws, is referred to in various New Testament books, including Galatians. In this case, some [[Jewish Christians|Jews who had become Christians]] believed that in order to obtain salvation, both faith in Christ (as [[Messiah]]), and obedience to the Mosiac laws were required, such as the cases of the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy]] and the [[Incident at Antioch]]. Generally, however, these cases are referred to as the [[Judaizer]] controversy, rather than a legalism controversy, but the two are related.

Legalism refers to any doctrine which states salvation comes strictly from adherence to the law.  It can be thought of as a works-based religion.  Groups in the New Testament said to be falling into this category include the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Scribes]], [[Judaizers]], and [[Nicolaitans]].  They are legalists because they emphasized obeying the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]], in the case of the Pharisees and Scribes, to the letter without understanding the concept of grace.  Jesus condemned their legalism in [[Woes of the Pharisees|Matthew 23]].  The Pharisees love of the praises of men for their strict adherence is said to be a prime example of legalism.

Legalism is sometimes confused with obedience.  New Testament books such as Romans, speak of grace and obedience together. An example is found in Romans 1:5 (New American Standard Version) speaking of Christ 'through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake...' The goal of receiving the grace was to bring about obedience of faith. Here grace, faith and obedience are tied together. Other references are in Acts 5:29, 32; Romans 16:19; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Hebrews 5:9.

Legalism is also confused with discipline, which is often spoken of in a positive light.  See 1 Corinthians 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 1:7 and Hebrews 12:5–11.

A third common misunderstanding of legalism is the word law.  Law in many places in the Bible refers to the Law of Moses, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].  In Galatians the Judaizers were trying to insist that salvation required that a person be circumcised prior to obeying the [[Law of Christ]].  Galatians 2:16 says,  "Knowing that a man is not justified by the [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|works of the law]], but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified" (King James Version).  The faith here is the [[Law of Christ]] and the law here is the Law of Moses.  The legalism of the Judaizers was that obedience to  the law of Moses was necessary to be saved.

Legalism in the New Testament is believed by some as being revealed by the life of Saul prior to his [[Conversion of Paul|conversion]].  Some believe that Saul sought to redeem himself by his works of persecution of the church and its ultimate destruction.  Acts 26:9–11 reveals, "I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to [[blaspheme]]; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities" (King James Version). Galatians 1:13–14 states, "For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly [[Zealots#Paul the Apostle|zealous]] of the traditions of my fathers" (King James Version).  These two texts emphasize the nature of Saul's religion, works.

However, in this passage the obedience is not tied to the obeying of specific Old Testament laws, such as keeping [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] or circumcision.

[[Image:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Icon of [[James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the [[Apostolic Decree]] of {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19–29}}, c. AD 50.]]

At the [[Council of Jerusalem]], c. 50, [[James the Just]] decreed the ''Apostolic Decree'':
: "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the [[Gentiles]] are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from [[idolatry|pollutions of idols]], and [from] [[fornication]], and [from] things strangled, and [from] [[Taboo food#Blood|blood]].{{ref|4}} For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the [[synagogues]] every [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] day" ({{bibleref|Acts|15:19–21|KJV}}).

Though the ''Apostolic Decree'' is no longer observed by many [[Christian denominations]] today, it is still observed in full by the [[Greek Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a very effective philosophy during that time.

== In intra-Christian relations ==

===Roman Catholic Church===
In [[Roman Catholicism]], [[good works]] are done in service to God and one's neighbour, by faith working through love.  In contrast, a severity in the imposition of, or overly scrupulous conformity to any rule of piety, may be charged with legalism.

In an attempt to resolve the dispute over legalism, the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] was a document issued in 1999 by Lutheran-Catholic clerical representatives, declaring a common belief in ''[[Sola gratia]]'', that grace alone can save the faithful, and that there is a ''progressive infusion'' of grace in the spirit of the believer.

===Eastern Orthodox Churches===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], for another example, rejects the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]] as ''legalistic''.  The satisfaction theory states that mankind's [[Original Sin]] violated God's law, resulting in all men being born guilty: an idea prevalent in the writings of [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] of the [[Western Church]].  [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] formally developed the theory that the legal problem of guilt before the Law, required the legal solution of retribution, in order to achieve a just salvation. The solution was for God's son Jesus to willingly die on the [[Cross]] in place of humanity, thus allowing the legal penalty to be fully carried out, satisfying the justice of God, and thus clearing the way for mercy to be shown to sinners.  The Eastern Orthodox charge that this theory is too dependent upon Roman legal concepts of retribution and justice. [citation needed]

===Protestant Churches===
In [[Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Christian]] [[theology]], especially in popular versions of the same, the charge of legalism is an accusation of overzealous adherence to the word of the Bible (as law) in all things said, established or accomplished in a believer's life (cf. [[bibliolatry]]). In that context, to apply the criticism of legalism to a theological position or religious attitude implies that the accused has overturned the Gospel of [[salvation]] through [[faith]] and new life in Jesus Christ and has instead substituted some principle of personal works of strict adherence to the word, through action, thought, or speech for the unearned [[divine grace|grace]] of God.

===In history===

Throughout the [[history of Christianity]], certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the article/interview [http://www.puntoacroce.altervista.org/_Den/T1-Legalismo_Sh.htm "Il legalismo? Parliamone (Legalism? Let's talk about it)"], with the participation of Nicola Martella, Alessandro Ceralli, Silvano Creaco, ''et al.'' {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* [[Asceticism]], such as [[fasting]] and other forms of self-denial.
* The keeping of [[Christian Sabbath]], especially regarding prohibitions of various otherwise innocent activities on the day of worship.
* Various extra-biblical [[religious law|ordinances]] and customs that become associated not just with wisdom but with holiness, in the contemporary situation, such as prohibitions against [[theater]], [[movies]], [[dance|dancing]], [[rock music]], [[playing card]]s, [[interracial marriage]] or [[mixed bathing]].
* Total abstinence from alcohol (See also [[Christianity and alcohol]].)
* [[Ritualism]], a superficial or superstitious use of customary [[prayer]]s and [[liturgy]].
* Similarly, certain exclusive [[ritual]] practices, such as rigorous insistence on the [[tetragrammaton]] as the only name by which God is honored, dietary laws, [[Saturday Sabbath]], or [[Passover (Christian holiday)]], especially when practicing these rituals is held necessary for salvation.
* [[Sacrament]]s, especially when the underlying theology allegedly views them as communicating God's grace automatically (compare [[ex opere operato]]).
* Various rigorous and restrictive beliefs, such as that, [[King-James-Only Movement|only the King James Version]] of the Bible constitutes God's word.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', [https://books.google.com/books/about/One_Bible_Only.html?id=uQWTxDdIO6IC&amp;redir_esc=y Beacham, Roy E.; Kevin T. Bauder, ''One Bible Only? Examining Exclusive Claims for the King James Bible'', Kregel Publications, 2001].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The belief that Christian families should [[homeschooling|homeschool]].
* The belief that women should never wear pants or shorts.
* [[Iconoclasm]]
* [[Tithing]]
* [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]]
* [[Puritan]]ism
* [[Judaizing]]
* [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]]
* [[Christian Reconstructionism]], which is based on the belief that Christians should still obey and enforce the full Mosaic law.

Several underlying dynamics appear in these controversies.  The permitted scope of [[veneration]] of material objects versus claims that such veneration is [[idolatry]], affects the perceived sanctity of ritual spaces and objects, and therefore of the rituals and customs themselves. Teachings about the authority of the church, the sources of legitimacy of that authority, and the role of [[clergy]] versus the [[priesthood of all believers]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Protestant Heritage" ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2007), [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109446 ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 20/09/2007]: "Protestantism originated in the 16th-century Reformation, and its basic doctrines, in addition to those of the ancient Christian creeds, are justification by grace alone through faith, the priesthood of all believers, and the supremacy of Holy Scripture in matters of faith and order."&lt;/ref&gt; also affect these debates.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}

A '''lone wolf''' is an animal or person that generally lives or spends time alone instead of with a group.&lt;ref name="reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lone+wolf|title=Lone wolf - Define Lone wolf at Dictionary.com|work=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originates from [[wolf]] behavior. Normally a [[Pack hunter|pack animal]], wolves that have left or been excluded from their [[Pack (canine)|pack]] are described as lone wolves.

==Animal==
{{Main|Gray wolf#Social and territorial behaviors}}
As an animal, a lone wolf is a [[wolf]] that lives independently rather than with others as a member of a [[pack (canine)|pack]].

In the animal kingdom, lone wolves are typically older female wolves driven from the pack, perhaps by the breeding male, or young adults in search of new territory. Many female wolves between the ages of one to four years old leave their family to search for a pack of their own. This has the effect of preventing inbreeding as there is typically only one breeding pair in a wolf pack. Very few wolves will simply remain lone wolves; as such, these lone wolves may be stronger, more aggressive and far more dangerous than the average wolf that is a member of a pack. However, lone wolves have difficulty hunting, as wolves' favorite prey, large [[ungulate]]s, are troublesome for a single wolf to bring down alone. Instead, lone wolves will generally hunt smaller animals and scavenge [[carrion]].&lt;ref name="Denali"&gt;Mech L.D., Adams L.G., Meier T.J., Burch J.W., Dale B.W. (1998) The Wolves of Denali. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Person==
As a person, a lone wolf is an individual who prefers [[solitude]], expresses [[Introversion|introversion]], or works alone.&lt;ref name="reference.com"/&gt;

In literature, lone wolves are aloof and emotionally unable or unwilling to directly interact with other characters in the story. A stereotypical lone wolf will be dark or serious in personality; they are often taciturn and distinguished by their reserved nature. A lone wolf often has undergone some emotional trauma which separates them from the crowd.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Lone wolf of the group===
A similar concept is the lone wolf of a particular group, who spends enough time with a group to be considered a member but not enough time to be very close to the other members. Such people tend to not take part in the group activities or "get-togethers". Part of this concept arises from the fact that the lone wolf has been pushed away from the group but still has a very strong bond to the "pack". He or she will use the traits of the former pack to find and develop a new one if possible. This may involve establishing mating dominance of a certain member of another pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfcountry.net/information/WolfPack.html|title=The Wolf Pack}}&lt;/ref&gt; This refreshes the idea that this behavior is suggestive of rejected inbreeding within a social system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2409">'''''Mākutu''''' in  the  [[Māori language]] of [[New Zealand]] means "[[witchcraft]]", [[magic (paranormal)| "sorcery"]], "to bewitch"; and also a "spell or incantation".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Herbert W., 1975. ''A Dictionary of the Māori Language''. 7th edition. Wellington: Government Printer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-CowYest-t1-body-d1-d6.html The Maori: Yesterday and To-day Chapter VI. – Makutu: – The Belief in Witchcraft]&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be described as a belief in malignant occult powers possessed by certain people.

[[Elsdon Best]] (1859-1931) portrayed the belief in mākutu as "universal and prominent in pre-European times", stating that it acted as "a disciplinary force in the old days; it was one of the substitutes for civil law that preserved order in a Māori community".&lt;ref name = "Best"&gt;Best, Elsdon, 1982. ''Māori Religion and Mythology, Part 2''. Dominion Museum Bulletin No.11. Museum of New Zealand: Wellington.&lt;/ref&gt; Best noted that the effectiveness of mākutu was heightened by the fact that it could be carried out in secret; the element of uncertainty produced caution on the part of those who might otherwise transgress the laws of the community. It was widely believed{{by whom?|date=August 2015}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} that those expert in mākutu were able to use the art to kill people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} But there were limits on their freedom to act: should an irresponsible practitioner of the dark arts become a nuisance to a tribe, the solution to the problem simply involved killing the errant magician without delay. The training undergone by an apprentice was long and difficult, involving secret rituals and tests.&lt;ref name = "Best"/&gt; &lt;!-- Best 1982:102-108). --&gt;

An [[Wainuiomata Mākutu Lifting|October 2007 mākutu-lifting]] in the [[Lower Hutt]] suburb of [[Wainuiomata]] led to the death by drowning of a woman and the hospitalisation of a teen, allegedly due to attempts to remove such a curse.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Manifold: Origin''''' (2001) is a science fiction novel by British author [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], the third instalment in the ''[[Manifold Trilogy]]''. As with the other books, the protagonist Reid Malenfant is put through a scenario dealing with the [[Fermi paradox]]. Each novel is an alternative scenario rather than a chronological sequel, and does not occur in the same universe. ''Manifold: Origin'' explores primate evolution to create an explanation for our lack of contact with other intelligent species.

The scenario begins when a [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] appears in the sky and transports a select few individuals including Malenfant's wife to a new red moon which has appeared in place of the moon we know. Blaming himself, Malenfant launches a mission to find his wife and solve the Fermi Paradox once and for all.

==Reception==
Jeff Zaleski was mixed in his review for [[Publishers Weekly]] saying that "a variety of characters speculate on the simpler aspects of Darwinian theory, but somewhat disappointingly they all reach the same conclusion. Gratuitous violence from time to time offers relief from the challenge of keeping straight the host of loosely related story lines. Baxter fans should be well satisfied, but those who prefer more thought-provoking SF will need to look elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Zaleski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaleski|first=Jeff|date=28 January 2002|title=MANIFOLD (Book)|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume= 249|issue= 4|pages=276|issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roland Green in his review for [[Booklist]] was much more positive saying "Baxter uses many more characters and viewpoint shifts than [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in support of a theme that  recalls Clarke's classic ''[[Childhood's End]]'' (1953). He also details survival in primitive societies unsparingly; as a result, much of the book is not for the weak of stomach. Lovers of intelligent variations on classic sf themes, however, will embrace this worthy successor to Manifold: Time (2000) and Manifold: Space (2001)."&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Roland|date=15 January 2002|journal=Booklist|volume= 98|issue= 9/10|pages=774|issn=0006-7385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of South Korea''' ({{lang-ko|국기에 대한 맹세}}, {{Literal translation|"Vow about the national flag"}}) is the pledge to the national [[Flag of South Korea|flag]] of [[South Korea]]. The pledge is recited at flag ceremonies immediately before the [[Aegukga|South Korean national anthem]].

Unlike the current pledge which pledges allegiance to the state of South Korea, the 1972 pledge rather pledged allegiance to the "[[Korean ethnic nationalism|Korean race]]", also known as the ''minjok''.&lt;ref name=REKelly2015&gt;{{Cite web|first=Robert E. |last=Kelly |url=http://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2015/06/04/why_south_korea_is_so_obsessed_with_japan_108014.html |title=Why South Korea is So Obsessed with Japan |date=June 4, 2015 |work=Real Clear Defense |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324194031/http://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2015/06/04/why_south_korea_is_so_obsessed_with_japan_108014.html |archivedate=March 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BRMyersSKTULR&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/korea/south-korea-unloved-republic |first=Brian Reynolds |last=Myers |authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers |title=South Korea: The Unloved Republic? |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=May 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519065927/http://asiasociety.org/korea/south-korea-unloved-republic |archivedate=May 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OathChosunIlbo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/04/18/2011041801112.html |title=New Pledge of Allegiance to Reflect Growing Multiculturalism |quote=The military has decided to omit the word 'minjok,' which refers to the Korean race, from the oath of enlistment for officers and soldiers, and replace it with 'the citizen.'

In the mid-2000s, the pledging of allegiance to a "Korean race" or "Korean nation" was criticized by some people as being [[Racism in South Korea|racist]] and "not appropriate at a time when South Korea is becoming a multi-racial and multicultural society."&lt;ref name=JHJeong2006&gt;{{Cite |title=A pledge to a nation, or a gang oath? |last=Jeong |first=Jeong-hun |date=2006 |work=The Hankyoreh |publisher=The Hankyoreh Media Company |location=South Korea }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the pledge was discontinued in July 2007, during the presidency of [[Roh Moo-hyun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sthelepress.com/index.php/2016/12/28/still-the-unloved-republic/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313210134/http://sthelepress.com/index.php/2016/12/28/still-the-unloved-republic/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 13, 2018|title=Still the Unloved Republic|first=B rian R.|last=Myers|date=December 28, 2016|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced with non-racist wording. Some left-wing South Koreans condemned the re-wording of the country's pledge of allegiance to non-racial phraseology as it went against their ideology.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/North+Korea's+state-loyalty+advantage.-a0274114570|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180520092751/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/North+Korea's+state-loyalty+advantage.-a0274114570|deadurl=yes|last=Myers|first=Brian Reynolds|authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers|title=North Korea's state-loyalty advantage.|work=Free Online Library|date=20 May 2018|archivedate=20 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, until April 2011, South Korean army soldiers swore allegiance to the "Korean race" in their oaths of enlistment until that too was discontinued for similar reasons.&lt;ref name=OathChosunIlbo/&gt;

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Punch Line episodes}}
Yūta Iridatsu lives at the Korai House apartment complex with four girls: Mikatan Narugino, Ito Hikiotani, Meika Daihatsu, and Lovera  Chichibu. One day, following a busjacking incident, Yūta finds himself ejected from his own body and becoming a spirit. Guided by the cat spirit Chiranosuke, Yūta must learn to master his spirit powers in order to protect his housemates from the various circumstances they find themselves in. However, if Yūta sees a girl's panties twice in a row, the Earth will be destroyed by a meteor.

==Characters==
;{{Nihongo|Yūta Iridatsu|伊里達 遊太|Iridatsu Yūta}}
:{{voiced by|[[Marina Inoue]]}}
:The main protagonist. Yūta's soul was separated from his body following the bus hijacking incident. Yūta must search for Sacred Tome of Koraikan in order to return to his physical body. Whenever he sees a girl's panties, he gains a burst of strength known as Über-fy powers, but upon seeing panties twice in succession, Yūta gains too much stimulation and loses consciousness, which somehow results in a meteor destroying Earth, though he can go back in time to prevent that. He has a small amount of spiritual abilities, which increases upon 'levelling up', but can also perform more advanced abilities, such as possession, when there is cinnamon in the vicinity. In episode 7, it is revealed that Yūta was originally a boy named {{nihongo|'''Pine'''|パイン|Pain}} who ended up switching bodies with a girl named Chiyoko. As such, Yūta is biologically female, with his legal name being {{nihongo|Yū Iridatsu|伊里達 遊|Iridatsu Yū}}. "Yūta Iridatsu" is a pun on the phrase {{nihongo|"astral projection"|幽体離脱|yūtai ridatsu}}.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;
;{{Nihongo|Mikatan Narugino|成木野 みかたん|Narugino Mikatan}}
:{{voiced by|[[Sora Amamiya]]}}
:A member of the idol group "Seas May", who secretly fights crime as the magical girl Strange Juice. Whenever she is flustered or alone, she ends up speaking in the [[Tsugaru dialect]] which she picked up in her early childhood. Similar to Yūta, she possesses Uber-fy powers for her crimefighting, but these have a strong side-effect on her body which requires constant medication. It is later revealed that she is {{nihongo|'''Chiyoko'''|ちよ子}}, whose soul went out of the body Yūta possesses and into the body of Guriko.&lt;ref name=offsite&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.punchline.jp/character/|title= Official website for punchline|publisher=Aniplex| access-date=16 April 2015|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the characters in her name are read differently, her name is a pun on the phrase {{nihongo|"ally of justice"|正義の味方|seigi no mikata}}.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201503/15074054.html |script-title=ja:ノイタミナアニメ『パンチライン』ゲーム版発表！ アニメ＆ゲーム制作のきっかけを、打越鋼太郎氏に独占インタビュー（前編） |publisher=famitsu.com |type=Interview with scriptwriter|date=2015-03-15 |accessdate=16 April 2015|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{voiced by|[[Minako Kotobuki]]}}
:A NEET who spends most of her time playing online games and taking care of her pet Muhi, a bear cub. Her name is a pun on the term {{nihongo|"HikiOtaNEET"|ヒキオタニート}}, a portmanteau of [[hikikomori]], [[otaku]], and [[NEET]].
;{{Nihongo|Meika Daihatsu|台初 明香|Daihatsu Meika}}
:{{voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]}}
:A robot who happens to be the landlady of the apartment all the characters are living in. She is also a genius inventor, and has unrivalled hacking skills. However, she has very poor physical reflexes.  She speaks in the [[Kansai dialect]]. Her name is a pun on the phrase {{nihongo|"great inventor"|大発明家|Daihatsumei-ka}}.&lt;ref name="offsite"/&gt; She is Pumpkin Chair.
;{{Nihongo|Lovera Chichibu|秩父 ラブラ|Chichibu Rabura}}
:{{voiced by|[[Haruka Tomatsu]]}}
:A [[gyaru]] who works as an exorcist. Despite her profession, she does not believe in the existence of spirits. She can be temporarily possessed by Yūta when there is cinnamon in the vicinity. Her name is a pun on {{nihongo|"''chichi burabura ''"|乳ブラブラ||lit. "breasts dangling"}}.&lt;ref name="offsite"/&gt;
;{{Nihongo|Chiranosuke|チラ之助|Chiranosuke}}
:{{voiced by|Yuri Yoshida}}
:A talking cat spirit who informs Yūta about spirit powers and serves as a guide to get him to save the world. In episode 12, it is revealed that Chiranosuke is a cat that Ito Hikiotani's friend from technical school gave to her. He/she is a chinchilla, which is a type of Persian Cat.
;{{nihongo|Ryūto Teraoka|寺岡 龍都|Teraoka Ryūto}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kenji Akabane]]}}

;{{nihongo|Chihaya Tomoda|友田 千早|Tomoda Chihaya}}
:{{voiced by|Jun Oosuka}}
:Ito's homeroom teacher, who has a deranged admiration for Ito. Merging with Q-May's spirit, Tomoda becomes a masked soldier, referred to the residents as {{nihongo|"Turtle Man"|亀男|Kame Otoko}}, and is able to use Über-fy powers.
;{{nihongo|Kenji Miyazawa|宮沢 賢治|Miyazawa Kenji}}
:{{voiced by|[[Marina Inoue]]}}
:A costumed vigilante who shows up out of nowhere and possesses the same Uber-fy powers as Yūta. It is later revealed that this is another version of Yūta, who goes back in time from a previous time loop and possesses his present day body whenever the plan to save the world fails, eventually becoming an identity the present Yūta assumes when he goes back in time.
;{{nihongo|Akina Iridatsu|伊里達 秋奈|Iridatsu Akina}}
:{{voiced by|[[Mariko Honda]]}}
:Yūta's foster sister, who found him after he had switched into Chiyoko's body. She is the one who sends Yūta the Kenji Miyazawa costume.

In [[China|Chinese]] and other [[East Asia]]n  and [[Southeast Asia]]n societies, a '''red envelope''', '''red packet''', '''''lì xì''''' (Vietnamese), '''''lai see''''' ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]), '''''âng-pau''''' ([[Hokkien]]) or '''''hóngbāo''''' ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]) is a monetary gift which is given during holidays or special occasions such as weddings, graduation or the birth of a baby.

Outside of China, similar customs have been adopted across parts of Southeast Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population. 

In China, the Chinese mobile app [[WeChat]] popularized the distribution of red envelopes in 2014 via [[mobile payments]] over the internet. This method of distributing red envelopes is now quite popular in the country.

==Usage==
Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as [[Chinese marriage|weddings]] or holidays such as [[Chinese New Year]]. The [[Color in Chinese culture|red color]] of the [[envelope]] symbolizes [[good luck]] and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called ''tao hongbao'' ({{zh|t=討紅包|hp=tǎo hóngbāo}}) or ''yao lishi'' ({{zh|t=要利是|hp=yào lì shì|links=no}}), and in the south of China, ''dou li shi'' ({{zh|t=逗利是|hp=dòu lì shì||cy=dau6 lai6 si6|links=no}}). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.

The amount of money contained in the envelope usually ends with an even digit, in accordance with [[Numbers in Chinese culture|Chinese beliefs]]; odd-numbered money gifts are traditionally associated with funerals.  The exception being the number 9 as it pronunciation of ''nine'' is homophonus to the word ''long'' and is the largest digit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fengshuiweb.co.uk/advice/angpow.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Still in some regions of China and in [[Chinese diaspora|its diaspora community]], odd numbers are favored for weddings because they are difficult to divide. There is also a widespread tradition that money should not be given in fours, or the number four should not appear in the amount, such as in 40, 400 and 444, as the pronunciation of the word ''four'' is homophonous to the word ''death''.

At wedding banquets, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as signify goodwill to the newlyweds. Amounts given are often recorded in ceremonial ledgers for the new couple to keep.

During the Chinese New Year, in Southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the married to the unmarried, most of whom are children. In northern and southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the elders to the younger under 25 (30 in most of the three northeastern provinces), regardless of marital status, while in some regions red envelopes are only given to the young people without jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Students and future students in the sciences are typically rewarded handsomely&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of money is usually notes to avoid heavy coins and to make it difficult to judge the amount inside before opening. It is traditional to put brand new notes inside red envelopes and also to avoid opening the envelopes in front of the relatives out of courtesy.

It is also given during the Chinese New Year in workplace from a person of authority (supervisors or owner of the business) out of his own fund to employees as a token of good fortune for the upcoming year.

In acting, it is also conventional to give an actor a red packet when he or she is to play a dead character, or pose for a picture for an obituary or a grave stone. 

Red packets are also used to deliver payment for favorable service to [[lion dance]] performers, religious practitioners, teachers, and doctors.

=== Digital red envelopes ===
During the Chinese New Year holiday in 2014, the [[mobile app|mobile]] [[instant messaging]] service [[WeChat]] introduced the ability to distribute virtual red envelopes of money to contacts and groups via its [[mobile payment]] platform. The feature became considerably popular, owing to its contemporary interpretation of the traditional practice, and a promotional giveaway held during the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]], China's most-watched television special, where viewers could win red envelopes as prizes. Adoption of WeChat Pay saw a major increase following the launch, and two years later, over 32 billion virtual envelopes were sent over the Chinese New Year holiday in 600bc (itself a tenfold increase over 2015). The popularity spawned a "red envelope war" between WeChat owner [[Tencent]] and its historic rival, [[Alibaba Group]], which added a similar function to its competing messaging service and has held similar giveaway promotions, and imitations of the feature from other vendors.&lt;ref name="fastco-redpacket"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Social Cash Made WeChat The App For Everything|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money|website=Fast Company|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Doug|title=Red envelope wars in China, Xiaomi eyes US|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1715981/red-envelope-wars-china-xiaomi-eyes-us|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chun|first1=Flora|last2=Lee|first2=Chun|title=Silicon Valley Startup Reinvents an Ancient Tradition: The Red Envelope|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1238540-silicon-valley-startup-reinvents-an-ancient-tradition-the-red-envelope/|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=Epoch Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts estimated that over 100 billion digital red envelopes would be sent over the New Year holiday in 2017.&lt;ref name="bbc-virtual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why this Chinese New Year will be a digital money fest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38746298|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-01-13/tencent-alibaba-send-lunar-new-year-revelers-money-hunting-101043798.html|title=Tencent, Alibaba Send Lunar New Year Revelers Money-Hunting - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In China, during the [[Qin Dynasty]], the elderly would thread coins with a red string. The money was referred to as "money warding off evil spirits" ({{zh|t=壓祟錢|hp=yāsuì qián|links=no}}) and was believed to protect the person of younger generation from sickness and death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The ''yasui qian'' was replaced by red envelopes when printing presses became more common and is now found written using the homophone for ''{{lang|zh|suì}}'' that means "old age" instead of "evil spirits" thus, "money warding off old age" ({{zh|t=壓歲錢|hp=yāsuì qián|links=no}}). Red envelopes continue to be referred to by such names today.

==Other customs==
Other similar traditions also exist in other countries in Asia. In [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and [[Cambodia]], the Chinese diaspora and immigrants have introduced the culture of red envelopes.

In Cambodia, red envelopes are called Ang Pav or Tae Ea(give Ang Pav). Ang Pav is delivered with best wishes from elder to younger generations. The money amount in Ang Pav makes young children happy and is a most important gift which traditionally reflects the best wishes as a symbol of good luck for the elders. Ang Pav can be presented in the day of Chinese New Year or "Saen Chen", when relatives gather together. The gift is kept as a worship item in or under the pillowcase, or somewhere else, especially near the bed of young while they are sleeping in New Year time. Gift in Ang Pav can be either money or a cheque, and more or less according to the charity of the donors.
The tradition of the delivery of Ang Pav traditionally descended from one generation to another a long time ago. Ang Pav will not be given to some one in family who has got a career, but this person has to, in return, deliver it to their parents and/or their younger children or siblings.
At weddings, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as help the newly married couple.

In Vietnam, red envelopes are considered to be lucky money and are typically given to children. They are generally given by the elders and adults, where a greeting or offering health and longevity is exchanged by the younger generation. Common greetings include "Sống lâu trăm tuổi", "An khang thịnh vượng" (安康興旺), "Vạn sự như ý" (萬事如意) and Sức khỏe dồi dào, which all relate back to the idea of wishing health and prosperity as age besets everyone in Vietnam on the Lunar New Year. The typical name for lucky money is lì xì or, less commonly, mừng tuổi.

In South Korea and Japan, a monetary gift is given to children by their relatives during the New Year period. In both countries, however, white envelopes are used instead of red, with the name of the receiver written on the back. A similar practice, [[Shūgi-bukuro]], is observed for Japanese weddings, but the envelope is folded rather than sealed, and decorated with an elaborate bow.

In the [[Philippines]], [[Chinese Filipino]]s exchange red envelopes (termed ''ang pao'') during the Lunar New Year, which is an easily recognisable symbol. The red envelope has gained wider acceptance among non-Chinese Filipinos, who have appropriated the custom for other occasions such as birthdays, and in giving monetary ''[[aguinaldo]]'' during [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas]].

Red packets as a form of bribery in China's film industry were revealed in 2014's [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|Sony hack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox-Brewster|first1=Thomas|title=Inside Sony's Mysterious 'Red Pockets': Hackers Blow Open China Bribery Probe|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/12/13/sony-pictures-hackers-reveal-mysterious-red-packets-payments-in-china/|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green envelope===
{{Main|Green envelope}}
[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] Muslims in [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Singapore]] have adopted the Chinese custom of handing out monetary gifts in envelopes as part of their [[Eid al-Fitr]] ([[Bahasa Melayu|Malay]]: ''[[Hari Raya Aidilfitri]]'') celebrations, but instead of red packets, green envelopes are used. Customarily a family will have (usually small) amounts of money in green envelopes ready for [[Hospitality|visitors]], and may send them to friends and family unable to visit. [[Green#Religion|Green]] is used for its traditional association with [[Islam]], and the adaptation of the red envelope is based on the Muslim custom of ''[[sadaqah]]'', or voluntary charity. While present in the [[Qur'an]], ''sadaqah'' is much less formally established than the sometimes similar practice of ''[[zakat]]'', and in many cultures this takes a form closer to gift-giving and generosity among friends than charity in the strict sense, i.e. no attempt is made to give more to guests "in need", nor is it as a religious obligation as Islamic charity is often viewed.

===Purple envelope===
The tradition of ''ang pao'' has also been adopted by the local Indian Hindu populations of [[Indian Singaporeans|Singapore]] and [[Malaysian Indian|Malaysia]] for [[Diwali|Deepavali]]. They are known as ''Deepavali ang pow'' (in Malaysia), ''purple ang pow'' or simply ''ang pow'' (in Singapore).&lt;ref&gt;http://design-cu.jp/iasdr2013/papers/1893-1b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow coloured envelopes for Deepavali have also been available at times in the past.&lt;ref&gt;http://chinesenewyearlanterns.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/uses-of-ang-pow-among-different-races.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=February 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">'''Regional heritage''' consists of the natural and cultural environments and associated [[intangible cultural heritage]] that is perceived to be of importance in a region. The word “regional heritage” is a parallel to the word [[world heritage]] but does not refer to a specific object, but rather sets of sites, buildings and landscapes perceived to be valuable. Regional heritage are not formally appointed. Instead, it is subject to constant evaluation and discussion, and appears more or less clearly in the consensus among local, regional and national stakeholders.

Regional heritage is physical environments, as perceived by humans. And in addition, its history, stories, customs and the "[[genius loci]]" that are constantly recreated and is transferred from generation to generation, creating a sense of identity and continuity.

Keith Dewar writes: "Heritage can be world heritage, regional heritage, or it can belong to a particular culture or simply to an extended family. Heritage should not be seen simply as cultural elements, since the natural environment also contains places of significance. Heritage value can be found in a national park or a farm woodlot. Natural sites are not necessarily in the past; they exist and are alive in the present."

'''Semi-submarines''' are [[Semi-submersible|submersibles]] vessels that are capable of diving, similarly to [[submarine]]s. However, unlike submarines, they cannot be entirely submerged below the surface of the water.

== Design ==
The most common design is one similar to a ship. The passenger cabin is relatively low, a few meters below [[sea level]]. The cabin is equipped with large windows into the water. The passengers can observe the marine environment that is passed during the voyage.

There are significant differences between a [[submarine]] and a semi-submarine from an engineering point of view. Submarines are human-occupied pressure vessels, while pressure concerns apply to a lesser extent to semi-submarines. As the pressure close to the water surface is relatively low, the viewing windows can be bigger. In some advanced designs the windows enclose the majority of the submersed hull, creating an experience comparable to [[scuba diving]]. Customers can leave the submerged cabin for the unsubmerged deck at any time.

== Use ==
Semi-submarines can be used for [[Research vessel|research]], but they are most commonly used in the [[tourism]] industry. However, large tourism-orientated semi submarines should not be confused with [[narco-submarine]]s which are smaller home-made semi-submarines used to smuggle drugs.

== Legal status ==
Semi-submarines do not have an international classified status. Their operating range from the native port might be limited by the local authorities.

A '''sewing gauge''' is a [[ruler]], typically 6&amp;nbsp;inches long, used for measuring short spaces. A space no longer than 6 inches in diameter.

In general, Ghanaians emphasize [[Community|communal]] values such as [[family]], the importance of [[dignity]], and proper [[Behavior|social conduct]].&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

==Conduct==
Individual conduct is seen as impacting their entire family, social group, and community; therefore everyone is expected to be respectful, dignified, and observant in public settings and in most aspects of life.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africayouthinaction.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=29|accessdate=16 January 2012|title=About Ghana – Social Conduct|publisher=africayouthinaction.org|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greetings==
When greeting people in a home, it is considered improper if the guest ignores anyone present. Guests are expected to acknowledge and greet every person at a social occasion, including children and babies.

When shaking hands, it is appropriate for the guest to first greet the person on their right-hand side, and then work their way left. This ensures that the guest's palm makes contact with the palm of the person receiving the handshake - touching the back of the hand instead of the palm is considered insulting or unlucky. Guests are expected to greet the most elderly person present first.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

The same ritual is expected to be observed upon departure and should be carried out until sufficient familiarity has been established, at which point the ritual becomes redundant.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

When greeting dignitaries, this procedure is expected to be carried out by all persons present regardless of age or status.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

==Invitations==
Asking a person to a social event (e.g. a [[tavern|bar]] or a [[restaurant]]) implies that the person offering the invite will be paying for everything. Inviting a person out and then expecting them to pay for themselves is considered extremely rude. When a foreigner is invited to visit a home or community, the guest is expected to bring a gift, commonly a bottle of [[Schnapps]] or Kasapreko [[gin]] which is available in any shop.

==Special occasions==
[[Ghanaian name|Naming ceremonies]] and [[wedding|marriages]] are marked by family ceremonies. Seasonal festivals serve to bring people together in a spectacular fashion.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

When attending funerals, weddings, or naming ceremonies; women, including foreign women, must cover their heads with a hat or simple black cloth wound around the head. A man must not have his head covered.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
It is unacceptable for women, particularly young foreign women, to wear revealing clothing. Women's clothing that would be acceptable in the West (shorts, low-cut strapped tops, etc.) is not socially acceptable in Ghanaian society. Similarly it is unacceptable for foreign men to be shirtless in public, and unacceptable for Ghanaian men to a lesser degree. Ghanaian social norms are sometimes difficult to establish as younger adults are generally much less inhibited about wearing revealing clothing or being shirtless, while older Ghanaian citizens may find such apparel to be insulting. A general rule is to dress conservatively unless in the company of people of one's own gender or age with whom one is well-acquainted.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

Drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[smoking]] in public are serious ''faux pas'' and should be avoided. Public [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]] to any degree is generally viewed with extreme disapproval. Such activities are perfectly acceptable in a local bar though. When drinking alcohol, it is a common custom to pour the last few drops on the ground as a libation for the gods. People who decline from drinking alcohol may accept an alcoholic drink with gratitude, raise it to their lips without drinking, and then pour it on the ground. Raising the glass to the lips signifies gratitude and pouring the drink away is thus a socially acceptable alternative for those who do not drink. This custom permits non-drinking Ghanaians to join social events without offending those present by refusing a drink.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

Taking photographs of people unknown to the photographer must be conducted with the same level of consideration as in one's own country. Most Ghanaians are happy to pose for pictures, as it is considered polite.&lt;ref name="About Ghana – Social Conduct"/&gt;

'''''Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain''''' is a [[third-person shooter]] [[stealth video game]] developed by [[SIE Bend Studio|SCE Bend Studio]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] for [[PlayStation 2]]. It is the fourth game in the [[Syphon Filter|''Syphon Filter'' series]].

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is a huge departure from the previous games. Rather than playing as Gabe Logan, the player is given the role of a new recruit working for Gabe's secret [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorist]] organization, the IPCA. Players are able to create an original agent using a character customization system.

The game also gives a [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]], [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]] experience where players are given choices to take on certain tasks, or avoid them altogether. [[Role-playing game (video games)|RPG elements]] were added so that players could create characters, level up their ranks, and unlock new weapons. Enemies constantly spawn so that players can never completely clear an area.&lt;ref name="ps2.gamespy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/syphon-filter-dark-mirror/795164p2.html |title=GameSpy: Sony Bend Talks Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror for PS2 - Page 2 |publisher=Ps2.gamespy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Following the destruction of the original Syphon Filter virus, Gabriel Logan repurposes the agency Agency as the International Presidential Consulting Agency, serving as a counterterrorism unit. As Commander-in-Chief, Logan has Lian Xing, Teresa Lipan, Lawrence Mujari, and Dr. Elsa Weissenger serve as his officers.

An Agency team headed by Imani Gray is deployed to a besieged Carthage, Michigan in order to rescue Mujari, who disappeared while investigating Dr. Richard Broussard’s ties with the Anarchiste Liberation Army. Imani and her team successfully rescue Mujari, and assassinate the ALA leadership then prepare for their next assignment.

Meanwhile, IPCA commander Gary Stoneman assassinates Italian mafia leader Dimitri Alexopoulous to prevent his acquisition of the Omega Strain in Italy. The team follows Stone to Belarus and tracks a shipment of infected cattle to Ivankov’s residence. They discover that his courier Yuschenko is selling the Omega Strain, and Agency pilot Alima Haddad is captured by the Chechens during the operation.

During the Belarus operation, Lian is deployed to Kyrgistan in order to eliminate an arms deal involving a local warlord and the North Koreans.

Gabe reluctantly enlists help from Mossad agent Ehud Ben Zohar upon determining Yuschenko’s plans to sell the virus to Fatha Al-Hassan, a Yemeni leader. Zohar only cares about stopping Al-Hassan’s network, so he steals the viral canister after the Agency retrieves it from Yuschenko. Zohar and the team enter Al-Hassan's palace disguised as the dead Chechens in order to assassinate him.  In the aftermath, they exchange the contracts for the virus.

The team investigates a lead recovered from the Belarus operation that shows Dr. Nikolai Jandran is conducting virus tests at a local university. Maggie Powers assists in recovering evidence before the university’s destruction.

Shortly after recovering, Mujari conducts his own investigation into the Chechens and photographs  Russian forces committing war atrocities for future blackmail. Afterwards, Mujari takes control of the Agency team as they check the wreckage of the S.S. Lorelei. The university turned up salvaged boxes, indicating [[Syphon Filter 3|an undersea operation]].  The team evacuates the salvage rig before destroying the viral containers for good. However, Jandran dies from a serum before he can be brought back for questioning.

While Gabe faces pressure from the U.S. president and Alex Birchim of the White House Internal Affairs, he sends Lian and the team to track North Korean agent Yong-jun Kim, a man connected to the Yakuza’s Murakawa Industries in Japan. The investigation reveals that Murakawa was helping develop the Omega Strain. Aramov arrived before Lian and forced Murakawa to commit suicide for trusting Kim. Kim posed as an employee working with Murakawa so he could get the virus.

Shortly after destroying the Japanese labs, the team is re-deployed to recover Imani in Myanmar. The plane carrying Imani and Kim had been shot down.  Guilt-ridden, Lian takes the team to recover her body and the viral sample Kim was carrying. Despite claims that inclement weather brought down the jet, they find evidence indicating that Aramov had bribed the Myanmar army to shoot down the plane.

Gabe becomes frustrated with his investigation into the secret corporation Meta Global Funds, which he believes controls the Syphon Filter conspiracy. The purchase of Murakawa Industries by Meta Global was possible through Niculescu Funds, headed by international banker Mihai Niculescu. He deduces that  Niculescu as the mastermind behind the conspiracy. Against Birchim's commands, Gabe brings the Agency team to the headquarters in Zurich. They find evidence linking Birchim to bribes, but nothing implicating Niculescu, and upload a virus to sabotage Niculescu financially.

Gabe conducts a solo investigation into Niculescu's Montenegro estate in a final effort to expose him. Although he did not find physical evidence, he learns of Aramov’s ties to Niculescu and learns that Ivankov plans to nuke Russia.

Having learned of Ivankov's location from Mara, the Agency mobilises to his base and prevents the missile's launch. Stone recovers an injured Alima. Ivankov is eventually killed by Gabe while attempting to escape.&lt;ref name="SyphonFilterTheOmegaStrain"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain|developer=[[SIE Bend Studio]]|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to tissue and virus samples recovered by the IPCA, a vaccine for the Omega Strain virus is successfully synthesized, ending the threat with the aid of the [[World Health Organization]]. The President congratulates the IPCA and has Birchim arrested. Niculescu is killed by two anonymous gunmen as a result of his bank’s sabotage. Dr. Weissenger gives a written admission that she had the recruit kill Dr. Jandran, as well as signs of mental instability before disappearing from the Agency. Lastly, Stone aims his rifle at Aramov to assassinate her on Logan’s order.&lt;ref name="SyphonFilterTheOmegaStrain"/&gt;

==Development==
In a June 2007 interview with [[GameSpy]], franchise veteran John Garvin maintained his attachment to the game, and explained that it was originally not intended to feature a single player mode. Garvin implied that the ability to play through the campaign alone had been tacked on at the demand of parent company Sony Computer Entertainment, late into the development process, in order to broaden the game's appeal.&lt;ref name="ps2.gamespy.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2609">[[File:Te Kōrero Māori dance group (7374413142).jpg|thumb|280px|Dance troupe performing in the Cook Islands]]

The '''tāmūrē''', or Tamouré as popularized in many 1960s recordings, is a dance from [[Tahiti]] and the [[Cook Islands]] and although denied by the local purists, for the rest of the world it is the most popular dance and the mark of Tahiti. Usually danced as a group of boys and girls, all dressed in ''more'' (the Tahitian [[grass skirt]], however not made of grass but of the fibers from the bark of the ''pūrau'' ([[hibiscus]])). 

The boys shake their knees (as scissors, from there the use of the word ''pā{{okina}}oti'' (scissors) for this movement), and the girls shake their hips (and their long, loose hairs, if they have them). In reality the movement of their knees is the engine which drives their hips. Their feet should stay flat on the ground and their shoulders should remain stationary. However traditionally in the Ote'a or Ura Pa'u, the hips in Tahiti are shaken round and round (in what is known as the fa'arapu) while in the Cook Islands the hips are in a side to side movement. But due to the tamure, this emphasis is less important. The movements of the hands is of secondary importance. The girls are largely standing still, the boys move around their partner, either facing her in front or hiding behind her back (as seen from the public). The tempo of the music is continuously increased up to the point where only the most experienced and fittest dancers can keep their shakings up. Depending on the performers, the sexual innuendo may be more or less obvious. The predecessor of the tāmūrē, the traditional [['upa'upa|{{okina}}upa{{okina}}upa]] was outlawed by the [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] missionaries for that reason.
Tāmūrē is a foreign word, the name of a fish in the [[Tuamotu]], the real name of the dance is ''{{okina}}ori Tahiti'' (Tahitian dance). Shortly after the Second World War a soldier of the Pacific battalion, Louis Martin, wrote a song on a classic rhythm in which he used the word tāmūrē quite often as a tra-la-la. He afterwards was known as Tāmūrē Martin, and a new genre was born.

'''Terminology extraction''' (also known as '''term''' extraction, '''glossary''' extraction, term '''recognition''', or terminology '''mining''') is a subtask of [[information extraction]]. The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given [[Text corpus|corpus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_19|chapter = SemCluster: Unsupervised Automatic Keyphrase Extraction Using Affinity Propagation|title = Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems|volume = 650|pages = 222–235|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2018|last1 = Alrehamy|first1 = Hassan H|last2 = Walker|first2 = Coral|isbn = 978-3-319-66938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[semantic web]] era, a growing number of communities and networked enterprises started to access and interoperate through the [[internet]]. Modeling these communities and their information needs is important for several [[web application]]s, like topic-driven [[web crawler]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Menczer F., Pant G. and Srinivasan P. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/menczer02topicdriven.html Topic-Driven Crawlers: machine learning issues].&lt;/ref&gt; [[web service]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Fan J. and Kambhampati S.

One of the first steps to model the [[Domain knowledge|knowledge domain]] of a [[virtual community]] is to collect a vocabulary of domain-relevant terms, constituting the linguistic surface manifestation of domain [[Ontology (computer science)#Classes .28concepts.29|concepts]].

Typically, approaches to automatic term extraction make use of linguistic processors ([[part of speech tagging]], [[phrase chunking]]) to extract terminological candidates, i.e. syntactically plausible terminological [[noun phrase]]s, NPs (e.g. compounds "credit card", adjective-NPs "local tourist information office", and prepositional-NPs "board of directors" - in English, the first two constructs are the most frequent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_19|chapter = SemCluster: Unsupervised Automatic Keyphrase Extraction Using Affinity Propagation|title = Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems|volume = 650|pages = 222–235|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2018|last1 = Alrehamy|first1 = Hassan H|last2 = Walker|first2 = Coral|isbn = 978-3-319-66938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Terminological entries are then filtered from the candidate list using statistical and [[machine learning]] methods. Once filtered, because of their low ambiguity and high specificity, these terms are particularly useful for conceptualizing a knowledge domain or for supporting the creation of a [[Ontology (computer science)#Domain ontologies and upper ontologies|domain ontology]] or a terminology base. Furthermore, terminology extraction is a very useful starting point for [[semantic similarity]], [[knowledge management]], [[translation|human translation]] and [[machine translation]], etc.

==Bilingual terminology extraction==

The methods for terminology extraction can be applied to [[parallel corpus|parallel corpora]]. Combined with e.g. [[co-occurrence]] statistics, candidates for term translations can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Macken, Lieve, Els Lefever, and Veronique Hoste.

'''''The Monster of Florence: A True Story''''' is a 2008 [[true crime]] book by American thriller writer [[Douglas Preston]] and Italian journalist [[Mario Spezi]]. It relates to [[Monster of Florence|a series of murders]] that occurred between 1968 and 1985 and involved couples who were killed while having sex in their cars in deserted lanes around the city of [[Florence]] in the Italian region of [[Tuscany]].

==Background==
Preston, an author of fiction and non-fiction books, moved to Florence with his family and became interested in the Monster of Florence case because the murders had taken place in the surrounding countryside. Mario Spezi, co-author of the book, is a journalist who specialized in the Monster of Florence case for many years. Preston and Spezi became friends and then collaborated on articles and books about the case. Both became figures in the case when the Italian prosecutors came to suspect them and accuse them of crimes including [[obstruction of justice]] and potentially being [[accomplice]]s to murder. Preston published an article about the case in American magazine ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/the-monster-of-florence/4981/ July/August issue, 2006, Atlantic Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The book recounts the authors' personal experiences while investigating the case and their problems of being accused by the Italian criminal justice system. Preston and Spezi are outspoken critics of the tactics and theories pursued by the Italian police and prosecutors in the Monster of Florence case.

==Film version==
In late 2008, film studio [[United Artists]] announced its purchase of the film rights to ''The Monster of Florence: a True Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=avww07YExLmY&amp;refer=home|title='Monster of Florence' Murders Expose Dark Side of Tuscan City|last=Scherer|first=Steve|date=September 18, 2008|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|accessdate=June 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the project was acquired by [[Fox 2000]] and is in development, with [[George Clooney]] attached as producer as well as to play the role of Preston.&lt;ref name="clooney"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0696409/news]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{One source|date=March 2008}}

The '''Vijayanagara musicological nonet''' or the '''''Sangitashastra navaratna''''' are a group of nine musicological treatises written during the reign of the [[Vijayanagara empire]].  These works are counted among the most important and definitive treatises in [[Carnatic music]] theory.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Each of these works contributed seminally to the growth of the [[Carnatic music]] tradition.  These nine works are the ''Sangitasara'' by the sage [[Vidyaranya]], ''Taladipika'' by Salva Gopa Tippendra, ''Sangitakalanidhi'' by Kallinatha, Bhandaru Vittaleshwara's commentary on the ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]'', Bhandaru Lakshminarayana's ''Sangitasuryodaya'', Achyutadevaraya's ''Talakalabdhi/Talakalavriddhi'' and the much celebrated ''[[Swaramelakalanidhi]]'' by Ramamatya.

==Historical milieu==
The reign of [[Vijayanagara empire]] was a watershed period in the cultural history of South India, particularly the history of Carnatic music.  The period witnessed the prolific contributions of numerous musicians, saints and theoreticians.  By virtue of the geo-political influence it exerted, Vijayanagara had become the confluence of many religions, art forms and cultures.  Society and culture went through a process of conflict and eclectic assimilation of the traditional and elite values on the one hand and the emerging folk and foreign influences on the other.  There was a strong interaction between traditional and elite values on the one hand and folk and foreign influences on the other.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Much of this was also the result of a reaction and revolt against emerging sociological and aesthetic trends.  Even as this assimilation and nativization of the contending or opposing influences took place, traditional purity and historical continuity continued to be preserved.  These cultural trends and objectives were later sustained and fostered in the several feudatory states that continued to thrive beyond the fall of the Vijayanagar empire.  Some of the notable states included Anegundi, Penukonda, Tanjore, [[Mysore Kingdom]], Madurai, [[Keladi Nayaka|Ikkeri]] etc.,.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Innovations in theory and practice==
A wide range of experiments and innovations were carried out in the field of instruments too.  The [[Tanpura (instrument)|Tamburi]] introduced during the period soon became the principal drone instrument.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Seminal work and innovations also took place in the Vina keyboards with regard to the accordatura, tonal range and instrumental parameters. The ''mela'' replaced the ''grama'' and it's the theoretical possibilities were fully explored through mathematical schemes of tabulation.  The innovation of the concept of ''mela'' and organization of the entirety of contemporary melodic material under its umbrella culminated in Venkatamakhin's ''Melakarta'' scheme, one which continues to influence greatly the theory and practice of Carnatic music to this day.  New classificatory models emerged for ragas; &lt;!--through psychoacoustical principles of temperament.--&gt; ''svayambhusvara'' (upper partials), ''paryaya-svara'' (alternative svara denomination) and ''pratinidhi-svara'' (representative note) scales and intervals were tuned to be brought into alignment with contemporary musical practice.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Various melodic and rhythmic structures found their way art music.  All music became ''desi'' and ''marga'' music passed into oblivion as did the ''madhyamagrama'' and its paraphernalia. The totality of melody came to be referred to ''sadja grama'' alone. The arbitrary, archaic and prolific ''desi talas'' made way for the suladi talas engendered by the [[Haridasa]]s.  These were further refined based on the principles of the ten vital elements called ''taladasaprana''.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} &lt;!--Theoretical and pedagogical scalar standards, as well as propaedeutic exercises (''abhyasagana'') which are relevant even today, were the contributions of  Vijayanagara.--&gt;

==Prominent composers==
At the height of the Vijayanagara empire great saint-composers like [[Purandara Dasa]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vyasatirtha|Vyasaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]], [[Kanaka Dasa]], Tallapakam [[Annamacharya]] and his descendants, and Nijagunashivayogi flourished. Musical forms, the ''Kriti'', the ''Suladi'', the ''Ugabhoga'', the ''Dandaka'', the ''Urttanama'', the ''Namavali'', the ''Mundige'', the ''Gita'', the ''Thaya'' and the ''Prabandha'' developed and found wide currency during this period.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==The 'nonet'==
Throughout the Vijayanagara period, theory and musical practice kept pace with each other closely. Great musicologists like Vidyaranya, Salva Gopa Tippendra, Kallinatha, Kumbhakarna, Ramamatya, Laksmanarayana, Pandarika Vittala, Somanatha, Locana Jha and Hrdayanarayanadeva contributed to musical theory of both North and South India during this period.  Tanappacharya, [[Govinda Dikshita]] and Venkatamakhin made foundational contributions from Tanjore about a century later. Each work of these scholars records a revolutionary and seminal concept or development which cumulatively resulted in modern Carnatic music.  Nine musicological treatises of great significance were composed in the Vijayanagar period and these have been called the Vijayanagara ''Sangitashastra Navaratna'' or the 'Vijayanagara Musicological Nonet'.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Sangitasara
The first of the ''navaratnas'' is Vidyaranya's ''Sangitasara'', composed in the second half of the fourteenth century.  The work dealt with, among other things, the fifteen ''melas'' and their fifty ''janya ragas'' as well as certain types of singers.  Some of this even found its way into Govinda Dikshita's ''Sangitasudha'' (''nidhi''), authored in the early seventeenth century.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Taladipika
The second of the nonet (chronologically) is the ''Taladipika''.  Authored in the mid-fifteenth century by Salva Gopa-Tippendra, brother-in-law of king [[Deva Raya II|Praudha Devaraya II]] and a viceroy of [[Kolar district|Mulbagal]], the work deals at great length with the [[Tala (music)|tala]]. It describes over a hundred desi talas including some of the author's own inventions.  Most importantly, the concept of ''taladasaprana'' (ten vital elements of tala) is elucidated  for the first time in the work. This innovation was to prove so influential that, following its explication, all temporal activities in music and dance came to be organized and consolidated under these elements.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Sangitakalanidhi
To the same period belongs the third work of the Nonet, Kallinatha's''Sangitakalanidhi'', a versatile commentary on [[Sarangadeva|Sharngadeva]]'s ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]'', the encyclopedic magnum opus on Indian music.  It was about dancing and aesthetics of the thirteenth century. In the work, Kallinatha meticulously annotated, explicated, criticised and emphasised all the central issues of the ''Ratnakara''; he also illumined it through comparison with contemporary practices, theories and norms of music and dance. He anticipated many developments in these arts.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Bhandaru Vittaleshwara's commentary
A Telugu commentary by Bhandaru (-ri?) Vittaleshwara on the ''Sangitaratnakara'' in the last quarter of the fifteenth century forms the fourth of the ''navaratnas''.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}
 
;Sangitasuryodaya
In 1525, Vittaleshwara's son Bhandaru (ri?) Lakshminarayana composed the fifth treatise, the ''Sangitasuryodaya'', under the patronage of king [[Krishnadevaraya]] of Vijayanagara.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Talakalabdhi/Talakalavriddhi
In the generation that immediately followed, Achyutadevaraya's ''Talakalabdhi''/''Talakalavridhi'' was written.  This was an important treatise on ''tala''. This work organizes for the first time the theory and practice of the ''suladi talas'' of the Haridasas in terms of the ''dasapranas''. In the work, he also compiles views from several earlier works on ''tala'' such as Talakalavilasa, Sangitavidyavinoda, Jainamata, Sangitamarga, Chaturasabhavilasa, Sangitachudamani, Anjaneyamata, Nrttachudamani, Sangitamanidarpana, Katyayaniya, Sangitarnava, Rangaraja Bharatabhashya, Kapardi, and Parameshvara (all of them non-extant), and refutes them. 
Further, Achyutaraya applies all the five ''laghu-jatis'' to each ''suladi tala'' and thereby expands the scope and function of the ''suladi talas''.  Around the same time, Ashtavadana Somabhatta composed the ''Svararagasudharasa'' or ''Natyachudamani'' under the guidance of his guru Sitarama and probably under Achyutaraya's patronage. This work is now available only in fragments.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Swaramelakalanidhi
The final 'gem' in the series is the much celebrated ''[[Svaramelakalanidhi]]'' authored by the illustrious Kallinatha's grandson, Ramamatya ca. 1550.  Ramamatya was the royal composer and architect in the court of de facto king [[Aliya Rama Raya]].&lt;ref name="kall"&gt;Moorthy (2001), p 27&lt;/ref&gt; He described himself as ''abhinavabharatacharya'' and ''todara-malla'' (meaning "the hero(malla) who wears the honorific anklet(''todar'')). The last epithet however, is usually interpreted by scholars as alluding to the Todarmal, a minister in Akbar's court, the anachronism notwithstanding.  The Kannada term, in fact translates to 'the hero (malla) who wears the honorific anklet (todar)'.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

''Svaramelakalanidhi'' importance lies in the fact that it is more relevant and related to modern practice than the books written prior to it.  The work, spread over five chapters deals primarily with ''Raga'' and preliminary to it, describes the ''Mela-s'' for the classification of ''Raga'' - and the different ''Suddha svara-s'' and ''Vikrta svara-s'' constituting the ''Mela-s''. Similar works by other celebrated contemporaries like Pandarika Vitthala and Somanatha project a common theme, namely the description of ''Ragas'', classification under ''Melas'' and the enumeration of the ''Suddha'' and ''Vikrta svaras'' constituting the ''Melas''.  Minor ideological differences can however be discerned among these works.&lt;ref name="nram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicresearch.in/categorydetails.php?imgid=7 |title=Svaramelakalanidhi of Ramamatya |author=N Ramanathan |accessdate=2008-02-21 |publisher=[MusicResearch.in]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Svaramelakalanidhi'' brings the theory up to date, rationalizes intervals and scales, introduces the concepts of ''svayambhu-svara'' (self-generating note, upper partial), ''.dharashruti paryayatattva'' and ''pratinidhitattva'' of ''svaras''.  ''Mukhari'' is established as the ''shuddhasvara saptaka''.  It also fixes and standardizes musical intervals on the keyboard, defines the accordatura, range, preferred strings (for particular notes) etc., for a variety of stringed keyboards.  It also innovates and dedicates a new keyboard to Achyutaraya.  A new scheme for classifying ragas into ''uttama'' (superior), ''madhyama'' (middling) and ''adhama'' (inferior) on the basis of their expressive potential is also expounded in the work.  It also resolves the problem of the ''antara'' and ''kaishiki'' notes.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

[[Image:Wassoulou map.png|thumb|right|200px|The Wassoulou region of [[West Africa]]]]

'''Wassoulou''' is a [[cultural area]] and [[historical region]] in the Wassoulou River Valley of [[West Africa]]. It is home to about 160,000 people, and is also the native land of the [[Wassoulou music|Wassoulou genre of music]].

Wassoulou surrounds the [[Tripoint|point]] where the borders of three present-day countries meet: [[Mali]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Guinea]]. It includes portions of southwestern Mali, northwestern Ivory Coast, and eastern Guinea. It is bordered by the [[Niger River]] to the northwest, and by the [[Sankarani River]] to the east.

The name ''Wassoulou'' is alternately spelled '''Wassulu''', '''Wassalou''', and '''Ouassalou'''.

==Culture==
Wassoulou is best known internationally as the birthplace of [[Wassoulou music]], a style which blends traditional and modern influences with strong female vocalists and a pentatonic hunter's harp. Wassoulou music is one of the two forms of West African music  ethnomusicologists believe to be the origin of the American blues, which developed out of music forms dating back to the American slave trade from West Africa.  Some of the most famous residents of Wassoulou include the singers [[Oumou Sangare]], [[Ramata Diakite]] and [[Coumba Sidibe]].

Wassoulou's cultural importance is reflected in the development of internet resources, and the creation of ''Radio Wassoulou'' broadcasting from Yanfolila.

===Language===
Wassoulou is also a dialect of the Eastern Maninkakan language, and is closely related to [[Kankan Mandinka]]. Speakers of Wassoulou number some 73,500 in [[Guinea]], with 41,200 speakers estimated in Mali, where the closely related [[Bamanankan]] is also spoken. In the far northwest of Côte d'Ivoire there are some 21,000 Wassoulou speakers, where it is related to [[Wojenaka Maninka]].

Inhabitants are  known as Wassulu, Wassulunka or Wassulunke.

==History==
The Wassoulou area is a center for the mingling of several ethnic groups.  The nomadic [[Fula people]], who were believed to have emigrated from the [[Fouta Djallon]] highlands to the west, integrated into the indigenous [[Mandé peoples]] and adopting their language and customs sometime prior to the 18th century, at roughly the same time [[Islam]] spread into the area. There are also large populations of [[Mandinka people]]s native to Wassoulou.

Wassoulou is also the name of an [[Islamic state]], the [[Wassoulou Empire]] (1870–1898), ruled by [[Samori Ture]] and  centered on his capital, [[Bissandugu]]. In 1870, Samori overthrew an older Wassoulou state within the [[Kénédougou Kingdom|Kingdom of Kénédougou]], whose ''faama'' (ruler) was Dyanabufarina Modi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africanseer.com/rulers-of-africa/rulers-of-mali.php |title=Rulers of Mali |website=AfricanSeer |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mali_native.html |website=worldstatesmen.org |title=Mali Traditional states: Wassulu (from 1880, Samori Empire) |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rulers.org/malitrad.html |website=rulers.org |title=Traditional polities: Wassulu |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded his empire from there, taking the Wassoulou name.  While the history of the Mandinka Wassoulou states remain unclear, the small kingdoms of Kenedugu and Wassulu existed from at least the 1650s, benefiting from gold mining and trade in the area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20765">The '''well-made play''' ({{lang-fr|la pièce bien faite}}, pronounced {{IPA-fr|pjɛs bjɛ̃ fɛt|}}) is a [[Drama|dramatic genre]] from [[nineteenth-century theatre]] first codified by French dramatist [[Eugène Scribe]]. Dramatists [[Victorien Sardou]], [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], and [[Emile Augier]] wrote within the genre, each putting a distinct spin on the style. The well-made play was a popular form of entertainment. By the mid-19th century, however, it had already entered into common use as a derogatory term.&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;Banham (1998), 964, 972–3, 1191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the other [[Realism (theatre)|realistic]] dramatists of the later 19th century ([[August Strindberg]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Anton Chekhov]]) built upon its technique of careful construction and preparation of effects in the genre [[problem play]]. "Through their example", Marvin Carlson explains, "the well-made play became and still remains the traditional model of [[Dramaturgy|play construction]]."&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;Carlson (1993, 216).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English language, that tradition found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]]'s ''Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship'' (1912),&lt;ref&gt;Archer, William. Playmaking: a Manual of Craftsmanship. Public domain. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10865&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States with [[George Pierce Baker]]'s ''Dramatic Technique'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;J L Styan, ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice I'', quoted by Innes (2000, 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]

The form has a strong [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] flavour, involving a tight [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] that takes place close to the end of the play. The well-made play retains the shape of [[Aristotle]]'s ideal [[Greek tragedy|Greek-tragedy]] model outlined in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-made play can be broken down into a specific set of criteria.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scribe|first1=Eugene|last2=ed. introd. Stanton |first2=Stephen|title=Camille and Other Plays|date=1956|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0809007061}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the story depends upon a key piece of information kept from some characters, but known to others (and to the audience). Most of the story takes place before the action of the play begins, making the beginning of the play a late point of attack. Exposition during act one explains actions that precede the opening scene, and generates the audience's sympathy for the hero (or heroes) over their rival (or rivals). The plot moves forward in a chain of actions that use minor reversals of fortune to create suspense. The pace builds towards a climactic obligatory scene, in which the hero triumphs. This scene contains a climactic reversal of fortune, or [[peripeteia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McBride|first1=Augusto Boal ; translated by Charles A. &amp; Maria-Odilia Leal|title=Theatre of the oppressed|date=1985|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|location=New York|isbn=0930452496|edition=5th print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dénouement follows, in which all remaining plot points are unraveled and resolved.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"/&gt;

A recurrent device that the well-made play employs is the use of letters or papers falling into unintended hands, in order to bring about [[plot twists]] and climaxes.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"/&gt; The letters bring about an unexpected and climactic reversal of fortune, in which it is often revealed that someone is not who they pretend to be. Mistaken or mysterious identity as a basis for plot complications is referred to as ''qui pro quo''.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanton|first1=Stephen S.|title=Shaw's Debt to Scribe|journal=MLA|date=December 1961|volume=76|issue=5|pages=575–585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, Beth. "Acting Out: Qui pro Quo in the Context of Interwar Warsaw." East European Politics &amp; Societies (2012): 0888325412467053.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene Scribe]] contributed over 300 plays and opera libretti to the dramatic literature canon. Thirty-five of these works are considered well-made-plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Encyclopædia Britannica Editors|title=well-made play|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639300/well-made-play|website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===French Neoclassicism: a standard form===
History of French Neoclassic form lays a critical foundation for Scribe, who draws upon devices determined by the [[French Academy]] to create his dramatic structure. French Neoclassicism conceives of [[Verisimilitude]], or the appearance of a plausible truth, as the aesthetic goal of a play.&lt;ref name="Ashgate Publishing, Ltd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibbett|first1=Katherine|title=The Style of the State in French Theater, 1630-1660: Neoclassicism and Government.|date=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.,}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1638, the [[French Academy]] codified a system by which dramatists could achieve Verisimilitude in a verdict on the [[Pierre Corneille|Le Cid debate]].&lt;ref name="Ashgate Publishing, Ltd"/&gt;  The monarchy enforced the standards of French Neoclassicism with a system of censorship under which funding and practice permits were issued to a limited number of theater companies.&lt;ref name="Brockett &amp; Hildy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hildy|first1=Franklin J.|last2=Brockett|first2=Oscar G.|title=History of the theatre|date=2007|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-205-47360-1|edition=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system underwent small modifications, but remained essentially the same up until the [[French Revolution]]. Until then, restrictive laws inhibited the growth of new practices with the exception of those advocated by a few intrepid dramatists such as [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]], and [[Beaumarchais]]. After the [[French Revolution]], adherence to the form became an artistic choice instead of a political necessity.

===Boulevard theatres: new forms===
Although Scribe drew heavily upon Neoclassic devices, he used them in original ways that would not have been acceptable without new popular forms, such as those developed at the Boulevard theatres.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Theater and Revolution: the culture of the French stage|date=1980|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to work around the formal monopoly of the [[Comédie Française]] in the middle of the 18th century, theater troupes experimenting with new dramatic forms sprang up along the Boulevard du Temple. Their aim was to escape the censors, and please the public. Popular reception of the boulevard theatres' explorations helped to crack the edifice of Neoclassic form.&lt;ref name="History of the theatre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hildy|first1=Oscar G. Brockett ; Franklin J.|title=History of the theatre|date=2007|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-205-47360-1|edition=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the French Revolution, French theater opened to the influence of practices that had meanwhile developed in other places around Europe.&lt;ref name="French Revolution, Carlson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Marvin A.|title=The Theatre of the French Revolution|date=1966|publisher=Cornell UP|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribe's development of a form that could be used repeatedly to turn out new material suited the demands of a growing middle class theater audience.&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=edited, with an introduction to the well-made play by Stephen S.|title=Camille, and other plays|date=1999|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|isbn=0809007061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===On Scribe, Dumas fils, Augier, and Sardou===

Scribe's influence on theater, according to Marvin J. Carlson, "cannot be overestimated".&lt;ref name="Cornell UP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Marvin|title=Theories of the Theatre: A Historical and Critical Survey from the Greeks to the Present|date=1984|publisher=Cornell UP|location=Ithaca and London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson observes that, unlike other influential theater thinkers, Scribe did not write prefaces or manifestos declaiming his ideas. Scribe influenced theater, instead, with craftsmanship. He honed a dramatic form into a reliable mould that could be applied not only to different content, but to different content from a variety of playwrights. Carlson identifies a single instance of Scribe's critical commentary from a speech Scribe gave to the Académie française in 1836. Scribe expressed his view of what draws the audiences to theater:

"not for instruction or improvement, but for diversion and distraction, and that which diverts them [audience] most is not truth, but fiction. To see again what you have before your eyes daily will not please you, but that which is not available to you in every day life - the extraordinary and the romantic."&lt;ref name="Cornell UP"/&gt;

Although Scribe advocated for a theater of amusement over didacticism, other writers, beginning with [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], adopted Scribe's structure to create didactic plays. In a letter to a critic, Dumas ''fils'' states,"... if I can find some means to force people to discuss the problem, and the lawmaker to revise the law, I shall have done more than my duty as a writer, I shall have done my duty as a man.".&lt;ref name="History of the theatre"/&gt; Dumas' thesis plays are plays written in the well-made style that take clear moral positions on social issues of the day. [[Emile Augier]] also used Scribe's formula to write plays addressing contemporary social issues, although he declares his moral position less strongly.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, John Russell. The Rise and Fall of the Well-Made Play, Great Britain: Routledge, Cox and Wyman, Ltd.,1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, the well-made play had fallen out of critical favor.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw was among those who held the form in low regard, "Why the devil should a man write like Scribe when he can write like Shakespeare or Moliere, Aristophanes or Euripides? Who was Scribe that he should dictate to me or anyone else how a play should be written?"&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt; In reference to the form's tendency to favor amusing plot twists over complexly drawn characters, Shaw referred to the genre as Sardoodledom after [[Victorien Sardou]], who also wrote in the well-made style.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt;

===Shaw and Ibsen===
The opening to the preface to ''Three Plays by Brieux'' offers another example of Shavian disdain for the well-made plays. Shaw identifies the process of creating them as an industry, and their creators as “literary mechanics” instead of artists. To convey how vulgar he finds a widely used playwrighting formula, Shaw interprets the aphorism "Art for art's sake," as "Success for money's sake."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, George Bernard. ‘’Three Plays by Brieux’’. New York: Brentano’s, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay published in [[Modern Language Association|PMLA]] in 1951, ''Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw’s Dramatic Theory and Practice'', Milton Crane reasons that Shaw’s disparagement of the classic well-made formula, and his desire to pry Ibsen’s work away from association with the works of Scribe and Sardou, serve a specific agenda. Crane argues that Shaw aims to prevent his own use of the well-made formula from linking his plays with work considered out of fashion. Shaw’s theory of the [[problem play]] and discussion ideas align his plays with Ibsen’s, and distinguishes them from stale plays of the past. Crane observes that Shaw, by his own admission, learned dramatic structure from contemporary popular theatre which was then dominated by the well-made formula.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt; Crane goes on to argue how that formula is present in [[List of works by George Bernard Shaw|''Pygmalion'', ''Man and Superman'', and ''The Doctor’s Dilemma'']].&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Milton. "Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw's Dramatic Theory and Practice." PMLA 66.6 (1951): 879-85. JSTOR [JSTOR]. Web. 4 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The problem play====
 [[File:Henrik Ibsen as a young man.jpg|thumb|Henrik Ibsen as a young man]]

Shaw discusses the notion of the [[problem play]] in an essay of the same title published in 1895.&lt;ref name="Problem Play from Shaw on Theatre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=George Bernard|editor1-last=West|editor1-first=E.J.|title=Shaw on Theatre|date=1958|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|location=New York|chapter=Problem Play}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines a problem play as one that puts a person or people in conflict with an institution, confronting a contemporary social question. He cites the "Woman question" as a contemporary example. Ibsen's engagement with the "Woman question" in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' qualifies those works as problem plays. Shaw distinguishes between the problem play and literature with conflicts reflecting a more universal view of the human condition. Works whose fundamental conflict does not pit human against institution, he argues, are more apt to remain relevant through generations. He cites ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', and ''[[Les Misérables]]'' as examples of stories whose conflicts involve more eternal human questions. Shaw observes that the immediacy of the institutional question addressed in a problem play will render the play "flat as ditchwater" once society progresses and the issue is resolved.&lt;ref name="Problem Play from Shaw on Theatre" /&gt; Although Ibsen was hailed by feminists, he did not regard himself as an advocate for any particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Christopher. "Henrik Ibsen, Speech at the Festival of the Norwegian Women's Rights League, Christiana, 26 May 1898." A Sourcebook on Naturalist Theatre. London: Routledge, 2000. 74-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The well-made play and modern drama====
Ibsen's aim, according to Raymond Williams, was to express tragedies in the human condition. Ibsen qualifies a human tragedy as the state "[when a person] stands in a tight place; he cannot go forwards or backwards.”&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Raymond|title=Drama from Ibsen to Brecht|date=1973|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=978-0140214925|edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also cites the specific characteristic that distinguishes his and Ibsen's modern drama from the preceding well-made formula. The well-made formula, Shaw observes, can be divided into three sections: Exposition, Situation, Unraveling. The plays of Ibsen and Shaw, Shaw himself asserts, do not end with a classic unraveling. Their work can be divided as: Exposition, Situation, Discussion.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

==Offshoots==
[[Oscar Wilde|Oscar Wilde's]] ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' exaggerates many of the conventions of the well-made play, such as the missing papers conceit (the hero, as an infant, was confused with the manuscript of a novel) and a final revelation (which, in this play, occurs about thirty seconds before the final curtain).&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt;

[[Henrik Ibsen|Henrik Ibsen's]] ''[[A Doll's House]]'' follows most of the conceits of the well-made play, but transcends the genre when, after incriminating papers are recovered, Nora rejects the expected return to normality.  Several of Ibsen's subsequent plays build on the general construction principles of the well-made play.  ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) can be seen as a deliberate, meta-theatrical deconstruction of the [[Eugène Scribe|Scribean]] formula.  Ibsen sought a compromise between [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and the well-made play which was fraught with difficulties since life does not fall easily into either form.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[George Bernard Shaw]] scorned the "well-made play", he accepted the form, and even thrived by it, for it concentrated his skills on the conversation among characters, his greatest asset as a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other classic twists on the well-made play can be seen in his use of the General's coat and the hidden photograph in ''[[Arms and the Man]]''.

Also, [[J. B. Priestley]]'s 1946 ''[[An Inspector Calls]]'' may in some ways be considered a "well-made play" in that its action happens before the play starts, and in the case of the older Birlings no moral change takes place. The similarity between Priestley's play and this rather conservative genre might strike some readers/audiences as surprising because Priestley was a socialist. However, his play, like Ibsen's ''A Doll's House'' transcends this genre by providing another plunge into chaos after the return to normality.  He replaced the dramatic full stop with a question mark by revealing in the last scene that the 'inspector' who has exposed the complicity of a prosperous industrial family in the murder or suicide of a working-class girl, is not an inspector at all (perhaps a practical joker, an emanation of the world to come, or a manifestation of the world to come), and the curtain falls on the news that a real girl has died and a real inspector is on the way.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of well-made plays also lend themselves to comedies of situation, often [[farce]]. In ''[[Quintessence of Ibsenism|The Quintessence of Ibsenism]]'', [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] proposed that [[Ibsen]] converted this formula for use in "serious" plays by substituting discussion for the plausible dénouement or conclusion. Thus, plays become open-ended, as if there were life for the [[protagonist]]s beyond the last act curtain.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard. The Quintessence of Ibsenism. New York: Brentano's, 1913. Print.

The '''Welsh Seal''', ({{lang-cy|Sêl Gymreig}}), is a [[seal (emblem)|seal]] used for [[Wales]]. Provision for a Welsh seal was made in Part 4 of the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] which also designated the [[First Minister of Wales]] as "Keeper of the Welsh Seal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/section/116|title=Government of Wales Act 2006|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seal is used by the First Minister to seal (and so bring into force) [[letters patent]] signed by the monarch giving [[Royal Assent]] to bills passed by the [[National Assembly for Wales]] in order for those bills to become [[Act of the National Assembly for Wales|Acts of the Assembly]].
