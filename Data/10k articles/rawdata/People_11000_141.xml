'''Aage Niels Bohr''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɔːwə ˌnels ˈboɐ̯ˀ|lang|Da-Aage Niels Bohr.ogg}}; 19 June 1922 – 8 September 2009) was a Danish [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1975 with [[Ben Mottelson]] and [[James Rainwater]] "for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in [[atomic nuclei]] and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection".&lt;ref name="The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | accessdate = 2015-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|liquid drop model]] of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments. Since his father, [[Niels Bohr]], had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/faq/questions_in_category.php?id=7#10 | title = Nobel Prize FAQ | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Aage Niels Bohr was born in [[Copenhagen]] on 19 June 1922, the fourth of six sons of the [[physicist]] [[Niels Bohr]] and his wife Margrethe Bohr (née Nørlund).&lt;ref name="Biographical"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/bohr-bio.html |title=Aage N. Bohr – Biographical |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His oldest brother, Christian, died in a boating accident in 1934,{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|p=204}} and his youngest, Harald, from childhood meningitis.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=226, 249}} Of the others, Hans became a physician; Erik, a chemical engineer; and [[Ernest Bohr|Ernest]], a lawyer and an Olympic athlete who played [[field hockey]] for Denmark at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Niels Bohr&amp;nbsp;– Biography|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/bohr-bio.html|publisher=[[Nobelprize.org]]|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hockey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/bo/ernest-bohr-1.html |title=Ernest Bohr Biography and Olympic Results – Olympics |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Copenhagen]], now known as the [[Niels Bohr Institute]], where he grew up surrounded by physicists who were working with his father, such as [[Hans Kramers]], [[Oskar Klein]], [[Yoshio Nishina]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]].&lt;ref name="Biographical" /&gt; In 1932, the family moved to the Carlsberg Æresbolig, a mansion donated by [[Carl Jacobsen]], the heir to Carlsberg breweries, to be used as an honorary residence by the Dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=322–333}}

Bohr went to high school at {{Interlanguage link multi|Sortedam Gymnasium|da}} in Copenhagen. In 1940, shortly after the German occupation of Denmark in April, he entered the University of Copenhagen, where he studied physics. He assisted his father, helping draft correspondence and articles related to [[epistemology]] and physics.&lt;ref name="Biographical" /&gt; In September 1943, word reached his family that the Nazis considered them to be Jewish, because Aage's grandmother, Ellen Adler Bohr, had been Jewish, and that they therefore were in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped the family [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|escape by sea]] to Sweden.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=483–484}} Bohr arrived there in October 1943, and then flew to Britain on a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] operated by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]]. The Mosquitoes were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's [[bomb bay]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=280}}

On arrival in London, Bohr rejoined his father, who had flown to Britain the week before.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=280}} He officially became a junior researcher at the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]],  but actually served as personal assistant and secretary to his father. The two worked on [[Tube Alloys]], the British [[atomic bomb]] project. On 30 December 1943, they made the first of a number of visits to the United States, where his father was a consultant to the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=248–249}} Due to his father's fame, they were given false names; Bohr became James Baker, and his father, Nicholas Baker.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=95}} In 1945, the director of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], [[Robert Oppenheimer]], asked them to review the design of the [[modulated neutron initiator]]. They reported that it would work. That they had reached this conclusion put [[Enrico Fermi]]'s concerns about the viability of the design to rest.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=95}} The initiators performed flawlessly in the bombs used in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in August 1945.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=264–265, 308–309, 390–397}}

== Career ==
In August 1945, with the war ended, Bohr returned to Denmark, where he resumed his university education, graduating with a master's degree in 1946, with a thesis concerned with some aspects of [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|atomic stopping power]] problems.&lt;ref name="Biographical" /&gt; In early 1948, Bohr became a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Institute for Advanced Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/abohr01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107093854/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/abohr01 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 January 2013 |title=Bohr, Aage Niels |publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]] |accessdate=13 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While paying a visit to [[Columbia University]], he met [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], who sparked in him an interest in recent discoveries related to the [[hyperfine structure]] of [[deuterium]]. This led to Bohr becoming a visiting fellow at Columbia from January 1949 to August 1950.&lt;ref name="Biographical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt; While in the United States, Bohr married Marietta Soffer on 11 March 1950. They had three children: Vilhelm, Tomas and Margrethe.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/world/europe/11bohr.html |title=Aage Bohr, Physicist’s Son Who Won Nobel, Dies at 87 |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=10 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marietta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geni.com/people/Marietta-Bohr/6000000009135398187 |title=Marietta Bohr (Soffer) (1922–1978) |publisher=Geni.com |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1940s it was known that the properties of [[atomic nuclei]] could not be explained by then-current models such as the [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|liquid drop model]] developed by Niels Bohr amongst others.  The [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]], developed in 1949 by [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]] and others, allowed some additional features to be explained, in particular the so-called [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]]. However, there were also properties that could not be explained, including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei.&lt;ref name="Nobel lecture"&gt;{{cite web |title= Rotational Motion in Nuclei Nobel Lecture, |date=11 December 1975 |first=Aage |last=Bohr |publisher=The Niels Bohr Institute and Nordita |location=Copenhagen |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/bohr-lecture.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1950 paper, [[James Rainwater]] of Columbia University suggested a variant of the drop model of the nucleus that could explain a non-spherical charge distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Nuclear Energy Level Argument for a Spheroidal Nuclear Model  |last=Rainwater |first=James |authorlink=James Rainwater |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=79  |issue=3  |pages=432–434  |date=August 1950  |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.79.432|bibcode = 1950PhRv...79..432R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainwater's model postulated a nucleus like a balloon with balls inside that distort the surface as they move about. He discussed the idea with Bohr, who was visiting Columbia at the time, and had independently conceived the same idea, and had, about a month after Rainwater's submission, submitted for publication a paper that discussed the same problem, but along more general lines. Bohr imagined a rotating, irregular-shaped nucleus with a form of surface tension.&lt;ref name="New Scientist"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[New Scientist]] |issn=0262-4079 |volume=68 |issue=972 |date=23 October 1975 |title=Nobel Prizes 1975: Medicine, Chemistry and Physics … and fifty years ago |first=Roger |last=Lewin |first2=Martin |last2=Sherwood |first3=Robert |last3=Walgate }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr developed the idea further, in 1951 publishing a paper that comprehensively treated the relationship between oscillations of the surface of the nucleus and the movement of the individual [[nucleon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=On the Quantization of Angular Momenta in Heavy Nuclei  |last=Bohr |first=Aage  |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=81  |issue=1  |pages=134–138  | date=January 1951 |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.134|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..134B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Copenhagen in 1950, Bohr began working with [[Ben Mottelson]] to compare the theoretical work with experimental data. In three papers, that were published in 1952 and 1953, Bohr and Mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment; for example, showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Matematisk-fysiske Meddelelser, [[Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab]] |title=Collective and Individual-Particle Aspects of Nuclear Structure |volume=27 |issue=16 |year=1953 |last=Bohr |first=Aage |last2=Mottelson |first2=Ben R. |authorlink2=Ben Mottelson |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/213298/files/p1.pdf |accessdate=30 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Interpretation of Isomeric Transitions of Electric Quadrupole Type  |last=Bohr |first=Aage |last2=Mottelson |first2=Ben R. |authorlink2=Ben Mottelson  |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=89  |issue=1  |pages=316–317  | date=January 1953 |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.89.316 |bibcode = 1953PhRv...89..316B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Rotational States in Even-Even Nuclei  |last=Bohr |first=Aage |last2=Mottelson |first2=Ben R. |authorlink2=Ben Mottelson  |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=90  |issue=4  |pages=717–719  | date=May 1953 |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.90.717.2 |bibcode = 1953PhRv...90..717B }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were thereby able to reconcile the shell model with Rainwater's concept.&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; This work stimulated many new theoretical and experimental studies.&lt;ref name="Nobel lecture" /&gt; Bohr, Mottelson and Rainwater were jointly awarded the 1975 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection".&lt;ref name="The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975" /&gt; Because his father had been awarded the prize in 1922, Bohr became one of only four pairs of fathers and sons to win the Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/physics/ |title=Facts on the Nobel Prizes in Physics |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=12 May 2015 }} The others: [[William Henry Bragg]] (1915) and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] (1915); [[J. J. Thomson]] (1906) and [[George Paget Thomson]] (1937); and [[Manne Siegbahn]] (1924) and [[Kai M. Siegbahn]] (1981). Two pairs of fathers and sons have won Nobel Prizes in other fields: [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]] (chemistry, 1929) and [[Ulf von Euler]] (medicine, 1970); and [[Arthur Kornberg]] (medicine, 1969) and [[Roger D. Kornberg]] (chemistry, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Only after doing his Nobel Prize-winning research did Bohr receive his doctorate from the University of Copenhagen, in 1954, writing his thesis on "Rotational States of Atomic Nuclei".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1565671 |title=Rotational States of Atomic Nuclei |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |date=1954 |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr became a professor at the University of Copenhagen in 1956, and, following his father's death in 1962, succeeded him as director of the Niels Bohr Institute, a position he held until 1970. He remained active there until he retired in 1992.&lt;ref name="Nobelprisvinderen Aage Bohr er død" /&gt; He was also a member of the board of the [[Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (Nordita) from its inception in 1957, and was its director from 1975 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/namely_names/2009/nobel_prize_recipient_aage_bohr/ |title=Nobel Laureate Aage Bohr has died|publisher=[[Niels Bohr Institute]] |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Nobel Prize, he won the [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics]] in 1960, the [[Atoms for Peace Award]] in 1969, [[H.C. Ørsted Medal]] in 1970, [[Rutherford Medal and Prize]] in 1972, [[John Price Wetherill Medal]] in 1974, and the Ole Rømer medal in 1976.&lt;ref name="Institute for Advanced Study" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/academicians/deceased/bohr.html|first=Antonino|last=Zichichi |authorlink=Antonino Zichichi |title=Aage Bohr |publisher=[[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]]  |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iop.org/about/awards/subject/rutherford/medallists/page_38596.html |title=Rutherford medal recipients |publisher=[[Institute of Physics]] |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr and Mottelson continued to work together, publishing a two-volume [[monograph]], ''Nuclear Structure''. The first volume, ''Single-Particle Motion,'' appeared in 1969; the second, ''Nuclear Deformations,'' in 1975.&lt;ref name="Biographical" /&gt;

In 1972 he was awarded an [[honorary degree]], doctor philos. honoris causa, at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]], later part of [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary doctors at NTNU|publisher=Norwegian University of Science and Technology|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Bohr became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | accessdate = November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife Marietta died on 2 October 1978.&lt;ref name="Marietta" /&gt; In 1981, he married Bente Scharff Meyer.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |first=Frank |last=Close |date=14 September 2009 |title=Aage Bohr |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/sep/13/aage-bohr-obituary |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Tomas Bohr, is a Professor of Physics at the [[Technical University of Denmark]], working in the area of fluid dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtu.dk/english/Service/Phonebook/Person?id=5243&amp;tab=1 |title=Tomas Bohr |publisher=[[Technical University of Denmark]] |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aage Bohr died in Copenhagen on 9 September 2009.&lt;ref name="Nobelprisvinderen Aage Bohr er død"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/videnskab/article785607.ece |title=Nobelprisvinderen Aage Bohr er død ("Nobel Prize winner Aage Bohr has died") |newspaper=Viden |first=Morten Garly |last=Anderson |language=Danish |date=10 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913110223/http://politiken.dk/videnskab/article785607.ece |archivedate=13 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his second wife and children.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

The name was also used in [[medieval England]] (variants ''Absolon, Apsolon, Abselon''). As in the biblical story, the fleeing Absalom has his long hair caught in a tree, the name appears to have been a nickname for a man with long or thick hair, as suggested by a passage in the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',
:''Now was ther of that Chirche a parish clerk, The which that was ycleped Absolon ... Curl was his heer and as the gold it shoon'' (''[[The Miller's Tale]]'').
This use as a nickname is  possibly also the origin of Absalom as an [[English surname]].&lt;ref&gt;via a patronymic; one  ''Absolon filius Apsolon'' is recorded  in the ''Feet of Fines'' for [[Cambridgeshire]] in 1199, one ''Stephen Abselon'' is mentioned in the  ''Curia Regis Rolls'' of [[Oxfordshire]] in 1208, and one ''Thomas Absolom'' is mentioned in the Calendar of Letter Books for the [[medieval London|City of London]] in 1281. [https://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Absalom Name Origin Research www.surnamedb.com]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Absalom continued to be used in Anglo-Saxon Protestantism in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The Hebrew name was used among [[Palestinian Jews]] in the 19th to early 20th century and remains current in [[Israel]]; it is mostly anglicized as ''Avshalom'', reflecting [[Modern Hebrew]] pronunciation.

"Absalom" is a rare [[English surname]], recorded as early as in the early 13th century. It derives from the first name ''Absalom'' which became popular in England in the 12th century. The surname remained rare throughout its existence, but it gave rise to a number of variants, such as ''Asplen'', and via the latter ''Aspling'' and ''Ashplant''.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hey]], ''Family Names and Family History'',  Bloomsbury Publishing, 2006, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=d5i6BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 p. 65].&lt;/ref&gt;

The variant ''Absolon'' is found in England as well as in France and Germany, [[Ostsiedlung|reaching Central Europe]] in the late medieval period, so that ''Absolon'' (feminine ''Absolonová'') is now also a Czech and Slovak surname.

==Terminology==
How to refer to the Arab citizenry of Israel is a highly politicized issue and there are a number of self-identification labels used by members of this community.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowrance&gt;{{cite journal|title=Identity, Grievances, and Political Action: Recent Evidence from the Palestinian Community in Israel|author=Sherry Lowrance|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=27, 2|pages=167–190|year=2006 |url=https://uga.academia.edu/SherryLowrance/Papers/82564/Identity_Grievances_and_Political_Action_Recent_Evidence_from_the_Palestinian_Community_in_Israel|quote=There are a number of self-identification labels currently in use among Palestinian Israelis. Seven of the most commonly used were included in the 2001 survey. They range from "Israeli" and "Israeli Arab", indicating some degree of identification with Israel to "Palestinian," which rejects Israeli identification and wholeheartedly identifies with the Palestinian people. […] &lt;br /&gt; According to the author's survey, approximately 66 percent of the sample of Palestinian Israelis identified themselves in whole or in part as Palestinian. The modal identity is "Palestinian in Israel", which rejects "Israeli" as a psychological identification, but accepts it as a descriptive label of geographical location. […] &lt;br /&gt; The establishment-favoured "Israeli Arab" is the second-most popular response in the survey, reflecting its dominance in Israeli social discourse. About 37 percent of respondents identified themselves in some way as "Israeli", double-counting the "Israeli Palestinian" category as both "Israeli" and "Palestinian". Although much smaller than the percentage identifying themselves as Palestinian a nevertheless considerable number include "Israeli" as part of their identity, despite the hardships placed upon them by the Israeli state. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, supporters of Israel tend to use ''Israeli Arab'' or ''Arab Israeli'' to refer to this population without mentioning Palestine, while critics of Israel (or supporters of Palestinians) tend to use ''Palestinian'' or ''Palestinian Arab'' without referencing Israel.&lt;ref name=Peleg/&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', most prefer now to identify themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel rather than as Israeli Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Jodi Rudoren, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/world/middleeast/service-to-israel-tugs-at-arab-citizens-identity.html?hpw Service to Israel Tugs at Identity of Arab Citizens], ''[[The New York Times]]'' 12 July 2012: 'After decades of calling themselves Israeli Arabs, which in Hebrew sounds like Arabs who belong to Israel, most now prefer Palestinian citizens of Israel.'&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' uses both 'Palestinian Israelis'&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/opinion/sunday/israels-embattled-democracy.html 'Israel’s Embattled Democracy'], New York Times 21 July 2012 : "Israeli Palestinians are not required to join the army, and most do not. Many feel like second-class citizens and are deeply conflicted about their place in Israeli society."&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Israeli Arabs' to refer to the same population.

While they were allowed to become citizens, they were distanced from the center of power because the Israeli state was a ''Jewish'' state and Israeli national identity incorporated Jewish symbols and referents. Government officials categorized and labeled them by religion (Muslims, Christians, Druze), region (Galilee Arab, Triangle Arab, Negev Bedouin), and family connections, or ''hamula'' (Haberer 1985, 145). In official and popular culture, they ceased being Palestinians and were re-created as Israeli Arabs or Arab citizens of Israel. Expressing Palestinian identity by displaying the flag, singing nationalist songs, or reciting nationalist poetry was illegal in "Israel" until only very recently. Self-identification as Palestinians, Israeli Palestinians, or Palestinian citizens of Israel has increased since 1967 and is now their preferred descriptor. It was only under the influence of the ''intifada'', however, that many Israeli Palestinians felt secure enough to begin to refer to themselves publicly this way (as opposed to choosing the label ''Palestinian'' only in anonymous surveys on identity).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muwasi&gt;{{cite book |title=The Arab minority in Israel, 1967–1991: political aspects |author=Jacob M.

==History==

===1948 Arab–Israeli War===
Most Israelis refer to the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] as the War of Independence, while most Arab citizens refer to it as the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]] (catastrophe), a reflection of differences in perception of the purpose and outcomes of the war.&lt;ref name=Amarapxv&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Education Policy: The Arab Minority in Israel|first1=Muhammad |last1=Amara|first2=Abd el-Rahman|last2=Marʻi|publisher=Springer|year=2002|page=xv|isbn=978-1-4020-0585-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Masalhap221&gt;{{cite book|title=Catastrophe Remembered: Palestine, Israel and the Internal Refugees: Essays in Memory of Edward W.

In the aftermath of the 1947–49 war, the territory previously administered by the [[British Empire]] as [[Mandatory Palestine]] was de facto divided into three parts: the State of Israel, the [[Jordan]]ian-held West Bank, and the [[Egypt]]ian-held Gaza Strip.

Arabs who left their homes during the period of armed conflict, but remained in what had become Israeli territory, were considered to be "[[present absentee]]s". In some cases, they were refused permission to return to their homes, which were [[eminent domain|expropriated]] and turned over to state ownership, as was the property of other [[Palestinian refugee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pappé Ilan (1992) "The Making of the Arab Israeli Conflict 1947–1951"; I B Tauris, p. 72 {{ISBN|1-85043-819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Benny (2001).

===1949–1966===
[[Image:Seif el-Din el-Zubi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Seif el-Din el-Zubi]], member of the first Knesset]]
While most Arabs remaining in Israel were granted citizenship, they were subject to martial law in the early years of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=WlqcITwEktEC&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=%22martial+law%22+arabs+israel&amp;pg=PA67 |title=1967: Israel, the War, and the Year that Transformed the Middle East |first=Tom |last=Segev |date=29 May 2007 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |via=Google Books|isbn=9781429911672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kodmani-Darwish, p. 126, Féron, pp. 37, 40&lt;/ref&gt; Travel permits, curfews, [[administrative detention]]s, and expulsions were part of life until 1966. A variety of Israeli legislative measures facilitated the transfer of land abandoned by Arabs to state ownership. These included the [[Land and Property Laws in Israel#The 'Absentees Property Law'|Absentee Property Law of 1950]] which allowed the state to take control of land belonging to land owners who emigrated to other countries, and the Land Acquisition Law of 1953 which authorized the Ministry of Finance to transfer expropriated land to the state. Other common legal expedients included the use of emergency regulations to declare land belonging to Arab citizens a closed military zone, followed by the use of Ottoman legislation on abandoned land to take control of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Féron, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabs who held Israeli citizenship were entitled to vote for the Israeli [[Knesset]]. Arab Knesset members have served in office since the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|First Knesset]]. The first Arab Knesset members were [[Amin-Salim Jarjora]] and [[Seif el-Din el-Zoubi]] who were members of the [[Democratic List of Nazareth]] party and [[Tawfik Toubi]] member of the [[Maki (current political party)|Maki]] party.

In 1965 a radical independent Arab group called ''al-Ard'' forming the Arab Socialist List tried to run for [[Knesset]] elections. The list was banned by the [[Israeli Central Elections Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenstadt|first=S.N.|authorlink=Shmuel Eisenstadt|title=Israeli Society|publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]|year=1967|location=London|page=403|isbn=978-0-8133-0306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, martial law was lifted completely, and the government set about dismantling most of the discriminatory laws, while Arab citizens were granted the same rights as Jewish citizens under law.&lt;ref&gt;Kodmani, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967–2000===
[[File:Arabe Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A monument to residents of [[Arraba, Galilee|Arraba]] killed in the Arab–Israeli conflict]]
After the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Arab citizens were able to contact Palestinians in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] for the first time since the establishment of the state. This along with the lifting of military rule, led to increased political activism among Arab citizens.&lt;ref name="Identity Crisis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=2528&amp;l=1|title=Identity Crisis: Israel and its Arab Citizens|accessdate=8 October 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080709020917/http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=2528&amp;l=1| archivedate = 9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zureik|first=Elia|title=The Palestinians in Israel: A Study in Internal Colonialism|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|year=1979|location=London|pages=172–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sc8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=%22al+ard%22|isbn=978-0-7100-0016-3|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, a committee of Arab mayors and municipal councilmen was established which played an important role in representing the community and pressuring the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;Kodmani, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1975 by the formation of the Committee for the Defense of the Land, which sought to prevent continuing land expropriations.&lt;ref&gt;Féron, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, a political breakthrough took place with the election of Arab poet [[Tawfiq Ziad]], a [[Maki (current political party)|Maki]] member, as mayor of Nazareth, accompanied by a strong communist presence in the town council.&lt;ref&gt;Féron, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, six Arab citizens of Israel were killed by Israeli security forces at a protest against land expropriations and house demolitions. The date of the protest, 30 March, has since been commemorated annually as [[Land Day]].

The 1980s saw the birth of the [[Islamic Movement in Israel|Islamic Movement]]. As part of a larger trend in the [[Arab World]], the Islamic Movement emphasized moving Islam into the political realm. The Islamic movement built schools, provided other essential social services, constructed mosques, and encouraged prayer and conservative Islamic dress. The Islamic Movement began to affect electoral politics particularly at the local level.&lt;ref name="struggle"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Israel's Arab Citizens: The Continuing struggle|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=Jan 1998|first=Mark|last=Tessler|author2=Audra K Grant|volume=555|issue=January|pages=97–113|doi=10.1177/0002716298555001007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=1049214|title= Arab Citizens: The Continuing Struggle|journal= The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume= 555|pages= 97–113|date=January 1998|doi=10.1177/0002716298555001007|last1= Tessler|first1= Mark|last2= Grant|first2= Audra K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Arab citizens supported the [[First Intifada]] and assisted Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, providing them with money, food, and clothes. A number of strikes were also held by Arab citizens in solidarity with Palestinians in the occupied territories.&lt;ref name="struggle"/&gt;

The years leading up to the [[Oslo Accords]] were a time of optimism for Arab citizens. During the administration of [[Yitzhak Rabin]], Arab parties played an important role in the formation of a governing coalition. Increased participation of Arab citizens was also seen at the civil society level. However, tension continued to exist with many Arabs calling for Israel to become a "[[liberal nationalism|state of all its citizens]]", thereby challenging the state's Jewish identity. In the 1999 elections for prime minister, 94% of the Arab electorate voted for [[Ehud Barak]]. However, Barak formed a broad left-right-center government without consulting the Arab parties, disappointing the Arab community.&lt;ref name="Identity Crisis"/&gt;

===2000–present===
[[File:Demonstration Arabs Haifa 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Arab Israelis from Shefa-'Amr demonstrating in front of the Haifa court building with Palestinian flags]]
Tensions between Arabs and the state rose in [[October 2000 events|October 2000]] when 12 Arab citizens and one man from Gaza were killed while protesting the government's response to the [[Second Intifada]]. In response to this incident, the government established the [[Or Commission]]. The events of October 2000 caused many Arabs to question the nature of their Israeli citizenship. To a large extent, they boycotted the [[Israeli prime ministerial election, 2001|2001 Israeli Elections]] as a means of protest.&lt;ref name="Identity Crisis"/&gt; This boycott helped Ariel Sharon defeat Ehud Barak. In 1999 elections, more than 90 percent of Israel's Arab minority had voted for Ehud Barak.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-On, D., The others within us, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] enlistment by [[Bedouin]] citizens of Israel dropped significantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/jps.2003.32.3.5?journalCode=jps Embattled Identities: Palestinian Soldiers in the Israeli Military], Rhoda Kanaaneh, Journal of Palestine Studies, vol. 32, no. 3 (Spring, 2003), pp. 5–20&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Arab advocacy organizations complained that the Israeli government had invested time and effort to protect Jewish citizens from Hezbollah attacks, but had neglected Arab citizens. They pointed to a dearth of bomb shelters in Arab towns and villages and a lack of basic emergency information in Arabic.&lt;ref name="Arab Citizens and the 2006 War"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mossawacenter.org/files/files/File/Reports/2006/The%20Arab%20Citizens%20of%20Israel%20and%20the%202006%20War%20in%20Lebanon(2).pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205090430/http://www.mossawacenter.org/files/files/File/Reports/2006/The%20Arab%20Citizens%20of%20Israel%20and%20the%202006%20War%20in%20Lebanon%282%29.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2007 |title=The Arab Citizens of Israel and the 2006 War in Lebanon |accessdate=17 July 2007 |publisher=Mossawa |year=2006 |work=The Arab Citizens of Israel and the 2006 War in Lebanon: Reflections and Realities |format=PDF |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Israeli Jews viewed the Arab opposition to government policy and sympathy with the Lebanese as a sign of disloyalty.&lt;ref name="Arabs and War in North"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dayan.org/kapjac/files/War_North1_EN.pdf |title=The Arabs in Israel and the War in the North |accessdate=17 July 2007 |publisher=Konard Adenauer Program for Jewish-Arab Cooperation |year=2006 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926132101/http://www.dayan.org/kapjac/files/War_North1_EN.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, tensions rose when Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] invited a right-wing political party [[Yisrael Beiteinu]], to join his coalition government. The party leader, [[Avigdor Lieberman]], advocated an ethnicity based territory exchange, the [[Lieberman Plan]], by transferring heavily populated Arab areas (mainly [[Triangle (Israel)|the Triangle]]), to Palestinian Authority control and annexing major Jewish Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank close to the green line as part of a peace proposal.&lt;ref name="VOAnews-20061024"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Cabinet Appointment Tilts Israel to Right |author=Jim Teeple |publisher=Voice of America, Online English Edition |date=24 October 2006 |accessdate=31 October 2006 |url=http://voanews.com/english/2006-10-24-voa7.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024192908/http://voanews.com/english/2006-10-24-voa7.cfm |archivedate=24 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabs who would prefer to remain in Israel instead of becoming citizens of a Palestinian state would be able to move to Israel.

In January 2007 the first non-Druze Arab minister in Israel's history, [[Raleb Majadele]], was appointed minister without portfolio ([[Salah Tarif]], a [[Druze]], had been appointed a minister without portfolio in 2001). The appointment was criticized by the left, which felt it was an attempt to cover up the Labor Party's decision to sit with Yisrael Beiteinu in the government, and by the right, who saw it as a threat to Israel's status as a Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Stern-Raleb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Labor MK Raleb Majadele to be appointed first Arab minister|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/812014.html|date=10 January 2007|author=Yoav Stern|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haaretz-20070112"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/812625.html Lieberman calls on Peretz to quit post for appointing first Arab minister] Haaretz, 12 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally settled communities of [[Muslim]] Arabs comprise about 70% of the Arab population in Israel. In 2010, the average number of children per mother was 3.84, dropping from 3.97 in 2008. The Muslim population is mostly young: 42% of Muslims are under the age of 15. The median age of Muslim Israelis is 18, while the median age of Jewish Israelis is 30. The percentage of people over 65 is less than 3% for Muslims, compared with 12% for the Jewish population.&lt;ref name="Statistics"/&gt;

Most Israeli [[Druze]] live in the north of the country and are recognised as a separate community to Arabs. The Galilean Druze and Druze of the Haifa region received Israeli citizenship automatically in 1948. After Israel captured the [[Golan Heights]] from Syria in 1967 and annexed it to Israel in 1981, the Druze of the Golan Heights were offered full Israeli citizenship under the [[Golan Heights Law]]. Most declined Israeli citizenship and retain [[Syria]]n citizenship and identity and are treated as permanent residents of Israel.&lt;ref name="Scott Wilson"&gt;{{cite news|title=Golan Heights Land, Lifestyle Lure Settlers|author=Scott Wilson|date=30 October 2006|accessdate=6 May 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/29/AR2006102900926.html | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]], the Druze did not embrace the rising [[Arab nationalism]] of the time or participate in violent confrontations. In 1948, many Druze volunteered for the Israeli army and no Druze villages were destroyed or permanently abandoned.&lt;ref name="IDMC"/&gt; Since the establishment of the state, the Druze have demonstrated solidarity with Israel and distanced themselves from Arab and Islamic radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/the_middle_east_journal/v064/64.4.nisan.pdf|title=The Druze in Israel: Questions of Identity, Citizenship, and Patriotism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Druze citizens serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name="Christian Arabs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=555549|title=Christian Arabs / Second in a series – Israel's Christian Arabs don't want to fight to fit in|first=Yoav|last=Stern|publisher=Haaretz|date=23 March 2005|accessdate=7 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the responses of the survey participants reveal individual attitudes that assign a broader (albeit secondary, identity) dimension to the component of Israeli civic identity"&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabs living in [[East Jerusalem]], occupied and administered by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967, are a special case. Although they hold Israeli ID cards, most are permanent residents since few accepted Israel's offer of citizenship after the war's end, refusing to recognize its sovereignty, and most maintain close ties with the West Bank.&lt;ref name=BBCEJ/&gt; As permanent residents, they are eligible to vote in [[Jerusalem]]'s municipal elections, although only a small percentage takes advantage of this right.

The remaining Druze population of the Golan Heights, occupied and administered by Israel in 1967, are considered permanent residents under the [[Golan Heights Law]] of 1981. Few have accepted full Israeli citizenship and the vast majority consider themselves citizens of [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Scott Wilson"/&gt;

46% of the country's Arabs (622,400 people) live in predominantly Arab communities in the north.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; In {{Israel populations|Year}} [[Nazareth]] was the largest Arab city, with a population of {{Israel populations|Nazareth}},{{Israel populations|reference}} roughly 40,000 of whom are Muslim. [[Shefa-'Amr]] has a population of approximately {{Israel populations|Shefar'am}} and the city is mixed with sizable populations of Muslims, Christians, and Druze.

[[Jerusalem]], a mixed city, has the largest overall Arab population. Jerusalem housed 209,000 Arabs in 2000 and they make up some 33% of the city's residents and together with the local council of [[Abu Ghosh]], some 19% of the country's entire Arab population.

14% of Arab citizens live in the [[Haifa District]] predominantly in the [[Wadi Ara]] region. Here is the largest Muslim city, [[Umm al-Fahm]], with a population of {{Israel populations|Umm Al-fahm}}. [[Baqa-Jatt]] is the second largest Arab population center in the district. The city of [[Haifa]] has an Arab population of 10%, much of it in the [[Wadi Nisnas]], Abbas and Halissa neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

10% of the country's Arab population resides in the [[Central District (Israel)|Central District]] of Israel, primarily the cities of [[Tayibe]], [[Tira, Israel|Tira]], and [[Qalansawe]] as well as the mixed cities of [[Lod]] and [[Ramla]] which have mainly Jewish populations.&lt;ref name="Statistics"/&gt;

Of the remaining 11%, 10% live in Bedouin communities in the northwestern [[Negev]]. The Bedouin city of [[Rahat]] is the only Arab city in the [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern District]] and it is the third largest Arab city in Israel.

The remaining 1% of the country's Arab population lives in cities that are almost entirely Jewish, such as [[Nazareth Illit]] with an Arab population of 22%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications16/local_authorities14_1642/pdf/318_1061.pdf נצרת עילית 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv-Yafo]], 4%.&lt;ref name="Statistics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arabhra.org"/&gt;

===Perceived demographic threat===
{{Main|Demographic threat#Israel}}
In the northern part of Israel the percentage of Jewish population is declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3481768,00.html|title=Jewish population in Galilee declining — Ynetnews|accessdate=14 June 2008|date=12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing population of Arabs within Israel, and the majority status they hold in two major geographic regions – the Galilee and the [[Triangle (Israel)|Triangle]] – has become a growing point of open political contention in recent years. [[Wahid Abd Al-Magid|Dr. Wahid Abd Al-Magid]], the editor of ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'s'' "Arab Strategic Report", predicts that: "The Arabs of 1948 (i.e. Arabs who stayed within the bounds of Israel and accepted citizenship) may become a majority in Israel in 2035, and they will certainly be the majority in 2048."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=8828 Egyptian Dream: Israel will disappear "thanks to demographics"] • Global Jewish Agenda, 8 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Among Arabs, Muslims have the highest birth rate, followed by Druze, and then Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/israeliarabs.html Statistics Regarding Israeli Arabs], Jewish Virtual Library, November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The phrase ''demographic threat'' (or ''demographic bomb'') is used within the [[politics of Israel|Israeli political sphere]] to describe the growth of Israel's Arab citizenry as constituting a threat to its maintenance of its status as a [[homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish state]] with a Jewish demographic majority.

Israeli historian [[Benny Morris]] stated in 2004 that, while he strongly opposes expulsion of Israeli Arabs, in case of an "apocalyptic" scenario where Israel comes under total attack with [[non-conventional weapons]] and comes under existential threat, an expulsion might be the only option. He compared the Israeli Arabs to a "time bomb" and "a potential [[fifth column]]" in both demographic and security terms and said they are liable to undermine the state in time of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Survival of the Fittest |author=Ari Shavit |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/shavit01162004.html |date=16 January 2004 |accessdate=8 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pvy2Rvfw?url=http://www.counterpunch.org/shavit01162004.html |archivedate=23 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several politicians&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;a fifth column, a league of traitors" (Evelyn Gordon, [https://archive.is/20130706010812/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1157913624780 "No longer the political fringe"], [[The Jerusalem Post]], 14 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[Avigdor Lieberman] compared Arab MKs to collaborators with Nazis and expressed the hope that they would be executed." (Uzi Benziman, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/772911.html "For want of stability"], [[Ha'aretz]].)&lt;/ref&gt; have viewed the Arabs in Israel as a security and demographic threat.&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;many Israeli Jews view Israeli Arabs as a security and demographic threat." (Evelyn Gordon, [https://archive.is/20120709122234/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178708666171&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer "'Kassaming' coexistence"], [[The Jerusalem Post]], 23 May 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Why is Arab criticism always labeled as conspiracy to destroy Israel?" (Abir Kopty, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3385477,00.html "Fifth column forever?"], [[Ynetnews]], 7 April 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;they hurl accusations against us, like that we are a 'fifth column.'" (Roee Nahmias, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3285075,00.html "Arab MK: Israel committing 'genocide' of Shiites"], [[Ynetnews]], 2 August 2006.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "demographic bomb" was famously used by Benjamin Netanyahu in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/netanyahu-israel-s-arabs-are-the-real-demographic-threat-1.109045
|title=Netanyahu: Israel's Arabs are the real demographic threat

|publisher=[[Haaretz]]
|author=Sedan, Gil}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he noted that, if the percentage of Arab citizens rises above its current level of about 20 percent, Israel will not be able to maintain a Jewish demographic majority. Netanyahu's comments were criticized as [[racism|racist]] by Arab Knesset members and a range of civil rights and human rights organizations, such as the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/mks-slam-netanyahu-s-remarks-about-israeli-arabs-1.108963
|title=MKs slam Netanyahu's remarks about Israeli Arabs
|date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier allusions to the "demographic threat" can be found in an internal Israeli government document drafted in 1976 known as the [[Koenig Memorandum]], which laid out a plan for reducing the number and influence of Arab citizens of Israel in the [[Galilee]] region.

In 2003, the Israeli daily ''Ma'ariv'' published an article entitled "Special Report: Polygamy is a Security Threat", detailing a report put forth by the Director of the Population Administration at the time, Herzl Gedj; the report described [[polygamy]] in the Bedouin sector a "security threat" and advocated means of reducing the birth rate in the Arab sector.&lt;ref&gt;Manski, Rebecca. "A Desert 'Mirage:' Privatizing Development Plans in the Negev/Naqab"; Bustan, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Administration is a department of the Demographic Council, whose purpose, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, is: "...to increase the Jewish birthrate by encouraging women to have more children using government grants, housing benefits, and other incentives".&lt;ref&gt;HRA: Weekly Review of the Arab Press, issue no. 92&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the minister of the interior appointed Yaakov Ganot as new head of the Population Administration, which according to ''Haaretz'' is "probably the most important appointment an interior minister can make".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/878895.html|title=Haaretz on new head of Population Administration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2006 study rejects the "demographic time bomb" threat based on statistical data that shows Jewish births have increased while Arab births have begun to drop.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Zimmerman, Roberta Seid and Michael L. Wise: [http://www.israeldemography.com/Forecast%20for%20Israel%202025%20June%202006.ppt ''Population Forecast for Israel and West Bank • 2025'']. Sixth Herzliya Conference, 23 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted shortcomings in earlier demographic predictions (for example, in the 1960s, predictions suggested that Arabs would be the majority in 1990). The study also demonstrated that Christian Arab and Druze birth rates were actually below those of Jewish birth rates in Israel. The study used data from a Gallup poll to demonstrate that the desired family size for Arabs in Israel and Jewish Israelis were the same. The study's population forecast for 2025 predicted that Arabs would comprise only 25% of the Israeli population. Nevertheless, the Bedouin population, with its high birth rates, continues to be perceived as a threat to a Jewish demographic majority in the south, and a number of development plans, such as the [[Blueprint Negev]], address this concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bustan.org/2006/08/current_strategy_for_negev_development.html |title=Negev development plans to address the Bedouin "demographic threat" |accessdate=2008-04-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409102217/http://bustan.org/2006/08/current_strategy_for_negev_development.html |archivedate=9 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study showed that in 2010, Jewish birthrates rose by 31% and 19,000 diaspora Jews immigrated to Israel, while the Arab birthrate fell by 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benari |first=Elad |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/142226 |title=Number of Israeli Jews Increases – Inside Israel – News |publisher=Israel National News |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Israeli politicians advocate land-swap proposals in order to assure a continued Jewish majority within Israel. A specific proposal is that Israel transfer sovereignty of part of the Arab-populated [[Wadi Ara]] area (west of the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]) to a future Palestinian state, in return for formal sovereignty over the major Jewish settlement "blocks" that lie inside the [[West Bank]] east of the Green Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trading Places|author=Aluf Benn|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/13/AR2005081300091_pf.html|date=14 August 2005|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avigdor Lieberman]] of [[Yisrael Beiteinu]], the fourth largest faction in the 17th Knesset, is one of the foremost advocates of the transfer of large Arab towns located just inside Israel near the border with the [[West Bank]] (e.g. [[Tayibe]], [[Umm al-Fahm]], [[Baqa al-Gharbiyye]]), to the jurisdiction of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in exchange for [[Israeli settlement]]s located inside the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Amayreh, Khalid.{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/FED27702-1D56-4699-8BC1-3415D354D3B6.htm |title=''Israeli minister wants Arabs expelled'' |accessdate=2006-03-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220184734/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/FED27702-1D56-4699-8BC1-3415D354D3B6.htm |archivedate=20 February 2006 |df=dmy }} .

''Ynetnews'', 23 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] formally joined in the ruling government's parliamentary coalition, headed by [[Kadima]]. After the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli Cabinet]] confirmed Avigdor Lieberman's appointment to the position of "minister for strategic threats", Labour Party representative and science, sport and culture minister [[Ophir Pines-Paz]] resigned his post.&lt;ref name="VOAnews-20061024"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=165508|title=Labor's Paz-Pines resigns as government minister|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=30 October 2006|accessdate=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his resignation letter to Ehud Olmert, Pines-Paz wrote: "I couldn't sit in a government with a minister who preaches racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/pines-paz-i-can-t-sit-in-gov-t-with-racist-1.203813|title=Pines-Paz: I can't sit in gov't with racist|journal=Haaretz|author=Mazal Mualem|date=31 October 2006|accessdate=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lieberman Plan]] caused a stir among Arab citizens of Israel. Various polls show that Arabs in Israel do not wish to move to the West Bank or Gaza if a Palestinian state is created there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/23/opinion/eddromi.php Israeli Arabs and the Vote]. International Herald Tribune, 24 March 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207200521/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/23/opinion/eddromi.php |date=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey conducted by Kul Al-Arab among 1,000 residents of Um Al-Fahm, 83 percent of respondents opposed the idea of transferring their city to Palestinian jurisdiction, while 11 percent supported the proposal and 6 percent did not express their position.&lt;ref name="AlArab"&gt;Kul Al-Arab (Nazareth, Israel), 28 July 2000, cited in "Um Al-Fahm Prefers Israel", by Joseph Algazy, Haaretz, 1 August 2000. Online copy available [http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/358.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

Of those opposed to the idea, 54% said that they were against becoming part of a [[Palestinian state]] because they wanted to continue living under a democratic regime and enjoying a good standard of living. Of these opponents, 18% said that they were satisfied with their present situation, that they were born in Israel and that they were not interested in moving to any other state. Another 14% of this same group said that they were not prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of the creation of a Palestinian state. Another 11 percent cited no reason for their opposition.&lt;ref name="AlArab"/&gt;

==Politics==

===Arab political parties===

There are three mainstream Arab parties in Israel: [[Hadash]] (a joint Arab-Jewish party with a large Arab presence), [[Balad (political party)|Balad]], and the [[United Arab List]], which is a coalition of several different political organizations including the [[Islamic Movement in Israel]]. In addition to these, there is [[Ta'al]]. All of these parties primarily represent Arab-Israeli and Palestinian interests, and the Islamic Movement is an [[Islamism|Islamist]] organization with two factions: one that opposes Israel's existence, and another that opposes its existence as a Jewish state. Two Arab parties ran in Israel's [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first election in 1949]], with one, the [[Democratic List of Nazareth]], winning two seats. Until the 1960s all Arab parties in the Knesset were aligned with [[Mapai]], the ruling party.

A minority of Arabs join and vote for [[Zionism|Zionist]] parties; in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]] 30% of the Arab vote went to such parties, up from 25% in [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|2003]],&lt;ref name=od&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/conflict-debate_97/beyond_zionism_4547.jsp Arabs in Israel: on the move] Open Democracy, 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; though down on the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|1999]] (31%) and [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|1996 elections]] (33%).&lt;ref&gt;Frisch, H.

Arab-dominated parties typically do not join governing coalitions. However, historically these parties have formed alliances with dovish Israeli parties and promoted the formation of their governments by voting with them from the opposition. Arab parties are credited with keeping Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in power, and they have suggested they would do the same for a government led by Labor leader [[Isaac Herzog]] and peace negotiator [[Tzipi Livni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2015/Israel-s-Arab-lawmakers-unite-for-first-time-hoping-to-boost-voter-turnout-unseat-premier/id-8742e9a3dce1497ca8e762e349b21bfe |title=Arab lawmakers shake up Israeli politics with historic union |author=Areej Hazboun and Daniel Estrin |publisher=Associated Press |date=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/arab-parties-hadash-set-to-announce-unity-deal/ |title=Arab parties, Hadash set to announce unity deal |author=Adiv Sternman |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 ''[[Haaretz]]'' poll found that a majority of Israeli Arabs would like their parties, then running on a [[Joint List|joint list]], to join the governing coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-election-2015/.premium-1.643361

Palestinian Arabs sat in the state's [[List of members of the first Knesset|first parliamentary assembly]]; as of 2011, 13 of the 120 members of the [[Knesset|Israeli Parliament]] are Arab citizens, most representing Arab political parties, and one of Israel's [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] judges is a Palestinian Arab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country's Report Israel|publisher=Freedom House|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=363&amp;year=2011&amp;country=8060|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, there are 17 Arab members of knesset. Along with 13 out of the 14 members of the Joint List, there will be four Arab parliamentarians representing Zionist parties, which is double their number in the previous Knesset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.647598|title=More Women and Arabs, Fewer Orthodox in Next Knesset|journal=Haaretz|first=Judy|last=Maltz|date=18 March 2015|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Arab Members of the Knesset, past and present, are under police investigation for their visits to countries designated as enemy countries by Israeli law. This law was amended following MK Mohammad Barakeh's trip to Syria in 2001, such that MKs must explicitly request permission to visit these countries from the Minister of the Interior. In August 2006, Balad MKs [[Azmi Bishara]], [[Jamal Zahalka]], and [[Wasil Taha]] visited [[Syria]] without requesting nor receiving such permission, and a criminal investigation of their actions was launched. Former Arab Member of Knesset [[Mohammed Miari]] was questioned 18 September 2006 by police on suspicion of having entered a designated enemy country without official permission. He was questioned "under caution" for 2.5 hours in the [[Petah Tikva]] station about his recent visit to Syria. Another former Arab Member of Knesset, [[Muhammad Kanaan]], was also summoned for police questioning regarding the same trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/760939.html|title=Bar-On wants passports of Arab MKs who visited Syria revoked – Haaretz – Israel News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, six Arab MKs visited [[Libya]], an openly anti-Zionist Arab state, and met with [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] and various senior government officials. Gaddafi urged them to seek a [[one-state solution]], and for Arabs to "multiply" in order to counter any "plots" to expel them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3880679,oo.html |title=Gaddafi to Arab MKs: I've nothing against Jews – Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights of citizens are guaranteed by a set of [[Basic Laws of Israel|basic laws]] (Israel does not have a written constitution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_yesod.htm|title=Basic Laws – Introduction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this set of laws does not explicitly include the term "right to equality", the Israeli Supreme Court has consistently interpreted "Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic3_eng.htm|title=Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation (1994)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic4_eng.htm|title=Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation (1994)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guaranteeing equal rights for all Israeli citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfjfp.org/factsheets/arabsinisrael.htm |title=The Arab Citizens of Israel |accessdate=2008-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203050855/http://www.jfjfp.org/factsheets/arabsinisrael.htm |archivedate=3 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that "Arab Israelis are citizens of Israel with equal rights" and states that "The only legal distinction between Arab and Jewish citizens is not one of rights, but rather of civic duty. Since Israel's establishment, Arab citizens have been exempted from compulsory service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/8/Arab%20Israelis |title=Arab Israelis |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050854/http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfaarchive/2000_2009/2001/8/arab%20israelis |archivedate=3 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Druze and [[Circassians]] are drafted into the Israeli army, while other Arabs may serve voluntarily; however, only a very small number of Arabs choose to volunteer for the Israeli army&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rise in Arab National Service Volunteers|author=Aviel Magnezi|publisher=Ynetnews.com|date=25 October 2010|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3974580,00.html|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Many Arab citizens feel that the state, as well as society at large, not only actively limits them to second-class citizenship, but treats them as enemies, affecting their perception of the ''[[de jure]]'' versus ''de facto'' quality of their citizenship.&lt;ref name="ynetnews1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop Treating Arab Citizens Like Enemies|author=Roee Nahamias|publisher=Ynetnews.com|date=24 April 2007|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3391545,00.html|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint document ''[[The Future Vision of the Palestinian Arabs in Israel]]'', asserts: "Defining the Israeli State as a Jewish State and exploiting democracy in the service of its Jewishness excludes us, and creates tension between us and the nature and essence of the State." The document explains that by definition the "Jewish State" concept is based on ethnically preferential treatment towards Jews enshrined in immigration (the [[Law of Return]]) and land policy (the [[Jewish National Fund]]), and calls for the establishment of minority rights protections enforced by an independent anti-discrimination commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adalah.org/newsletter/eng/dec06/tasawor-mostaqbali.pdf "The Future Vision of the Palestinian Arabs in Israel"] pp. 5–12&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 report by [[Mossawa Center|Mossawa]], an advocacy center for Palestinian-Arab citizens of Israel, states that since the events of [[October 2000 events|October 2000]], 16 Arabs had been killed by security forces, bringing the total to 29 victims of "institutional violence" in four years.&lt;ref name=Mossawa&gt;{{cite web|title=Racism in Israel 2004:Thousands of Arab Citizens Suffer from Racism, Xenophobia, Incitement and Violence |author=Mossawa |date=6 June 2004 |accessdate=19 December 2007 |url=http://www.mossawacenter.org/default.php?lng=3&amp;dp=2&amp;fl=4&amp;pg=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206195448/http://www.mossawacenter.org/default.php?lng=3&amp;dp=2&amp;fl=4&amp;pg=2 |archivedate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed Sa'adi, in his article on ''The Concept of Protest and its Representation by the Or Commission'', states that since 1948 the only protestors to be killed by the police have been Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Concept of Protest and its Representation by the Or Commission|author=Dr. Ahmed Sa'adi|publisher=Adalah's Newsletter|date=October 2004|volume=6|url=http://www.adalah.org/newsletter/eng/oct04/sadi.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yousef Munayyer, an Israeli citizen and the executive director of [[The Jerusalem Fund]], wrote that Palestinians only have varying degrees of limited rights in Israel. He states that although Palestinians make up about 20% of Israel's population, less than 7% of the budget is allocated to Palestinian citizens. He describes the 1.5 million Arab citizens of Israel as second-class citizens while four million more are not citizens at all. He states that a Jew from any country can move to Israel but a Palestinian refugee, with a valid claim to property in Israel, cannot. Munayyer also described the difficulties he and his wife faced when visiting the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Not All Israeli Citizens Are Equal | author= Yousef Munayyer |date=2012-05-23 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/opinion/not-all-israeli-citizens-are-equal.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic and Hebrew as official languages===
[[Image:Hebrew Arabic English road signs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Israeli road signs in Arabic, Hebrew and English]]
[[Arabic language|Arabic]] was until July 2018 one of Israel's official languages.&lt;ref name="NYT 2018"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-07-21|title=Israeli Law Declares the Country the ‘Nation-State of the Jewish People’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/middleeast/israel-law-jews-arabic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Arabic increased significantly following [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] rulings in the 1990s. [[Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People]] defines Hebrew as the official language of the State and gives the Arabic language a special status.

Government ministries publish all material intended for the public in Hebrew, with selected material translated into Arabic, English, Russian, and other languages spoken in Israel. There are laws that secure the Arab population's right to receive information in Arabic. Some examples include a portion of the public television channels' productions must be in Arabic or translated into Arabic, safety regulations in working places must be published in Arabic if a significant number of the workers are Arabs, information about medicines or dangerous chemicals must be provided in Arabic, and information regarding elections must be provided in Arabic. The country's laws are published in Hebrew, and eventually English and Arabic translations are published.&lt;ref name="Spolsky"/&gt; Publishing the law in Hebrew in the [[official gazette]] (''[[Reshumot]]'') is enough to make it valid. Unavailability of an Arabic translation can be regarded as a legal defense only if the defendant proves he could not understand the meaning of the law in any conceivable way. Following appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the use of Arabic on street signs and labels increased dramatically. In response to one of the appeals presented by Arab Israeli organizations,{{Which|date=September 2010}} the Supreme Court ruled that although second to Hebrew, Arabic is an official language of the State of Israel, and should be used extensively. Today most highway signage is trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic, and English).

Many Arab villages lack street signs of any kind and the Hebrew name is often used.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Milner.

This curriculum includes mandatory lessons of Hebrew as foreign language from the 3rd grade onwards. Arabic is taught in Hebrew-speaking schools, but only the basic level is mandatory. In the summer of 2008, there was an unsuccessful attempt of right-wing lawmakers to strip Arabic of its status alongside Hebrew as an official language of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Jeffay.[http://www.forward.com/articles/13577/ "Knesset Hawks Move To Strip Arabic of Official Status in Israel"]; ''The Jewish Daily Forward,'' 12 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli national symbols===
[[Image:Flag of Israel.svg|thumb|200px|right|The [[flag of Israel]], based on [[the Star of David]]]]
Some Arab politicians have requested a reevaluation of the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]] and [[Hatikvah|national anthem]], arguing that the [[Star of David]] at the flag's center is an exclusively Jewish symbol, and [[Hatikvah]] does not represent Arab citizens, since it speaks of the Jewish people's desire to return to their homeland. The [[High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel]] and the National Committee for the Heads of the Arab Local Authorities in Israel stated in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future Vision of Palestinian Arabs in Israel |author=The National Committee for the Heads of the Arab Local Authorities in Israel |date=December 2006 |url=http://www.mossawacenter.org/files/files/File/Reports/2006/Future%20Vision%20(English).pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=8 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327103836/http://www.mossawacenter.org/files/files/File/Reports/2006/Future%20Vision%20%28English%29.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Israeli legal system includes a number of core laws that produce and reinforce inequality between the Arabs and the Jews in Israel. [...] The official bias is not restricted to symbols such as the Israeli flag, but also to deeper legal issues concerning all Palestinian Arabs [...] [t]he official definition of Israel as a Jewish state created a fortified ideological barrier in the face of obtaining full equality for the Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel [...] We, the Palestinians in Israel, are an integral part of this place [...] Israel has tried over the past decades to disengage us from this place, not through physical transfer but through intellectual emotional transfer. Israel has tried to create a new identity on the basis of 'loyalty to the state' [...] The State has not determined a position acceptable to us yet in terms of nurturing our Arab culture.}}

[[Michael Oren]], the former [[Israeli ambassador to the United Nations]], has argued that since the [[Seal of Solomon]] (Star of David) is also considered to be an Islamic symbol, Arab citizens of Israel should be able to feel the same sense of loyalty to the flag as Jewish citizens do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418630070&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090820162145/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418630070&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 August 2009 |title=Oren hopes Arabs can salute Israeli flag |first=Jonah |last=Newman |date=17 August 2009 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence Day===
In Israel, Independence Day takes place on 5 Iyar according to the [[Hebrew calendar]], which means it falls on different dates every year under the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Arab citizens of Israel generally mark al-Nakba both on this day, and on 15 May, as do other Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Arabs to mark Nakba day with march|author=Eli Ashkenazi|publisher=Ha'aretz Online, English Edition|date=26 April 2004|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=420090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Druze soldiers, however, were present at Israel's first Independence Day Parade in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;"The Druze in Israel," Dr. Naim Aridi, Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, {{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/12/Focus%20on%20Israel-%20The%20Druze%20in%20Israel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303144228/http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfaarchive/2000_2009/2002/12/focus%20on%20israel-%20the%20druze%20in%20israel |archivedate=3 March 2007 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and there have since been parades for Druze and [[Circassians]], as well as special events for Bedouins, on Independence Day.&lt;ref&gt;"Israeli Arabs find no joy during Independence Day," Larry Derfner, ''Jewish News Weekly'', 24 April 1998,[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/8570/edition_id/162/format/html/displaystory.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the mayor of [[Shefa-'Amr]], Ursan Yassin, met with officials of the Israeli state committee on the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of independence and announced that Shefa-'Amr intended to take part in the celebrations. He stated: "This is our country and we completely disapprove of the statements made by the Higher Monitoring Committee. I want to hold a central ceremony in Shefa-'Amr, raise all the flags and have a huge feast. The 40,000 residents of Shefa-'Amr feel that they are a part of the State of Israel...The desire to participate in the festivities is shared by most of the residents. We will not raise our children to hate the country. This is our country and we want to live in coexistence with its Jewish residents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3501480,00.html|title=Arab town plans big celebration for Israel's Independence Day|publisher=|date= 1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship and Entry Law===
On 31 July 2003, Israel enacted the [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]] (Temporary Provision), 5763-2003, a one-year amendment to Israel's Citizenship Law denying citizenship and Israeli residence to Palestinians who reside in the [[West Bank]] or [[Gaza Strip]] and who marry Israelis; the rule has been waived for any Palestinian "who identifies with the State of Israel and its goals, when he or a member of his family has taken concrete action to advance the security, economy or any other matter important to the State". Upon expiration the law was extended for six months in August 2004, and again for four months in February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/hrpa.html|title=Human Rights Issues for the Palestinian Population| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080706062448/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/hrpa.html| archivedate= 6 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 May 2005, the Israeli ministerial committee for issues of legislation once again amended the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, to restrict citizenship and residence in Israel only to Palestinian men over the age of 35, and Palestinian women over the age of 25.

Defenders of the Citizenship and Entry Law say it is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and preserving the "Jewish character" of Israel by restricting Arab immigration.&lt;ref name="scotsman1"/&gt; The new bill was formulated in accordance with [[Shin Bet]] statistics showing that involvement in terror attacks declines with age. This newest amendment, in practice, removes restrictions from half of the Palestinian population requesting legal status through marriage in Israel. This law was upheld by a High Court decision in 2006.&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=721352006|title=Arab spouses face Israeli legal purge|author=Ben Lynfield|work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh, Scotland|date=15 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights===
{{Main|Ethnic discrimination in Israel#Directed at Arabs}}
The [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] stated that the State of Israel would ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex, and guaranteed freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture. While formally equal according to Israeli law, a number of official sources acknowledge that Arab citizens of Israel experience discrimination in many aspects of life. Israeli High Court Justice (Ret.) Theodor Or wrote in [[Or Commission|The Report by the State Commission of Inquiry into the Events of October 2000]]:&lt;ref&gt;Or Commission Report, page 33, ''Israel Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, 25–53&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Arab citizens of Israel live in a reality in which they experience discrimination as Arabs. This inequality has been documented in a large number of professional surveys and studies, has been confirmed in court judgments and government resolutions, and has also found expression in reports by the state comptroller and in other official documents. Although the Jewish majority's awareness of this discrimination is often quite low, it plays a central role in the sensibilities and attitudes of Arab citizens. This discrimination is widely accepted, both within the Arab sector and outside it, and by official assessments, as a chief cause of agitation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Or Commission report also states that activities by Islamic organizations may be using religious pretenses to further political aims. The commission describes such actions as a factor in 'inflaming' the Muslim population in Israel against the authorities, and cites the [[al-Sarafand]] mosque episode, with Muslims' attempts to restore the mosque and Jewish attempts to stop them, as an example of the 'shifting of dynamics' of the relationship between Muslims and the Israeli authorities.

According to the 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government had done "little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens".&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41723.htm|title=Israel and the occupied territories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices''&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004"/&gt; notes that:
* "Israeli-Arab advocacy organizations have challenged the Government's policy of demolishing illegal buildings in the Arab sector, and claimed that the Government was more restrictive in issuing building permits in Arab communities than in Jewish communities, thereby not accommodating natural growth."
* "In June, the Supreme Court ruled that omitting Arab towns from specific government social and economic plans is discriminatory. This judgment builds on previous assessments of disadvantages suffered by Arab Israelis."
* "Israeli-Arab organizations have challenged as discriminatory the 1996 "Master Plan for the Northern Areas of Israel," which listed as priority goals increasing the Galilee's Jewish population and blocking the territorial contiguity of Arab towns."
* "Israeli Arabs were not required to perform mandatory military service and, in practice, only a small percentage of Israeli Arabs served in the military. Those who did not serve in the army had less access than other citizens to social and economic benefits for which military service was a prerequisite or an advantage, such as housing, new-household subsidies, and employment, especially government or security-related industrial employment. The Ivri Committee on National Service has issued official recommendations to the Government that Israel Arabs not be compelled to perform national or "civic" service, but be afforded an opportunity to perform such service"."
* "According to a 2003 University of Haifa study, a tendency existed to impose heavier prison terms to Arab citizens than to Jewish citizens. Human rights advocates claimed that Arab citizens were more likely to be convicted of murder and to have been denied bail."
* "The Orr Commission of Inquiry's report […] stated that the 'Government handling of the Arab sector has been primarily neglectful and discriminatory,' that the Government 'did not show sufficient sensitivity to the needs of the Arab population, and did not take enough action to allocate state resources in an equal manner.' As a result, 'serious distress prevailed in the Arab sector in various areas. Evidence of distress included poverty, unemployment, a shortage of land, serious problems in the education system, and substantially defective infrastructure.'"

''The 2007 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100597.htm|title=Israel and the occupied territories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that:
* "According to a 2005 study at Hebrew University, three times more money was invested in education of Jewish children as in Arab children."

[[Human Rights Watch]] has charged that cuts in veteran benefits and child allowances based on parents' military service discriminate against Arab children: "The cuts will also affect the children of Jewish ultra-orthodox parents who do not serve in the military, but they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not available to Palestinian Arab children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/06/07/isrlpa4026.htm Israel: Cuts in Child Allowance Discriminate Against Palestinian Arab], [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''the Guardian'', in 2006 just 5% of civil servants were Arabs, many of them hired to deal with other Arabs, despite the fact that Arab citizens of Israel comprise 20% of the population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

Although the Bedouin infant mortality rate is still the highest in Israel, and one of the highest in the developed world, ''The Guardian'' reports that in the 2002 budget, Israel's health ministry allocated Arab communities less than 1% of its budget for healthcare facility development.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

In March 2010, a report released by several Israeli civil rights groups stated that the current [[Knesset]] was "the most racist in Israeli history" with 21 bills proposed in 2008 and 2009 that would discriminate against the country's Arab minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1157857.html |title='Current Knesset is the most racist in Israeli history' |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=21 March 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324042038/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1157857.html| archivedate= 24 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A preliminary report commissioned by Israel's Courts Administration and the Israel Bar Association found in 2011 that Israeli Arabs are more likely than Israeli Jews to be convicted of crimes after being charged, more likely to be given custodial sentences, and were given longer sentences. It did not account for "mitigating or aggravating circumstances, prior criminal record and the convict's gender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Tomer Zarchin | title = Israeli Arabs more likely to be convicted for crimes than their Jewish counterparts, study shows | url = http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/israeli-arabs-more-likely-to-be-convicted-for-crimes-than-their-jewish-counterparts-study-shows-1.376521 | publisher=[[Haaretz]] | accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the JNF and the ILA view an exchange of lands as a long-term solution, opponents say that such maneuvers privatize municipal lands and preserve a situation in which significant lands in Israel are not available for use by all of its citizens.&lt;ref name="Pfeffer"/&gt; As of 2007, the High Court delayed ruling on JNF policy regarding leasing lands to non-Jews,&lt;ref name="Pfeffer"/&gt; and changes to the ILA-JNF relationship were up in the air.&lt;ref name="corner"/&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20120512020532/http://www.adalah.org/eng/jnf.php Adalah] and other organizations furthermore express concern that proposed severance of the relation between the ILA and JNF, as suggested by [[Ami Ayalon]], would leave the JNF free to retain the same proportion of lands for Jewish uses as it seeks to settle hundreds of thousands of Jews in areas with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority (in particular, 100,000 Jews in existing [[Galilee]] communities&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; and 250,000 Jews in new [[Negev]] communities via the [[Blueprint Negev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jnf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=advertorial2|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070503040051/http://www.jnf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=advertorial2|deadurl=yes|title=Jewish National Fund: A Message from Ronald S.

The [[Israel Land Administration]], which administers 93% of the land in Israel (including the land owned by the [[Jewish National Fund]]), refuses to lease land to non-Jewish foreign nationals, who include Palestinian residents of Jerusalem who have identity cards but are not citizens of Israel. When ILA land is "bought" in Israel it is actually leased to the "owner" for a period of 49 years. According to article 19 of the ILA lease, foreign nationals are excluded from leasing ILA land, and in practice foreigners may just show that they qualify as Jewish under the Law of Return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1101682.html|title=Most Arabs can't buy most homes in West Jerusalem|first=Nir|last=Hasson|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=21 July 2009|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli law also discriminates between Jewish and Arab residents of Jerusalem regarding rights to recover property owned before the dislocations created by the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Arabs-Jews-dont-have-equal-rights-to-recover-property |title=Arabs, Jews don't have equal rights to recover property |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950 [[Israeli land and property laws relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict#The Absentees Property Law|Absentees Property Law]] said that any property within post-war Israel which was owned by an [[Palestinians|Arab]] who had left the country between 29 November 1947 and 19 May 1948, or by a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] who had merely been abroad or in area of Palestine held by hostile forces up to 1 September 1948, lost all rights to that property. Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes by Jewish or Israeli forces, before and during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, but remained within the borders of what would become Israel, that is, those currently known as Arab citizens of Israel, are deemed [[present absentee]]s by the legislation. Present absentees are regarded as absent by the Israeli government because they left their homes, even if they did not intend to leave them for more than a few days, and even if they did so involuntarily.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, Tom. ''1949: The First Israelis'', pp. 68–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1967 Six-Day War in which Israel occupied the [[West Bank]], from where it annexed [[East Jerusalem]], Israel then passed in 1970 the ''Law and Administration Arrangements Law'' allowing for Jews who had lost property in East Jerusalem and the West Bank during the 1948 war to reclaim it.&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt; Palestinian residents of Jerusalem (absentees) in the same positions, and Arab Israelis (present absentees), who owned property in West Jerusalem or other areas within the state of Israel, and lost it as a result of the 1948 war, cannot recover their properties. Israeli legislation, therefore, allows Jews to recover their land, but not Arabs.&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt;

In the early 2000s, several [[Community settlement (Israel)|community settlements]] in the Negev and the Galilee were accused of barring Arab applicants from moving in. In 2010, the [[Knesset]] passed legislation that allowed admissions committees to function in smaller communities in the Galilee and the Negev, while explicitly forbidding committees to bar applicants based on the basis of race, religion, sex, ethnicity, disability, personal status, age, parenthood, sexual orientation, country of origin, political views, or political affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nevo.co.il/law_word/law14/law-2286.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-s-high-court-orders-jewish-galilee-town-to-accept-arab-couple-1.384296 Israel's High Court orders Jewish Galilee town to accept Arab couple]. Haaretz, Sep. 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, however, say the law gives the privately run admissions committees a wide latitude over public lands, and believe it will worsen discrimination against the Arab minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/24/world/la-fg-israel-arab-laws-20110324 New Israeli laws will increase discrimination against Arabs, critics say].

===Contesting allegations of discrimination===
While groups are not separated by official policy, Israel has a number of different sectors within the society that maintain their strong cultural, religious, ideological, and/or ethnic identity. The Israeli foreign ministry maintains that in spite of the existing social cleavages and economic disparities, the political systems and the courts represent strict legal and civic equality. The Israeli foreign ministry describes the country as: "Not a meltingpot society, but rather more of a mosaic made up of different population groups coexisting in the framework of a democratic state".&lt;ref&gt;''SOCIETY: Minority Communities'', [[Israeli Foreign Ministry|Israeli foreign ministry]] Web site, [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts+About+Israel/People/SOCIETY-+Minority+Communities.htm]. 1 October 2006. Retrieved 19 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ishmael Khaldi]], an Arab citizen of Israel and the nation's first high-ranking Muslim in the Israeli foreign service, while Israeli society is far from perfect, minorities in Israel fare far better than any other country in the Middle East. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;"Lost in the blur of slogans", Ishmael Khaldi, San Francisco Chronicle, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a proud Israeli – along with many other non-Jewish Israelis such as Druze, Bahai, Bedouin, Christians and Muslims, who live in one of the most culturally diversified societies and the only true democracy in the Middle East. Like America, Israeli society is far from perfect, but let us deal honestly. By any yardstick you choose – educational opportunity, economic development, women and gay's rights, freedom of speech and assembly, legislative representation – Israel's minorities fare far better than any other country in the Middle East.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, the Israeli Arab Journalist [[Khaled Abu Toameh]], writing for the [[Gatestone Institute]], declared to a [[Muslim]] audience during the [[Durban Review Conference]], that, while there are serious problems facing the Arab sector in Israel: "Israel is a wonderful place to live and we are happy to be there. Israel is a free and open country. If I were given the choice, I would rather live in Israel as a second class citizen than as a first class citizen in Cairo, Gaza, Amman or Ramallah."&lt;ref name="durban"&gt;[http://www.hudson-ny.org/511/islam-today-1 Islam Today], by Khaled Abu Toameh, 18 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to intermarriage===
Intermarriage is prohibited by the Jewish [[Halakha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=163&amp;letter=I |title=Intermarriage |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of mixed Arab-Jewish marriages, emotions run especially high. A 2007 opinion survey found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage was equivalent to national treason. A group of Jewish men in the [[Jerusalem]] neighborhood of [[Pisgat Ze'ev]] started patrolling the neighborhood to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. The municipality of [[Petah Tikva]] has also announced an initiative to providing a telephone hotline for friends and family to report Jewish girls who date Arab men as well as psychologists to provide counselling. The city of [[Kiryat Gat]] launched a campaign in schools to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men.&lt;ref name="Protect"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=155387 |title='Protecting' Jewish girls from Arabs |publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drive"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/israeli-drive-to-prevent-jewish-girls-dating-arabs |title=Israeli drive to prevent Jewish girls dating Arabs |publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |first=Jonathan |last=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey found that 82% of Israeli Muslims and 88% of Israeli Christians would be uncomfortable with a child of theirs marrying a Jew. 97% of Israeli Jews would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a Muslim and 89% would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/intergroup-marriage-and-friendship/|title=Intergroup marriage and friendship in Israel|last=|first=|date=March 8, 2016|website=Pew Research Center|access-date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knesset===
The Mossawa Center – an advocacy organization for Arabs in Israel – blames the Knesset of discrimination against Arabs, citing a 75% increase in discriminatory and racist bills submitted to the Knesset in the year 2009. According to the report, 11 bills deemed by the center to be "discriminatory and racist" were placed on the legislature's table in 2007, while 12 such bills were initiated in 2008. However, in 2009 a full 21 bills deemed discriminatory by the Mossawa Center were discussed in the Knesset.&lt;ref name="Roffe-Ofir"&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: Current Knesset most racist of all time |first=Sharon |last=Roffe-Ofir |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=21 March 2010 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3865696,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reports categorizes as "racist" proposals such as giving academic scholarships to soldiers who served in combat units, and a bill to revoke government funding from organizations acting "against the principles of the State".&lt;ref name="Roffe-Ofir"/&gt; The Coalition Against Racism and the Mossawa Center said that the proposed legislation seeks to de-legitimize Israel's Arab citizens by decreasing their civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Current Knesset is the most racist in Israeli history' |first=Jack |last=Khoury |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=21 March 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1157857.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic status==
Inequality in the allocation of public funding for Jewish and Arab needs, and widespread employment discrimination, present significant economic hurdles for Arab citizens of Israel.&lt;ref name="economist1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5654988|title=Shutting itself in, hoping for the best|journal=The Economist|date=23 March 2006|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the [[Minorities at Risk]] (MAR) group states that "despite obvious discrimination, Israeli Arabs are relatively much better off economically than neighboring Arabs."&lt;ref name="cidcm1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessment for Arabs in Israel |publisher=Minorities at Risk |accessdate=26 October 2006 |url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=66601 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215113219/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=66601 |archivedate=15 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant feature of the Arab community's economic development after 1949 was its transformation from a predominantly peasant farming population to a proletarian industrial workforce. It has been suggested that the economic development of the community was marked by distinct stages. The first period, until 1967, was characterised by this process of proletarianisation. From 1967 on, economic development of the population was encouraged and an Arab [[bourgeoisie]] began to develop on the margin of the Jewish bourgeoisie. From the 1980s on, the community developed its economic and, in particular, industrial potential.&lt;ref&gt;Féron, pp. 40–41, see also Kodmani, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, the Government categorized all Arab communities in the country as 'class A' development areas, thus making them eligible for tax benefits. This decision aims to encourage investments in the Arab sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3273263,00.html|title=Financial benefits for Arab communities – Israel Money, Ynetnews|accessdate=14 June 2008|date=10 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raanan Dinur, director-general of Prime Minister office, said in December 2006 that Israel had finalized plans to set up a NIS 160 million private equity fund to help develop the businesses of the country's Arab community over the next decade. According to Dinur, companies owned by Arab citizens of Israel will be eligible to apply to the fund for as much as NIS 4 million (USD 952,000), enabling as many as 80 enterprises to receive money over the next 10 years. The Israeli government will, according to Dinur, solicit bids to operate the fund from various financial institutes and private firms, which must pledge to raise at least NIS 80 million (about USD 19 million) from private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3338907,00.html|title=State to raise NIS 160 mn for Arab businesses|author=The Israel Export and International Cooperation Institute|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|date=12 December 2006|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that 53 percent of the impoverished families in Israel were Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/world/middleeast/08israel.html|title=Noted Arab Citizens Call on Israel to Shed Jewish Identity|journal=The New York Times|first=Isabel|last=Kershner|date=8 February 2007|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the majority of Arabs in Israel do not serve in the army, they are ineligible for many financial benefits such as scholarships and housing loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2006&amp;country=6985|title=Israel – Country report – Freedom in the World – 2006|website=www.freedomhouse.org|date=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab towns in Israel are reluctant to collect city taxes from their residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/795055.html|title=Haartez "The Bottom Line / Arab municipalities do not believe in equality in debts"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikkuy, a prominent Arab-Jewish NGO, found that Arabs as a group have the highest home ownership in Israel: 93% compared to 70% among Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=//1088730|title=רוב הערבים בישראל מתגוררים בדירה בבעלותם - וואלה! חדשות|publisher=|date=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While per capita income is lower in the Arab community, these figures do not take into account age (the average age in the Arab community is lower and young people earn less), the low percentage of women who join the workforce, and the large size of Arab families.&lt;ref name=Yemini20April2007&gt;{{cite news|last=Yemini|first=Ben Dror|title=The trap of self-delusion|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/571/620.html|newspaper=Maariv|date=20 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, of the 40 towns in Israel with the highest unemployment rates, 36 were Arab towns.&lt;ref name="Shamir"/&gt; According to the Central Bank of Israel statistics for 2003, salary averages for Arab workers were 29% lower than for Jewish workers.&lt;ref name="Shamir"/&gt; Difficulties in procuring employment have been attributed to a comparatively low level of education vis-a-vis their Jewish counterparts, insufficient employment opportunities in the vicinity of their towns, discrimination by Jewish employers, and competition with foreign workers in fields, such as construction and agriculture.&lt;ref name="Shamir"/&gt; Arab women have a higher unemployment rate in the work force relative to both religious and secular Jewish women. While among Arab men the employment was found to be on par with Jewish men, 17% of Arab women were found to be employed. This puts the Arab employment at 68% of the Israeli average. The Druze and Christian Arabs have higher employment than Muslims.&lt;!--expand sources--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=4827FCE4666F50EF1AEF78B147CF673D.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=39001|title=CJO – Abstract – Changing Labour Force Participation and Occupational Status: Arab Women in the Israeli Labour Force|journal=Work, Employment and Society|volume=13|issue=1|pages=117–131|accessdate=14 June 2008|date=March 1999|last1=Brahm|first1=Iris|last2=Lewin-Epstein|first2=Noah|last3=Semyonov|first3=Moshe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imad Telhami, founder and CEO of Babcom, a call center in the [[Tefen]] Industrial Park with 300 employees, is committed to developing career opportunities for Arab workers in Israel. Telhami, a Christian Arab, was a senior executive at the [[Delta Galil Industries]] textile plant before establishing Babcom. He hopes to employ 5,000 workers within five years: "Israeli companies have been exporting thousands of jobs to India, Eastern Europe and other spots around the globe. I want to bring the jobs here. There are terrific engineers in the Arab sector, and the potential is huge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/a-gateway-into-high-tech-1.312412|title=A Gateway Into High-tech|journal=Haaretz|first=Guy|last=Rolnik|date=6 September 2010|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the government approved a $216 million, five-year development plan for the Israeli Arab sector with the goal of increasing job accessibility, particularly for women and academics. Under this program, some 15,000 new employees will be added to the work roster by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/InnovativeIsrael/Israeli_Arabs_high-tech-March_2011.htm |title=Bringing Israeli Arabs into high-tech |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315202541/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/InnovativeIsrael/Israeli_Arabs_high-tech-March_2011.htm |archivedate=15 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2010s, the Israeli-Arab standard of living was found to be improving, with the number of middle class Arabs growing. In 2017, ''[[Haaretz]]'', which termed Arabs as Israel's "new [[yuppie]]s", reported that Arabs, especially women, were pursuing higher education in increasing numbers, and increasingly seeking white-collar jobs. According to Professor Aziz Haidar of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], in 2017 about 27% of Arabs were middle class (as opposed to 17% two decades before) and 3% were wealthy, and although most Arabs were still in lower-income brackets, the Arab middle class is expanding dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/arabs-are-israel-s-new-yuppies-1.5483071|title=Arabs Are Israel's New Yuppies|journal=Haaretz|date=13 June 2017|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==

The most common health-related causes of death are heart disease and cancer. Roughly 14% were diagnosed with diabetes in 2000.&lt;ref name="JVL-stats"/&gt; Around half of all Arab men smoke.&lt;ref name="JVL-stats"/&gt; Life expectancy has increased 27 years since 1948.

The Israeli government regulates and finances most of the schools operating in the country, including the majority of those run by private organizations. The national school system has two major branches – a Hebrew-speaking branch and an Arabic-speaking branch. The curricula for the two systems are almost identical in mathematics, sciences, and English. It is different in humanities (history, literature, etc.). While Hebrew is taught as a second language in Arab schools since the third grade and obligatory for Arabic-speaking school's matriculation exams, only basic knowledge of Arabic is taught in Hebrew-speaking schools, usually from the 7th to the 9th grade. Arabic is not obligatory for Hebrew speaking school's matriculation exams. The schooling language split operates from preschool, up to the end of high school.

In 2001, [[Human Rights Watch]] described government-run Arab schools as "a world apart from government-run Jewish schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/12/05/isrlpa3399.htm|title=Israeli Schools Separate, Not Equal (Human Rights Watch, 5-12-2001)|website=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found striking differences in virtually every aspect of the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/israel2/ISRAEL0901-01.htm|title=Human Rights Watch: Second Class: Discrimination Against Palestinian Arab Children in Israel's Schools – Summary|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/israel2/ Second Class – Discrimination Against Palestinian Arab Children in Israel's Schools], [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Follow-Up Committee for Arab Education said that the Israeli government spent an average of $192 a year on Arab students compared to $1,100 for Jewish students. The drop-out rate for Arabs was twice as high as for Jews (12% versus 6%). There was a 5,000-classroom shortage in the Arab sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Sector: NIF Grantees Fight Discrimination in Arab Education|publisher=New Israel Fund|date=13 September 2005|url=http://www.nif.org/content.cfm?id=2343&amp;currbody=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807221918/http://www.nif.org/content.cfm?id=2343&amp;currbody=1|archivedate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2004 [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]] for Israel and the occupied territories, "Israeli Arabs were underrepresented in the student bodies and faculties of most universities and in higher professional and business ranks. Well educated Arabs often were unable to find jobs commensurate with their level of education. According to Sikkuy, Arab citizens held approximately 60 to 70 of the country's 5,000 university faculty positions."&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004"/&gt;

Arab educators have long voiced concerns over institutionalized budgetary discrimination. An August 2009 study published by the [[Hebrew University]]'s School of Education claimed that Israel's [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Education Ministry]] discriminated against Arabs in its allocations of special assistance for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and the average per-student allocation at Arab junior high schools was one-fifth the average at Jewish ones. This was due to the allocation method: funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems according to the number of students in each, and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the large proportion of such students in the Arab sector, they receive less funds, per student, than Jewish students. The Ministry of Education said it was discontinuing this method in favor of a uniform index.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1106955.html Haaretz. Israel aids its needy Jewish students more than Arab counterparts by Or Kashti.

Nearly half of Arab students who passed their matriculation exams failed to win a place in higher education because they performed poorly in the [[Psychometric Entrance Test]], compared to 20% of Jewish applicants. Khaled Arar, a professor at [[Beit Berl College]], believes the psychometric test is culturally biased: "The gap in psychometric scores between Jewish and Arab students has remained steady – at more than 100 points out of a total of 800 – since 1982. That alone should have raised suspicions."&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Free Press: Jonathan Cook, Israel's Arab students cross to Jordan – Academic hurdles block access to universities, 11 April 2009 {{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticfreepress.com/news/1/9140-israels-arab-students-cross-to-jordan-academic-hurdles-block-access-to-universities.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029083317/http://atlanticfreepress.com/news/1/9140-israels-arab-students-cross-to-jordan-academic-hurdles-block-access-to-universities.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 1986 research found negligible differences in construct or predictive test validity across varying cultural groups and the findings appeared to be more consistent with the psychometric than with the cultural bias position.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Zeidner.

Arab citizens are not required to serve in the Israeli military, and, outside the Bedouin community, very few (around 120 a year) volunteer.&lt;ref name="Statistics"/&gt; Until 2000, each year between 5–10% of the [[Negev Bedouin|Bedouin]] population of draft age volunteered for the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]], and Bedouin were well known for their unique status as volunteers. The legendary Israeli soldier, [[Amos Yarkoni]], first commander of the Shaked Reconnaissance Battalion in the [[Givati Brigade]], was a Bedouin (born ''Abd el-Majid Hidr''). Bedouin soldiers dominate the elite human tracking units that guard Israel's northern and southern border.&lt;ref name="bedouin in israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/profiles/2013/04/24/Bedouin-army-trackers-scale-Israel-social-ladder-.html|title= Muslim Arabs serve as Israel's gatekeepers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Magdi Mazarib, a Bedouin, who is the Israeli army's highest-ranking tracking commander, told the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] that he believes that "the state of Bedouin in Israel is better, as far as the respect we get, our progress, education".&lt;ref name="bedouin in israel"/&gt; Today the number of Bedouin in the army may be less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} [https://www.knesset.gov.il/protocols/data/html/bikoret/2004-10-11.html מישיבת הוועדה לענייני ביקורת המדינה]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 report stated that willingness among Bedouin to serve in the army had drastically dropped in recent years, as the Israeli government has failed to fulfill promises of equal service provision to Bedouin citizens.&lt;ref name="caliber1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Embattled Identities: Palestinian Soldiers in the Israeli Military|first=Rhoda|last=Kanaaneh|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=32|issue=3|pages=5–20|doi=10.1525/jps.2003.32.3.5|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2009 article in [[Haaretz]] stated that volunteer recruitment for a crack elite Bedouin army unit rose threefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1070787.html|title=Anshel Pfeffer / Israel minorities see IDF service as key to social mobility – Haaretz – Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDF figures indicate that, in 2002 and 2003, Christians represented 0.1 percent of all recruits. In 2004, the number of recruits had doubled.

===National Service===
Rather than perform army service, Israeli Arab youths have the option to volunteer to [[Sherut Leumi|national service]] and receive benefits similar to those received by discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab populations, where they assist with social and community matters. {{As of|2010}} there are 1,473 Arabs volunteering for national service. According to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are counseling youths to refrain from performing services to the state. According to a National Service official: "For years the Arab leadership has demanded, justifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged soldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these leaders who reject the state's call to come and do the service, and receive these benefits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3974580,00.html Rise in Arab National Service volunteers], by Aviel Magnezi.

Because Israeli Arabs have Israeli citizenship, they have become increasingly targeted for recruitment as operatives by organizations that attack civilians.&lt;ref name="terror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shabak.gov.il/SiteCollectionImages/%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D/terror-summary-4years-new.pdf|title=שירות הבטחון הכללי|website=www.shabak.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Israeli General Security Service (Shabak), from 2001 to 2004, at the height of the Second Intifada, there were 102 cases where some Arab-Israelis were involved in some way in terrorist attacks killing hundreds of Israelis.&lt;ref name="terror" /&gt; In 2001, for example, passengers disembarking from a train in [[Nahariya]] were attacked by an Israeli Arab who killed 3 and wounded 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Loyalties|author=Johnathan Wilson|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060801424.html|accessdate=8 October 2009 | date=11 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/isrl-pa/ISRAELPA1002-08.htm|title=APPENDIX ONE: CHRONOLOGY OF ATTACKS|accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, two Israeli Arabs were convicted of manslaughter for smuggling a suicide bomber into Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/832234.html|title=3 Israelis convicted of manslaughter for transporting suicide bomber|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2004, some 150 Arabs from East Jerusalem were arrested for participation in such attacks.&lt;ref name="terror" /&gt;

====Ties with Hezbollah====
Hezbollah has taken advantage of family and criminal ties with Israeli-Arabs who can easily cross the border into Lebanon, meet with Palestinians in the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]], transfer weapons, drugs and money to Israel, gather intelligence and recruit operatives. This phenomenon is particularly widespread in the village of [[Ghajar]]. Arab citizens of Israel have been convicted of espionage for Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=280844&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y] [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=636473] [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=643653] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228174803/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=280844&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab-Israeli terror cells have been established, such as a cell in [[Reineh]] whose members were arrested in February 2004.&lt;ref name="terror" /&gt;

===Violence against Arab citizens in Israel===
Alexander Yakobson of Jerusalem's Hebrew University has said "There is very little actual violence between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Given the length and the intensity of the conflict, that is both surprising and encouraging."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16381128|title=Under siege too|journal=The Economist|date=17 June 2010|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1956 [[Kafr Qasim massacre]], 48 unarmed Arab citizens, returning to their village, were gunned down by an Israel Border Police platoon; a curfew had been imposed, but the villagers were not informed of it. Arab citizens have also been killed by Israeli security forces in the wake of violent demonstrations and riots, such as the March 1976 [[Land Day]] demonstrations, which left 6 dead, and the [[October 2000 events]] in which 12 Israeli Arabs and one Palestinian from Gaza were killed.

In 2005 an [[AWOL]] [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldier, [[Eden Natan-Zada]] opened fire in a bus in [[Shefa-Amr]] in northern Israel, murdering four Arabs and wounding twenty-two others. No group had taken credit for the terrorist attack and an official in the settler movement denounced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/international/middleeast/05mideast.html|title=Jewish Militant Opens Fire on Bus of Israeli Arabs, Killing 4|last=Myre|first=Greg|date=August 5, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 March 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab victims of terrorism===
Arab citizens have also been victims of Palestinian, Arab, or Islamist attacks on Israel and Israelis. For example, on 12 September 1956, three [[Druze]] guards were killed in an attack on Ein Ofarim, in the [[Arabah]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/terror1952_1989.html|title=Worldwide Terror Attacks on Jewish Targets (1952–2003)|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Arab citizens were killed in the [[Ma'alot massacre]] carried out by the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] on 15 May 1974. In March 2002, a resident of the Arab town of [[Tur'an]] was killed in an attack on a Haifa restaurant&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=312052&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y |title=The other victims |author=Vered Levy-Barzilai |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210003630/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=312052&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y |archivedate=10 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, a woman from [[Jaffa]] was killed in a [[Hamas]] [[suicide attack|suicide bombing]] in [[Rishon LeZion]]&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; On 18 June 2002: A woman from the Arab border town of [[Barta'a]] was one of 19 killed by Hamas in the [[Pat Junction Bus Bombing]] in [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; In August 2002, a man from the Arab town of [[Maghar, Israel|Mghar]] and woman from the Druze village of [[Sajur]] were killed in a suicide bombing at [[Meron, Israel|Meron]] junction&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; On 21 October 2002, an [[Carmel City|Isfiya]] man and a [[Tayibe]] woman were among 14 killed by [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] in the [[Karkur junction suicide bombing|Egged bus 841 massacre]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; On 5 March 2003, a 13-year-old girl from the Druze town of [[Daliyat al-Karmel]] was one of 17 killed in the [[Haifa bus 37 suicide bombing]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; In May 2003: A [[Jisr az-Zarqa]] man, was killed in an [[Afula]] mall suicide bombing.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; On 19 March 2004, [[Fatah]] [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] gunmen killed [[George Khoury]], a [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israel.org/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Memorial/2004/George+Khoury.htm |title=George Khoury |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029031101/http://www.israel.org/MFA/Terrorism-%20Obstacle%20to%20Peace/Memorial/2004/George%20Khoury.htm |archivedate=29 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2004, five Arab IDF soldiers were killed in an explosion and shooting at the border with Egypt for which the [[Fatah Hawks]] claimed responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standwithus.com/pdfs/flyers/postArafatViolence.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317085359/http://www.standwithus.com/pdfs/flyers/postArafatViolence.pdf|date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October 2003, four Arab citizens of Israel were among the 21 killed by [[Hanadi Jaradat]] in the [[Maxim restaurant suicide bombing]]. In July 2006, 19 Arab citizens were killed due to [[Hezbollah]] rocket fire in the course of the [[2006 Lebanon War]].

On 22 August 2006, 11 Arab tourists from Israel were killed when their [[Sinai bus crash|bus overturned]] in Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]]. Israel sent [[Magen David Adom]], but the ambulances waited for hours at the border before receiving Egyptian permission to enter and treat the wounded, responsible for at least one of the deaths. The victims say that the driver acted as part of a planned terrorist attack, and are attempting to receive compensation from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3303434,00.html|title=Israeli Arabs against Mubarak: Learn from Israel|publisher=|date=13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressmethod.com/releasestorage/17932.htm |title=Israeli Arab Survivors Of Bus Overturn In Egypt Want Compensation As Terror Victims |accessdate=2007-12-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210001121/http://www.pressmethod.com/releasestorage/17932.htm |archivedate=10 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Arab citizens of Israel share in the culture of the [[Palestinian people]] and wider Arab region of which many of them form a part. There are still some women who produce Palestinian cultural products such as [[Palestinian costumes#Pre-1948|Palestinian embroidery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imeu.net/news/article003822.shtml|title=IMEU: Palestinian embroidery and textiles: A nation's tale|accessdate=14 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201083644/http://imeu.net/news/article003822.shtml|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/cms/content/view/86/125/|title=Global Fund for Women – Grantee Profile – Laqiya|accessdate=14 June 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070412040520/http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/cms/content/view/86/125| archivedate=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Palestinian costumes|costume]]. The Palestinian folk dance, known as the [[dabke]], continues to be taught to youth in cultural groups, and is often danced at weddings and other parties.

===Language===
Linguistically speaking, the majority of Arabic citizens of Israel are fluently bilingual, speaking both a [[Palestinian Arabic]] dialect and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In Arab homes and towns, the primary language spoken is Arabic. Some Hebrew words have entered the colloquial Arabic dialect. For example, Arabs often use the word ''beseder'' (equivalent of "Okay") while speaking Arabic. Other Hebrew words that are regularly interspersed are ''ramzor'' (stoplight), ''mazgan'' (air conditioner), and ''mahshev'' (computer). The resulting dialect is usually referred to as 'Israeli Arabic'.

Such borrowings are often "Arabized" to reflect not only [[Arabic phonology]] but the phonology of Hebrew as spoken by Arabs. For example, the second consonant of מעונות (''me'onot'', "dormitory") would be pronounced as a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] rather than the [[glottal stop]] traditionally used by the vast majority of Israeli Jews.

There are different local colloquial dialects among Arabs in different regions and localities. For example, the [[Triangle (Israel)|Little Triangle]] residents of [[Umm al-Fahm]] are known for pronouncing the [[kaph]] sound with a "ch" (as-in-cheese) rather than "k" (as-in-kite). Some Arabic words or phrases are used only in their respective localities, such as the Nazareth word for "now" which is ''issa'', and ''silema'' a local modification of the English word "cinema".&lt;ref&gt;Kimary N. Shahin, ''Palestinian Rural Arabic (Abu Shusha dialect)''. 2nd ed. University of British Columbia. LINCOM Europa, 2000 ({{ISBN|3-89586-960-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Rice, ''Eastern Arabic-English, English-Eastern Arabic: dictionary and phrasebook for the spoken Arabic of
Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine/Israel and Syria''. New York: Hippocrene Books 1998 ({{ISBN|0-7818-0685-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab citizens of Israel tend to watch both the Arab satellite news stations and Israeli cable stations and read both Arabic and Hebrew newspapers, comparing the information against one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Culture of Media Consumption among National Minorities: The Case of Arab Society in Israel|author=Amal Jamal|publisher=I'lam Media Center for Arab Palestinians in Israel|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and art===
{{See also|Palestinian art#Palestinian artists in Israel|l1=Palestinian artists in Israel}}
The [[Palestinian art]] scene in general has been supported by the contributions of Arab citizens of Israel.&lt;ref name=Zvi&gt;{{cite web|title=''Hagar: Contemporary Palestinian Art''|author=Tal Ben Zvi|publisher=Hagar Association|year=2006|accessdate=5 June 2007|url=http://www.hagar-gallery.com/Catalogues/docs/PArt_eng_final.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the contribution of artists such as singer [[Amal Murkus]] (from [[Kafr Yasif]]) to evolving traditional [[Palestinian music|Palestinian]] and [[Arabic music]] styles, a new generation of Arab youth in Israel has also begun asserting a Palestinian identity in new musical forms. For instance of the Palestinian hip hop group [[DAM (band)|DAM]], from Lod, has spurred the emergence of other hip hop groups from Akka, to Bethlehem, to Ramallah, to Gaza City.

===Athletics===
Arab Citizens of Israel have been prominent in the field of Athletics, as seen specifically by their contributions to Israeli football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last1=Gilmore|first1=Ingigo|title=Arab players have been hailed as heroes in Israels World Cup campaign|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1487028/Arab-players-hailed-as-heroes-in-Israels-World-Cup-campaign.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2015|date=2005-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players such as [[Abbas Suan]] have had illustrious careers playing not only professional football, but also most notably for the [[Israel national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abbas Suan |url=http://www.knowledgedb.org/?pageid=44671 |website=KnowledgeDB |accessdate=7 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081314/http://www.knowledgedb.org/?pageid=44671 |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These players have been argued to represent symbols of political movement and civil justice for the Arab Citizens of Israel, considering alleged discriminatory sentiments against the Arab population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last1=Kessel|first1=Jerrold|title=On the Couch / Stand up, Speak up|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/sports/on-the-couch-stand-up-speak-up-1.149921|journal=Haaretz|accessdate=7 May 2015|date=2005-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in a 2005 World Cup Qualifying match, Suan and his Arab teammates played significant roles for the Israeli National Team, where Suan scored an equalising goal against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wildman|first1=Sarah|title=Soccer, Racism and Israel's Unlikely World Cup Hero: Abbas Suan, Arab Muslim|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/05/29/soccer-racism-and-israels-unlikely-world-cup-hero-abbas-suan/|website=Politics Daily|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this match, Arab Citizens of Israel received unprecedented media attention from Israeli TV stations. Even without the publicity, the Arab Citizens of Israel have been said to look up to these players in hopes that they speak up for them as their political voice within Israel.&lt;ref name=Chabin&gt;{{cite web|title=''Arab Players Key to Israel Success''|author=Michelle Chabin|publisher=USA Today|year=2005|accessdate=3 May 2015|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/world/2005-06-03-arab-israel-team_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following months, Suan and other players were supposedly being criticised by the Hebrew Media for their involvement with political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shor|first1=Eran|title=In Search of a Voice: Arab soccer players in the Israeli media|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/search-voice-arab-soccer-players-israeli-media|website=Middle Eastern Institute|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to their answers to questions regarding their partaking in the singing of the [[Hatikvah]], the [[national anthem]] of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shor|first1=Eran|last2=Yonay|first2=Yuvel|title='Play and Shut up': The silencing of Palestinian athletes in Israeli media|journal=Routledge|volume=34|issue=2|pages=229|date=10 Sep 2010|doi=10.1080/01419870.2010.503811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Israel-Palestinian soccer players are looked up to greatly by the Arab citizens of Israel, yet are allegedly criticised and silenced when it comes to their attempts to involve themselves in political issues surrounding equality for Arab Citizens in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last1=Erlanger|first1=Steven|title=A National Hero One Day, An Enemy to Some the Next|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/sports/soccer/22soccer.html?_r=0|journal=The New York Times|accessdate=7 May 2015|date=2005-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema and theater===
Arab citizens of Israel have made significant contributions in both Hebrew and Arabic cinema and theater. [[Mohammad Bakri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202207/|title=Salim Dau|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juliano Mer-Khamis]] have starred in Israeli film and television. Directors such as Mohammad Bakri, [[Elia Suleiman]], [[Hany Abu-Assad]], and [[Michel Khleifi]] have put Arab citizens of Israel on the cinematic map.

===Literature===
Acclaimed Israeli-Arab authors include [[Emil Habibi]], [[Anton Shammas]], and [[Sayed Kashua]].

At the age of 4 years, he was at the mouth of the death, suffering from Bifar [Smallpox]. It is also said that his life was saved due to divine and the power of Goddess Durga. His father Indra Prasad Gupta was a landseller. That's why there was no scarcity of basic needs. He completed his school life in India because of the scarcity of schools in Nepal. Although he was unable to complete his higher studies, he studied independently. He was interested in writing.

'''Daniel Myron Lefever''' (August 27, 1835 &amp;ndash; October 29, 1906) was an American gun maker, popularly known as '''"Uncle Dan Lefever"'''. He is best known{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} as the inventor of the [[hammerless]] [[shotgun]], first introduced in 1878.

==Biography==

Born in [[Hopewell, New York]], Uncle Dan Lefever's gunmaking career began as an apprentice in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]] in the early 1850s. He married Sarah Stead on June 10, 1857, in Canandaigua.  He opened his own gunshop in Canandaigua in 1857. His principal business was making muzzle-loading rifles. In 1862 he joined with James Ellis to form '''Lefever &amp; Ellis'''.  They built long-range rifles which were used in the [[American Civil War]].  This partnership broke up in 1867. 

===Gun manufactory===

Sometime before 1870 D. M. Lefever moved to [[Auburn, New York]] where he joined with Francis Dangerfield to form '''Dangerfield &amp; Lefever'''. This firm made primarily [[breechloading]] double [[shotguns]]. They also converted muzzle-loading guns to breech-loading. This firm dissolved in late 1873 or early 1874.

In early 1874 D. M. Lefever moved to [[Syracuse, New York]]. Here he joined with Lorenzo Barber to form '''Barber &amp; Lefever'''. Again they made breech-loading shotguns and rifles. This partnership lasted a short two years.

D. M. Lefever then joined with John Nichols and formed '''Nichols &amp; Lefever'''. During this time D. M. Lefever worked on the development of the [[hammerless]] shotgun.  These guns were cocked with a cocking lever on the side of the breech.  In 1878 he won first prize at the St. Louis Bench Show and Sportsman's Association for the best breech-loading shotgun in America.

===Automatic hammerless shotgun===

By the time D. M. Lefever patented his hammerless shotgun in 1880 he had left ''Nichols &amp; Lefever'' and gone into business for himself. In 1883 D. M. Lefever patented the first truly automatic hammerless shotgun. This internalized the cocking mechanism so that the gun was automatically cocked when the breech was closed. He also patented the automatic ejector system which ejected the used shells when the breech was opened. In 1886 D. M. Lefever lost control of his company which by then was called [[Lefever Arms Company]]. However, he remained as superintendent until 1902.

In 1902 D. M. Lefever left ''Lefever Arms Company'' to form '''D. M. Lefever, Sons &amp; Company''' with sons Charles F. Lefever (also known as Fred who later invented the ''Model 25 Daisy BB pump gun''&lt;ref&gt;"It's A Daisy" by Cass S. Hough, pp 45-52, 1976, Daisy Division Victor Comptometer Corporation, Rogers, Arkansas&lt;/ref&gt;), Frank, and George. They continued to make fine hammerless shotguns, but could not compete with the larger Lefever Arms Company. In 1904 they moved to [[Ohio]], first in [[Defiance, Ohio|Defiance]] and within a year in [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]]. In 1906 they returned to [[Syracuse, New York]], however, before being able to re-establish a viable company D. M. Lefever died on October 29 in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] of a [[stomach ulcer]]. His remains are interred, with his wife (who died in 1898), in Woodlawn Cemetery in Syracuse.

[[Image:Optimus-1-web.jpg|thumb|300px|right|LeFever Arms Co. Optimus Grade shotgun]]

The ''[[Lefever Arms Company]]'' continued to make fine Lefever designed shotguns in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] until 1916 when they were purchased by the [[Ithaca Gun Company]]. Ithaca continued to produce Lefever-designed guns under the [[Lefever Arms Company]] name in [[Ithaca, New York]] until 1921. These were made using primarily left-over parts from the Syracuse operation. Shortly after that the [[Ithaca Gun Company]] used the Lefever name to market an inexpensive gun, the "Lefever Nitro Special", that was of their own design, having nothing to do with D. M. Lefever except to exploit his name. These were manufactured until the early 1940s.

Many collectors{{Who|date=April 2010}} consider original "D.M. Lefever" guns to be the finest ever produced in America.

==Uncle Dan LeFever Cup==
The Lefever Arms Collectors Association created the "Uncle Dan Lefever Cup" in honor of the legacy of D.M. Lefever.  The "Uncle Dan LeFever Cup" shoot-off is held annually during a LACA designated trap shoot event.  The highest scoring shooter wins a trophy engraved with the year the champion won.  Only LACA members, firing Lefever guns, are eligible for the award.  The first "Uncle Dan Lefever Cup" was awarded during the Greater Northeast Side by Side in [[Friendsville, PA]], on June 6, 2010.  LACA held the 2nd Annual shoot-off during the June 2011 Nimrod Classic in [[Bozeman, MT]]. The 3rd Annual Uncle Dan Cup was held again at the Greater Northeast Side by Side in [[Friendsville, PA]], on June 2, 2012. The 4th Annual Uncle Dan Cup will be held at the Spring 2013 Southern Side By Side in Sanford, NC. April 26–27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefevercollectors.com/index.php?p=1_16_Uncle-Dan-Lefever-Cup&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Knopfler''' (born 27 December 1952) is a British [[singer-songwriter]], guitarist, pianist, record producer, poet, and author. He is the younger brother of guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]].

He is a co-founder of the rock band [[Dire Straits]], with whom he spent three years. After quitting the band, Knopfler embarked upon a solo career as a recording artist. Knopfler initially created smaller record labels, publishing companies, and [[Indie music|indie labels]].

Knopfler has encouraged the advent of online purchasing music since 1995, although he concedes the necessity for other avenues of the distribution and sale of recorded music.&lt;ref name="DK2002 panelist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knopfler.com/nemo.html|title=Building Your Support Team – Creating A Buzz|last=Knopfler|first=David|year=2002|work=Draft notes-- Knopfler was a panelist|publisher=David Knopfler|accessdate=24 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719031315/http://www.knopfler.com/nemo.html|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''Bluffers Guide to the Rock Music Business'' was published in 1996. His anthology of poetry  "Bloodstones and Rhythmic Beasts" was published 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookdepository.com/Blood-Stones-Rhythmic-Beasts-David-Knopfler/9780955026003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Knopfler was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, to an English mother, Louisa Mary, a teacher, and a [[Hungarian Jew]]ish father, Erwin Knopfler, an architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Brothers-of-Scottish-Rock-and-Pop-mostly-312295.html |title=Brothers of Scottish Rock and Pop (mostly) – Fun Facts, Questions, Answers, Information |publisher=Funtrivia.com |date= |accessdate= 6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3414800180/knopfler-mark-freuder-1949.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

When Knopfler was two, his family moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England, where he grew up and later attended [[Gosforth Grammar School]].

By the age of 11, Knopfler owned a guitar, a piano and a drum kit, and by the age of 14, he was playing and singing his own compositions in [[Folk music|folk clubs]].&lt;ref name=KB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knopfler.com/biog.html |title=David Knopfler Biography |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=Knopfler's official website |date=April 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107024611/http://www.knopfler.com/biog.html |archivedate=7 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending [[Bristol Polytechnic]], Knopfler became a [[social worker]] in London, where he shared a flat with [[John Illsley]].&lt;ref name=AM&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p18708|pure_url=yes}} |title=David Knopfler Biography |author=Christian Genzel |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knopfler's older brother [[Mark Knopfler|Mark]] also played the guitar. David introduced Mark to [[John Illsley]], a bass guitarist, and after gaining the interest of drummer [[Pick Withers]], the four founded the rock band [[Dire Straits]].&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; One of Mark's friends came up with the band's name, which was supposedly a reference to their financial situation at the time the band was beginning to gain notice in the music industry.&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000435/Dire-Straits.html|title=Dire Straits Biography|year=2009 |work=Musician Guide|publisher=Net Industries|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; David however, asserts on his website that "[the] notion that the band were literally in dire straits is largely retrospective myth making and not really factually supportable. We all had day jobs until we got a whacking big advance from Polygram".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knopfler.com/direstraits.html |title=Wikiphobia |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=Knopfler's official website |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314110345/http://www.knopfler.com/direstraits.html |archivedate=14 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knopfler played rhythm guitar beside his brother, who was lead guitarist in the band, and David appeared on Dire Straits' first two albums: ''[[Dire Straits (album)|Dire Straits]]'' (1978) and ''[[Communiqué (Dire Straits album)|Communiqué]]'' (1979). The stress of composing, [[arrangement|arranging]] songs, recording the then-requisite two albums and tours to support them took its toll on the brothers, and David left the band during the recording of their third album, ''[[Making Movies]]'' (1980), leaving him uncredited on the album.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; There is concert video footage, however, of David playing with the band live on several tracks of this album.

===Solo===
After leaving Dire Straits, Knopfler released his first solo album in 1983, titled ''[[Release (David Knopfler album)|Release]]''. Mark Knopfler and John Illsley both played on the album.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; Harry Bogdanovs, a lifelong friend of Knopfler,&lt;ref name=KB/&gt; is credited with having co-written three of the tracks and playing synthesizer.&lt;ref name=HBC&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p57681|pure_url=yes}} |title=Harry Bogdanovs – Credits |accessdate=10 January 2009 |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was supported by the single "Soul Kissing" on the label of Peach River Records. The single was a minor commercial success, peaking at #82 in the [[UK Albums Chart]],&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

''[[Behind the Lines (David Knopfler album)|Behind the Lines]]'', his second album, was released in 1985 and his third solo album, ''Cut the Wire'', followed in 1986.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; In 1988, the U.S. label [[Cypress Records]] released his fourth album, ''Lips Against the Steel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r42530|pure_url=yes}} |title=Lips Against the Steel – Overview |accessdate=10 January 2009 |publisher=Allmusic |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knopfler [[Sheet music|scored]] the soundtracks for the films ''[[Shergar#Legacy|Shergar]]'' (1984) and ''[[Laser Mission]]'' (1989),&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; and the German productions ''[[:de:Treffer|Treffer]]'' (1984), ''Jakob hinter der blauen Tür'' (1989) and ''[[:de:Der große Bellheim|Der grosse Bellheim]]''.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/David+Knopfler |title=David Knopfler Discography |accessdate=10 January 2009 |publisher=[[Discogs]] website |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1990===
''Lifelines'' in 1991 released by [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]], was recorded in [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Studios]]. That album was followed in 1993 by ''The Giver'',&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; released by MESA/Bluemoon in the U.S., and [[Ariola Records|Ariola]] in Europe. Its sparse, acoustic arrangements received positive reviews, as did 1995's ''[[Small Mercies (album)|Small Mercies]]'', which Knopfler co-produced with Harry Bogdanovs,&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; featuring [[Chris White (saxophonist)|Chris White]] on saxophone.&lt;ref name=CW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chriswhite-saxophone.com/bio/abio.html |title=Some pieces of Chris White's musical biography... |accessdate=10 January 2009 |publisher=Chris White Unofficial Home Page – by Slavi |date=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Knopfler worked with Bogdanovs again to co-produce the album ''Wishbones'', which has guest appearances by [[Chris Rea]]&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; and [[Eddi Reader]]. His ninth solo album, ''Ship of Dreams'', which also included [[Chris Rea]], was released in 2004.

In May 2005, Knopfler published a book of poetry, ''Blood Stones and Rhythmic Beasts'',&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; which was released by the UK's BlackWing books ({{ISBN|0955026008}}).

The Canadian [[jazz]] label [[Justin Time Records]] released ''Ship of Dreams'' in October 2005 with an alternate rendition of "Tears Fall" featuring [[Megan Slankard]] (replacing [[Julia Neigel]] on the original European release).&lt;ref name=D/&gt; Knopfler's tenth solo album ''Songs for the Siren'' was released in 2006.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; Recent songwriting projects with other artists have included sessions with Amilia Spicer, [[Mack Starks]], [[Megan Slankard]] and [[Wendy Lands]].&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.songstuff.com/articles.php?selected=116 |title=Songstuff: David Knopfler |author=Nigel Lawry |accessdate=10 January 2009 |work=Interview with David Knopfler |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227051228/http://music.songstuff.com/articles.php?selected=116 |archivedate=27 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played various acoustic and electric gigs in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, Turkey and Australia from 2007 to 2009 with Harry Bogdanovs and his band.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. A new double CD ''Acoustic'', which contains unplugged renditions of new and old songs was released in 2011.

Knopfler continued to tour in Spain, Germany, the UK, the United States and Canada in 2012 to 2015. The first-ever limited edition live album, ''Made in Germany'' (recorded in Erfurt, Germany during the 2012 tour with Bogdanovs), was released in April 2013 exclusively via CDBaby.com. 
Knopfler is currently recording a new studio album due for release September 2015 ( working title "Grace") when he will be touring Germany with Harry Bogdanovs.

===Personal life===
Knopfler is married to art professor Leslie Stroz.&lt;ref name="Herbeck"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.buffalonews.com/20130501/david_knopfler_performs_sunday_at_sportsmen_x2019_s_tavern.html | title=David Knopfler performs Sunday at Sportsmen’s Tavern | work=[[Buffalo News]] | date=1 May 2013 | accessdate=13 June 2014 | author=Herbeck, Dan | location=Buffalo, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one son with former wife [[Anna Perera]].

The '''Design Research Society''' ('''DRS'''), founded in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;Bayazit, N. (2004). Investigating Design: A review of forty years of design research, ''[[Design Issues]]'', Vol. 20, No. 1, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tovey"&gt;Tovey, M. (2011). Researching Design Education. In E. Bohemia, B. Borja de Mozota &amp; L. Collina (Eds.), [http://www.cumulusassociation.org/images/stories/Working_papers/CumulusDRS_symposium_Paris_2011.pdf Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium for Design Education Researchers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211934/http://www.cumulusassociation.org/images/stories/Working_papers/CumulusDRS_symposium_Paris_2011.pdf# |date=2015-09-23 }} (pp. 1-8). Paris, France: CUMULUS // DRS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (2007). Editorial: Forty Years of Design Research, ''Design Studies'', Vol. 28, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; is an international society for developing and supporting the interests of the [[design research]] community. The primary purpose of the DRS, as embodied in its first statement of rules, is to promote ‘the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields'. This established the intention of being an interdisciplinary [[Learned|learned society]], taking a scholarly and domain independent view of the process of designing. Membership is open to anyone interested in design research, and members with established experience and a strong background in design research may apply to be elected as a DRS Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/fellows]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of the Society lay in the first conference on [[design methods]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. C. and D. G. Thornley, (eds.) (1963). ''Conference on Design Methods''. Oxford, UK, [[Pergamon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; (full title "The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and Communications") held in London in 1962, which enabled a core of people to be identified who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing.

==Early history==
Initially, the DRS promoted its aims through a series of one-day conferences and the publication of a quarterly newsletter to members. However, within a few years, unsuccessful attempts to establish a published journal&lt;ref&gt;Booker, P. J. and P. A. Slann (eds.) (1968). DRS Newsletter, Vol. 1, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and fruitless internal debate about the Society's goals led to inactivity. The Society was revived by its first major international conference, on design participation,&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (ed.) (1972). Design Participation. London, UK, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; held in Manchester in 1971. At that conference a meeting of DRS members led to a call for a special general meeting of the Society, and to changes of officers and council members. Subsequently, a series of conferences was held through the 1970s and 80s: in London (1973), Portsmouth (1976,&lt;ref&gt;Evans, B., J. Powell, and R. Talbot (eds.) (1982). Changing Design. Chichester, UK, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; 1980&lt;ref&gt;Jacques, R. and J. Powell (eds.) (1981). Design:Science:Method. Guildford, UK, Westbury House.&lt;/ref&gt;), Istanbul (1978), and Bath (1984).

In the mid-1970s DRS also collaborated with the Design Methods Group, based in the USA, including publishing a joint journal, Design Research and Methods.

==Publications and conferences==
By the late 1970s there was enough enthusiasm, and evidence of design research activity around the world, for the DRS to approach IPC Press (now Elsevier Science) with a successful proposal for its own journal.  [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies/ Design Studies], the international journal for design research, was launched in 1979. A monthly internet news bulletin DesignResearchNews was started in 1998 and has over 9000 subscribers. Between 2006 and 2009 the Society also published a quarterly newsletter, Design Research Quarterly.

A new biennial series of DRS conferences began in 2002 with the 'Common Ground' conference in London. Subsequent ones have been held at venues around the world, with a variety of themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roworth-Stokes|first=Seymour|title=The Design Research Society and Emerging Themes in Design Research|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|date=June 2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=419–424|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5885.2011.00815.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2011.00815.x/abstract|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the Table below. In 2005 DRS was one of the founding members of the International Association of Societies of Design Research (IASDR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IASDR|url=https://iasdr.net|publisher=IASDR|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also holds biennial, international conferences.

==Special Interest Groups==
Special Interest Groups provide a forum for specific areas of research which are of interest to the Design Research Community and its members. SIGs organise events and discussion in a number of ways to facilitate the exchange and development of best practice in the field. Each SIG is organised by a convenor who is supported by an organising group and the SIG members. DRS members are invited to join any Special Interest Group to contribute actively to research in the subject area of their chosen group.&lt;ref name="tovey"/&gt;

===Special Interest Group on Experiential Knowledge (EKSIG)===
EKSIG is concerned with the understanding and role of knowledge in research and professional practice in design in order to clarify fundamental principles and practices of using design practice within research both with regard to research regulations and requirements, and research methodology.

The main aims of EKSIG are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Experiential Knowledge Special Interest Group's Aims|url=http://www.experientialknowledge.org.uk/aims.html|publisher=EKSIG|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Investigate and advance the understanding of 'knowledge' and 'contribution to knowledge' in design research, especially in areas where designing forms part of the research process
*Develop principles and criteria of research in design for employing different kinds of knowledge and means for the communication of knowledge
*Promote the implementation of such principles and criteria within current research policy to promote quality and standards in research
*Promote the implementation of such principles and criteria within research practice through the development of appropriate methodology to promote quality and best practice in research

EKSIG runs a biennial conference series, special strands at the DRS and IASDR conferences. It also runs a discussion list, which is used for announcements and debate about the core issues of knowledge and methodology in research and practice in the creative disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niedderer|first=Kristina|title=Special Interest Group on Experiential Knowledge (EKSIG)|url=http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/eksig.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617050546/http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/eksig.html#|archive-date=2012-06-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Interest Group on Wellbeing and Happiness (SIGWELL)===
The SIG focuses on bringing together designers, design researchers, landscape architects and others who aim to improve personal and societal wellbeing through design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coles|first=Richard|title=Special Interest Group on Wellbeing and Happiness (SIGWELL)|url=http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/sigwell.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616102120/http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/sigwell.html#|archive-date=2012-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design Pedagogy Special Interest Group (PedSIG)===
This SIG  on design pedagogy aims to bring together design researchers, teachers and practitioners, and others responsible for the delivery of design education, to clarify and  develop the role of design research in providing the theoretical underpinning for design education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tovey|first=Michael|title=SIG on Design Pedagogy|url=http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/sig-desped.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719105954/http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/sig-desped.html#|archive-date=2012-07-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The DRS Design Pedagogy Special Interest Group is bringing together other research which is directed to similar ends.  Design research is not an irrelevant activity living in its own little ghetto, but rather it provides the basis for the academic core of design teaching and pedagogic innovation. By that means through the provision of the next generation of designers it links into design practice.&lt;ref name="tovey"/&gt;
The DRS PedSIG runs special streams at DRS biannual conferences. It also organised symposia which were hosted by the Coventry University on 27 March 2009 and 28 January 2011.

In 2010, the DRS PedSIG and CUMULUS Association have join forces to develop a bi-annual international research events. The 1st International Symposium for Design Education Researchers [http://www.adm.heacademy.ac.uk/events/researching-design-education] in collaboration with: CUMULUS Association; Design Research Society (DRS); five other international universities (which included: [[Aalto University]], L'École de Design Nantes Atlantique, [[Coventry University]], L'École Parsons à Paris, and [[Politecnico di Milano]]); the Lieu de Design, Chambre de commerce et d’industrie de Paris and AVA Publishing. The symposium was held in a prestigious location of [[:fr:Bourse de commerce de Paris]]  in May 2011. A special issue of Collection, a research journal, has been produced featuring a selection of contributions. The 2nd International Conference for Design Research Educators, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130621191140/http://www.hioa.no/eng/About-HiOA/Fakultet-for-teknologi-kunst-og-design/DRS-CUMULUS-Oslo-2013 DRS//CUMULUS 2013], was hosted by the Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hioa.no/eng/About-HiOA/Fakultet-for-teknologi-kunst-og-design/DRS-CUMULUS-Oslo-2013# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621191140/http://www.hioa.no/eng/About-HiOA/Fakultet-for-teknologi-kunst-og-design/DRS-CUMULUS-Oslo-2013# |archive-date=2013-06-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Interest Group for Objects, Practices, Experiences, Networks (OPENSIG)===
The OPENSiG was originally launched in 2007 under the name ‘Emotion, Experience and Interaction’.  A special strand at the DRS conference 2008 and two successful workshops at Sheffield Hallam University (2007) and Nottingham Trent University (2010) served to define the group’s interest in broad questions about human-object interactions – focusing on Objects and engaging with social Practices, which involve Experiences with/ of objects in Networks of relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Tom|title=Objects, Practices, Experiences, Networks (OPENSiG)|url=http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/opensig.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509015022/http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/opensig.html#|archive-date=2012-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusive Design Special Interest Group (Inclusive SIG)===
The Inclusive Design Research Special Interest Group (InclusiveSIG) aims to provide an international platform for researchers, design practitioners, design educators and students, and the general public to exchange knowledge about inclusive design and to empower wider participation in design.

===Design Research Society’s Design Innovation Management Special Interest Group (DIMSIG)===
Design Research Society’s Design Innovation Management Special Interest Group (DIMSIG) in collaboration with the Design Society’s Design Management Special Interest Group (DeMSIG) formed a cross-societal working party named the Design Management Academy (DMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designmanagementacademy.com/|title=Design Management Academy – … bringing researchers together|website=designmanagementacademy.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Design School at [[Hong Kong Polytechnic]] hosted the first Design Management Academy international conference in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designmanagementacademy.com/dma2017/|title=Design Management Academy 2017 Hong Kong|website=Design Management Academy 2017 Hong Kong|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franz Edmund Creffield''', commonly known as Edmund Creffield and by the pseudonym '''Joshua''' (c. 1870–1906), was a German-American religious leader who founded a movement in [[Corvallis, Oregon]], which became known locally as the "[[Holy Rollers]]". The movement, mainly popular among women, was widely regarded as a [[cult]]. Creffield, who believed himself the second coming of [[Jesus]], had a number of run-ins with the authorities and the local citizenry over the next several years, often stemming from his relations with his female followers and his increasingly erratic behavior.

In 1906 he was murdered by George Mitchell, whose sister was one of Creffield's followers. After being acquitted of wrongdoing in the killing, Mitchell was himself murdered by his sister in revenge, with another follower subsequently committing suicide. The story attracted national attention and was major news for a time in the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;Robert P. Sutton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pA01_CvpCsIC&amp;pg=PA37 ''Modern American Communes]. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2005; p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCracken|first=T-|title=Holy Rollers: Murder and Madness in Oregon's Love Cult|year=2002|publisher=Caxton Press|location=Caldwell, Idaho|isbn=0-87004-424-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Creffield came from Germany; it is unclear how he came to Oregon. He first appeared in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in 1903, and he quickly became involved in the [[Salvation Army]]. Later that year he was sent on mission to the town of [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]]. Soon after, he broke with The Salvation Army and formed his own group, which he called the Bride of Christ Church.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Creffield is Guilty|newspaper=Oregon Daily Journal|date=16 September 1904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townspeople thought it a [[cult]] and called them Holy Rollers because they rolled for hours during their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Their Queer Acts|newspaper=Corvallis Times|date=31 October 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bride of Christ Church==
Edmund Creffield did not say anything outrageous when he first came to Corvallis in 1903, preaching mostly about "the beauty of the [[full Gospel]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Holiness|date= 21 September 1902|newspaper=The War Cry|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon his followers believed he was receiving messages directly from God.&lt;ref&gt;"Holy Rollers Insane," ''Brownsville Times'' (Oregon) 6 May 1904, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Creffield preached for hours on end and his followers loudly rolled on the floor pleading for God's forgiveness. When their cacophonous meetings began running into the early morning hours, Creffield was barred from holding services within city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burn Up Goods|date=31 October 1903|newspaper=Morning Oregonian ''(Portland)''|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer he and his followers camped out on [[Kiger Island]] in the [[Willamette River]]. When the fall rains started Sarah Hurt and her three children, Maud, Frank, and Mae, some of his most ardent followers, invited him and about twenty others to move into their house just outside Corvallis. In October the group burned most of the house’s contents including furniture, utensils, heirlooms, a cat, and a dog.&lt;ref&gt;"Their Queer Acts," ''Corvallis Times,'' 31 October 1903, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports that a baby had been sacrificed were false.

People soon began to ask if Creffield could really "live in the same locked house with a number of young girls, and do nothing in the world but be religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Their Welcome Departure|date= 9 January 1904|newspaper=Corvallis Times|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1904, twenty [[vigilantes]] called the White Caps [[tarred and feathered]] Creffield, and told him to leave town and never come back. The next day Creffield and Maud Hurt were married in a room where "the odor of [pine] tar was noticeable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Tarred and Feathered |date= 6 January 1904|newspaper=Corvallis Times|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February Creffield was accused of having adulterous relations in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] with Maud’s aunt, Donna Starr. [[Adultery]] was a criminal offense, so a warrant was put out for his arrest. A statewide manhunt went on for months. Meanwhile, many of his followers [[fasted]] and spent their days lying flat on the floor praying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Holy Rollers Insane|date= 6 May 1904|newspaper=Brownsville Times|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most were committed to either the [[Oregon State Insane Asylum]] or the Boys and Girls Aid Society in Portland.

In July, one month after Sarah Hurt was committed, Creffield was discovered nude and starving under her house. Creffield said he was innocent, but was found guilty and served seventeen months in the [[Oregon State Penitentiary]]. When released, he claimed he was Jesus Christ risen from the dead, his [[resurrection]] being his emergence from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= In Benton Again. But Only Passed Through—Creffield, the Monster—More Rollerism, |date= 24 April 1906|newspaper=Corvallis Times|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creffield said he was responsible for the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and his followers, all of whom had been released from the asylum, believed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Camp Given Up |date= 1 May 1906|newspaper=Corvallis Times|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Creffield is Jesus Christ," Cora Hartley said. "He condemned the city of [[San Francisco]] and brought the earthquake; he has condemned the city of Corvallis and an [[earthquake]] will destroy this place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Creffield Poses As Jeremiah |date= 2 May 1906|newspaper= Oregon Daily Journal (Portland), |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and the others obeyed his order to evacuate to the coast.

==Assassination==

In April, Louis Hartley, a wealthy mine owner  followed his wife, Cora, and daughter, Sophie, when they went to [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]] to meet up with Creffield and the others. As the group boarded a ferry, Hartley fired a [[revolver]] four times at Creffield. The gun snapped harmlessly because the [[centerfire]] [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s were wrong for the [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] gun.&lt;ref&gt;Circuit Court State of I Oregon for Benton County, Lewis Hartley (Plaintiff) vs. Cora A. Hartley (Defendant), No. 4377, Complaint, Filed 11 May 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others were also gunning for Creffield, so he fled to [[Seattle]] with Maud. There, George Mitchell, Esther's brother, found him and, in front of witnesses, killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= I Got My Man|date= 7 May 1906|newspaper=Seattle Star|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multnomah County]]’s district attorney, John Manning, sent [[King County]]’s prosecuting attorney, Kenneth Mackintosh, a letter saying, "I investigated many, many charges against him [Creffield] while he was on his Holy Rolling tour in Oregon, the character of which were perfectly awful, in so far as being low, degenerate and brutal, and if permitted, I would like an opportunity to testify before the grand jury, before Mitchell is indicted … I think the taking of the law in one’s own hands, under such circumstances, to mete out summary justice is almost excusable.".&lt;ref&gt;Manning Upholds Him," ''Morning Oregonian'' (Portland), 10 May 10, 1906, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Mackintosh was appalled by Manning’s suggestion.

O.V. Hurt, Creffield's father-in-law, hired one of the best law firms in Seattle to defend George. Numerous witnesses testified to telling George that "free love"&lt;ref&gt;Editorial Comment," ''Corvallis Gazette'', 12 January 1904, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; took place in 1903. They said they told George that Creffield preached that Christ would be reborn and one of the Brides’ of Christ would be the new Mary and that he needed to lay his hands upon them and purify them.&lt;ref&gt;"Creffield’s Slayer To Escape, Disciples Disband," ''Oregon Daily Journal'' (Portland), 8 May 1906, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They said they told George that mothers were debauched in front of their daughters, including Sarah and her then sixteen-year-old daughter, Mae.&lt;ref&gt;"Mitchell Trial Advances Slowly," ''Seattle Post Intelligencer'', 27 June 1906, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They said they told George that finally Creffield announced that the new Mary was Esther Mitchell, the then sixteen-year-old sister of George."&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Creffield on Stand," ''Seattle Star'', 17 September 1906, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many believe that much of the testimony was perjury, a tactic to avoid hearsay and put Creffield on trial. George was found not guilty by reason of insanity and released. Two days later, Esther shot and killed him using a gun Maud bought using their witness fees.&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Creffield Bought Gun," ''Seattle Star'', 13 July 1906, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

O.V. was devastated, but still loved his daughter so he hired the same lawyers who had defended George, to defend her.&lt;ref&gt;"Hurt Will Come to Aid of His Daughter," ''Seattle Sunday Times'', 15 July 1906, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the case went to trial, Maud committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Crefield, Ida M.  Death Certificate.  King County, Washington.  Volume No: 1906, Register No: 17252.  16 November 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; Esther was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to [[Western State Hospital (Washington State)|Western State Hospital]], an asylum in [[Fort Steilacoom|Steilacoom]], Washington.&lt;ref&gt;"Esther Mitchell Goes to Asylum," Seattle Post Intelligencer, February 21, 1907, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Esther was released from the asylum in 1909&lt;ref&gt;"Esther Mitchell Leaves Asylum."  ''Morning Oregonian'' (Portland) 6 April 1909.  p1.&lt;/ref&gt; She committed suicide in  1914.&lt;ref&gt;"Esther Mitchell is Dead By Own Hand." ''Evening Telegram'' (Portland). 3 August 1914.  p2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Clodd''' (1 July 1840 – 16 March 1930) was an English banker, writer and [[Anthropology|anthropologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Memoriam: Edward Clodd|author=Alfred Cort Haddon|authorlink=Alfred Cort Haddon|journal=Folklore|volume=40|issue=2|date=30 June 1930|pages=183–189|jstor=1255836|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1929.9716819}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a great variety of literary and scientific friends, who periodically met at [[Whitsun]]day (a springtime holiday) gatherings at his home at [[Aldeburgh]] in Suffolk.

==Biography==

Although born in [[Margate]], where his father was captain of a trading brig, the family moved soon afterward to Aldeburgh, his father's ancestors deriving from [[Parham, Suffolk|Parham]] and [[Framlingham]] in Suffolk. Born to a [[Baptist]] family, his parents wished him to become a minister, but he instead began a career in accountancy and banking, relocating to London in 1855. He was the only surviving child of seven.&lt;ref name = "JM"&gt;Joseph McCabe, ''Edward Clodd: A memoir'', John Lane The Bodley Head, 1932, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward first worked unpaid for six months at an accountant's office in Cornhill in London when he was 14 years of age.&lt;ref name = "JM"/&gt; He worked for the London Joint Stock Bank from 1872 to 1915, and had residences both in London and Suffolk. He married his first wife Eliza Garman, a doctor's daughter in 1862.&lt;ref name = "JM"/&gt; He had eight children with Eliza, though two died when they were young.&lt;ref name = "JM"/&gt; In his old age, he married his secretary, Phyllis Maud Rope (born 1887), who survived him by 27 years.

Clodd was an early devotee of the work of [[Charles Darwin]] and had personal acquaintance with [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. He wrote biographies of all three men, and worked to popularise [[evolution]] with books like ''The Childhood of the World'' and ''The Story of Creation: A Plain Account of Evolution''.

Clodd was an agnostic and wrote that the [[Genesis creation narrative]] of the Bible is similar to other religious myths and should not be read as a literal account. He wrote many popular books on [[Evolution|evolutionary science]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lightman. (1997). ''Victorian Science in Context''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 222–223. {{ISBN|978-0226481128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a biography of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and was a lecturer and populariser of anthropology and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Francis O'Gorman.

He was also a keen [[folklore|folklorist]], joining the [[Folklore Society]] from 1878, and later becoming its president.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Hill. (2008). Stonehenge. Harvard University Press. p. 134. {{ISBN|978-0674031326}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Suffolk Secretary of the [[Prehistoric Society]] of East Anglia from 1914 to 1916. He was a prominent member and officer of the Omar Khayyam Club or 'O.K. Club', and organised the planting of the rose from [[Omar Khayyam]]'s tomb on to the grave of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]] at [[Boulge]], Suffolk, at the Centenary gathering.

Clodd had a talent for friendship, and liked to entertain his friends at literary gatherings in Aldeburgh at his seafront home there, Strafford House, during Whitsuntides. Prominent among his literary friends and correspondents were [[Grant Allen]], [[George Meredith]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[George Gissing]], [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]], [[Andrew Lang]], [[Cotter Morison]], [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], [[Mary Kingsley]] and Mrs [[Eliza Lynn Linton|Lynn Linton]]; he also knew Sir [[Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet|Henry Thompson]], Sir [[William Huggins]], Sir [[Laurence Gomme]], Sir [[John Rhys]], [[Paul Du Chaillu]], [[Edward Whymper]], [[Alfred Comyn Lyall]], [[York Powell]], [[William Holman Hunt]], Sir [[E. Ray Lankester]], [[H.G. Wells]] and many others as acquaintances. His hospitality and friendship was an important part of the development of their social relations.

'''Frederick William Winterbotham''' (16 April 1897 – 28 January 1990) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Royal Air Force]] officer (latterly a [[Group Captain]]) who during [[World War II]] supervised the distribution of [[Ultra]] [[military intelligence|intelligence]]. His book ''The Ultra Secret'' was the first popular account of Ultra to be published in Britain.

==Family and education==
He was born in [[Stroud]], [[Gloucestershire]], the younger child and only son of Frederick Winterbotham, solicitor, and his wife, Florence Vernon Graham. He was educated at [[Charterhouse School]], in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]]. He married four times: Erica Horniman (1921), daughter of [[Frederick John Horniman]], tea trader and MP, Madge Mary Moncrieff Anderson (1939), Joan Petrea Trant (1948) and Kathleen Price (1987).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfo.me.uk/getperson.php?personID=I15804&amp;tree=W1 Frederick William Winterbotham - Mitchell Families Online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I service==
At the start of the war, in 1914, he enlisted in the [[Royal Gloucestershire Hussars]] Yeomanry. He transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in 1916, and became a fighter pilot. He was shot down and captured on 13 July 1917, in [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner, for much of the time in [[Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp]].

== Between the wars ==
Upon his release in 1918 he went to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], to study law. He took a law degree (1920) in the shortened course for returning servicemen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stroud-history.org.uk/articles.php?article_id=163 Winterbotham, Frederick William at www.stroud-history.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; but had no liking for an office job. He pursued farming opportunities in Britain, [[Kenya]], and [[Rhodesia]] without success. By 1929 he was back in Britain, and considered becoming a stockbroker in the [[City of London|City]]. Instead he was recruited to join the staff of the [[Royal Air Force]], where he was assigned to the newly created Air Section of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI-6).&lt;ref name="Conn"&gt;Winterbotham, Frederick.  ''The Nazi Connection''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1978. {{ISBN|0-297-77458-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the next few years, Winterbotham began the process of building up an intelligence service for the RAF. His job was to gather information on the development of military aviation in hostile or potentially hostile countries. He recruited agents, and filed and analyzed their reports.

One of these reports revealed that [[Germany]] had secret arrangements with the [[Soviet Union]] for the training of military pilots in violation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. [[William de Ropp]], the agent who supplied this information also informed Winterbotham that the [[Nazism|Nazis]], not yet in power, wanted to cultivate high-level contacts in Britain; they imagined that "imperialist" Britain would be sympathetic to their own dreams of racial conquest. Winterbotham, who was socially well-connected, seemed a likely channel.&lt;ref name="Conn"/&gt;

This led to a visit by Nazi "philosopher" [[Alfred Rosenberg]] in 1932. Winterbotham, with the full knowledge of MI-6, escorted Rosenberg around Britain, made some appropriate introductions, and played up to him. Neither Ropp nor Rosenberg knew that Winterbotham had any intelligence connections—he was just a civilian official of the Air Staff.

Winterbotham continued in this role for the next seven years. He became a regular visitor to Germany, and an apparent Nazi sympathizer. As such, he was welcomed into the highest circles in Germany, meeting [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Hermann Göring|Göring]], and with Göring's [[Luftwaffe]] subordinates such as [[Erhard Milch]] and [[Albert von Kesselring]]. He gathered a tremendous amount of information on the Luftwaffe and on German political and military intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Staerck, Chris; Sinnott, Paul.  ''Luftwaffe: The Allied Intelligence Files''. Brassey's, 2002. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Winterbotham recruited [[Sidney Cotton]] to carry out some very successful [[aerial reconnaissance]] over [[Italy]] and Germany in 1939–40 in a private [[Lockheed 12|Lockheed 12A]] aircraft.

== Ultra ==
These games came to an end when World War II broke out in 1939. As a top ranking member of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] (he reported directly to its head, Sir [[Hugh Sinclair]], and his successor in 1940, Sir [[Stewart Menzies]]), Winterbotham was fully aware of Britain's successful code-breaking operation against the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher machine. The [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] derived from [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] decrypts was absolutely authentic (it was what the Germans were telling each other) and it was often of immense value. This source was so valuable it was given the special classification "Top Secret Ultra", or simply "[[Ultra]]".

At first the British forces did not know what to do with the information, but this problem was solved during the later part of 1940, as teams of analysts were formed to scan, digest, and file the messages, and channels were established for forwarding key messages to the appropriate field commands.

A key part of the solution was arranging for the secure delivery of Ultra to the various commanders, and making sure that they did nothing to give away the secret that Enigma was being read. Winterbotham took charge of this process. He formed "Special Liaison Units", which were attached to each field headquarters that received Enigma.
&lt;ref name="Sec"&gt;Winterbotham, Frederick.  ''The Ultra Secret''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1974. {{ISBN|0-297-76832-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An SLU consisted of a few RAF officers and enlisted men, low in rank to avoid drawing attention. They received Ultra messages by radio from Britain, carefully encrypted in Britain's strongest [[cipher]]. They decrypted the messages, and handed them over to the commander, who was often the only person cleared to know where the information came from. (At some HQs, there might be one or two deputies also cleared.) The SLU was expected to retrieve the Ultra message after the commander had read it and keep it under lock and key.&lt;ref name="Sec"/&gt;

The SLU was also expected to keep the recipient commander from telling anyone else about the origins of the message or acting too obviously on its contents. Naturally, this sometimes led to conflicts with field commanders who objected to being second-guessed. After the [[United States|U.S.]] entered the war, these field commanders were often not British.&lt;ref name="Sec"/&gt;

Winterbotham was responsible for recruiting and training the SLU personnel for this difficult role. They had to be very able technically, be close-mouthed, keep a low profile, and also be diplomatic enough to manage commanders who far outranked them. When diplomacy failed, Winterbotham flew out to the problem HQ to resolve the quarrel. He had the ultimate authority of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] governments behind him, as both Britain and the U.S. would do almost anything to avoid exposing the secret of the decryptions.&lt;ref name="Sec"/&gt;

Winterbotham succeeded brilliantly all around. The SLU personnel he picked did splendid jobs; and he was very effective in dealing with recalcitrant commanders. There were no leaks about Ultra in the field.&lt;ref name="Sec"/&gt;

==''The Ultra Secret''==
Ultra remained strictly secret even after the war. Then in 1974, Winterbotham's book, ''The Ultra Secret'', was published. This was the first book in English about [[Ultra]], and it explained what Ultra was, and revealed Winterbotham's role, particularly with regard to the dissemination and use of Ultra.

There had been mentions of Enigma decryption in earlier books by [[Władysław Kozaczuk]], [[Ladislas Farago]] and [[Gustave Bertrand]]. However, Winterbotham's book was the first extensive account of the uses to which the massive volumes of Enigma-derived intelligence were put by the Allies, on the western and eastern European fronts, in the Mediterranean, North Africa, and perhaps most crucially, in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].

Winterbotham's account has been criticized for inaccuracies and self-aggrandizement. Winterbotham acknowledged in the book that he was no [[cryptologist]] and had only slight understanding of the cryptologic side of the multi-faceted and strictly compartmentalized Ultra operation. His description of the pioneering work done by [[Poland]]'s [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] before the war is minimal and incorrect. Winterbotham later responded that he had simply passed on the story that he had been given at the time. He erroneously suggested that [[Japan]]'s [[PURPLE]] cipher machine was a version of the German Enigma and confused [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox|"Dilly" Knox]] with a different person.

Perhaps the worst flaw in the book is the myth of [[Winston Churchill]] and the [[Coventry Blitz]]. During [[The Blitz]] of 1940–1941, [[Coventry]] was severely bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]] on the night of 14–15 November. There was heavy damage and numerous civilian casualties. Winterbotham asserted that Enigma decrypts had provided clear advance warning of the raid but that Churchill personally decided not to take any special countermeasures that might alert the Germans that the British were reading Enigma. This story has been widely repeated, even though it has been thoroughly refuted by other historians and memoirists. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[Peter Calvocoressi]] was head of the Air Section at [[Bletchley Park]] that translated and analysed all decrypted Luftwaffe messages. He wrote that "Ultra never mentioned Coventry... Churchill, so far from pondering whether to save Coventry or safeguard Ultra, was under the impression that the raid was to be on London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calvocoressi |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Calvocoressi |title=Top Secret Ultra |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year=1981 |pages=85–86 |isbn=0-345-30069-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Winterbotham's book is a vivid first-hand account by one of the key figures in the Ultra story, and much of the book still retains interest and validity.  Winterbotham concludes that the war's outcome "was, in fact, a very narrow shave, and the reader may like to ponder [...] whether or not we might have won had we not had Ultra".

==Role in enabling the "Dambusters" raid==
[[James Holland (author)|James Holland]] credits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIpYmw1sRJU&amp;channel=HudUniRepository|title=James Holland, Dambusters Raid lecture 'The Dams Raid -- A Reassessment' - Univ of Huddersfield|first=|last=Uni Huddersfield Repository Research Videos|date=26 July 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winterbotham with responding to a letter from [[Barnes Wallis]] with a desperate cry for assistance ("help oh help") with a letter of his own, in February 1943. Winterbotham's letter ensured the chief of the air staff, Air Chief Marshall [[Sir Charles Portal]], knew of the Wallis plan, and took a favourable view of it. Portal overrode the resistance of [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet]], head of [[Bomber Command]], to Wallis' proposal, and the Dambusters raid, code-named [[Operation Chastise]] in May 1943, was approved.

The '''Five Tiger Generals''' is a popular appellation in Chinese culture for any five military generals serving under a ruler. This term is used in literature texts, plays and popular culture. In historical contexts, "Five Tiger Generals" usually refers to the five best military generals serving under the ruler. The term does not appear in Chinese historical records and is not used officially.

==In literature==
When applied to the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, the "Five Tiger Generals" refer to five generals from the state of [[Shu Han]]. In the historical text ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguozhi''), the biographies of [[Guan Yu]], [[Zhang Fei]], [[Zhao Yun]], [[Ma Chao]] and [[Huang Zhong]] are placed in the same volume. In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguo Yanyi''), which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Shu Han|Shu]] emperor [[Liu Bei]] actually bestowed the titles of "Five Tiger Generals" on these five generals.&lt;ref&gt;''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The historicity of the Tiger Generals is unknown; those generals existed but it is uncertain whether they were granted the titles contemporarily or posthumously honoured as such.

In the classical novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', five of the 108 outlaws at [[Mount Liang|Liangshan Marsh]] – [[Guan Sheng]], [[Lin Chong]], [[Qin Ming]], [[Huyan Zhuo]] and [[Dong Ping]] – are named the "Five Tiger Generals" of the Liangshan cavalry.

In the historical novel ''[[Shuo Tang]]'', the rebellion force of [[Wagang Army]] has ''Five Tiger Generals'' including [[Qin Shubao]], [[Shan Xiongxin]], [[Cheng Yaojin]], [[Wang Bodang]] and [[Luo Cheng]].

The [[Qing dynasty]] writer Li Yutang named [[Di Qing]], Shi Yu, Zhang Zhong, Li Yi, and Liu Qing as the "Five Tiger Generals" in his works ''Romance of Di Qing'', ''The Five Tigers Conquer the West'', and ''The Five Tigers Pacify the South''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://open-lit.com/listbook.php?cid=2&amp;gbid=106&amp;start=0 Chapter Two of Wuhu Zhengxi]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Heroes of the Ming Dynasty'', a novel romanticising the events leading to the founding of the Ming dynasty, [[Xu Da]], [[Tang He]], [[Chang Yuchun]], [[Hu Dahai]], and [[Mu Ying]] are named the "Five Founding Tiger Generals of Ming".

==Cultural impact==
In present-day terminology, "Five Tiger Generals" can refer to any group of five that is particularly outstanding in a certain field.

Hsiao Shou-li, Chiang Wu-tung, Chiao Tsai-pao, Chen Chun-sheng, and Su Teng-wang are called "Five Tiger Generals" of [[Taiwanese opera]].

Taiwanese politicians Kuo Yu-hsin, Li Wan-chu, Kuo Kuo-chi, Li Yuan-chan, and [[Wu San-lien]] are called the "Five Tiger Generals" of the [[Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council]]. Together with female politician [[Hsu Shih-hsien]], the six of them are called "Five Tigers and the Phoenix".

In the 1980s and 1990s, the five hosts of the Taiwanese television channel [[Sanlih E-Television]], He Yih-hang, Peng Chia-chia, Yang Fan, Yu Tien and Li Teng-tsai are called "Five Tiger Generals".

In the 1980s, [[Hong Kong]] television actors [[Felix Wong]], [[Michael Miu]], [[Kent Tong]], [[Andy Lau]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] are called the "[[Five Tiger Generals (TVB)|Five Tiger Generals]] of [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]]". The five of them starred together in the 1991 film ''[[The Tigers (film)|The Tigers]]''.

In 2009, a Taiwanese musical band called [[Wu Hu Jiang (band)|Wu Hu Jiang]] was formed. The five members starred as the Five Tiger Generals of Shu in the television series ''[[K.O.3an Guo]]'', which spoofs ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' in a modern school setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4072">'''Fred Lee Crisman''' (July 22, 1919 - December 10, 1975) was an author from [[Tacoma, Washington]] known for claims of [[paranormal]] events and 20th century [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracies]].

In 1947, Crisman was involved in the [[Maury Island incident]], an early [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] hoax. Crisman's "fellow UFO witness" Harold Dahl believed the 1960s TV series, ''[[The Invaders]]'' was based on Crisman's life.&lt;ref name="Gulyas" /&gt; Prior to this, Crisman had written to ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' magazine claiming that he battled "mysterious and evil" underground creatures to free himself from a cave in [[Myanmar|Burma]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Gulyas"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gulyas |first1=Aaron John |year=2015 |chapter=Paranoid and Paranormal Precursors from the 1960s to the 1990s |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=81LpCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Paranormal and the Paranoid: Conspiratorial Science Fiction Television |script-title= |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81LpCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages=30-31 |isbn=9781442251144 |access-date=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Crisman was subpoenaed by [[Jim Garrison]] to testify in the case against [[Clay Shaw]] in the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].&lt;ref name="Gulyas"/&gt; A photocopied document later circulated among Kennedy assassination buffs claimed that Crisman was one of the "[[three tramps]]" allegedly employed by a secret government agency.&lt;ref name="Knight2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Knight|title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&amp;pg=PA690|date=1 January 2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-812-9|pages=690–}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he hosted a [[talk radio|radio talk show]] under the pseudonym "Jon Gold" and wrote a book, ''The Murder of a City, Tacoma'' published in 1970 through Transistor Publishing Company. The book was described by reviewer Michael Sullivan as a "weird, politically slanted rant" that manages to "tie corruption in Tacoma to everything from communist infiltrators to the Kennedy assassination".&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Michael|title=On a Small Tacoma Bookshelf|url=http://www.historictacoma.org/ht/files/websitetacoma_bookshelf.doc|website=HistoricTacoma.org|publisher=Historic Tacoma|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] reported that forensic anthropologists had analyzed and compared the photographs of the "tramps" with those of Crisman, as well as with photographs of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] figures [[E. Howard Hunt]], [[Frank Sturgis]], and two other men.&lt;ref name="HCSA-IB"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1979 |month= |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=91–92 |chapter=I.B. |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1b.html |ref={{harvid|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section B|1979}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Committee, only Crisman resembled any of the tramps; but the same Committee determined that he was not in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination.&lt;ref name="HCSA-IB"/&gt;

Conspiracy authors consider Crisman "a nexus point for a number of conspiracies and cover-ups from the late 1940s until [his] death in 1975".&lt;ref name="Gulyas" /&gt;

'''Eugene (Gene) B. Glick''' (August 29, 1921 – October 2, 2013) was a noted [[Indiana]] philanthropist and builder. After returning from serving with the U.S. Army in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]] during [[World War II]], he and his wife, Marilyn Glick, began constructing housing in the [[Indianapolis]] area with other [[military veterans]] in mind. Originally concentrating on building [[single-family homes]] and then shifting to [[apartment]] projects in the 1960s, the Glicks amassed a considerable fortune over their lifetimes, the bulk of which they used for extensive [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] endeavors.&lt;ref name="currentincarmel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://currentincarmel.com/eugene-b-glick|publisher=currentincarmel.com|title=Eugene B. Glick &amp;#8211; Current in Carmel|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more than $142&amp;nbsp;million in charitable donations to date, the Glicks’ philanthropic impact on the state of Indiana is one of the largest of any family-based organization.&lt;ref name="insidephilanthropy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/fundraising-for-the-fine-arts/the-eugene-and-marilyn-glick-family-foundation-grants-for-vihtml|publisher=insidephilanthropy.com|title=The Eugene and Marilyn Glick Family Foundation: Grants for Visual Arts — Inside Philanthropy|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many significant cultural [[landmarks]], civic endeavors and educational entities across the state bear the Glick name.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/indystar/obituary.aspx?pid=167309357|publisher=legacy.com|title=Gene Glick Obituary - Indianapolis, IN &amp;#124; The Indianapolis Star|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deaths of Marilyn Glick in 2012 and Eugene Glick in 2013, oversight of the company and philanthropic activities has remained under the control of their children and other family members.

==Personal life and military service==

Eugene Biccard Glick was born in Indianapolis on Aug. 29, 1921, the eldest son of Reuben and Faye Biccard Glick. The family was [[Jewish]] of [[Germany|German]] ancestry. His younger brother, Arthur, died of spinal meningitis in 1937. Gene attended [[Shortridge High School]] at the same time as author [[Kurt Vonnegut]].&lt;ref name="shortridgealumni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shortridgealumni.com/halloffame.php?rl=0|publisher=shortridgealumni.com|title=Shortridge High School Alumni Association, Indianapolis, Indiana|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending [[Indiana University]], he operated a [[Charter Bus|charter bus]] service for students.&lt;ref name="cicf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cicf.org/about-cicf/funds-and-foundations/family-funds/the-glick-fund/history/|publisher=cicf.org|title=Glick Fund History - Central Indiana Community Foundation|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from IU in December 1942 with a [[bachelor’s degree]] in business, Glick enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name="iu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inscopearchive.iu.edu/headlines/2013-10-10-headline-glick-inscope.shtml|publisher=inscopearchive.iu.edu|title=Prominent Hoosier philanthropist and IU benefactor Gene Glick dies at age 92:&amp;#160;Headlines:&amp;#160;InScope:&amp;#160;Indiana University|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glick served as an [[infantry]] combat instructor until June 1944, when he was deployed to [[Italy]]. He soon requested a transfer to the [[France during World War II|French front]], and joined the [[179th Infantry Regiment (United States)|179th Regiment]] of the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]]. His [[fluency]] in German led to him serving as an [[Interrogation|interrogator]] for Army scouts.&lt;ref name="ibj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/43874-gene-glick-was-a-soldier-a-builder-and-a-philanthropic-giant|publisher=ibj.com|title=gene-glick-was-a-soldier-a-builder-and-a-philanthropic-giant|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was nearly killed during the [[Battle of the Bulge]], which greatly affected his outlook on life. In his book ''Born to Build'', Glick recounted that on Nov. 11, 1944, he huddled under cover during an intense [[artillery]] barrage for hours, and promised himself that if he survived he would always look back on that day as a lesson to never lose hope.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Born-Build-Story-Glick-Company/dp/1578600057|publisher=amazon.com|title=www.amazon.com/Born-Build-Story-Glick-Company/dp/1578600057|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glick and his unit liberated the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. He had a camera with him and helped document the atrocities of the [[Holocaust]]; Glick later donated his photographs to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] and [[Emory University]]. While serving in the war, Glick received the [[European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal|European Theater medal]], the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] and the [[Bronze Star]].&lt;ref name="legacy"/&gt;

Glick’s wartime experiences led to him being featured in Tom Brokaw’s best-selling book, ''[[Greatest Generation|The Greatest Generation]]'', as well as contemporaneous television broadcasts hosted by [[Tom Brokaw]] and [[Matt Lauer]].&lt;ref name="nbclearn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://highered.nbclearn.com/portal/site/HigherEd/flatview?cuecard=6456|publisher=highered.nbclearn.com|title=The Greatest Generation: A GI Comes Home to Build Up America|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to Indianapolis after mustering out, Glick founded the [[G.I. Bill|G.I. loans]] department at People’s Bank. Glick married Marilyn Koffman in 1947, and together they began building single family homes in Indianapolis, an enterprise that eventually became the Gene B. Glick Company.

The couple had four daughters: Marianne Glick, Arlene Grande, Alice Meshbane and Lynda Schwartz. The Glicks raised their family in the Indianapolis area and continued to reside there for the rest of their lives. In 1982, they created the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Family Foundation and began to devote more of their time and wealth to charitable causes.

They remained active in the Indianapolis Jewish community as members of the [[Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation]], and were noted patrons of the [[Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis]], whose community center is named after Glick’s brother, Arthur.&lt;ref name="jewishindianapolis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishindianapolis.org/community-directory/arthur-m-glick-jewish-community-center|publisher=jewishindianapolis.org|title=Arthur M. Glick Jewish Community Center &amp;#124; Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis, Inc.|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene Glick died on Oct. 2, 2013 at the age of 92.

==The Gene B. Glick Company==

The Gene B. Glick Company is a [[Multi-family residential|multifamily housing]] development and [[property management]] company founded by Gene Glick in 1947. Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, it is one of the largest [[Privately held company|privately owned]] firms in the apartment industry within the state and nationwide.&lt;ref name="ibj2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/lists/multifamily-property-management-firms|publisher=ibj.com|title=www.ibj.com/lists/multifamily-property-management-firms|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indystar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2013/10/02/indianapolis-philanthropist-gene-glick-dies-at-age-92/2910301/|publisher=indystar.com|title=www.indystar.com/story/news/2013/10/02/indianapolis-philanthropist-gene-glick-dies-at-age-92/2910301/|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 it owns and operates properties in 12 states, with more than 20,000 apartment units and approximately 7,000 employees.&lt;ref name="ibj3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/lists/indiana-private-50|publisher=ibj.com|title=www.ibj.com/lists/indiana-private-50|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glick started the company, then known as Indianapolis Homes Inc., building single family houses on the Eastside of Indianapolis using money he saved while serving in the Army, as well as savings of his wife, Marilyn. His stated aim was to help other military veterans successfully transition to civilian life. During the 1950s the company became a leading [[franchisee]] of National Homes, expanding from building single homes to entire [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]s.

By 1962, the company had changed its name to the Gene B. Glick Company and was generating more than $1&amp;nbsp;million in sales annually.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Born-Build-Story-Glick-Company/dp/1578600057, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In this same year, the company built its first apartment community, Williamsburg East. The business changed its focus from single family houses to multifamily communities, with an emphasis on creating affordable homes for low-income families using federal [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] funding. By 1968, the Gene B. Glick Company had shifted its entire business model to [[Construction|building]], acquiring and managing apartment buildings.

From the late 1960s through the 1980s, the company expanded from Indiana to [[Ohio]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Born-Build-Story-Glick-Company/dp/1578600057, page 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2000s, Gene and Marilyn Glick became focused on their philanthropic endeavors, turning over more of the daily operations to their children and grandchildren.&lt;ref name="ibj4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/2245-a-new-generation-takes-over-glick-apartment-empire|publisher=ibj.com|title=www.ibj.com/articles/2245-a-new-generation-takes-over-glick-apartment-empire|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Glick officially retired in 2008, at which point his granddaughter’s husband, David Barrett, became President and [[CEO]] of the Gene B. Glick Company.

The company has continued to expand over the past decade, building or acquiring more apartment communities as well as a new national headquarters building in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name="indystar2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/03/13/notably-new-river-north-keystone-opening/70223904/|publisher=indystar.com|title=www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/03/13/notably-new-river-north-keystone-opening/70223904/|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it expanded into its 12th state, [[Wisconsin]].

==Philanthropy and honors==

Gene Glick is regarded as one of the most significant philanthropists in Indiana history.&lt;ref name="iupui"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inside.iupui.edu/headlines/2013-10-08-glick.shtml|publisher=inside.iupui.edu|title=Prominent Hoosier philanthropist and IU benefactor Gene Glick dies at age 92:&amp;#160;Headlines:&amp;#160;Inside IUPUI:&amp;#160;Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene and Marilyn Glick made charitable contributions throughout their lives that grew as their personal fortune did.

In 1982, they established the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Family Foundation to organize their philanthropic endeavors. It was later joined by the Glick Family Housing Foundation, which focuses on providing homes and support services for low-income families; the Glick Fund administered by the Central Indiana Community Foundation, which primarily goes toward education, self-sufficiency and the arts; and a separate Glick Fund of the [[Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name="cicf2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cicf.org/about-cicf/funds-and-foundations/family-funds/the-glick-fund/|publisher=cicf.org|title=The Glick Fund|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glick’s philanthropic efforts focused on education, health care, affordable housing for low-income families, community support services and the arts.&lt;ref name="wfyi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/eugene-glick-92-passes-away|publisher=wfyi.org|title=Eugene Glick, 92, Passes Away|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous buildings, landmarks, educational programs and cultural endeavors across Indiana are named after the Glicks.

The Indianapolis Cultural Trail: A Legacy of Gene &amp; Marilyn Glick is an 8-mile network of urban pedestrian and bike corridors linking the city’s seven [[Indianapolis Cultural Districts]]. It opened in 2013 after 12 years of planning and six years of construction at a total cost of $62.5&amp;nbsp;million in a [[public-private partnership]].&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-mayor-announce-205-million-in-federal-funding-for|publisher=carson.house.gov|title=Congressman, Mayor Announce $20.5 Million in Federal Funding for Indianapolis Cultural Trail &amp;#124; Congressman Andre Carson|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Glicks donated $15&amp;nbsp;million as [[seed money]] for the project.&lt;ref name="cleveland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2013/05/the_new_indianapolis_cultural.html|publisher=cleveland.com|title=The new Indianapolis Cultural Trail is a masterpiece of bike-friendly design Cleveland should emulate &amp;#124; cleveland.com|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eugene and Marilyn Glick History Center, a museum in downtown Indianapolis for historical artifacts that also hosts many cultural events, serves as the headquarters of the [[Indiana Historical Society]]. The center was built in 1999 and reopened and renamed in 2010 in honor of the Glick’s $8&amp;nbsp;million gift to the project.&lt;ref name="ibj5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/38284-indiana-historical-society-wraps-up-19m-campaign|publisher=ibj.com|title=www.ibj.com/articles/38284-indiana-historical-society-wraps-up-19m-campaign|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Gene and Marilyn gave $30&amp;nbsp;million to Indiana University to establish the Glick Eye Institute, which houses the Department of [[Ophthalmology]] at the [[Indiana University School of Medicine|IU School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="ibj6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/8099-glicks-to-donate-30-million-to-iu-medical-school|publisher=ibj.com|title=www.ibj.com/articles/8099-glicks-to-donate-30-million-to-iu-medical-school|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Glick had previously established an IU [[scholarship]] program in his name.&lt;ref name="iupui2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.iupui.edu/releases/2014/04/sop-online-version.shtml|publisher=news.iupui.edu|title=Donors, volunteers receive one of IUPUI's most prestigious philanthropy awards : Newscenter : IUPUI|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the [[Indianapolis Public Library]] Foundation, the Glicks created the Indiana Authors Award recognizing notable Indiana writers beginning in 2009.&lt;ref name="indianaauthorsaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianaauthorsaward.org/the-award/the-glicks/|publisher=indianaauthorsaward.org|title=The Glicks - Indiana Authors Award|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Glick Fund gave a grant to the local [[NPR]] affiliate, [[WFYI-FM|WFYI]], to fund a [[reporter]] position covering issues of [[poverty]] and health.&lt;ref name="ibj7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/61950-wfyi-other-public-radio-stations-bulk-up-news-staffs|publisher=ibj.com|title=www.ibj.com/articles/61950-wfyi-other-public-radio-stations-bulk-up-news-staffs|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable institutions to receive Glick donations include the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]], [[United Way of Central Indiana]], [[Riley Children's Foundation|Riley Children’s Hospital]], Second Helpings, the [[Indianapolis Art Center]], [[Ball State University]] and TeenWorks, a job-training program for local underprivileged teens that Gene Glick launched in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="genebglick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genebglick.com/our-story.php#bottom-container|publisher=genebglick.com|title=The Glick Company &amp;#124; Indianapolis Apartment Management Company : Gene B.

Glick received numerous personal awards and honors during his lifetime. He received the [[Sagamore of the Wabash]], the state of Indiana’s highest civilian award at the time, on three occasions – in 1982, 1992 and 2005 – making him one of only four people to receive the Sagamore three or more times.&lt;ref name="insideindianabusiness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/29815612/indiana-remembers-gene-glick|publisher=insideindianabusiness.com|title=Indiana Remembers Gene Glick - Inside INdiana Business|date=2015-08-18|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named an Indiana Living Legend by the Indiana Historical Society in 2002. The Indiana Chapter of the National Society of Fund Raising Executives, now known as the Association of Fundraising Professionals, gave him their Lifetime Achievement Award. He was a member of both the National Housing Hall of Fame and the Central Indiana Business Hall of Fame. Glick received an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of law|Doctor of Laws]] degree from [[Butler University]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="fox59"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox59.com/2013/10/02/real-estate-developer-noted-philanthropist-gene-b-glick-dead-at-age-92/|publisher=fox59.com|title=Real estate developer, noted philanthropist Gene B.

'''Gratius Faliscus''' or '''Grattius''' was a [[Latin poetry|Roman poet]] of the age of [[Augustus]] (63 BC – 14 AD). He is known as the author of a ''Cynegeticon'', a poem on hunting.

==Life==
The only reference to Grattius in any extant ancient writer is a passing reference in [[Ovid]], ''Ex Ponto'':&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Ex Ponto'', iv.16.33&lt;/ref&gt; 
:''Tityrus antiquas et erat qui pasceret herbas &lt;br&gt;Aptaque venanti Gratius arma daret.''

Some lines by [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] have been supposed to allude to Grattius, but the terms in which they are expressed&lt;ref&gt;Astron. 2.43&lt;/ref&gt; are too vague to warrant such a conclusion. According to Wernsdorf, who argued from the name, he must have been a slave or a [[freedman]]. The [[cognomen]], or epithet, Faliscus, from which it has been inferred that he was a native of [[Falerii]]&lt;ref&gt;See ''e.g.'' {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Grattius}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first introduced by Barth, on the authority of a manuscript which no one else ever saw, and probably originated in a forced interpretation of one of the lines in the poem, "At contra nostris imbellia lina Faliscis" (5.40). [[William Ramsay (classical scholar)|William Ramsay]] argued that in the context, "nostris" here denotes merely "Italian", in contradistinction to the various foreign tribes spoken of in the preceding verses.

==Cynegeticon==
541 [[hexameter]] lines of Grattius's poem about hunting are preserved in a manuscript of c. 800 AD.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (1966) p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; The work describes various kinds of [[game (food)|game]], methods of hunting, and the best breeds of horses and dogs, using a fairly regular hexameter to do so.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (1966) p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; Grattius stresses the role of ''ratio'' ([[reason]]) in hunting, seeing it as a civilising endeavour in the tradition of [[Hercules]], as opposed to indulgence in [[Seven Deadly Sins|luxuria]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Tooley, ''Melancholy, Love and Time'' (2004) p. 242-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contents===
The poem, entitled ''Cynegeticon Liber'', professes to set forth the apparatus (''arma'') necessary for the sportsman, and the manner in which the various requisites for the pursuit of game are to be procured, prepared, and preserved (''artes armorum''.) Among the ''arma'' of the hunter are included not only nets, gins, snares (''retia, pedicae, laquei''), darts and spears (''jacula, venabula''), but also horses and dogs, and a large portion of the undertaking (verses 150–430) is devoted to a systematic account of the different kinds of hounds and horses.

The matter and arrangement of the treatise are derived in a great measure from [[Xenophon]], although information was drawn from other ancient sources, such as Dercylus the Arcadian, and [[Hagnon of Tarsus|Hagnon]] of [[Boeotia]].

===Appraisal===
According to Ramsay, the language of the ''Cynegetica'' is pure, and not unworthy of the age to which it belongs, but there is frequently a harshness in the structure of the periods, a strange and unauthorised use of particular words, and a general want of distinctness, which, in addition to a very corrupt text, render it a task of great difficulty to determine the exact meaning of many passages. Although considerable skill is manifested in the combination of the parts – Ramsay continues – the author did not possess sufficient power to overcome the obstacles which were triumphantly combated by Virgil. 

It is remarkable that both the second-century poets [[Oppianus]] and [[Nemesianus]] arrogate to themselves the honour of having entered upon a path altogether untrodden. Whether we believe them to be sincere and ignorant, or suspect them of deliberate dishonesty, their bold assertion is sufficient to prove that the poem of Grattius had in their day become almost totally unknown.

===Editions===
The Cynegetica has been transmitted to modern times through the medium of a single manuscript, which was brought from Gaul to Italy by [[Actius Sannazarius]] about the beginning of the sixteenth century, and contained also the Cynegetics of Nemesianus, and the [[Halieutics]] ascribed to Ovid. A second copy of the first 159 lines was found by [[Jan van Vliet]] appended to another manuscript of the Halieutics.

The ''Editio Princeps'' was printed at Venice in February 1534, by [[Aldus Manutius]], in a volume, containing also the Halieutica of [[Ovid]], the Cynegetica and Carmen Bucolicum of [[Nemesianus]], the [[Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus|Buolica]] of [[Titus Calpurnius Siculus|Calpurnius Siculus]], together with the Venatio of Hadrianus; and reprinted at Augsburg in the July of the same year. The best editions are those contained in the Poetae Latini Minores of Burmann (vol. i. Lug. Bat. 1731), and of Wernsdorf (vol. i. p. 6, 293, ii. p. 34, iv. pt. ii. p. 790, 806, v. pt. iii. p. 1445), whose introductions provide all the requisite preliminary information.

===Translations===
A translation into English verse with notes, and the Latin text, by [[Christopher Wase]], was published at London in 1654, and a translation into German, also metrical, by S. E. G. Perlet, at Leipzig, in 1826.

Together with his prime minister [[Gajah Mada]], he reigned the empire at the time of its greatest power. During his reign the [[Hindu texts|Hindu epics]], the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], became ingrained in the culture and worldview of the Javanese through the [[wayang kulit]] (“leather puppets”).&lt;ref name=mark1&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer and Wade Clark Roof, 2012, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=B105DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA557&amp;dq=gajah+mada+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2yJDvxKLaAhVMuI8KHSapCqkQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=gajah%20mada%20religion&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Global Religion], Volume 1, Page 557.&lt;/ref&gt; He was preceded by [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]] and succeeded by his son-in-law [[Wikramawardhana]]. Most of the accounts of his life were taken from [[Nagarakretagama]] and [[Pararaton]].

==Early life==
According to [[Nagarakretagama]] canto 1 stanza 4 and 5 (composed by [[Mpu Prapanca]] in 1365), Hayam Wuruk was born in 1256 Saka or correspond to 1334 CE, the same year that [[Kelud|Mount Kelud]] erupted. Prapanca argued that this was the divine sign that ''Batara Gurunata'' (Javanese name for [[Shiva|Shiva Mahadewa]]) has manifest Himself on earth, reincarnated as the Javanese king.&lt;ref name="JejakNusantara"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Terjemahan Kakawin Dēśawarṇnana (Nāgarakṛtāgama) |author=Mpu Prapanca, translated by Slamet Muljana|publisher=Jejak Nusantara |url=http://jejaknusantara.com/terjemahan-nagarakretagama |language=Indonesian|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the same, [[Gajah Mada]] declared his oath [[Palapa Oath|Sumpah Palapa]].

Hayam Wuruk's name can be translated as "scholar rooster". He was the son of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwana Tunggadewi]] and Sri [[Kertawardhana]] or [[Cakradhara]]. His mother was the daughter of [[Raden Wijaya]] founder of [[Majapahit]], meanwhile his father was the son of [[Bhre Tumapel]] lesser king of [[Singhasari]]. Both [[Pararaton]] and [[Nagarakretagama]] praised Hayam Wuruk as a handsome, bright, talented, and exceptional student in the courtly martial arts of archery and fencing, also mastering politics and scriptures, as well as arts and music. He was known as an accomplished ceremonial dancer in the court. Some accounts tell of Hayam Wuruk's performances in a traditional ceremonial Javanese [[Topeng dance|mask dance]]. His mother, Queen Tribhuwana, educated and groomed him to become the next monarch of Majapahit.

==The Reign==
In 1350 [[Gayatri Rajapatni]] died in her retirement at a Buddhist monastery. She was the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit, and also the grandmother of Hayam Wuruk. Queen Tribhuwana had to abdicate because she ruled Majapahit under Rajapatni's auspices, and she was obliged to relinquish her throne to her son.

Hayam Wuruk inherited the throne in 1350 at the age of 16 when the patih ([[prime minister]]) [[Gajah Mada]] was at the height of his career. Under his rule, Majapahit extended its power throughout the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago.

According to [[Pararaton]] and [[Kidung Sunda]], in 1357 King Hayam Wuruk was expected to marry [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]], the princess of the [[Sunda Kingdom]]. The reason for this royal engagement was probably political, to foster the alliance between the Majapahit and the Sundanese Kingdoms. However, in the [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]], the Sunda royal family and their guards were involved in a skirmish with Majapahit troops. The planned royal wedding ended in disaster with the death of the princess and the whole Sunda royal party. The court officials blamed [[Gajah Mada]] because it was his intention to demand submission from Sunda Kingdom that ended in bloodshed.

Several years later Hayam Wuruk married his half-sister, Paduka Sori, daughter of [[:id:Dyah_Wiyat|Dyah Wiyat]]. Hayam Wuruk and Paduka Sori have 1 father, different mothers.
In 1365 (or 1287 [[Shalivahana era|Saka year]]), [[Mpu Prapanca]] wrote the ''[[kakawin]]'' [[Nagarakretagama]], the old Javanese [[eulogy]] for King Hayam Wuruk.&lt;ref name=Myron&gt;

He sent embassies to China from 1370 to 1381.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|240}}

Hayam Wuruk had a daughter, Crown Princess [[Kusumawardhani]], with Queen Sori. Kusumawardhani married a relative, Prince Wikramawardhana. However, from a consort concubine, Hayam Wuruk had a son, Prince Wirabhumi. After Hayam Wuruk's death in 1389, the empire fell into chaos and decline during the contest over succession between Wikramawardhana and Wirabhumi. The dispute ended in Wirabhumi's defeat in the Paregreg war. Wikramawardhana succeeded Hayam Wuruk as the King of Majapahit.

'''''Hidden in Plain Sight''''' ({{lang-fi|Piilottajan päiväkirja}}) is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[Juha Suoranta]] on helping a minor [[asylum seeker]] in [[Finland]]. The book, based on the author's journal, is about his attempt to protect Ashraf Sahil, and to help him avoid deportation to inhuman conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intokustannus.fi/kirja/hidden_in_plain_sight/ |title=Hidden in Plain Sight (synopsis)|accessdate=December 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426042039/http://www.intokustannus.fi/kirja/hidden_in_plain_sight/ |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }} ''intokustannus.fi''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sahil, who as a young child had fled with his family from [[Afghanistan]] to [[Pakistan]] in the 1990, was first sent to [[Iran]] from where he was carried to [[Greece]] through [[Turkey]] by [[human smuggling|human smugglers]]. From there he traveled across [[Europe]] to [[Finland]] in summer 2008. The [[Immigration to Finland|Finnish Immigration]] officials [http://www.migri.fi/netcomm/Default.asp?language=EN] did not grant him a due [[right of asylum|asylum]] process but instead imposed a [[deportation]] when the author received an e-mail request for help from his sociologist friend in [[Minneapolis]].

Suoranta states that he could not tolerate a situation "where a young person was about to be sent into an uncertain, perhaps life-threatening, situation. If it was in my power to do something, I had to do something.... Although I did not know what asylum, deportation, irregular [[immigration]], or the [[Dublin Regulation|Dublin agreement]] meant, it was necessary to try to do something, search for help, at least. When I found out that there was no organisation, including the church, which could help, I realised that I had a duty." Thus he hid the youngster to his late grandfather's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews%3D51351 |title=Tough Asylum Policy Opposed by Civil Disobedience |first= Linus |last= Atarah |date= May 7, 2010 |publisher=IPS News |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612005827/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51351 |archivedate=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/05/rights-finland-tough-asylum-policy-opposed-by-civil-disobedience/&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has three [[narrative thread|storyline]]s or intertwined layers. In one level it describes in a form of a journal the actual incidents in chronological order, a 5-month period from March to August 2009. In other level it ponders the author's inner feelings and anxieties in a difficult and unprecedented circumstances. And yet in another level the text contains [[ethics|ethical]] and [[morality|moral]] reflections pertaining universal questions of helping another human beings referring, among others, to [[sociologist]] [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and [[philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]], especially his ''[[Practical Ethics]]'' and ''[[The Life You Can Save]]''.

Suoranta's ethics in helping and hiding a stranger is as follows: "Suffering and death because of the lack of basic needs or protection are unnecessary. And if they can be prevented without notable sacrifices, compared to suffering and death, it is wrong not to help."&lt;ref&gt;Suoranta, Juha. ''Hidden in Plain Sight''. Helsinki: Into Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland the book attracted publicity in [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s and [[blogosphere]] as stories and book reviews;&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Mirka Heinonen, Piilottaja (Hiding), Anna 25-26/2010 s. 48-51, Heikki Laurinolli, Suomi torjuu tulijat (Finland Fends Off the Strangers), ''[[Aikalainen]]'' 11.2.2010 [http://aikalainen.uta.fi/2010/02/11/suomi-torjuu-tulijat/], Mikko Niemelä, Henkilökohtaisesta poliittista (Personal is Political), ''[[Paatos|Paatos (lehti)]]'' 2/2010 [http://jarjestot.uta.fi/aatos/paatos/arkisto/2010-2/paatos21007.html], Ninni Sandelius, "Haluan elää hyvän elämän" ("I want to live a good life"), ''[[Apu (magazine)|Apu]]'' 16.4.2010 [http://www.apu.fi/ihmiset/article162403-1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', the largest subscription newspaper in Finland, published a story in its Sunday pages titled "Good Tamperenian" in the eve of the book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heikki Hellman|Hellman, Heikki]], Laupias tamperelainen (Good Tamperenian), ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' January 31, 2010 [http://hommaforum.org/index.php/topic,21218.msg302769.html#msg302769]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hildegard Martha Lächert''' (20 January 1920 – 1995) was a female guard, or ''[[Female guards in Nazi concentration camps|Aufseherin]]'', at several German [[World War II]] [[concentration camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=t6FXCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT255&amp;dq=Hildegard+Martha+L%C3%A4chert&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinqdjg4-PZAhWoqlQKHR0oAYYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hildegard%20Martha%20L%C3%A4chert&amp;f=false|title=Se questa è una donna|last=Álvarez|first=Mónica|date=2016-01-19|publisher=Edizioni Piemme|isbn=9788858514740|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became publicly known for her service at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. After the war she was sentenced to a total of 27 years in prison for her brutal treatment of inmates during her camp service of which she only served close to ten. She later did work for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and for the [[West Germany|West German]] spy agency the [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] (Federal Intelligence Service).{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In October 1942, at the age of 22, Hildegard Lächert, a [[Germany|German]] [[Nursing|nurse]], was called to serve at Majdanek as an ''Aufseherin''. In 1944, after the birth of her third child, Lächert went on to serve at Auschwitz concentration camp. The ruthless overseer fled the camp in December 1944 ahead of the advancing [[Red Army]]. There are reports that her last overseeing jobs were at [[Bolzano]], a detention camp in northern [[Italy]], and at the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex|Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in [[Austria]].

In November 1947, the former SS woman appeared in a [[Kraków]], [[Poland]] courtroom, along with 40 other SS guards in the [[Auschwitz trial]]. Lächert sat next to three other former SS women, [[Alice Orlowski]], [[Therese Brandl]] and [[Luise Danz]]. Because of her [[war crime]]s at Auschwitz and [[Płaszów]], the former guard and mother of two surviving children was given a sentence of 15 years in prison. Lächert was released in 1956 from a Kraków prison. In 1975, the German government decided to try 16 former SS guards from the Majdanek concentration camp. Lächert was one of them, along with [[Hermine Braunsteiner]] and Alice Orlowski. From 26 November 1975 until 30 June 1981, the accused were tried in a [[Düsseldorf]] courtroom.
[[File:Hildegard Lächert 1947.tiff|thumb|Hildegard Lächert's 1947 trial]]
The testimonies heard concerning Lächert's [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] behaviour were long and detailed. One former prisoner, Henryka Ostrowska, testified, "We always said ''blutige'' about the fact that she struck until blood showed," giving her the nickname "Bloody Brigitte" (''Krwawa Brygida'' in [[Polish language|Polish]]). Many other witnesses characterized her as the "worst" or "the most cruel" ''Aufseherin'', as "Beast", and as "Fright of the Prisoners." For her part in selections to the gas chamber, releasing her dog onto inmates and her overall abuse, the court sentenced her to 12 years' imprisonment. She never had to serve this time since her imprisonment in Poland (close to 10 years) and the time she spent in custody awaiting trial (5 years) were allowed for.

Hildegard Lächert died in 1995 in Berlin, aged 75.

'''Itzhak Perlman''' ({{lang-he|יצחק פרלמן}}; born 31 August 1945) is an [[Israeli-American]] violinist, conductor, and music teacher. Over the course of his career, Perlman has performed worldwide, and throughout the United States, in venues that have included a State Dinner at the [[White House]] honoring [[Queen Elizabeth II]], and at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Presidential Inauguration]] of [[President Obama]], and he has conducted the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]], and the [[Westchester Philharmonic]]. In 2015, he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

==Early life==
Perlman was born in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1945, then [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], now [[Israel]]. &lt;!-- please do not add "Israel"; it did not exist in 1945--&gt; His parents, Chaim and Shoshana Perlman, were natives of [[Poland]] and had independently [[Aliyah|immigrated to Palestine]] in the mid-1930s before they met and later married.

Perlman first became interested in the violin after hearing a classical music performance on the radio. At the age of three, he was denied admission to the [[Shulamit Conservatory]] for being too small to hold a violin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/pqdweb?index=2&amp;did=445171182&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1317432895&amp;clientId=43922 |title=Israeli Violin Prodigy Admits He Likes Jazz |publisher=Proquest.com |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He instead taught himself how to play the instrument using a toy fiddle until he was old enough to study with Rivka Goldgart at the Shulamit Conservatory and at the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv, where he gave his first recital at age 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/21349?q=itzhak+perlman&amp;hbutton_search.x=0&amp;hbutton_search.y=0&amp;hbutton_search=search&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1 |title=Perlman, Itzhak |publisher=Oxford Music Online |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the United States to study at the [[Juilliard School]] with the violin pedagogue [[Ivan Galamian]] and his assistant [[Dorothy DeLay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/perlman-itzhak-biography |title=Perlman, Itzhak Biography: Contemporary Musicians |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perlman contracted [[polio]] at age four and has walked using leg braces and [[crutches]] since then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/I-woke-up-and-I-couldnt-walk-This-is-the-polio-that-should-become-just-a-memory-398720 |title='I WOKE UP AND I COULDN'T WALK': THIS IS THE POLIO THAT SHOULD BECOME JUST A MEMORY |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plays the violin while seated. {{as of|2018}}, he uses crutches or an electric Amigo scooter for mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/nyregion/how-they-roll.html |title=How They Roll |work=The New York Times |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Performing===

[[File:Ed Sullivan - Itzhak Perlman 1958.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ed Sullivan]] congratulates 13-year-old Itzhak Perlman after a concert (1958)]] 
Perlman appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' twice in 1958, and again in 1964, on the same show with the [[Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Duration:&amp;nbsp;60 min |url=http://www.ovguide.com/tv_episode/the-ed-sullivan-show-season-12-episode-8-itzhak-perlman-carol-lawrence-larry-kert-film-ed-sullivan-visits-jerusalem-27092 |title=Watch The Ed Sullivan Show Season 12 Episode 8 Itzhak Perlman / Carol Lawrence &amp; Larry Kert / Film: Ed Sullivan Visits Jerusalem |publisher=Ovguide.com |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1963 and won the [[Leventritt Competition]] in 1964. Soon afterward, he began to tour widely. In addition to an extensive recording and performance career, he has continued to make guest appearances on American television shows such as ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' as well as playing at a number of functions at the [[White House]].

Although he has never been billed or marketed as a singer, he sang the role of "Un carceriere" ("a jailer") on a 1981 [[EMI]] recording of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini's]] "[[Tosca]]" that featured [[Renata Scotto]], [[Plácido Domingo]], and [[Renato Bruson]], with [[James Levine]] conducting. He had earlier sung the role in an excerpt from the opera on a 1980 Pension Fund Benefit Concert telecast as part of the [[Live from Lincoln Center]] series with [[Luciano Pavarotti]] as Cavaradossi and [[Zubin Mehta]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].

On 5 July 1986, he performed on the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s tribute to the 100th anniversary of the [[Statue of Liberty]], which was televised live on [[ABC Television]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-07-05/features/8602090161_1_liberty-weekend-liberty-festivities-great-lawn |title=Liberty Receives Classical Salute, Sun Sentinel, July 5, 1986 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223012824/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-07-05/features/8602090161_1_liberty-weekend-liberty-festivities-great-lawn |archivedate=23 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestra, conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], performed in [[Central Park]].

In 1987, he joined the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] (IPO) for their concerts in [[Warsaw]] and [[Budapest]] as well as other cities in [[Eastern bloc]] countries. He toured with the IPO in the spring of 1990 for its first-ever performance in the [[Soviet Union]], with concerts in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], and toured with the IPO again in 1994, performing in China and India.

In 2015 on a classical music program entitled ''The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center'' produced by [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]] in New York City, it was revealed that Perlman performed the uncredited violin solo on the 1989 [[Billy Joel]] song [[The Downeaster Alexa]].

While primarily a solo artist, Perlman has performed with a number of other musicians, including [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Pinchas Zukerman]], [[Jessye Norman]], [[Isaac Stern]], and [[Yuri Temirkanov]] at the 150th anniversary celebration of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] in Leningrad in December 1990. He has also performed and recorded with his friend and fellow Israeli violinist [[Pinchas Zukerman]] on numerous occasions over the years.

As well as playing and recording the classical music for which he is best known, Perlman has also played [[jazz]], including an album made with jazz pianist [[Oscar Peterson]], and in addition, [[klezmer]]. Perlman has been a soloist for a number of film scores such as the theme of the [[1993 film]] ''[[Schindler's List]]'' by [[John Williams]], which subsequently won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. More recently, he was the violin soloist for the [[2005 film]] ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' along with cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. Perlman played selections from the musical scores of the movies nominated for "Best Original Score" at the [[73rd Academy Awards]] with [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Selected performances===
[[File:ItzhakPerlmanWhitehouse2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Perlman at the White House in 2007]]
Perlman played at the state dinner attended by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 2007, in the East Room at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=News releases for May 2007 | url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/05/images/20070507_p050707sc-1032-1-515h.html | publisher=The White House | date=7 May 2007 | accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed [[John Williams]]'s "[[Air and Simple Gifts]]" at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|2009 inauguration ceremony]] for [[Barack Obama]] along with [[Yo-Yo Ma]] (cello), [[Gabriela Montero]] (piano), and [[Anthony McGill]] (clarinet).  While the quartet did play live, the music played simultaneously over speakers and on television was a recording made two days prior due to concerns over the cold weather damaging the instruments. Perlman was quoted as saying: "It would have been a disaster if we had done it any other way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/obama_inauguration/7846472.stm Quartet pre-recorded Obama music]. BBC News (23 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

He made an appearance in Disney's [[Fantasia 2000]] to introduce the segment [[Pines of Rome]] along with [[Steve Martin]].

On 2 November 2018, Perlman reprised the 60th anniversary of his first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show as a guest on [[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slippedisc.com/2018/11/60-years-on-itzhak-perlman-reprises-his-ed-sullivan-appearance/|title=60 Years On, Itzhak Perlman Reprises His Ed Sullivan Appearance.|date=2018-11-03|author=Norman Lebrecht|publisher=slippeddisc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
In 1975, Perlman accepted a faculty post at the Conservatory of Music at [[Brooklyn College]]. In 2003, Mr.&amp;nbsp;Perlman was named the holder of the Dorothy Richard Starling Foundation Chair in Violin Studies at the Juilliard School, succeeding his teacher, [[Dorothy DeLay]]. He also currently teaches students one-on-one at the Perlman Music Program on Long Island, NY, rarely holding master classes.

===The Perlman Music Program===
The Perlman music program, founded in 1995 by Toby Perlman and Suki Sandler, started as a summer camp for exceptional string musicians between the ages of 11 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gateway.proquest.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;res_dat=xri:iimp:&amp;rft_dat=xri:iimp:article:fulltext:iimp00163565 |title=The Perlman Music Program: Toby's Project Grows and Grows |publisher=Strings |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, it expanded to a year-long program. Students have the chance to have Itzhak Perlman himself coach them before they play at venues such as the [[Sutton Place Synagogue]] and public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gateway.proquest.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;res_dat=xri:iimp:&amp;rft_dat=xri:iimp:article:citation:iimp00170081 |title=Perlmans' Proteges: The Perlman Music Program |publisher=Strings |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By introducing students to each other and requiring them to practice together, the program strives to have musicians who would otherwise practice alone and develop a network of friends and colleagues. Rather than remain isolated, participants in the program find an area where they belong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gateway.proquest.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;res_dat=xri:iimp:&amp;rft_dat=xri:iimp:article:fulltext:iimp00170084 |title=Perlman Student Stirling Trent |publisher=Strings |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conducting===
At the beginning of the new millennium, Perlman began to [[Conducting|conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=20000821&amp;id=VIhGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lukMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1729,4990881|title=The Daily Gazette – Google News Archive Search|publisher=Google News|access-date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the post of principal guest conductor at the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]]. He served as music advisor to the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]] from 2002 to 2004. In November 2007, the [[Westchester Philharmonic]] announced the appointment of Perlman as artistic director and principal conductor.

Perlman plays the ''[[Soil Stradivarius]]'' violin of 1714, formerly owned by [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and considered one of the finest violins made during Stradivari's "golden period." Perlman also plays the [[Guarneri|Guarneri del Gesu 1743 'Sauret']]&lt;ref name="cozio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cozio.com/musician.aspx?id%3D107 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825190954/http://www.cozio.com/Musician.aspx?id=107 |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kreisler Bergonzi|Carlo Bergonzi 1740 'ex-Kreisler']].

'''Jamaicans''' are the citizens of [[Jamaica]] and their descendants in the [[Jamaican diaspora]]. Most Jamaicans are of African descent, with smaller minorities of Europeans, East Indians, Chinese and others or mixed ancestry. The bulk of the Jamaican diaspora resides in other [[Anglophone countries]], namely [[Jamaican Australians|Australia]], [[Jamaican Canadians|Canada]], [[Jamaican Americans|United States]] and the [[Jamaican British|United Kingdom]] and, to a lesser extent, other [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean countries]] and [[Commonwealth realms]].

According to the official Jamaica Population Census of 1970, ethnic origins categories in Jamaica include [[Afro-Jamaican|Black]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|East Indian]], [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Lebanese Jamaicans|Syrian or Lebanese]], [[White Jamaicans|White]], mixed, and other races. Jamaicans of African or partial African descent made up 89.4% of the working population. Those of non-African mixed race were the second most prominent labour group, making up 6% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jamaica Population Census 1970|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Diaspora==

'''James W. “Jim” Ford''' (December 22, 1893{{spaced ndash}}1957) was an activist and politician, the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-Presidential]] candidate for the [[Communist Party USA]] in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]], [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936]], and [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]]. A [[party organizer]] born in [[Alabama]] and living in [[New York City]], Ford was the first [[African American]] to run on a presidential ticket in the 20th century.

==Biography==

===Early years===
James W. Ford was born in [[Pratt City, Alabama|Pratt City]], [[Alabama]] on December 22, 1893, the son of Lymon Forsch and his wife. His father, a former resident of [[Gainesville, Georgia]], had come to Alabama in the 1890s to work in the coal mines and steel mills.&lt;ref name="Sol74"&gt;Mark Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity: Communists and African-Americans, 1917-36.'' Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 1998; pg. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for 35 years as a coal miner for the [[Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company]].&lt;ref name="Youth19"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Foster-fordTheCandidatesOfWorkingYouth1932 ''Foster-Ford: The Candidates of Working Youth.''] New York: Young Communist League, n.d. [1932]; pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; James' mother earned additional money for the family as a [[domestic worker]].&lt;ref name="Youth19" /&gt;

Ford got his first job at age 13 working on a railroad track at [[Enslay, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="Youth19" /&gt; He later worked as a blacksmith's helper at a steel plant, a machinist's helper, and as a laborer at a [[blast furnace]].&lt;ref name="Youth20"&gt;''Foster-Ford: The Candidates of Working Youth,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford worked his way through high school before attending [[Fisk University]].&lt;ref name="Sol74" /&gt;

A few months before graduation in 1917, Ford enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] in support of the American war effort in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Youth20" /&gt; He entered the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|signal corps]] in charge of communications for the 86th Brigade of the 92nd Division in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Youth20" /&gt; At the end of the war, Ford was discharged from the Army and returned to civilian life.

Ford returned to an America in which a black man with telecommunications skills was deemed unemployable in his profession because of racism. Many veterans had difficulty finding work soon after the war. Ford ended up taking a job as an unskilled laborer at a mattress factory in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foster-Ford: The Candidates of Working Youth,'' pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford landed a job working for the [[United States Post Office]] as a parcel post dispatcher, joining the [[Union of Communication Workers|Union of Post Office Workers]] at that same time.&lt;ref&gt;''Foster-Ford: The Candidates of Working Youth,'' pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford became active in his union local, activity which put him into contact with the Communist Party for the first time. This union activity in consort with radicals seems to have brought Ford to the attention of his superiors, and he was ultimately fired from his post office job.&lt;ref&gt;''Foster-Ford: The Candidates of Working Youth,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===
{{American socialism}}
In 1925, Ford was recruited into the [[Chicago]] section of the [[American Negro Labor Congress]] (ANLC), established by the Communist Party as a [[mass organization]] of black workers.&lt;ref name="Sol74" /&gt; The next year Ford joined the [[Communist Party USA|Workers (Communist) Party of America]] itself.&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there were few African-American members of the Communist Party in this period, Ford quickly gained recognition as one of the leading black communists in the nation.{{efn|Some prominent black Communists of the day included [[Cyril Briggs]], [[Otto Huiswoud]], [[Harry Haywood]], [[Richard B. Moore]], [[George Padmore]], [[William L. Patterson]], and [[Lovett Fort-Whiteman]]. To these may be added [[Claude McKay]], who was not likely a party member but who was deeply in the Communist Party’s orbit in this period.
Historian Mark Solomon indicates that in 1928 there were just fifty black members of the Communist Party in total, out of a population of twelve million black Americans.&lt;ref&gt;See: Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity,'' pg. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1928 Ford was sent to the [[Soviet Union]] to represent the American Communist Party at the [[4th World Congress of RILU|4th World Congress]] of the [[Red International of Labor Unions]] (RILU), held in [[Moscow]] during March and April.&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt; He was elected to the RILU Secretariat.&lt;ref name="Sol68"&gt;Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity,'' pg. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford did not immediately return to the United States, instead remaining in Moscow to work on RILU matters as a full-time [[functionary]].

In August 1928, Ford attended the [[6th World Congress of the Comintern|6th World Congress]] of the [[Communist International]] on behalf of the American Communist Party, where he was elected to the [[Comintern]]'s Negro Commission.&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt; Ford was also elected a delegate to the 1929 World Congress of the [[League Against Imperialism]], which met in [[Hamburg, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foster-Ford: The Candidates of Working Youth,'' pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1929, Ford attended the [[10th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI|10th Enlarged Plenum]] of the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] (ECCI), at which he delivered two speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Lazitch and Drachkovitch, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern,'' pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Ford attended the 2nd Congress of the [[League Against Imperialism]], where he was elected to the General Council and the Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt;

During the ultra-radical "[[Third Period]]" (1929–1933), many in the Comintern advocated that the American Communist Party launch the controversial [[slogan]] "Self-determination for the Black Belt" — a call for ''de facto'' or even ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty of the broad swath of the American South in which black Americans constituted a demographic majority. Ford considered the question of whether American blacks constituted an “oppressed nationality” to be a largely academic matter, in view of the exceedingly limited contact which the Communist Party had with the black community.&lt;ref name="Sol68" /&gt; The supporters of the ultra-radical idea of "self-determination" for the black people as an "oppressed nationality" (as opposed to fighting for equal rights for an "oppressed racial minority" of Americans) won the day. Thereafter Ford dutifully spoke out on behalf of independence of the American black belt, in accord with the new [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. Within the Black Belt region, most African Americans were more concerned with getting aid for their daily lives: help with evictions, jobs, services, and civil rights.

In 1930 Ford organized the Comintern-sponsored [[1st International Conference of Negro Workers]] in [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]], where he was elected as Secretary of the short-lived [[International Trade Union Committee for Black Workers]] as well as editor of its journal, ''[[The Negro Worker]].''&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt;  There he was supplied with a young mistress (an agent of the Soviet [[State Political Directorate|GPU]]) and a monthly pension from Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Valtin, Jan, ''Out Of The Night: Memoir Of Richard Julius Herman Krebs'', New York: Alliance Book Corporation (1940), pp. 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;  While in Hamburg, Ford participated in distributing copies of ''The Negro Worker'' via couriers to sailors on ships headed to British possessions, including [[Jamaica]] and the Union of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Valtin, Jan, pp. 274-275"&gt;Valtin, Jan, pp. 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to an official protest lodged by the British government, German police raided Ford's headquarters in Hamburg.  After a botched attempt to escape by bicycle, Ford was arrested in a glare of publicity, and was summarily relieved of his political post with the Comintern.&lt;ref name="Valtin, Jan, pp. 274-275"/&gt;

Ford returned to the United States in 1930.{{efn|Historian Mark Naison notes that Ford, "recently returned from the Soviet Union," was a speaker at a party-sponsored demonstration on March 6, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;See: Naison, ''Communists in Harlem During the Depression,'' pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} He assumed the role of Vice President of the League of Struggle for Negro Rights, the organizational successor to ANLC.&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt; In 1932 Ford was elected to the governing Political Buro of the CPUSA. He had become a top political leader of the Communist Party USA.

In 1932 the CPUSA nominated Ford as its candidate for Vice President of the United States, running on the ticket with Presidential nominee [[William Z. Foster]]; this increased his national recognition. He was the first African American to run on a presidential ticket. The placing of a black man near the top of the Communist ticket was symbolic of the party's self-declared commitment to [[racial equality]] and its commitment to advance blacks to its own leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity,'' pg. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Mark Solomon notes that this was part of a broader campaign:
{{cquote|In 1932 the CP ran dozens of black candidates in every region for everything from [[alderman]] and [[mayor]] to [[lieutenant governor]] and [[governor]] to [[member of Congress]]. All the Party candidates stressed the issues of unemployment insurance and racial equality. Getting elected was not a serious goal. Campaigns were 'mass actions,' political sounding boards; in Ford's words, they were a means 'to mobilize workers in the struggle for their immediate needs.' When asked about chances for the Party's black candidates, Ford replied, 'The Communist Party is not stupid; we know that better than 4 million Negroes in this country cannot vote...and besides this, there is a great anti-Negro sentiment which the Party goes up against when it puts forth Negroes as their candidates.'"&lt;ref name="Sol218"&gt;Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity,'' pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In all, the Foster-Ford ticket tallied 102,991 votes in 1932 — a tiny total but a major step forward when gauged against the organization's performance during its first two electoral efforts in 1924 and 1928.&lt;ref name="Sol218" /&gt;

In 1933 Ford was made the new head of the [[Harlem]] Section of the Communist Party in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity,'' pg. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended both to tighten party discipline in the organization and to lessen the influence of the more freewheeling, nationalist-inclined agitators such as [[Cyril Briggs]] and [[Richard B. Moore]]. The ultra-left “Third Period” slogan of “Self-determination for [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|the Black Belt]]” was drawing to a close, in favor of a new effort to build bridges with [[Liberalism|liberals]] and fighting for the solution of practical problems through the [[New Deal]]. The Harlem Communists sought to join with church and civic groups in a “Provisional Committee against Discrimination” in an effort to eliminate racism in job hiring and firing.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity,'' pg. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; Building the so-called “Popular Front” would be the new slogan of the day.

====1935 Harlem riot and its aftermath====
{{main|Harlem riot of 1935}}
On March 19, 1935, Harlem was torn by a riot, caused when a manager at a [[S. H. Kress &amp; Co.|Kress]] store on 125th Street grabbed a black teenager for allegedly stealing a knife. The boy was dragged into the basement by police before being released through a back door. Black customers believed the boy was being beaten, however, and a rumor started to spread that the boy had been killed. An angry crowd formed, a rock was thrown through the [[chain store]] window, and police broke up the spontaneous street meeting that had developed. Within an hour, not a window was left intact on 125th Street and rampant looting had broken out. In the end, one African American was killed, several others injured, and more than 200 were jailed in the so-called "Harlem Race Riot."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity,'' pp. 272-273.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the immediate response of the press was to blame the Communists for fomenting racial unrest, two months of hearings followed in which Ford's Harlem Section of the Communist Party was able to highlight the area’s economic and social plight. The Communist Party established connections with a number of the area's labor, religious, and political leaders in the aftermath of the March 19th event.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, ''The Cry Was Unity,'' pg. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

As historian Mark Naison notes:
{{cquote|During the next two months, the Harlem Party concentrated the efforts of its best organizers on the Mayor's Commission hearings. The commission divided its work among six subcommittees dealing with major problems in Harlem: crime and police, health and hospitals, housing and recreation, education, discrimination in employment, and discrimination in relief. A total of twenty-five hearings took place under the auspices of these bodies, and the Party used them to present a detailed analysis of discrimination against Harlem residents, backed up by rigorous cross-examination of employers and city officials.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"The Party's activities at the hearings helped strengthen its ties with other Harlem organizations. The representatives of Harlem 'labor unions, trade associations, religious, social and political organizations' that came to the hearings shared many of the same concerns about racial problems in New York as Party organizers and cooperated with them closely in exposing Harlem conditions. In style and educational background, the leading black Communists at the hearings, James Ford, Merrill Work, Abner Barry, Ben Davis, [[Williana Burroughs]], and Louise Thompson, had much in common with the middle-class Harlem civic leades who also testified. Although Communists openly used the hearings as a platform for their political views, they tried to maintain a level of professionalism in the presentation of evidence that would command the respect of their black allies and the Commission."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Naison, ''Communists in Harlem during the Depression.'' Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1983; pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====End of 1930s onwards====
In the summer of 1935 Ford was sent by the CPUSA to the [[7th World Congress of the Comintern]] as a delegate, where he was elected an alternate member of ECCI.&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt; In 1936, Ford was nominated on the CPUSA’s ticket as its Vice Presidential candidate, running this time with the CPUSA's General Secretary, [[Earl Browder]].

Ford traveled to [[Spain]] in 1937 along with other American Communists in support of the Republican forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt;

In 1940 the Communist Party supported the Browder/Ford ticket again, the third and final time James Ford appeared in that capacity.

Earl Browder, reading too much into the dissolution of the Communist International in May 1943 and the wartime alliance of the Soviet Union with America, dissolved the Communist Party in 1944. He replaced it with a "Communist Political Association" in an effort to make the organization more mainstream within the United States. James Ford was chosen as the Vice President of this new formation. When in April 1945 Moscow signaled its intense displeasure in the decision to dissolve the Communist Party, Browder was cashiered, and expelled from the reconstituted party in July.&lt;ref&gt;Lazitch and Drachkovitch, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern,'' pp. 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ford made a public [[self-criticism]] of his alleged errors, he was demoted from the top echelon of Communist Party leaders. He was not re-elected to the National Committee of the party and was supplanted in his ''[[de facto]]'' role as “America's leading black Communist” by [[Benjamin J. Davis]].

Ford was not targeted by the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] in its 1948 prosecution of the top leadership of the CPUSA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3884">'''Johann Jakob Bernhardi''' (1 September 1774 in [[Erfurt]] – 13 May 1850 in Erfurt) was a German doctor and [[botanist]].

==Biography==
Johann J. Bernhardi studied Medicine and Botany at the [[University of Erfurt]], and after graduation practiced medicine for a time in his native city. In 1799 he was named director of the [[botanical garden]] at ''Gartenstraße'', and in 1809 was appointed professor of botany, zoology, mineralogy and [[materia medica]] at the university.&lt;ref name=DE&gt;[http://www.erfurt.de/mam/ef/service/mediathek/publikationen/amtsblatt/2004/abl_2004_24.pdf Amtsblatt Nr. 24 vom 24.12.2004 - Erfurt]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as director of the botanical garden until his death in 1850, being buried in the central avenue of this botanical garden.

Throughout his life thanks to acquisitions and interchanges with other botanists, he assembled a considerable [[herbarium]] of 60,000 plants with specimens from North America, South America, Asia, and Africa. After his death this herbarium did not remain in [[Germany]] but due to the efforts of [[George Engelmann]], who, in 1857, shortly after the death of Bernhardi bought the complete herbarium for the amount of 600 dollars for [[Henry Shaw (philanthropist)|Henry Shaw]], founder of the [[Missouri Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden of Missouri]] in the U.S.A., forms the nucleus of the collection and the initial museum of this Botanical Garden (at the moment the "Missouri Botanical Garden herbarium" contains over 6.2 million specimens and the library over 120,000 volumes).

Johann J. Bernhardi studied and described several species of [[orchid]]s, including ''[[Epipactis atrorubens]]''. He described a species of rose without thorns, ''Rosa × francofurtana'', found in the garden of the house of Johann Wolfgang von [[Goethe]] in [[Weimar]]. The genus ''Bernhardia'' (family [[Psilotaceae]]) is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A68qyOyhOdkC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=%22Johann+Jakob+Bernhardi%22+Erfurt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BPQKfCSBkQ&amp;sig=3qYkTvPD01rqvSC2KtmwrVljRf4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LS8qUrS3MuGriAKVioH4Cg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Johann%20Jakob%20Bernhardi%22%20Erfurt&amp;f=false CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms] by Umberto Quattrocchi&lt;/ref&gt;

He was editor of the ''Thüringischen Gartenzeitung'' (Thuringian garden newspaper) and the ''Allgemeinen deutschen Gartenmagazin'' (General German garden magazine).&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Bernhardi,_Johann_Jakob translated biography] @ [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]&lt;/ref&gt; The thoroughfare, ''Jacob-Bernhardi-Straße'' in Erfurt, is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=DE/&gt;

In Los Angeles, Mantle became a member of the band ''Sex with Lurch'', which was formed by singer Robbie Quinne and guitarist Bernard Yin. As part of the group, Mantle used the stage name "Brandy Warhol". The group disbanded in December 2002.

Mantle was also a member of the band Tranzkuntinental.

Currently, Mantle is a member of the band the Rollz Royces with [[Tammie Brown]] and Michael Catti.

In 2014 Mantle starred in ''[[Confessions of a Womanizer]]'' with [[Gary Busey]]. The film was released in 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14487">'''Liu Congxiao''' ({{zh|t=留從效|poj=Liû Chiông-hāu}}; 906-962), formally the '''Prince of Jinjiang''' ({{zh|t=晉江王|poj=Chìn-kang-ông}}), was a general of the [[History of China|Chinese]] [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period]] state [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]].  After Min's fall, he initially submitted to [[Southern Tang]] (which had conquered Min), but eventually, taking advantage of Southern Tang's inability to fully control the region, took the southern part of the former Min realm under his own control, albeit in nominal submission to Southern Tang.  After Southern Tang's repeated defeats by [[Later Zhou]], he also nominally submitted to Later Zhou's successor state [[Song dynasty|Song]].

== Background ==
Liu Congxiao was born in 906, at the very end of the [[Tang dynasty]].  He was from Yongchn (永春, in modern [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]]), which was known as Taolin (桃林) early in his lifetime.  His father Liu Zhang (留璋) died in his youth, and he became known for serving his mother and older brother piously.  He was said to be somewhat educated in literature, and was a particularly avid reader of military strategies.&lt;ref name=HS483&gt;''[[History of Song]]'', [[:zh:s:宋史/卷483|vol. 483]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SGCQ93&gt;''[[Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/06080963.cn#page/n64/mode/2up vol. 93].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rebellion against Zhu Wenjin and subsequent service to Yin/Min ==
As of 944, Liu Congxiao was serving as an army officer in the army of his home prefecture Quan Prefecture (泉州, in modern Quanzhou).  By that time, the state that Quan had been ruled by, [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]], ruled by the imperial Wang family, had been broken apart by civil war and political strife—and now was under the reign of the usurper general [[Zhu Wenjin]] (who had assassinated the emperor [[Wang Yanxi|Wang Xi]] (Emperor Jingzong), with Zhu's hold on the throne being Min contested by Wang Xi's brother [[Wang Yanzheng]], who had earlier declared himself emperor of a breakaway state of [[Yin (Ten Kingdoms)|Yin]].&lt;ref name=ZZTJ284&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷284|vol. 284]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After seizing the Min throne, Zhu sent the general Huang Shaopo (黃紹頗) to Quan to serve as its prefect.  Liu, however, was discontented, and he stated to his colleagues Wang Zhongshun (王忠順), Dong Si'an (董思安), and [[Zhang Hansi]]:&lt;ref name=ZZTJ284/&gt;

{{quote|Zhu Wenjin slaughtered the Wangs and sent his confidants to take over the prefectures.  We have, for generations, received the grace of the Wangs, but we stand by and serve the bandits.  If the Prince of Fusha [(i.e., Wang Yanzheng, who carried the title of Prince of Fusha before declaring himself emperor)] were to capture Fu Prefecture [(福州, in modern [[Fuzhou]], [[Fujian]], Min's capital, then ruled by Zhu)], even death cannot be sufficient for our shame!}}

His colleagues agreed.  In winter 944, they held a feast at Liu's house, and they gathered the soldiers below them whom they deemed reliable and strong.  Liu spoke to them and stated (falsely, as it stood):&lt;ref name=ZZTJ284/&gt;

{{quote|The Prince of Fusha has captured Fu Prefecture.  He secretly sent us orders to attack Huang Shaopo.  I see that you, gentlemen, have appearances that are not suitable for being poor for long.  If you follow my words, riches and honors will come to you.  If not, disaster will come.}}

The soldiers became roused by his words and followed him in attacking Huang.  They climbed over the walls of the headquarters and killed Huang.  Liu then took the prefectural government seal and presented it to Wang Jixun (王繼勳), a nephew of Wang Yanzheng's who resided at Quan, asking Wang Jixun to serve as acting prefect.  Liu himself took the title of "Commander of the Army Against the Bandits" (平賊統軍使).  He boxed Huang's head and had the officer [[Chen Hongjin]] deliver it to Wang Yanzheng's capital Jian Prefecture (建州, in modern [[Nanping]], [[Fujian]]).  Wang Yanzheng commissioned Wang Jixun to be the prefect of Quan, and Liu, Wang Zhongshun, Dong, and Chen to be commanders of the army.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ284/&gt;

Hearing of Huang's death, Zhu sent the generals Lin Shouliang (林守諒) and Li Ting'e (李廷鍔) to attack Quan.  Wang Yanzheng, hearing the news, sent the general Du Jin (杜進) to aid the Quan army.  However, even before Du arrived, Liu led the Quan army and engaged Zhu's army, killing Lin in battle and capturing Li.  Subsequently, Zhu was assassinated by his officer Li Renhan (李仁翰), who surrendered Fu to Wang Yanzheng, who then took the title of Emperor of Min.  However, a subsequent rebellion led by [[Li Renda]] at Fu wrested that region away from Wang Yanzheng, and Wang Yanzheng's capital Jian Prefecture then came under attack by the Southern Tang general Cha Wenhui (查文徽).  During the Jian siege, Wang Yanzheng ordered Quan to send a 5,000-men detachment to Jian to help defend the city; that detachment was commanded by Dong and Wang Zhongshun.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ284/&gt;

== As Southern Tang subject ==
In fall 945, Jian fell to Southern Tang forces, and Wang Yanzheng surrendered.  (Wang Zhongshun died in the battle, and Dong Si'an took the remnants of his army and fled back to Quan.)  Initially, virtually the entire former Min domain submitted to Southern Tang's emperor [[Li Jing (Southern Tang)|Li Jing]], including even Li Renda, who, however, continued to hold actual control of the Fu region.  In spring 946, Liu Congxiao, alleging that, given the threats posed by Li Renda's army and that Wang Jixun was alienating the Quan soldiers by improper rewards and punishments, forced him to yield the command to Liu himself.  Liu himself then attacked and defeated Li Renda in a battle, and then reported the news of the victory to Li Jing.  Li Jing summoned Wang Jixun to the Southern Tang capital [[Nanjing|Jinling]] and commissioned Liu as the prefect of Quan, but also sent a detachment to Quan, apparently to both help defend it and to watch over Liu.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ285&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷285|vol. 285]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 946, the Zhang Prefecture (漳州, in modern [[Zhangzhou]], [[Fujian]]) officer Lin Zanyao (林贊堯) rebelled against Southern Tang and killed the general Chen Hui (陳誨), whom Li Jing had sent to Zhang, and Chen's monitor of the army Zhou Chengyi (周承義).  Liu launched an army and expelled Lin from Zhang; he had Dong take over Zhang.  Li Jing then commissioned Dong as the prefect of Zhang.  (After Dong declined the position on grounds of [[naming taboo]]—because his father was named Dong Zhang (董章)—Li Jing renamed the prefecture Nan Prefecture (南州), and so Dong accepted.)&lt;ref name=ZZTJ285/&gt;

Meanwhile, Li Renda had refused to yield actual control of Fu, leading to a Southern Tang expedition against him, commanded by the general Wang Chongwen (王崇文).  Li Renda sought aid from [[Wuyue]]'s king [[Qian Hongzuo]].  Meanwhile, Li Jing ordered Dong and Liu to lead forces to reinforce Wang Chongwen.  It was said, though, that partly as a result of that, Wang's army was bogged down and unable to siege the city effectively—as both Liu and Wang Jianfeng (王建封) were arrogant and not following Wang Chongwen's orders, while the civilian officials [[Chen Jue (Southern Tang)|Chen Jue]], [[Feng Yanlu]], and Wei Cen (魏岑) were also disrupting Wang Chongwen's command structure.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ285/&gt;  In spring 947, the joint forces of Li Renda and Wuyue defeated the Southern Tang siege army, which then scattered—apparently, as a result of both Liu and Wang Jianfeng not wanting to see the army regroup and take Fu—ending Southern Tang's attempt to take actual control over Fu.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ286&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷286|vol. 286]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu returned to Quan, and then held a feast for the commanding general of the Southern Tang detachment, stating to him:&lt;ref name=ZZTJ286/&gt;

{{quote|Quan and Fu Prefectures are long-time enemies.  To the south are the mountains, the seas, and the disease-stricken lands.  Due to the years-long campaigns, agriculture and sericulture have both been abandoned, and the revenues from winter and summer taxes are only sufficient for Quan itself.  How can it be permissible that we make an army stay here to help us?}}

Seeing that Liu was effectively wanting to chase him out, the Southern Tang general found no choice but to take his army and leave Quan.  Li Jing could not think of a way to control Liu, and therefore had to be content with keeping him nominally as a subject, and granted him the honorary title of acting ''Taifu'' (太傅).&lt;ref name=ZZTJ286/&gt;

In 949, Liu's older brother Liu Congyuan (留從願), who was serving as Dong's deputy at Nan (Zhang), poisoned Dong to death and took over the control of the prefecture.  Li Jing, finding no good way to deal with the situation, established a [[Qingyuan Jiedushi|Qingyuan Circuit]] with its headquarters at Quan, and made Liu its military governor (''[[Jiedushi]]'').&lt;ref name=ZZTJ288&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷288|vol. 288]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Not long after, he granted Liu honorary [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] designations, and created him the Duke of E.  Later, that title was upgraded to Prince of Jinjiang.&lt;ref name=HS483/&gt;

Liu was said to be frugal and hardworking as the ruler of the region.  He usually wore civilian clothes, and placed his prefect uniform on at the door of his headquarters, putting it on only when he was to hear official matters and taking it off whenever unnecessary, to show humility and attentiveness to his civilian origin.  Wang Yanzheng had two daughters who lived at Quan because they had married men from there, and Liu honored and treated them well.  He also made sure that each year, knowledgeable individuals were selected for the [[imperial examination]]s.&lt;ref name=HS483/&gt;

In 958, during a campaign that Southern Tang's northern neighbor [[Later Zhou]] was waging against Southern Tang, Liu had his officer Cai Zhongyun (蔡仲贇), disguised as a merchant, travel to Later Zhou to submit a petition to be the subject of Later Zhou's emperor [[Chai Rong|Guo Rong]].  However, soon the war ended (with Li Jing ceding the territory north of the [[Yangtze River]] to Later Zhou and submitting to Guo as a subject), and when Liu submitted another petition, asking to establish a liaison office at Later Zhou's capital [[Kaifeng]] and directly submitting to Later Zhou.  Guo, citing the fact that Li Jing had already submitted and that Liu had been a long-time Southern Tang subject, refused, instead encouraging him to remain faithful to Li Jing.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ294&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷294|vol. 294]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== As dual subject to Southern Tang and Song ==
In 960, the Later Zhou general [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Zhao Kuangyin]] seized the throne from Guo Rong's son and successor [[Chai Zongxun|Guo Zongxun]], ending Later Zhou and starting a new [[Song dynasty]] as its Emperor Taizu.  Later in the year, Liu Congxiao submitted a petition to the new Song emperor, offering to be a subject,&lt;ref name=XZZTJ1&gt;''[[Xu Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:續資治通鑑/卷001|vol. 1]].&lt;/ref&gt; and thereafter offered tributes.&lt;ref name=HS483/&gt;  Around the same time, though, Li Jing, while also offering to be a Song vassal but fearing the possibility of Song military action against Southern Tang, decided to move his capital from Jinling to [[Nanchang]],&lt;ref name=XZZTJ1/&gt; and did so in 961.&lt;ref name=XZZTJ2&gt;''Xu Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:續資治通鑑/卷002|vol. 2]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Liu, however, thought that movement of the capital was targeting him and feared a Southern Tang campaign against him, and therefore sent his nephew Liu Shaoji (留紹錤) to offer tributes to Li, while at the same time continued to send tributes to the Song emperor through Wuyue.  The Song emperor sent an emissary, intending to comfort him, but before the emissary could arrive in Liu's territory, Liu had died from a tumor on his back,&lt;ref name=HS483/&gt; apparently in 962.&lt;ref name=XZZTJ2/&gt;  Li Jing's son and successor [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|Li Yu]] bestowed posthumous honors on him.&lt;ref name=HS483/&gt;

As Liu Congxiao was sonless, he adopted both Liu Shaoji and another nephew, [[Liu Shaozi]] (both of them biological sons of Liu Congyuan) as his sons.&lt;ref name=HS483/&gt;  The ''[[Xu Zizhi Tongjian]]'' indicated that after his death, as Liu Shaoji was at the Southern Tang court, Liu Shaozi took over as acting military governor, but was soon seized by the officer [[Chen Hongjin]], who falsely accused Liu Shaozi of wanting to submit to Wuyue and delivered Liu Shaozi to Southern Tang, while supporting Zhang Hansi as the new acting military governor.&lt;ref name=XZZTJ2/&gt;  Liu Congxiao's biography in the ''[[History of Song]]'', however, gave a different account—that the coup took place while Liu Congxiao was ill but before his death—but its biography of Chen gave the same account as the ''Xu Zizhi Tongjian'' (i.e., the coup was during Liu Shaozi's rule).&lt;ref name=HS483/&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Mahāvatār Bābājī''' (literally; Great [[Avatar]] [[Indian_honorifics#Replacement type|(Revered) Father or Elder or Wise]]) is the name given to an Indian [[saint]] and [[yogi]] by [[Lahiri Mahasaya|Yogiraj Lahiri Mahasaya]],  
and several of his disciples,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], Baba Nasib Singh Ji, Ram Gopal Muzumdar, Swami Kebalananda, and Swami Pranabananda Giri&lt;/ref&gt; who reported meeting him between 1861, 1935 and 1980. Some of these meetings were described by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] in his book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', including a first-hand report of Yogananda's own meeting with the yogi.&lt;ref name=yogananda&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa, ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-56589-212-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another first hand account was given by [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]] in his book ''[[The Holy Science]]''.&lt;ref name=yukteswar&gt;Yukteswar Giri, ''The Holy Science''. Yogoda Satsanga Society, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sri Madhukarnath|Sri M]]'s autobiography (Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master), Babaji was Lord [[Shiva]]. In the second last chapter of his book, he mentions Babaji changing his form to that of Lord Shiva. All of these accounts, along with additional reported meetings, are described in various biographies.&lt;ref name=pranabananda&gt;Mukhopadyay, Jnananedranath, ''Srimad Swami Pranabananda Giri'', Sri Jnananedranath Mukhopadyay Property Trust, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yukteswarbio&gt;[[Swami Satyananda Giri|Satyananda Giri]],  [http://www.yoganiketan.net ''Swami Sri Yukteshvar Giri Maharaj'', from ''A collection of biographies of 4 Kriya Yoga gurus''], iUniverse Inc. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-595-38675-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lahiribio&gt; [http://www.yoganiketan.net 'Satyananda Giri, Swami, Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasay'', from ''A collection of biographies of 4 Kriya Yoga gurus''], iUniverse Inc. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-595-38675-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;                                                                       According to Yogananda's autobiography, Babaji has resided for at least hundreds of years in the remote Himalayan regions of India, seen in person by only a small number of disciples and others.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name="it"&gt;indiatoday.intoday.in {{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/the-unknown-siddha-babaji/1/657901.html |title=Mahavatar Babaji: The unknown 'immortal yogi'|date= |accessdate=2017-08-30 |work= |first= |last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Again, according to his autobiography, shortly before Yogananda left for America in 1920, Babaji came to his home in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], where Yogananda sat deeply praying for divine assurance regarding the mission he was about to undertake. Babaji said to him: "Follow the behest of your guru and go to America. Fear not; you shall be protected. You are the one I have chosen to spread the message of [[Kriya Yoga]] in the West."&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;

==Childhood==

There are very few accounts of Babaji's childhood.  One source of information is the book ''Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga tradition'' by [[Marshall Govindan|Marshal Govindan]].&lt;ref name="Govindan2001"&gt;{{cite book |title=Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga tradition |last=Govindan |first=Marshall |date=1 January 2001
|publisher=Babaji's Kriya Yoga Publications |isbn=978-1-895383-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Govindan, Babaji was named Nagarajan (king of serpents) by his parents. &lt;ref name=it/&gt; V.T. Neelakantan and S.A.A. Ramaiah founded on 17 October 1952, (they claim – at the request of Babaji) a new organization, "Kriya Babaji Sangah," dedicated to the teaching of Babaji's Kriya Yoga. They claim that in 1953 Mahavatar Babaji told them that he was born on 30 November 203 CE in a small coastal village now known as [[Parangipettai]], [[Cuddalore district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], India.&lt;ref name="NeelakantanRamaiah2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Neelakantan |first1=V. T. |last2=Ramaiah |first2=S. A. A. |author3=Babaji |title=The voice of Babaji: a trilogy on Kriya Yoga |year=2006 |publisher=Babaji's Kriya Yoga Order of Acharyas |isbn=978-1-895383-23-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babaji's Kriya Yoga Order of Acharyas Trust (Kriya Babaji Sangah) and their branch organizations claim his place and date of birth.&lt;ref name="NeelakantanRamaiah2006"/&gt; He was a disciple of [[Bogar]] and his birth name is Nagarajan.&lt;ref name="Govindan2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NeelakantanRamaiah2006" /&gt;

In Paramahansa Yogananda's ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', many references are made to Mahavatar Babaji, including from Lahirī Mahasaya and [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri|Sri Yukteswar]].&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;
In his book ''[[The Second Coming of Christ (Yogananda)|The Second Coming of Christ]]'', Yogananda states that [[Jesus in India|Jesus Christ went to India]] and conferred with Mahavatar Babaji.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; This would make Babaji at least 2000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |authorlink= |title=The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You p. |year=2004 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-87612-555-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Govindan's book, Babaji Nagaraj's father was the priest of the village's temple. Babaji revealed only those details which he believed to be formative as well as potentially instructive to his disciples. Govindan mentioned one incident like this: "One time Nagaraj's mother had got one rare [[jackfruit]] for a family feast and put it aside. Babaji was only 4 years old at that time. He found the jackfruit when his mother was not around and ate it all. When his mother came to know about it, she flew in blind rage and stuffed a cloth inside Babaji's mouth, nearly suffocating him, but he survived. Later on he thanked God for showing him that she was to be loved without attachment or illusion. His Love for his mother became unconditional and detached."&lt;ref name="Govindan2001"/&gt;

When Nagaraj was about 5 years old, someone kidnapped him and sold him as a slave in Calcutta (now [[Kolkata]]). His new owner however was a kind man and he freed Nagaraj shortly thereafter. Nagaraj then joined a small group of wandering [[Sannyasa|sannyāsin]] due to their radiant faces and love for God. During the next few years, he wandered from place to place, studying holy scriptures like the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishad]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Quest for Self-realization==
According to Marshall Govindan's book, at the age of eleven, he made a difficult journey on foot and by boat with a group of ascetics to [[Kataragama]], Sri Lanka. Nagaraj met [[Siddha]] [[Bhogarnathar]] and became his disciple. Nagaraj performed intensive yogic [[sadhana]] for a long time with him. Bhogarnathar inspired Nagaraj to seek his initiation into Kriya Kundalini Pranayam from Siddha [[ Maharshi Agastya]]. Babaji became a disciple of Siddha Agastya. Nagaraj was initiated into the secrets of Kriya Kundalini Pranayama or "Vasi Yogam". Babaji made a long pilgrimage to [[Badrinath]] and spent eighteen months practising yogic [[kriya]] taught to him by Siddha Agastya and Bhogarnathar. Babaji attained self-realization shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Govindan2001"/&gt;

It is claimed that these revelations were made by Babaji himself to S.A.A. Ramaiah, a young graduate student in geology at the University of Madras and V.T. Neelakantan, a famous journalist, and close student of [[Annie Besant]], President of the Theosophical Society and mentor of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]]. Babaji was said to have appeared to each of them independently and then brought them together to work for his Mission in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Babaji's Kriya Yoga |url=http://www.babajiskriyayoga.net/english/about-babaji.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports of meetings, 1861–1980==

===Shyāmacharan Lahirī===
{{Main article|Lahiri Mahasaya}}
The first reported encounter with Mahavatar Babaji was in 1861, when Shyāmacharan Lahirī (called "Mahāsaya" by disciples, devotees, and admirers) was posted to [[Ranikhet]] in his work as an accountant for the British government. One day while walking in the hills of [[Dunagiri]] above Ranikhet, he heard a voice calling his name. Following the voice up the mountain, he met a "tall, divinely radiant [[sadhu]]."&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt; He was amazed to find that the sadhu knew his name.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt; This sadhu was Mahavatar Babaji.

Mahavatar Babaji told Lahirī that he was his guru from the past, then initiated him into [[Kriya Yoga]] and instructed Lahiri to initiate others. Lahiri wanted to remain with Mahavatar Babaji, who told him instead that he must return to the world to teach Kriya Yoga and that "Kriya Yoga [[sadhana]] would spread through the people of the world through his (Lahiri's) presence in the world."&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt;

Lahirī reported that Mahavatar Babaji did not give his name or background, so Lahiri gave him the title "Mahavatar Babaji." Many sadhus in India are called Babaji, and sometimes even "Babaji Maharaj", which has caused confusion between Mahavatar Babaji and other sadhus with similar names.&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt;

Lahirī had many meetings with Mahavatar Babaji, recounted in several books, including Paramhansa Yogananda's ''Autobiography of a Yogi'',&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt; ''Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya'' (Lahiri's biography),&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt; and ''Purana Purusha: Yogiraj Sri Shama Churn Lahiri'',&lt;ref name=purana&gt;Chatterjee, Ashoke Kumar, ''Purana Purusha: Yogiraj Sri Shama Churn Lahiri''. Yogiraj Publications, 2004. {{ISBN|81-87563-01-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

There are references to Sri Lahiri Mahasaya in Sampoorna Sripada Vallabha Charitam as guru to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sri Shirdi Saibaba]], who initiated him to kriya yoga.

===Disciples of Shyāmacharan Lahirī===

Several disciples of Shyāmacharan Lahirī also reported having met Babaji. Through discussion with each other, and the fact that some of these encounters included two or more witnesses, they confirmed that the person they saw was the same sadhu that Lahirī called Mahavatar Babaji.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt;&lt;ref name=kebalanandabio&gt;{{cite book |last=Giri |first=Satyananda |title=Yogacharya Shastri Mahasaya: a short biographical sketch of Hamsaswami Kebalanandaji Maharaj |publisher=Yoganiketan |year=2004 |url=http://www.yoganiketan.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1894 [[Kumbha Mela]] in Allahabad, [[Yukteswar Giri]], a disciple of Lahirī, met Mahavatar Babaji. He was struck by the resemblance between Lahirī and Mahavatar Babaji.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=yukteswarbio/&gt; Others who met Babaji also commented on the resemblance.&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt; It was at this meeting that Mahavatar Babaji instructed Sri Yukteswar to write the book that was to become ''Kaivalya Darshanam'', or ''[[The Holy Science]]''.&lt;ref name=yukteswar/&gt; Yukteswar had two more meetings with Mahavatar Babaji, including one in the presence of Lahiri Mahasaya.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=yukteswarbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt;

Pranabananda Giri, another disciple of Lahirī, also met Mahavatar Babaji in the presence of Lahirī, at Lahirī's home. Pranabananda asked Mahavatar Babaji his age. Mahavatar Babaji responded that he was about 500 years old at that time.&lt;ref name=pranabananda/&gt;

Keshabananda, a disciple of Lahirī, tells of meeting Mahavatar Babaji in the mountains near [[Badrinath]] around 1935, after he became lost wandering in the mountains.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt; At that meeting, Pranabananda reported that Babaji gave him a message for Paramahansa Yogananda, that "I won't see him this time, as he is eagerly hoping; but I shall see him on some other occasion."&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt; In his book ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', Paramahansa Yogananda wrote that Mahavatar Babaji visited him before his journey to America and addressed him saying, "You are the one I have chosen to spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West."&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;

Other disciples of Lahirī who reported meetings with Mahavatar Babaji include Kebalananda Giri&lt;ref name=kebalanandabio/&gt; and Ram Gopal Muzumdar, who recounted meeting Mahavatar Babaji and his sister, whom he called Mataji.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt; In addition, a disciple of [[Trailanga Swami]], Shankari Mata (also called Shankari Mai [[-ji|Jiew]]) met Mahavatar Babaji while visiting Lahiri Mahasaya.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=lahiribio/&gt;

===Baba Nasib Singh Ji===

Babaji was seen by Baba Nasib Singh Ji, when he was saved by Mahavatar Babaji when he was suffering from blood cancer. Babaji told him that his divine plan is to serve the needy. Babaji also gave him a divine staff that was able to cure the miseries of people. Babaji said to him: "Follow my instructions and serve the ones who are in need, with this divine staff you will be able to help others and cure them. You have my divine blessings. I will be always with you whenever you will need my help." {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Traditional legends==
[[File:Altar-Langerringen.jpg|350px|thumb|Altar of the meditation circle Langerringen near Augsburg in Bavaria, Germany. Group of Self-Realization Fellowship.]] 
Legendary powers and age have been attributed to Mahavatar Babaji by the disciples of Lahirī. These stories have led many to believe that Mahavatar Babaji is a legendary person, rather than a real sadhu that was seen by numerous witnesses from 1861 to 1935.

Paramahansa Yogananda, in his Autobiography, described Mahavatar Babaji's role on earth &lt;ref name=it/&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Mahavatar is in constant communion with Christ; together they send out vibrations of redemption, and have planned the spiritual technique of salvation for this age. The work of these two {{Sic|?|hide=y|fully|-}}illumined masters–one with the body, and one without it–is to inspire the nations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds, religious sectarianism, and the boomerang-evils of materialism. Babaji is well aware of the trend of modern times, especially of the influence and complexities of Western civilization, and realizes the necessity of spreading the self-liberations of yoga equally in the West and in the East.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, Babaji is reputed to be ageless, according to some accounts, and about 500 years old around the late 1800s, according to Pranabananda.&lt;ref name=pranabananda/&gt; Yogananda reports that, according to the disciples of Lahirī, nobody knows Babaji's age, family, place of birth, true name, or other details "dear to the annalist's heart."&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;

According to Yogananda's autobiography, he has a sister called Mataji (meaning "Holy Mother") who also has lived throughout the centuries. &lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{cite web |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism / Self Realisation Fellowship / Page: 781|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=kzPgCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA781&amp;dq=Mahavatar+Babaji+hinduism&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhrdXh04DWAhXQY1AKHdykCpwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mahavatar%20Babaji%20hinduism&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7007-1267-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her level of spiritual attainment is comparable to her brother's, and she lives in a state of spiritual ecstasy in an underground cave. Although only three pages in the book are dedicated to her, she is described by Ram Gopal as "young and surpassingly lovely" as well as a "glorious woman."&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;

Yogananda frequently prayed out loud to "Babaji-Krishna."&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa: various articles (''Praecepta Lessons'', Volume 1, 1934) and recordings (''One Life Versus Reincarnation'' [CD]. {{ISBN|0-87612-439-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern claims and popular references==
[[File:Shri Mahavatar Babaji statue at Babajisannidhan, Bangalore.jpg|thumb|300px|Statue of Mahavatar Babaji at Babajisannidhan, Bangalore, India]]
Mahavatar Babaji was one of the many people featured on the cover of The Beatles' 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. He can also be seen on the cover of [[George Harrison]]'s 1974 album ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]''.&lt;ref name="beatles"&gt;cnn.com {{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/31/entertainment/sgt-pepper-cover-anniversary-trnd/index.html |title=How the 'Sgt.

In Book 3 of ''[[Conversations with God]]'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is mentioned that Babaji may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like Lazarus, Jesus and others.&lt;ref&gt;Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Ultimate Journey'' (1994) by [[Robert Monroe]], the author visits a person through his astral projection (although no name is mentioned) who turns out to have lived one single life for 1800 years, which would suggest that he was born around 203 CE.

The 2002 [[Tamil film]] ''[[Baba (2002 film)|Baba]]'' written by [[Rajinikanth]] was based on Babaji.
[[Swami Maheshwarananda]] writes in his book ''The hidden power in humans'', that the Guru of the legendary Babaji is Sri Alakh Puriji.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Maheshwarananda]], ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag, page 245. {{ISBN|3-85052-197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan master: a yogi's autobiography'' (2010), [[Sri M]] (Mumtaz Ali) narrates his meeting with Babaji near Neelkant hill.&lt;ref&gt;Sri M (Mumtaz Ali), ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan master: a yogi's autobiography'', Magenta Press, 2010, {{ISBN|81-910096-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Sri M gave description of Babaji as golden complexioned, bare-bodied, except for a shining white loin cloth that barely reached the knees, and flowing brown hair that fell to his shoulders. He mentioned that a lovely scent emanated from Babaji and he looked divine. In the second last chapter of his book, he mentions that Babji himself was Lord Shiva. He describes seeing Babaji changing his form to Lord Shiva again and again. He also mentions that Sai Baba, Jesus, Guru Nanak and many others were disciples of Mahavatar Babaji.

Songwriter [[Roger Hodgson]] of English rock band [[Supertramp]] composed a song called 'Babaji' in reference to Mahavatar Babaji. This song is recorded on their 1977 album ''[[Even in the Quietest Moments...]]''

'''Marion Cecilia Davies''' (née Douras, January 3, 1897 – September 22, 1961) was an American film actress, producer, screenwriter, and philanthropist.

Davies had appeared in several Broadway musicals and one film, ''[[Runaway Romany]]'' (1917) before newspaper tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]], with whom she had begun a romantic relationship, took over management of her career. Hearst financed Davies' pictures and promoted her heavily through his newspapers and Hearst Newsreels. He founded [[Cosmopolitan Productions|Cosmopolitan Pictures]] to produce her films. Hearst preferred to see her in historical dramas, but her real talent was in comedy. For this reason, Davies is often remembered today as Hearst's [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] and the hostess of many lavish events for the [[Hollywood]] elite. In particular, her name is linked with the 1924 scandal aboard Hearst's yacht when one of his guests, film producer [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]], died.

In the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), the title character's second wife—an untalented singer whom he tries to promote—was widely assumed to be based on Davies. But many commentators, including ''Citizen Kane'' writer/director [[Orson Welles]] himself, have defended Davies' record as a gifted actress, to whom Hearst's patronage did more harm than good. She retired from the screen in 1937, choosing to devote herself to Hearst and charitable work.

In Hearst's declining years, Davies provided financial as well as emotional support until his death in 1951. She married for the first time eleven weeks after his death, a marriage which lasted until Davies died of [[stomach cancer]] in 1961 at the age of 64.

==Early life==
Davies was born '''Marion Cecilia Elizabeth Brooklyn Douras'''&lt;ref&gt;The name is sometimes spelled "Marion Cecilia Dourvas" in biographies. In her autobiography, it is spelled "Douras," as it appears in the 1900 U.S. Census when they lived in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; on January 3, 1897, in [[Brooklyn]], the youngest of five children born to Bernard J. Douras (1857–1935), a lawyer and judge in New York City; and Rose Reilly (1867–1928).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Died|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,754678,00.html?promoid=googlep|quote=Bernard J.

His name was subsequently given to Davies' favorite nephew, screenwriter [[Charles Lederer]], the son of Davies' sister Reine Davies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Marion |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Times We Had |year=1975 |publisher= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3sdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q |isbn=0-672-52112-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Douras family lived near [[Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York|Prospect Park]] in Brooklyn. The sisters changed their surname to Davies, which one of them spotted on a real-estate agent's sign in the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, M. (1975). ''The times we had: Life with William Randolph Hearst''. New York: NY: Random House Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Even at a time when New York was the [[melting pot]] for new immigrants, having a British surname greatly helped one's prospects—the name Davies has Welsh origins.

Educated in a New York convent, Davies left school to pursue a career. She worked as a chorus girl in Broadway revues and modeled for illustrators [[Harrison Fisher]] and [[Howard Chandler Christy]]. In 1916, Davies was signed on as a [[Ziegfeld girl]] in the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oW0hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8oYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=666,2839306&amp;dq=marion+davies+model&amp;hl=en|title=Famous Actress-Philanthropist Marion Davies Dies of Cancer|date=September 18, 1961|work=Tri City Herald|page=2|accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:MarionDavies-Hat-1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Davies for the cover of ''Theatre Magazine'' (June 1920)]]

===Early career===
After making her screen debut in 1916, modelling gowns by [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon|Lady Duff-Gordon]] in a fashion newsreel, she appeared in her first feature film in the 1917 ''Runaway Romany''.&lt;ref name="golden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/mariondavies.html |title=Marion Davies |quote= |publisher=Golden Silents |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509144109/http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/mariondavies.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies wrote the film, which was directed by her brother-in-law, prominent Broadway producer George W. Lederer. The following year she starred in two films—''The Burden of Proof'' and ''Cecilia of the Pink Roses''. Playing mainly light comic roles, she quickly became a film personality appearing with major male stars, making a small fortune, which enabled her to provide financial assistance for her family and friends.

===Hearst and Cosmopolitan Pictures===
[[File:Marion-Davies-Beach-House-Postcard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Postcard of Marion Davies in front of her beach house in Santa Monica]]
By the mid-1920s, however, Davies' career was often overshadowed by her relationship with [[William Randolph Hearst]] and their social life at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]] and [[Annenberg Community Beach House|Ocean House]] in [[Santa Monica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decofilms.com/mariondavies/homes.htm|title=Marion Davies - Homes|author=|date=|website=www.decofilms.com|accessdate=April 30, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202311/http://www.decofilms.com/mariondavies/homes.htm|archivedate=April 30, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was dubbed by [[Colleen Moore]] "the biggest house on the beach—the beach between [[San Diego]] and [[Vancouver]]".

According to her own audio diaries, she met newspaper tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]] long before she had started working in films.&lt;ref&gt;"The Times We Had", by Marion Davies, edited by Pamela Pfau and Kenneth S Marx&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Hearst formed [[Cosmopolitan Productions|Cosmopolitan Pictures]] and signed Davies to a $5-per-week contract, using his newspapers and Hearst Newsreels to promote her.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Longworth |first1=Karina |title=The Mistress, the Magnate, and the Genius |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/you_must_remember_this/2015/09/marion_davies_actress_and_mistress_of_william_randolph_hearst_was_portrayed.html |website=Slate |date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst's relentless efforts to promote her career had a detrimental effect, but he persisted, making Cosmopolitan's distribution deals first with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], then [[Samuel Goldwyn|Goldwyn]], and with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Davies herself was more inclined to develop her comic talents alongside her friends at [[United Artists]], but Hearst pointedly discouraged this. Davies, in her published memoirs ''The Times We Had'', concluded that Hearst's over-the-top promotion of her career, in fact, had a negative result.  One particular example, he had purchased the Cameo Theatre (located in San Francisco) in 1929. He then lavishly remodeled both the exterior and interior decor in a rosebud-hued Art Moderne motif, and renamed it The Marion Davies Theatre. From Hearst's office windows further up Market Street, he could see pink neon letters constantly spelling out her name above the marquee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/3130|title=Esquire Theatre in San Francisco, CA - Cinema Treasures|author=|date=|website=cinematreasures.org|accessdate=April 30, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902222902/http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/3130|archivedate=September 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst Metrotone Newsreels were included on the program, and these newsreels regularly touted Miss Davies' social activities.

Hearst, who was still married, became romantically involved with Davies, and moved her with her mother and sisters into an elegant Manhattan townhouse at the corner of [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] and W. 105th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alleman, Richard|title=New York: The Movie Lover's Guide|chapter=MARION DAVIES MANSION|pages=359–360|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_0Z5SxTKLkC&amp;pg=PA359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20070826_HEIST_GRAPHIC/heist_wLineOnly.swf|title=No. 331: Publisher's Mistress — NY Times|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=April 30, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105062723/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20070826_HEIST_GRAPHIC/heist_wLineOnly.swf|archivedate=November 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cecilia of the Pink Roses]]'' in 1918 was her first film backed by Hearst. She was on her way to being the most infamously advertised actress in the world. During the next ten years she appeared in 29 films, an average of almost three films a year.&lt;ref name="deco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decofilms.com/mariondavies/biography.htm |title=Marion Davies |quote= |publisher=Deco Films |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515223825/http://www.decofilms.com/mariondavies/biography.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her best known roles was as [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]] in ''[[When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922 film)|When Knighthood Was in Flower]]'' (1922), directed by [[Robert G. Vignola]], with whom she collaborated on several films.

The 1922–23 period may have been her most successful, with both ''[[When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922 film)|When Knighthood Was in Flower]]'' and ''[[Little Old New York]]'' ranking among the top 3 box-office hits of those years. Indeed, she was named the #1 female box-office star by theater owners and crowned as "Queen of the Screen" at their 1924 convention in Hollywood. Other hit silent films included ''[[Beverly of Graustark]]'', ''[[The Cardboard Lover]]'', ''[[Enchantment (1921 film)|Enchantment]]'',''[[The Bride's Play]]'', ''[[Lights of Old Broadway]]'', ''[[Zander the Great]]'', ''[[The Red Mill]]'', ''[[Yolanda (film)|Yolanda]]'', ''[[Beauty's Worth]]'', and ''[[The Restless Sex]]''.

Hearst loved seeing her in expensive costume pictures, but she also appeared in contemporary comedies like ''[[Tillie the Toiler]]'', ''[[The Fair Co-Ed]]'' (both 1927), and especially three directed by [[King Vidor]], ''[[Not So Dumb]]'' (1930), ''[[The Patsy (1928 film)|The Patsy]]'' and the backstage-in-Hollywood saga ''[[Show People]]'' (both 1928). ''The Patsy'' contains her imitations, which she usually did for friends, of silent stars [[Lillian Gish]], [[Mae Murray]] and [[Pola Negri]]. King Vidor saw Davies as a comedic actress instead of the dramatic actress that Hearst wanted her to be. He noticed she was the life of parties and incorporated that into his films.

After seeing photographs of [[St Donat's Castle]] in ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine, the Welsh [[Vale of Glamorgan]] property was bought and revitalized by Hearst in 1925 as a gift to Davies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/08/03/lydia-hearst-is-queen-of-the-castle-91466-21454996/|title=Lydia Hearst is queen of the castle|author=Bevan, Nathan|publisher=Wales on Sunday|date=August 3, 2008|accessdate=August 3, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022101008/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/08/03/lydia-hearst-is-queen-of-the-castle-91466-21454996/|archivedate=October 22, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst and Davies spent much of their time entertaining, holding lavish parties with guests at their Beverly Hills estate. Frequent guests included, among others, [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], and a young [[John F. Kennedy]]. Upon visiting St Donat's, [[George Bernard Shaw]] was quoted as saying: "This is what God would have built if he had had the money."

===Sound films===
[[File:Mariondavies.jpg|thumb|upright]]
The coming of [[Sound film|sound]] made Davies nervous because she had never completely overcome a childhood [[stutter]].&lt;ref name="deco"/&gt; Her career continued, however, and she made several comedies and musicals during the late 1920s and 1930s, including ''[[Marianne (1929 musical film)|Marianne]]'' (1929), ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' (1929), ''[[Not So Dumb]]'' (1930), ''The Florodora Girl'' (1930), ''The Bachelor Father'' (1931), ''Five and Ten'' (1931) with [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], ''[[Polly of the Circus (1932 film)|Polly of the Circus]]'' (1932) with [[Clark Gable]], ''Blondie of the Follies'' (1932), ''[[Peg o' My Heart (1933 film)|Peg o' My Heart]]'' (1933), ''[[Going Hollywood]]'' (1933) with [[Bing Crosby]], and ''Operator 13'' (1934) with [[Gary Cooper]]. She was involved with many aspects of her films and was considered an astute businesswoman. Her career, however, was hampered by Hearst's insistence that she play distinguished, dramatic parts as opposed to the comic roles that were her forte.

Hearst reportedly had tried to push MGM production boss [[Irving Thalberg]] to cast Davies in the title role in ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'', but Thalberg gave the part to his wife, [[Norma Shearer]]. This rejection came on the heels of Davies having been also denied the female lead in ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934 film)|The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]''; that role going to Shearer as well. Despite Davies' friendship with the Thalbergs, Hearst reacted by pulling his newspaper support for MGM and moving Davies and Cosmopolitan Pictures  distribution to [[Warner Brothers]]. Davies' films there were ''[[Page Miss Glory (1935 film)|Page Miss Glory]]'' (1935), ''Hearts Divided'', ''[[Cain and Mabel]]'' (both 1936), and ''Ever Since Eve'' (1937). Mirroring events at MGM, Warners purchased the rights to the play "Tovarich" for Davies, but the film version ''[[Tovarich (1937 film)|Tovarich]]'' was given to [[Claudette Colbert]]. Hearst shopped Davies and Cosmopolitan for another year, but no deals were made and Davies officially retired. In 1943, Davies was offered the role of Mrs. Brown in ''[[Claudia (1943 film)|Claudia]]'', but Hearst dissuaded her from taking a supporting role and tarnishing her starring career. In her 45 feature films, over a 20-year period, Davies had never been anything but the star and always got first billing. The only exceptions were films in which she appeared as herself and uncredited [[cameo appearance]]s.

When Cosmopolitan folded, Davies left the film business and retreated to San Simeon. Davies would later state in her autobiography that after many years of work she had had enough and decided to devote herself to being Hearst's "companion and confidante". In truth, she was intensely ambitious, but faced the harsh reality that at the age of forty, she could no longer play the young heroines or madcaps as in earlier films, and that she was unwilling to play supporting roles. Decades after Davies' retirement and death, however, the consensus among some critics is more appreciative of her efforts, particularly in the field of comedy.

==Critical reassessment==
Largely because of the damage to her reputation caused by ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', Davies has been largely ignored by film critics and historians.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} But a recent reassessment of her work has come about via broadcast of her films on Turner Classic Movies and the release on DVD on her silent films like ''[[When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922 film)|When Knighthood Was in Flower]]'', ''[[Beauty's Worth]]'', ''[[The Bride's Play]]'', ''[[Enchantment (1921 film)|Enchantment]]'', ''[[The Restless Sex]]'', ''[[April Folly]]'', and ''[[Buried Treasure (1921 film)|Buried Treasure]]''. This new availability, along with the publication of ''[[The Silent Films of Marion Davies]]'' by [[Edward Lorusso]] have allowed for a better assessment of Davies' work as an actress. Despite the legend, most of Davies's films made money and she remained a popular star for most of her career. Indeed, Davies was the #1 female box office star of 1922-23 thanks to the enormous popularity of ''[[When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922 film)|When Knighthood Was in Flower]]'' and ''[[Little Old New York]]'', which both ranked among the biggest box-office films of 1922 and 1923, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorusso, Edward]] (2017) ''The Silent Films of Marion Davies'', CreateSpace, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Relationship with William Randolph Hearst===
Publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst and Davies lived as a couple for decades but were never married, as Hearst's wife refused to give him a divorce. At one point, he reportedly came close to marrying Davies, but decided his wife's [[settlement (law)|settlement]] demands were too high. Hearst was extremely jealous and possessive of her, even though he was married throughout their relationship. [[Lita Grey]], the second wife of [[Charlie Chaplin]], wrote four decades later that Davies confided with her about the relationship with Hearst. Grey quoted Davies saying:

{{quote|God, I'd give everything I have to marry that silly old man. Not for the money and security—he's given me more than I'll ever need. Not because he's such cozy company, either. Most times, when he starts jawing, he bores me stiff. And certainly not because he's so wonderful behind the barn. Why, I could find a million better lays any Wednesday. No, you know what he gives me, sugar? He gives me the feeling I'm worth something to him. A whole lot of what we have, or don't have, I don't like. He's got a wife who'll never give him a divorce. She knows about me, but it's still understood that when she decides to go to the ranch for a week or a weekend, I've got to vamoose. And he snores, and he can be petty, and has sons about as old as me. But he's kind and he's good to me, and I'd never walk out on him.&lt;ref&gt;Lita Grey Chaplin. ''My Life With Chaplin'', Grove Press (1966) pp. 214-215&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the late 1930s, Hearst was suffering financial reversals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6wIkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5280,5119515&amp;dq=marion+davies+st+donat%27s+castle&amp;hl=en|title=Hearst Career Full of Drama|date=August 14, 1951|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=4|accessdate=November 29, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919120437/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6wIkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5280,5119515&amp;dq=marion+davies+st+donat's+castle&amp;hl=en|archivedate=September 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After selling many of the contents of [[St Donat's Castle]], Davies sold her jewelry, stocks and bonds and wrote a check for $1 million to Hearst to save him from bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GKUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J-kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3077,3431837&amp;dq=marion+davies+million+dollars&amp;hl=en|title=Marion Davies Dies of Cancer|date=September 23, 1961|work=The Miami News|page=7A|accessdate=November 29, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001065723/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GKUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J-kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3077,3431837&amp;dq=marion+davies+million+dollars&amp;hl=en|archivedate=October 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies had developed a drinking problem over the course of many years, but her [[alcoholism]] grew worse in the latter 1930's and the 1940s, as she and Hearst lived an increasingly isolated life. The two spent most of the Second World War at Hearst's [[Northern California]] estate of [[Wyntoon]], until returning to San Simeon in 1945.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book| title=Hearst Castle: The Biography of a Country House| author=Victoria Kastner| publisher=Harry N.

Hearst died on August 14, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZuVXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XfYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3921,2914090&amp;dq=william+randolph+hearst+death+august+14&amp;hl=en|title=Allowance Asked By Hearst Widow|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle|publisher=August 22, 1951|page=7|accessdate=November 29, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001104306/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZuVXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XfYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3921,2914090&amp;dq=william+randolph+hearst+death+august+14&amp;hl=en|archivedate=October 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, Hearst provided handsomely for Davies, leaving her 170,000 shares of [[Hearst Corporation]] stock, in addition to 30,000 he had established for her in a [[trust fund]] in 1950. This gave her a controlling interest in the company for a short time, until she chose to relinquish the stock voluntarily to the corporation on October 30, 1951. She retained her original 30,000 shares and an advisory role with the corporation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Patricia Lake===
Since the early 1920s, there has been speculation that Davies and Hearst had a child together some time between 1920 and 1923. The child was rumored to be [[Patricia Lake]] (née Van Cleve), who was publicly identified as Davies' niece.&lt;ref name=latimes1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-31/news/mn-51785_1_marion-davies|title=Obituary Revives Rumor of Hearst Daughter : Hollywood: Gossips in the 1920s speculated that William Randolph Hearst and mistress Marion Davies had a child.

Lake had never commented on her alleged paternity in public, even after Hearst's and Davies' deaths, but did tell her grown children and friends. Lake's claim was published in her [[death notice]], which was published in newspapers.&lt;ref name=latimes1 /&gt;

Lake told her friends and family that Davies became pregnant by Hearst in the early 1920s. As the child was conceived during Hearst's extra-marital affair with Davies and [[out of wedlock]], Hearst sent Davies to Europe to have the child in secret to avoid a public scandal. Hearst later joined Davies in Europe. Lake claimed she was born in a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] hospital outside of Paris between 1920 and 1923 (she was unsure of the precise date). Lake was then given to Davies' sister Rose, whose own child had died in infancy, and passed off as Rose and her husband George Van Cleve's daughter. Lake stated that Hearst paid for her schooling and both Davies and Hearst spent considerable time with her. Davies reportedly told Lake of her true parentage when she was 11 years old. Lake said Hearst confirmed that he was her father on her wedding day at age 17 where both Davies and Hearst gave her away.&lt;ref name=latimes1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Michelle|title=Children of Hollywood: Accounts Of Growing Up As the Sons and Daughters Of Stars|year=2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-2046-4|pages=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Davies nor Hearst ever publicly addressed the rumors during their lives. Upon news of the story, a spokesman for [[Hearst Castle]] only commented that, "It's a very old rumor and a rumor is all it ever was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-31/news/mn-51785_1_marion-davies/2|title=Obituary Revives Rumor of Hearst Daughter : Hollywood: Gossips in the 1920s speculated that William Randolph Hearst and mistress Marion Davies had a child.

===Ince scandal===
In November 1924, Davies was among those aboard Hearst's luxury yacht ''[[USS Oneida (SP-432)|Oneida]]'' for a weekend party that resulted in the death of film producer [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]]. Rumors have endured since then that Davies had an alleged relationship with fellow-guest [[Charlie Chaplin]], and that Hearst mistook Ince for Chaplin and shot him out of jealousy. There has never been any evidence to support the rumors.

Ince's autopsy showed that he suffered an attack of acute indigestion while aboard the yacht and was escorted off in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] by another of the guests, Dr. Daniel Carson Goodman, a Hollywood writer and producer. Ince was put on a train bound for Los Angeles, but was removed from the train at [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]] when his condition worsened. He was given medical attention by Dr. T. A. Parker and a nurse, Jesse Howard. Ince told them that he had drunk liquor aboard Hearst's yacht. He was taken to his Hollywood home where he died the following day of a heart condition.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Citizen Hearst by W. A. Swanberg. pages 445–446. Press hostile to Hearst fueled the rumors. Op cit p. 446 The District Attorney of San Diego, Chester C. Kempley made an inquiry into the events and issued a statement to the effect that he was satisfied that Ince's death was due to "heart failure due to an attack of acute indigestion". Op cit p. 446 The quote is footnoted. The source for Mr. Kempley's statement is given as the ''New York Times'' December 4, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Eleven weeks and one day after Hearst's death, Davies married Horace Brown on October 31, 1951, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sea Captain wed to Marion Davies.

Davies filed for divorce twice, but neither was finalized, despite Brown admitting he treated her badly: "I'm a beast," he said. "I took him back. I don't know why," she explained. "I guess because he's standing right beside me, crying. Thank God we all have a sense of humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marion Davies Files. Sues Husband for a Divorce.

==Later years==
In her later years, Davies was involved with charity work. In 1952, she donated $1.9 million to establish a children's clinic at [[UCLA]] which was named for her;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucla.edu/about/buildings/health.html |title=UCLA: Facts &amp; History |accessdate=April 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219193959/http://www.ucla.edu/about/buildings/health.html |archivedate=December 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the clinic's name was changed to The Mattel Children's Hospital in 1998. She also fought childhood diseases through the Marion Davies Foundation.&lt;ref name="deco"/&gt;

She suffered a minor stroke in 1956, and later underwent surgery on her jawbone for [[osteomyelitis]]. Twelve days after the operation, Davies fell in her hospital room and broke her leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yttUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NDwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2144,4421979&amp;dq=marion+davies+hearst&amp;hl=en|title=Marion Davies, film star of 1920's confidante of Hearst, dies at 64|date=September 23, 1961|work=The Leader-Post|page=1|accessdate=November 29, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919121228/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yttUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NDwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2144,4421979&amp;dq=marion+davies+hearst&amp;hl=en|archivedate=September 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies made her last public appearance on January 10, 1960, on an [[NBC]] television special called ''Hedda Hopper's Hollywood''. [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] rented Davies' mansion and worked from behind the scenes to secure his son [[John F. Kennedy]]'s nomination during the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles. It was not long after that she was diagnosed with stomach cancer.

===Portrayals of Davies===
Davies was commonly assumed to be the inspiration for the [[Citizen Kane#Susan Alexander|Susan Alexander]] character portrayed in [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), which was based loosely on Hearst's life.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kane2/kane2ts.html ''The Battle over Citizen Kane''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216132713/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kane2/kane2ts.html |date=December 16, 2007 }} on PBS' ''[[American Experience]]''; retrieved January 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This led to various portrayals of Davies as a talentless opportunist. In his foreword to Davies' autobiography, ''The Times We Had'' (published posthumously in 1975), Welles wrote that his fictional creation bears no resemblance to Davies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That Susan was Kane's wife and Marion was Hearst's mistress is a difference more important than might be guessed in today's changed climate of opinion. The wife was a puppet and a prisoner; the mistress was never less than a princess. Hearst built more than one castle, and Marion was the hostess in all of them: they were pleasure domes indeed, and the Beautiful People of the day fought for invitations. Xanadu was a lonely fortress, and Susan was quite right to escape from it. The mistress was never one of Hearst's possessions: he was always her suitor, and she was the precious treasure of his heart for more than 30 years, until his last breath of life. Theirs is truly a love story. Love is not the subject of ''Citizen Kane''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Marion, ''The Times We Had: Life with William Randolph Hearst''; foreword by Orson Welles, May 28, 1975. Indianapolis and New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1975 {{ISBN|0-672-52112-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Welles told filmmaker [[Peter Bogdanovich]] that [[Samuel Insull]]'s building of the [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Chicago Opera House]], and business tycoon [[Harold Fowler McCormick]]'s lavish promotion of the opera career of his [[Ganna Walska|second wife]], were direct influences on the [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay for ''Citizen Kane'']]. "As for Marion," Welles said, "she was an extraordinary woman—nothing like the character [[Dorothy Comingore]] played in the movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[Orson Welles|Welles, Orson]], and [[Peter Bogdanovich]], ''[[This is Orson Welles]]''. New York: HarperCollins Publishers 1992 {{ISBN|0-06-016616-9}} page 49. Welles states, "The real story of Hearst is quite different from Kane's … There's all that stuff about McCormick and the opera. I drew a lot from that from my Chicago days. And Samuel Insull."&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies was portrayed by [[Virginia Madsen]] in the [[telefilm]] ''[[The Hearst and Davies Affair]]'' (1985) with [[Robert Mitchum]] as Hearst. Madsen later became a Davies fan and said that she felt she had inadvertently portrayed her as a [[stereotype]], rather than as a real person.

Davies was portrayed by [[Heather McNair]] in ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]'' (1992); by [[Gretchen Mol]] in ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' (1999); and by [[Kirsten Dunst]] in ''[[The Cat's Meow]]'' (2001).

[[Melanie Griffith]] was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Miniseries or a Movie]] for portraying Davies in [[RKO 281]] in 2000.

'''Menippus of Gadara''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɪ|p|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Μένιππος ὁ Γαδαρεύς}}; fl. 3rd century BC) was a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[satirist]]. His works, all of which are lost, were an important influence on [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] and [[Lucian]]. The [[Menippean satire]] genre is named after him.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Menippus. He was a native of [[Gadara]] in [[Coele-Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephanus Byz.; Strabo, xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient sources agree that he was a [[Slavery in Ancient Greece|slave]]. He was in the service of a citizen of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], but in some way obtained his freedom and lived at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. [[Diogenes Laërtius]]&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 99, 100&lt;/ref&gt; relates a dubious story that he amassed a fortune as a [[usury|money-lender]], lost it, and committed [[suicide]] through grief.&lt;ref&gt;"The tradition that he was a moneylender and speculator in marine insurance is probably apocryphal, resting as it does on the always dubious authority of [[Hermippus of Smyrna|Hermippus]]." Donald Dudley, (1937) ''A History of Cynicism'', page 70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian]] ranks Menippus with [[Antisthenes]], [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], and [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]] as among the most notable of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]].

==Writings==
His works (written in a mixture of [[prose]] and [[poetry|verse]]) are all lost. He discussed serious subjects in a spirit of ridicule, and especially delighted in attacking the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] and [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. [[Strabo]] and [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Stephanus]] call him the "earnest-jester" ({{lang-el|σπουδογέλοιος}}, ''[[Spoudaiogeloion|spoudogeloios]]''). His writings exercised considerable influence upon later literature, and the [[Menippean satire]] genre is named after him. Although the writings of Menippus no longer survive, there are some fragments of [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]'s ''Saturae Menippeae'', which were written in imitation of Menippus.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 2, 8; Aulus Gellius, ii. 18; Macrobius, ''Sat.'' i. 11&lt;/ref&gt; One of the dialogues attributed to [[Lucian]], his avowed imitator, who frequently mentions him, is called ''Menippus'', but since the sub-title ("The Oracle of the Dead") resembles that of a work ascribed to Menippus by Diogenes Laërtius, {{Citation needed span|text=it has been suggested that it is imitated from his Necromancy|date=September 2018|reason=}}.

Diogenes Laërtius says the following works were written by Menippus:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 101&lt;/ref&gt;
* Νέκυια – ''Necromancy''
* Διαθῆκαι – ''Wills''
* Ἐπιστολαὶ κεκομψευμέναι ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν προσώπου – ''Letters artificially composed as if by the Gods''
* Πρὸς τοὺς φυσικοὺς καὶ μαθηματικοὺς καὶ γραμματικοὺς – ''Replies to the Natural Philosophers, and Mathematicians, and Grammarians''
* Γονὰς Ἐπικούρου – ''The Birth of Epicurus''
* Τὰς θρησκευομένας ὑπ' αὐτῶν εἰκάδας – ''The School's reverence of the twentieth day'' (celebrated in the Epicurean school)

In addition, [[Athenaeus]] mentions works called ''Symposium''&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, 14.629F&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Arcesilaus'',&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, 14.664E&lt;/ref&gt; and Diogenes Laërtius mentions a ''Sale of Diogenes'' ({{lang-el|Διογένους Πράσει}})&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; written by Menippus which seems to be the main source of the story that [[Diogenes of Sinope]] was captured by pirates and sold into slavery.

'''Michael Servetus''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|iː|t|ə|s}}; {{lang-es|Miguel Serveto}} as real name, {{lang-fr|Michel Servet}}), also known as ''Miguel Servet'', ''Miguel de Villanueva'', ''Michel Servet'', ''Revés'', or ''Michel de Villeneuve'' (Villanueva de Sigena, Aragón, Spain, 29 September 1509 or 1511&amp;nbsp;– 27 October 1553), was a Spanish [[theology|theologian]], [[physician]], [[cartographer]], and [[Renaissance humanist]]. He was the first European to correctly describe the function of [[pulmonary circulation]], as discussed in ''[[Christianismi Restitutio]]'' (1553). He was a [[polymath]] versed in many sciences: [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[meteorology]], [[geography]], human [[anatomy]], [[medicine]] and [[pharmacology]], as well as [[jurisprudence]], [[translation]], [[poetry]] and the scholarly study of the [[Bible]] in its original languages. He is renowned in the history of several of these fields, particularly medicine. He participated in the [[Protestant Reformation]], and later developed a heterodox view of the [[Trinity]] and [[Christology]]. After being condemned by [[Catholic]] authorities in [[Kingdom of France|France]], he fled to [[Calvinist]] [[Republic of Geneva|Geneva]] where he was burnt at the stake for [[heresy]] by order of the city's governing council.

=== Early life and education ===
[[File:Fachada casa natal Servet.jpg|thumb|Façade of the house of Michael Servetus in Villanueva de Sigena (Spain). Today it is the headquarters of the ''Michael Servetus Institute'' and a research centre of Servetus' life and works.]]

Most scholars agree that Servetus was probably born&lt;ref&gt;See a discussion on the date in Angel Alcalá's introduction to the first Spanish translation of ''Christianismi Restitutio'' (''La restitución del cristianismo'', Fundación Universitaria Española, Madrid, 1980, p. 16, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1511 in Villanueva de Sigena in Aragon, Spain. The day of 29 September has been conventionally proposed for his birth, due to the fact that 29 September is Saint Michael's day according to the Catholic [[calendar of saints]], but there are no data supporting this claim. Some sources give an earlier date based on Servetus' own occasional claim of having been born in 1509,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drummond |first=William H. |title= The Life of Michael Servetus: The Spanish Physician, Who, for the Alleged Crime of Heresy, was Entrapped, Imprisoned, and Burned, by John Calvin the Reformer, in the City of Geneva, October 27, 1553 |year= 1848 |publisher= John Chapman |location=London, England |isbn= | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few authors have proposed Tudela of Navarre as his birthplace, and that his true name was ''De Villanueva'' according to the letters of his French naturalization (Chamber des Comptes, Royal Chancellorship and Parlement of Grenoble) and the registry at the University of Paris. The ancestors of his father came from the hamlet of Serveto, in the [[Aragon]]ese [[Pyrenees]]. His father was a notary of Christian ancestors from the lower nobility (''infanzón''),&lt;ref&gt;See J. Barón, ''Miguel Servet: Su Vida y Su Obra'', Espasa-Calpe, Madrid, 1989, pp. 37-39.&lt;/ref&gt; who worked at the nearby [[Monastery of Santa Maria de Sigena]]. Servetus had two brothers: one, Juan was a Catholic priest, and another was a notary, Pedro.&lt;ref&gt;Barón, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Servetus declared during his trial in Geneva that his parents were "Christians of ancient race", and that he never had any communication with Jews,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Calvini Opera Quae Supersunt Omnia'', Vol. VIII, Brunsvigae, 1870, p. 767.&lt;/ref&gt; his maternal line actually descended from the Zaportas (or Çaportas), a wealthy and socially relevant family from the [[Barbastro]] and [[Monzón]] areas in [[Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernestro Fernández-Xesta, "Los Zaporta de Barbastro", in ''Emblemata: Revista aragonesa de emblemática'', Vol. #8, 2002, pp. 103-150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/28/98/03nicolas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This was demonstrated by a notarial protocol published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez Echeverría," Andrés Laguna and Michael Servetus: two converted humanist doctors of the XVI century" in: Andrés Laguna International Congress. Humanism, Science and Politics in the Renaissance Europe, García Hourcade y Moreno Yuste, coord., Junta de Castilla y León, Valladolid,1999 pp. 377-389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;González Echeverría " Michael Servetus belonged to the famous converted Jewish family The Zaporta", Pliegos de Bibliofilia, nº 7, Madrid pp. 33-42. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;González Echeverría" On the Jewish heritage of Michael Servetus" Raíces. Jewish Magazine of Culture, Madrid, nº 40, pp. 67-69. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Servetus' family used a nickname, "Revés", according to an old tradition in rural Spain of using alternate names for families across generations. The origin of the Revés nickname may have been that a member of a (probably distinguished) family living in Villanueva with the surname Revés established blood ties with the Serveto family, thus uniting both family names for the next generations.&lt;ref&gt;There are several documents referring to people called Revés in Villanueva in the 15th century, as shown in Juan Manuel Palacios Sánchez, [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/1333209.pdf "A propósito del lugar de nacimiento y origen familiar de Miguel Servet"  ("Regarding Michael Servetus' birth place and family origins")], ''Argensola'', Instituto de Estudios Altoaragoneses, ISSN 0518-4088, #87, Huesca, 1979, pp. 266-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Servetus was gifted in languages and he could have studied [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] under the instruction of [[Dominican Order|Dominican friars]].&lt;ref name="Drummondp3"&gt;Drummond, p3.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a knowledge of [[Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;In his two main theological books, Servetus shows a level of knowledge that is similar to other 16th-century humanists. His Hebrew quotes refer to common, well-known concepts, and they are not philological analysis, but they are made to endorse exegetic interpretations, and the vocabulary he used was limited. For details on Servetus' use of Hebrew in his theological works and in his edition of Pagnino's Bible, see Natalio Fernández Marcos and Emilia Fernández Tejero, "Pagnino, Servet y Arias Montano: Avatares de una traducción latina de la Biblia Hebrea", in ''Sefarad'', No. 63, CSIC, Madrid, 2003, pp. 314-18. ([http://sefarad.revistas.csic.es/index.php/sefarad/article/view/539/637 Text (in Spanish)]).&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fifteen Servetus entered the service of a [[Franciscan]] friar named [[Juan de Quintana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Richard |title= An Apology for Dr. Michael Servetus: Including an Account of His Life, Persecution, Writings and Opinions |year= 1806 |publisher= F. B. Wright |location=London|isbn= | page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526 he attended the [[University of Toulouse]] where he studied law. Servetus could have had access to forbidden religious books, some of them maybe [[Protestant]], while he was studying in this city.&lt;ref&gt;Servetus' name was included at the top of a list of 40 heretics issued by the Inquisition in Toulouse on 17 June 1532; see Bourrilly, V.L. and Weiss N., "Jean du Bellay, les protestants et la Sorbonne" in ''Bulletin de la Societé d'Histoire du Protestantisme Français'', LIII, 103, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
Quintana became [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s confessor in 1530, and Servetus joined him in the imperial retinue as his page or secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Barón, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Servetus travelled through [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], and attended Charles' [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronation as Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[Bologna]]. He was outraged by the pomp and luxury displayed by the Pope and his retinue, and decided to follow the path of reformation.&lt;ref name = "Bainton"&gt;Bainton, ''Hunted Heretic'', pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known when Servetus left the imperial entourage, but in October 1530 he visited [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] in [[Basel]], staying there for about ten months, and probably supporting himself as a proofreader for a local printer. By this time he was already spreading his theological beliefs. In May 1531 he met [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito|Wolfgang Fabricius Capito]] in [[Strasbourg]].

Two months later, in July 1531, Servetus published  ''De Trinitatis Erroribus'' (''On the Errors of the Trinity''). The next year he published the work ''Dialogorum de Trinitate'' (''Dialogues on the Trinity'') and the supplementary work ''De Iustitia Regni Christi'' (''On the Justice of [[Christ]]'s Reign'') in the same volume. After the persecution of the Inquisition, Servetus assumed the name "Michel de Villeneuve" while he was staying in France. He studied at the [[Collège de Sorbonne#History|Collège de Calvi]] in [[Paris]] in 1533.
Servetus also published the first French edition of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Geography''. He dedicated his first edition of Ptolemy and his edition of the Bible to his patron Hugues de la Porte. While in Lyon, [[Symphorien Champier]], a medical [[Humanism|humanist]], had been his patron. Servetus wrote a [[pharmacological]] treatise in defence of Champier against [[Leonhart Fuchs]] ''In Leonardum Fucsium Apologia'' (''Apology against Leonard Fuchs''). Working also as a proofreader, he published several more books which dealt with medicine and pharmacology, such as his ''Syruporum universia ratio'' (''Complete Explanation of the [[Syrups]]''), for which he gained fame.

After an interval, Servetus returned to Paris to study medicine in 1536. In Paris, his teachers included [[Jacques Dubois|Sylvius]], [[Fernel]] and [[Johann Winter von Andernach]], who hailed him with Andrea [[Vesalius]] as his most able assistant in dissections. During these years he wrote his ''Manuscript of the Complutense'', an unpublished compendium of his medical ideas. Servetus taught mathematics and [[astrology]] while he studied medicine. He predicted an occultation of [[Mars]] by the [[Moon]], and this joined to his teaching generated much envy among the medicine teachers. His teaching classes were suspended by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Jean Tagault, and Servetus wrote his ''Apologetic Discourse of Michel de Villeneuve in Favour of Astrology and against a Certain Physician'' against him. Tagault later argued for the death penalty in the judgment of the [[University of Paris]] against Servetus. He was accused of teaching ''[[De Divinatione]]'' by [[Cicero]]. Finally, the sentence was reduced to the withdrawal of this edition. As a result of the risks and difficulties of studying medicine at Paris, Servetus decided to go to [[Montpellier]] to finish his medical studies, maybe thanks to his teacher [[Jacques Dubois|Sylvius]] who did exactly the same as a student.&lt;ref&gt;Krendal, Eric. 2011 ''Ongelmat Michael yliopistossa Pariisissa'' historioitsija painoksia Medicine, p 34-38&lt;/ref&gt; There he became a Doctor of Medicine in 1539. After that he lived at [[Charlieu]]. A jealous physician ambushed and tried to kill Servetus, but Servetus defended himself and injured one of the attackers in a sword fight. He was in prison for several days because of this incident.&lt;ref&gt;D'artigny- Judgement at Vienne Isère against Michel de Villeneuve.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working at Vienne ===
After his studies in medicine, Servetus started a medical practice. He became personal physician to Pierre Palmier, [[Archbishop of Vienne]], and was also physician to Guy de Maugiron, the lieutenant governor of [[Dauphiné]]. Thanks to the printer Jean Frellon II, acquaintance of John Calvin and friend of Michel,  Servetus and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] began to correspond. Calvin used the pseudonym "''Charles d'Espeville''." Servetus also became a French citizen, using his "De Villeneuve" ''persona'', by the Royal Process (1548&amp;ndash;1549) of French [[Naturalization]], issued by [[Henri II of France]].&lt;ref&gt;The text of the letter of French naturalisation was first published by F. Rude, "La naturalisation française de Michel Servet", in B. Becker (Ed.), ''Autour de Michel Servet et de Sebastien Castellion'', H.D. Tjeenk Willink &amp; Zoon N.V., Haarlem, 1953, pp. 133-141. The "royal letters" and an extract of one of the depositions had been previously published by Gustave Vellein, "Quelques mots sur Michel Servet: sa naturalisation durant son séjour à Vienne", in ''Petite revue des bibliophiles dauphinois'', Allier, 1921, pp. 13-29. Servetians had been wrongly referring this document for the last 50 years, it was considered lost by French indexers. It was located again by scholar Gonzalez Echeverria in the archives of Grenoble, after contacting a descendant of Vellein. Finally, after correcting some mistakes carried out by Rude's transcription, the whole 21 pages of the process (double verification in the Chamber of Finances of France, double registry in the Parlement de Grenoble, and Royal counsellors verification) was published in Prince of Viana Dep of Culture Journal of Navarre, N 255. It was also studied recently by the French Society for the History of Medicine, and the French Royal Law section of the Ancient Regime of France in Sorbone See ''La véritable identité de Servet, par le roi de France'' -''Premier prix de thèse de Paris'' Lellouch Prologue by G. Echeverria N 2013 (b) Sorbone Journal Historique Le Sorbone Page 45-70&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1553 Michael Servetus published yet another religious work with further anti-trinitarian views. It was entitled ''[[Christianismi Restitutio]]'' (''The Restoration of Christianity''), a work that sharply rejected the idea of [[predestination]] as the idea that God condemned souls to Hell regardless of worth or merit. God, insisted Servetus, condemns no one who does not condemn himself through thought, word or deed. This work also includes the first published description of the [[pulmonary circulation]].

To Calvin, who had written his summary of Christian doctrine ''Institutio Christianae Religionis'' (''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]''), Servetus' latest book was an attack on historical Nicene Christian doctrine and a misinterpretation of the biblical canon. Calvin sent a copy of his own book as his reply. Servetus promptly returned it, thoroughly annotated with critical observations. Calvin wrote to Servetus, "I neither hate you nor despise you; nor do I wish to persecute you; but I would be as hard as iron when I behold you insulting sound doctrine with so great audacity." In time their correspondence grew more heated until Calvin ended it.&lt;ref name = "Downton"&gt;Downton, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040610215638/http://home.messiah.edu/~kdownton/NatureOfAuthority.pdf ''An Examination of the Nature of Authority''], Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Servetus sent Calvin several more letters, to which Calvin took offense.&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant &lt;cite&gt; ''The Story of Civilization: The Reformation'' &lt;/cite&gt; Chapter XXI, page 481&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Calvin's frustrations with Servetus seem to have been based mainly on Servetus's departure from biblically-rooted Christian doctrine, but also on his tone, which Calvin considered inappropriate. Calvin revealed these frustrations with Servetus when writing to his friend [[William Farel]] on 13 February 1546:

{{cquote|Servetus has just sent me a long volume of his ravings. If I consent he will come here, but I will not give my word; for if he comes here, if my authority is worth anything, I will never permit him to depart alive ({{lang-la|Si venerit, modo valeat mea autoritas, vivum exire nunquam patiar&lt;!-- partiar? --&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;Durant, ''Story of Civilization'', 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Imprisonment and execution ===
On 16 February 1553, Michael Servetus while in [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], France, was denounced as a heretic by Guillaume de Trie, a rich merchant who had taken refuge in [[Republic of Geneva|Geneva]], and who was a good friend of Calvin,&lt;ref&gt;Bainton, ''Hunted Heretic'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; in a letter sent to a cousin, Antoine Arneys, who was living in Lyon. On behalf of the French [[inquisitor]] [[Matthieu Ory]], Michael Servetus and Balthasard Arnollet, the printer of ''[[Christianismi Restitutio]]'', were questioned, but they denied all charges and were released for lack of evidence. Ory asked Arneys to write back to De Trie, demanding proof. On 26 March 1553, the letters sent by Michel to Calvin and some manuscript pages of ''Christianismi Restitutio'' were forwarded to Lyon by De Trie. On 4 April 1553 Servetus was arrested by Roman Catholic authorities, and imprisoned in Vienne. He escaped from prison three days later. On 17 June, he was convicted of heresy, "thanks to the 17 letters sent by [[John Calvin]], preacher in Geneva"&lt;ref name = "Bainton164"&gt;''Hunted Heretic'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to be burned with his books. In his absence, he and his books were burned in effigy (blank paper for the books).

Meaning to flee to Italy, Servetus inexplicably stopped in Geneva, where Calvin and his Reformers had denounced him. On 13 August, he attended a sermon by Calvin at Geneva. He was arrested after the service&lt;ref name = "Heretics"&gt;''The Heretics'', p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; and again imprisoned.  All his property was confiscated. Servetus claimed during this judgment he was arrested at an inn at Geneva. French Inquisitors asked that Servetus be extradited to them for execution. Calvin wanted to show himself as firm in defense of Christian orthodoxy as his usual opponents. "He was forced to push the condemnation of Servetus with all the means at his command."&lt;ref name = "Heretics" /&gt; Calvin's delicate health meant he did not personally appear against Servetus.&lt;ref name = "Hanover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/comserv.html|title=Complaint Against Servetus|website=history.hanover.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas de la Fontaine]] played the more active role in Servetus's prosecution and the listing of points that condemned him. Among the possible reasons which prevented Calvin from appearing personally against Servetus there was one which must have seemed of itself sufficient. The laws regulating criminal actions in Geneva required that in certain grave cases the complainant himself should be incarcerated pending the trial. Calvin's delicate health and his great and constant usefulness in the administration of the state rendered a prolonged absence from the public life of Geneva impracticable. Nevertheless, Calvin is to be regarded as the author of the prosecution. Nicholas de la Fontaine was a refugee in Geneva and entered the service of Calvin, by whom he was employed as secretary.&lt;ref name=whitcomb&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/comserv.html Whitcomb, Merrick. "The Complaint of Nicholas de la Fontaine Against Servetus, 14 August, 1553", ''Translations and Reprints from the Original Sources of European History'', vol. 3, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania History Department, 1898-1912)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At his trial, Servetus was condemned on two counts, for spreading and preaching [[Nontrinitarianism]], specifically, [[Modalistic Monarchianism]], or [[Sabellianism]], and anti-[[paedobaptism]] (anti-infant baptism).&lt;ref name = "Bainton141"&gt;''Hunted Heretic'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Of paedobaptism Servetus had said, "It is an invention of the devil, an infernal falsity for the destruction of all Christianity."&lt;ref name="Reyburn"&gt;{{cite book |title=John Calvin: His Life, Letters, and Work |last=Reyburn |first=Hugh Young |year=1914 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=New York |isbn= |page=175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case the ''procureur général'' (chief public prosecutor) added some curious-sounding accusations in the form of inquiries—the most odd-sounding perhaps being, "whether he has married, and if he answers that he has not, he shall be asked why, in consideration of his age, he could refrain so long from marriage."&lt;ref name=whitcomb /&gt; To this oblique imputation about his sexuality, Servetus replied that rupture ([[inguinal hernia]]) had long since made him incapable of that particular sin. Another question was "whether he did not know that his doctrine was pernicious, considering that he favours [[Jews]] and [[Muslims|Turks]], by making excuses for them, and if he has not studied the [[Quran|Koran]] in order to disprove and controvert the doctrine and religion that the Christian churches hold, together with other profane books, from which people ought to abstain in matters of religion, according to the doctrine of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]."

Calvin believed Servetus deserved death on account of what he termed as his "execrable blasphemies".&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book |title=The debatable Land Between this World and the Next |last=Owen |first=Robert Dale |year=1872 |publisher=G.W. Carleton &amp; Co. |location=New York |isbn= |page=69, notes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin expressed these sentiments in a letter to [[William Farel|Farel]], written about a week after Servetus’ arrest, in which he also mentioned an exchange with Servetus. Calvin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...after he [Servetus] had been recognized, I thought he should be detained. My friend [[Nicholas de la Fontaine|Nicolas]] summoned him on a capital charge, offering himself as a security according to the ''[[lex talionis]]''. On the following day he adduced against him forty written charges. He at first sought to evade them. Accordingly we were summoned. He impudently reviled me, just as if he regarded me as obnoxious to him. I answered him as he deserved... of the man’s effrontery I will say nothing; but such was his madness that he did not hesitate to say that devils possessed divinity; yea, that many gods were in individual devils, inasmuch as a deity had been substantially communicated to those equally with wood and stone. I hope that sentence of death will at least be passed on him; but I desired that the severity of the punishment be mitigated.&lt;ref name = "Calvin"&gt;Calvin to [[William Farel]], August 20, 1553, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04575872&amp;id=MnG0aSU9QnwC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22bonnet+jules+%22 Bonnet, Jules (1820–1892)] ''Letters of John Calvin'', Carlisle, Penn: [[Banner of Truth Trust]], 1980, pp. 158–159. {{ISBN|0-85151-323-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Servetus was not a citizen of Geneva, and legally could at worst be banished, the government, in an attempt to find some plausible excuse to disregard this legal reality, had consulted other [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss Reformed cantons]] ([[Zürich]], [[Bern]], [[Basel]], [[Schaffhausen]]). They universally favoured his condemnation and suppression of his doctrine, but without saying how that should be accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip: ''History of the Christian Church, Vol. VIII: Modern Christianity: The Swiss Reformation'', William B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA, 1910, page 780.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] had condemned his writing in strong terms.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip: ''History of the Christian Church, Vol. VIII: Modern Christianity: The Swiss Reformation'', William B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA, 1910, page 706.&lt;/ref&gt; Servetus and [[Philip Melanchthon]] had strongly hostile views of each other. The party called the "[[Libertine]]s", who were generally opposed to anything and everything John Calvin supported, were in this case strongly in favour of the execution of Servetus at the stake (while Calvin urged that he be beheaded instead). In fact, the council that condemned Servetus was presided over by [[Ami Perrin]] (a Libertine) who ultimately on 24 October sentenced Servetus to [[execution by burning|death by burning]] for denying the [[Trinity]] and [[paedobaptism|infant baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Vollmer, Philip: 'John Calvin: Man of the Millennium,' Vision Forum, Inc., San Antonio, Texas, USA, 2008, 2008, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin and other ministers asked that he be beheaded instead of burnt, knowing that burning at the stake was the only legal recourse.&lt;ref&gt;Verdict and Sentence for Michael Servetus (1533) in A Reformation Reader eds. Denis R. Janz; 268–270&lt;/ref&gt; This plea was refused and on 27 October, Servetus was burnt alive—atop a pyre of his own books—at the Plateau of [[Champel]] at the edge of Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McGrath|1990|pp=118–120}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=222–225}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians record his [[last words]] as: "Jesus, Son of the Eternal God, have mercy on me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2002/11/12/goldstone/index.html "Out of the Flames" by Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone - Salon.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215521/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2002/11/12/goldstone/index.html |date=14 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[Sebastian Castellio]] and countless others denounced this execution and became harsh critics of Calvin because of the whole affair.

Some other anti-trinitarian thinkers began to be more cautious in expressing their views: [[Martin Cellarius]], [[Lelio Sozzini]] and others either ceased writing or wrote only in private. The fact that Servetus was dead meant that his writings could be distributed more widely, though others such as [[Giorgio Biandrata]] developed them in their own names.

The writings of Servetus influenced the beginnings of the Unitarian movement in Poland and [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref name="kot"&gt;See Stanislas Kot, "L'influence de Servet sur le mouvement atitrinitarien en Pologne et en Transylvanie", in B. Becker (Ed.), ''Autour de Michel Servet et de Sebastien Castellion'', Haarlem, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Gonesius]]'s advocacy of Servetus' views led to the separation of the [[Polish brethren]] from the Calvinist Reformed Church in Poland, and laid the foundations for the [[Socinian]] movement which fostered the early [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] in England like [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]].

==Theology&lt;!-- Some pages link here. Don't change this heading without changing them also. --&gt;==
In his first two books (''De trinitatis erroribus'', and ''Dialogues on the Trinity'' plus the supplementary ''De Iustitia Regni Christi'') Servetus rejected the classical conception of the [[Trinity]], stating that it was not based on the [[Bible]]. He argued that it arose from teachings of Greek [[Western philosophy|philosophers]], and he advocated a return to the simplicity of the [[Gospels]] and the teachings of the early [[Church Fathers]] that he believed predated the development of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] trinitarianism. Servetus hoped that the dismissal of the trinitarian dogma would make Christianity more appealing to believers in [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]], which had preserved the unity of God in their teachings. According to Servetus, trinitarians had turned Christianity into a form of "tritheism", or belief in three gods. Servetus affirmed that the divine ''[[Logos]]'', the manifestation of God and not a separate divine Person, was incarnated in a human being, Jesus, when God's spirit came into the womb of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. Only from the moment of conception was the Son actually generated. Therefore, although the Logos from which He was formed was eternal, the Son was not Himself eternal. For this reason, Servetus always rejected calling Christ the "[[eternity|eternal]] [[Son of God]]" but rather called him "the Son of the eternal God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://godglorified.com/errors_of_the_trinity.htm 'De trinitatis erroribus'], Book 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing Servetus' view of the Logos, Andrew Dibb explained: "In 'Genesis' God reveals himself as the creator. In 'John' he reveals that he created by means of the Word, or Logos. Finally, also in 'John', he shows that this Logos became flesh and 'dwelt among us'. Creation took place by the spoken word, for God said "Let there be ..." The spoken word of Genesis, the Logos of John, and the Christ, are all one and the same."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. T. Dibb, ''Servetus, Swedenborg and the Nature of God'', University Press of America, 2005, p. 93. Online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=_wdOqoatAJcC&amp;dq=%22servetus+swedenborg+and+the+nature+of+god%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Bx_ag86uUJ&amp;sig=jsfgd3fV53fnifnS7VTGC0CqNZs#PPA93,M1 Google Book Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his "Treatise Concerning the Divine Trinity" Servetus taught that the Logos was the reflection of Christ, and "That reflection of Christ was 'the Word with God" that consisted of God Himself, shining brightly in heaven, "and it was God Himself"&lt;ref name="Servetus 1553 75"&gt;{{cite book|last=Servetus|first=Michael|title=The Restoration of Christianity - An English Translation of Christianismi restitutio, 1553, Translated by Christopher A. Hoffman and Marian Hillar|year=1553|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Leiston - Queenston - Lampeter|isbn=978-0-7734-5520-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the Word was the very essence of God or the manifestation of God's essence, and there was in God no other substance or hypostasis than His Word, in a bright cloud where God then seemed to subsist. And in that very spot the face and personality of Christ shone bright."&lt;ref name="Servetus 1553 75"/&gt;

Unitarian scholar [[Earl Morse Wilbur]] states, "Servetus' ''Errors of the Trinity'' is hardly heretical in intent, rather is suffused with passionate earnestness, warm piety, an ardent reverence for Scripture, and a love for Christ so mystical and overpowering that [he] can hardly find words to express it&amp;nbsp;... Servetus asserted that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit were dispositions of God, and not separate and distinct beings."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone, ''Out of the Flames'', Broadway Books, NY NY, 2002, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Wilbur promotes the idea that Servetus was a [[Modalism|modalist]].

Servetus states his view clearly in the preamble to ''Restoration of Christianity'' (1553): "There is nothing greater, reader, than to recognize that God has been manifested as substance, and that His divine nature has been truly communicated. We shall clearly apprehend the manifestation of God through the Word and his communication through the Spirit, both of them substantially in Christ alone."&lt;ref&gt;Servetus, ''Restitución del Cristianismo'', Spanish edition by Angel Alcalá and Luis Betés, Madrid, Fundación Universitaria Española, 1980, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theology, though original in some respects, has often been compared to [[Adoptionism]], [[Arianism]], and [[Sabellianism]], all of which Trinitarians rejected in favour of the belief that God exists eternally in three distinct persons. Nevertheless, Servetus rejected these theologies in his books: Adoptionism, because it denied Jesus's divinity;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Restitución'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Arianism, because it multiplied the [[hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostases]] and established a rank;&lt;ref&gt;''Restitución'', p. 148, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sabellianism, because it seemingly confused the Father with the Son, though Servetus himself does appear to have denied or diminished the distinctions between the Persons of the Godhead, rejecting the Trinitarian understanding of One God in Three Persons.&lt;ref&gt;''Restitución'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The incomprehensible God is known through Christ, by faith, rather than by philosophical speculations. He manifests God to us, being the expression of His very being, and through him alone, God can be known. The scriptures reveal Him to those who have faith; and thus we come to know the Holy Spirit as the Divine impulse within us.&lt;ref&gt;Book VII, ''Out of the Flames'', Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone, Broadway Books, NY, NY, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under severe pressure from Catholics and Protestants alike, Servetus clarified this explanation in his second book, ''Dialogues'' (1532), to show the Logos coterminous with Christ. He was nevertheless accused of [[heresy]] because of his insistence on denying the dogma of the Trinity and the distinctions between the three divine Persons in one God.

Servetus also had very unorthodox views on the end times. He believed that he was the Michael referenced in both Daniel and Revelation who would fight the Antichrist. Furthermore, he believed that all this would take place in his lifetime. This possibly explains his decision to visit Calvin in Geneva. Servetus could have thought that he was somehow bringing about the beginnings of the end times by facing those who argued and fought against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Calvin|last=Gordon|first=Bruce|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Legacy ==

=== Theology ===
Because of his rejection of the Trinity and eventual [[execution by burning]] for [[heresy]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] often regard Servetus as the first (modern) Unitarian martyr —though he was a Unitarian in neither the 17th-century sense of the term nor the contemporary sense. Sharply critical though he was of the orthodox formulation of the trinity, Servetus is better described as a highly unorthodox trinitarian.&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;[http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/michaelservetus.html Hughes, Peter. "Michael Servetus", ''Dictionary of Unitarian &amp; Universalist Biography''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008004239/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/michaelservetus.html |date=8 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of conscience ===
Widespread aversion to Servetus’s death has been taken as signaling the birth in Europe of the idea of religious tolerance, a principle now more important to modern Unitarian Universalists than antitrinitarianism.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;The Spanish scholar on Servetus' work, Ángel Alcalá, identified the radical search for truth and the right for freedom of conscience as Servetus' main legacies, rather than his theology.&lt;ref&gt;A. Alcalá, "Los dos grandes legados de Servet: el radicalismo como método intelectual y el derecho a la libertad de conciencia", in ''Turia'', #63-64, March 2003, Teruel (Spain), pp. 221-242.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish-American scholar, [[Marian Hillar]], has studied the evolution of freedom of conscience, from Servetus and the Polish Socinians, to [[John Locke]] and to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the [[American Declaration of Independence]]. According to Hillar: "Historically speaking, Servetus died so that freedom of conscience could become a civil right in modern society." &lt;ref&gt;See Marian Hillar &amp; Claire S.

=== Science ===
Servetus was the first European to describe the function of [[pulmonary circulation]], although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, ''Christianismi Restitutio'', not in a book on medicine. However, the sections in which he refers to anatomy and medicines demonstrate an amazing understanding of the body and treatments. Most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. In passage V, Servetus recounts his discovery that the blood of the [[pulmonary circulation]] flows from the heart to the lungs (rather than air in the lungs flowing to the heart as had been thought). His discovery was based on the colour of the blood, the size and location of the different [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s, and the fact that the [[pulmonary vein]] was extremely large, which suggested that it performed intensive and transcendent exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Servetus |first1=Michael |title=Christianismi restitutio …|date=1553 |publisher=Baltasar Arnoullet |location=Vienne, France |page=170 |language=Latin}}  Available at:  [http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000041850 Biblioteca Digital Hispánica – Biblioteca Nacional de España] From p. 170:  ''"Fit autem communicatio hæc non per parietem cordis medium, ut vulgo creditur, sed magno artificio a dextro cordis ventriculo, longo per pulmones ductu, agitatur sanguis subtilis:  a pulmonibus præparatur, flavus efficatur:  et a vena arteriosa, in arteriam venosam transfunditur."'' (However this communication [of blood from the right to the left ventricle] occurs not through the middle wall of the heart, as is commonly believed, but by a great mechanism, the subtle blood is driven from the right ventricle of the heart, [and] at length led through the lungs; it is made ready in the lungs, is made yellowish, and is [thus] transferred from the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary vein.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Servetus does not only deal with [[cardiology]]. In the same passage, from page 169 to 178, he also refers to the brain, the [[cerebellum]], the [[meninges]], the nerves, the eye, the [[tympanum (anatomy)|tympanum]], the [[rete mirabile]], etc., demonstrating a great knowledge of [[anatomy]]. In some other sections of this work he also talks of medical products.

Servetus also contributed enormously to medicine with other published works specifically related to the field, such as his ''Complete Explanation of Syrups'' and his study on [[syphilis]] in his ''Apology against [[Leonhart Fuchs]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;2011 Samalways, Edmund.''

[[File:Michael Servetus in prison, statue by C. Roch Wellcome L0006357.jpg|thumb|Michael Servetus in prison, by [[Clotilde Roch]]. Monument in [[Annemasse]], France.]]

In Geneva, 350 years after the execution, remembering Servetus was still a controversial issue. In 1903 a committee was formed by supporters of Servetus to erect a monument in his honour. The group was led by a French Senator, Auguste Dide, an author of a book on heretics and revolutionaries which was published in 1887. The committee commissioned a local sculptor, Clotilde Roch, to execute a statue showing a suffering Servetus. The work was three years in the making and was finished in 1907. However, by then, supporters of Calvin in Geneva, having heard about the project, had already erected a simple [[stele]] in memory of Servetus in 1903, the main text of which served more as an apologetic for Calvin:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Duteous and grateful followers of Calvin our great Reformer, yet condemning an error which was that of his age, and strongly attached to liberty of conscience according to the true principles of his Reformation and gospel, we have erected this expiatory monument. Oct. 27, 1903&lt;/blockquote&gt; About the same time, a short street close by the stele was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=rue+servet+geneve+suisse&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=41.903538,92.724609&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Rue+Michel+Servet,+Gen%C3%A8ve,+Switzerland&amp;ll=46.193304,6.152043&amp;spn=0.008972,0.022638&amp;z=16 Rue Michel Servet, Genéve, Switzerland] at Google maps&lt;/ref&gt;
The city council then rejected the request of the committee to erect the completed statue, on the grounds that there was already a monument to Servetus. The committee then offered the statue to the neighbouring French town of [[Annemasse]], which in 1908 placed it in front of the city hall, with the following inscriptions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The arrest of Servetus in Geneva, where he did neither publish nor dogmatize, hence he was not subject to its laws, has to be considered as a barbaric act and an insult to the Right of Nations.” Voltaire&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I beg you, shorten please these deliberations. It is clear that Calvin for his pleasure wishes to make me rot in this prison. The lice eat me alive. My clothes are torn and I have nothing for a change, nor shirt, only a worn out vest.”
Servetus, 1553&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1942, the [[Vichy France|Vichy Government]] took down the statue, as it was a celebration of freedom of conscience, and melted it. In 1960, having found the original molds, Annemasse had it recast and returned the statue to its previous place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldstone, Nancy Bazelon |author2=Goldstone, Lawrence |title=Out of the Flames: The Remarkable Story of a Fearless Scholar, a Fatal Heresy, and One of the Rarest Books in the World |publisher=Broadway |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7679-0837-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}pp. 313-316&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, on 3 October 2011, Geneva erected a copy of the statue which it had rejected over 100 years before. It was cast in Aragon from the molds of Clotilde Roch's original statue. Rémy Pagani, former mayor of Geneva, inaugurated the statue. He previously had described Servetus as "the dissident of dissidence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdg.ch/geneve/actu/brule-fois-servet-aura-statue-geneve-pagani-2011-09-30 Tribune de Geneve]&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from the Roman Catholic Church in Geneva and the Director of Geneva's International Museum of the Reformation attended the ceremony. A Geneva newspaper noted the absence of officials from the National Protestant Church of Geneva, the church of John Calvin.&lt;ref&gt;Tribune de Genève, 4 October 2001, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the dates of the first editions are included.

*1531 ''On the Errors of the Trinity. De Trinitatis Erroribus'' ([[Haguenau]], Setzer). Without imprint mark or mark of printer, nor the city in which it was printed. Signed as Michael Servete alias Revés, from Aragon, Spanish. Written in Latin, it also includes words in Greek and in Hebrew in the body of the text whenever he wanted to stress the original meaning of a word from Scripture.
*1532 ''Dialogues on the Trinity. Dialogorum de Trinitate'' (Haguenau, Setzer). Without imprint mark or mark of printer, nor the city where it was printed. Signed as Michael Serveto alias Revés, from Aragon, Spanish.
*1535 ''Geography of Claudius Ptolemy. Claudii Ptolemaeii Alexandrinii Geographicae''. Lyon, Trechsel. Signed as Michel de Villeneuve. Servetus dedicated this work to Hugues de la Porte. The second edition was dedicated to Pierre Palmier. Michel de Villeneuve states that the basis of his edition comes from the work of Bilibald Pirkheimer, who translated this work from Greek to Latin, but Michel also affirms that he also compared it to the primitive Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;"According to the version of Bilibaldo Pirckheimer, and revised by Michel de Villeneuve, on the primitive Greek copies." Michel de Villeneuve, geography. "Claudii Ptolemaeii Alexandrinii Geographicae." printed by the Trechsel, 1535, Lyon.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century expert in Servetus, Henri Tollin (1833–1902), considered him to be "the father of comparative geography" due to the extension of his notes and commentaries.
*1536 ''The Apology against Leonard Fuchs. In Leonardum Fucsium Apologia.'' Lyon, printed by Gilles Hugetan, with Parisian prologue. Signed as Michel de Villeneuve. The physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] and a friend of Michael Servetus, [[Symphorien Champier]], got involved in an argument ''via'' written works, on their different Lutheran and Catholic beliefs. Servetus defends his friend in the first parts of the work. In the second part he talks of a medical plant and its properties. In the last part he writes on different topics, such as the defense of a pupil attacked by a teacher, and the origin of [[syphilis]].
*1537 ''Complete Explanation of the Syrups. Syruporum universia ratio''. Paris, edited by [[Simon de Colines]]. Signed as Michael de Villeneuve. This work consists of a prologue "The Use of Syrups", and 5 chapters:  I "What the concoction is and why it is unique and not multiple", II "What the things that must be known are", III "That the concoction is always..", IV "Exposition of the aphorisms of Hippocrates" and V "On the composition of syrups". Michel de Villeneuve refers to experiences of using the treatments, and to pharmaceutical treatises and terms more deeply described in his later [[pharmacopeia]] ''Enquiridion'' or ''Dispensarium''.  Michel mentions two of his teachers, [[Jacques Dubois|Sylvius]] and [[Andernach]], but above all, [[Galen]]. This work had a strong impact in those times.
*1538 ''Apologetic discourse of Michel de Villeneuve in favour of [[Astrology]] and against a certain physician. Michaelis Villanovani in quedam medicum apologetica disceptatio pro Astrologia.'' Servetus denounces Jean Tagault, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, for attacking astrology, while many great thinkers and physicians praised it. He lists reasonings of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]], how the stars are related to some aspects of a patient's health, and how a good physician can predict effects by them: the effect of the moon and sun on the sea, the winds and rains, the period of women, the speed of the decomposition of the corpses of beasts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;2008 Krendal, Erich.

González Echeverría is nowadays also the main defender of the hypothesis that Michael Servetus was born in the city of [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] in the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Navarre#Spanish conquest|Navarre]], that both biological parents were actually Jewish [[conversos]], although the father's identity and biographical details are unknown,&lt;ref&gt;González Echeverría, ''Amor a la verdad'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and that his true name was "De Villanueva", while "Servetus" was a pseudonym that he used in Protestant lands, and for publishing his heretical theological works, showing no other data such as the city where they were printed, imprint mark nor mark of printer.&lt;ref name="Lovefortruth" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;González Echeverría, Francisco Javier "Michael Servetus or Michael de Villanueva. His connection with Navarre and its people," in: Michael Servetus or Michael de Villanueva. Commemoration of the 450th anniversary of the death of Michael Servetus, 1553.

Some previous scholars had defended the birth of Michael in Tudela in the 19th and early 20th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;It was supported, among others, by Spanish author Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo and by Unitarian historians Earl Morse Wilbur and George H. Williams,&lt;/ref&gt; but never with the theory of "Servetus" being a pseudonym. The established academic consensus on the matter is that he was born in [[Villanueva de Sijena]],&lt;ref&gt;it was defended by R. Bainton, ''op. cit.'', p. 2 (2005 edition), among others.&lt;/ref&gt; in the neighbouring region of [[Aragon]], as Servetus himself claimed in his early works and during the whole trial at Geneva; but with no documents, as stated in the judgement that ultimately led him to his death at the stake. Scholarly debate may be tarnished by local and regional interests, because González and some other scholars{{who|date=September 2012}} claim that the true reason behind the non-acceptance of these new works by several institutions studying Servetus has to do more with his line of research on the identity of Michael,&lt;ref&gt;''43rd Congress of the International Society for the History of Medicine 24-5 Medicine, philosophy, repression and present'' FJ Gonzalez Echeverria 2012 Book of abstracts p45-46&lt;/ref&gt; and his consequent different birthplace, which would be highly inconvenient for these institutions, with many trustees and members from Villanueva de Sijena, or even located there.&lt;ref&gt;Acte Conmmemoratiu del cinque centenary de Miguel Servet (1511–2011), 29 November 2011, Reial Acadèmia de Medicina de Catalunya Book of Abstracts sept 2012, Fuentes-page 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; González (Aragonese, born in Zaragoza, where he stayed until he obtained his baccalaureate)&lt;ref&gt;Herald of Aragon, 20 February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; lives and works in Tudela,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://elpais.com/diario/1998/12/14/paisvasco/913668016_850215.html Mikel Muez, "The Servetus "Detective"", published in ''El País'', Pamplona, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; where he claims that "De Villanueva" was actually born, and his research on the 10 new works by Servetus has been supported by a grant from the Health Department of the regional government of Navarre, but even while he was still defending his birthplace in Aragon, for he had not done any research on his identity. In a similar way events on this issue organized in Villanueva de Sijena and in Zaragoza have been supported by the regional government of Aragon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiohuesca.com/noticia/452370/Inauguracion-del-Congreso-Internacional-sobre-Servet-en-Zaragoza President of Aragon], opening ceremony of the Michael Servetus V centenary congress, organized by the MSI institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcentenario.miguelservet.org/eventos.htm Michael Servetus congress] by the MSI subsidized by the government of Aragon&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of whether he was really born in Villanueva of Aragon or in Tudela of Navarre, or somewhere else, the fact is that he was known as "Michael Servetus of Aragon" after his death by everybody,&lt;ref&gt;except his friends in France, where he used the name "Michel de Villeneuve" during more than 18 years, until his flight to Geneva where he remained few months&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Servetus' own family in Aragon was deeply disturbed and paid for an altar for the church of Villanueva in expiation for their relative's heresy. But this was done after Anton Servetus's death and for the name of Michael does not show up anywhere here, it does not show if Anton was an adoptive or true father. This altar was raised in 1558 and destroyed in 1938 during the Spanish Civil War. See J. Barón, ''op. cit.'', p. 33. Servetus' See also Mcadler USC press;Minutes from Kottek UCS 2012 p.23-24. Death found no particular echo in Tudela.&lt;/ref&gt; including Calvin&lt;ref&gt;According to González, Calvin never provided useful information on the identity of Michael, in his Letters by De Trie, he lies in the third one, on the information he is providing in the second one.&lt;/ref&gt; and other enemies, his [[antitrinitarian]] supporters, and sympathetic authors such as [[Sebastian Castellio]], and many others, both admirers and enemies of those theological works published by Servetus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">'''Piva''' ([[Montenegrin Cyrillic]]: Пива; {{IPA-sh|pîʋa|pron}}) is a historical region in  [[Montenegro]], which existed as a tribe also known as '''Pivljani''' (Пивљани, {{IPA-sh|pîʋʎaːni|pron}}). It is situated in the northwestern highlands of Montenegro, bordering the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The [[Piva river]] flows through the region. Regional center is the town of [[Plužine]].

==History==

===Ottoman period===
Piva was a ''nahiya'' of the Ottoman Empire, mentioned in the 1476–78 ''[[defter]]''.{{sfn|Blagojević|1971|pp=609–610}} It was earlier mentioned in the ''[[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]]'' (ca. 1300–10&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Živković|first1=T.|last2=Kunčer|first2=D.|title=Gesta regum Sclavorum, I–II|location=Београд|year=2009|pages=362–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as one of ten counties in the province of Podgorje,{{sfn|Blagojević|1971|p=11}} and in the [[St. Stephen Chrysobull]] of Serbian king [[Stefan Milutin]] (r. 1282–1321).{{sfn|Blagojević|1971|p=377}} It was part of [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] during Ottoman rule.

The [[Serbian Orthodox]] [[Piva Monastery]] has been standing in Piva since the 16th century. It has produced four Patriarchs of the Serbian Orthodox Church.

===Modern===
Under Prince [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] and the [[Congress of Berlin]] recognition, in 1878 the Piva together with the Serb Herzegovinian tribes of [[Banjani]], [[Nikšići]], [[Šaranci]], [[Drobnjaci]] and a large number of the [[Rudinjani]] formed the Old Herzegovina region of the new Montenegrin state.&lt;ref name="Banac1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivo Banac|title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC|date=2 February 1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-9493-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

During the [[Second World War]], people of the region fought in both the Serbian royalist [[Chetnik]] and communist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] [[resistance movements]], which fought against each other.

The tribe has since the arrest of [[Radovan Karadžić]], the wartime [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] president and member of the neighbourly Drobnjak tribe of Petnjica (from which also the Serbian language reformer [[Vuk Karadžić]] descends), petitioned for Tadić's excommunication from the tribe because of Karadžić's arrest. The arrest is seen as directly bad behavior against the Serbian people and from the Piva against the [[Drobnjaci|Drobnjak]] tribe, who had never before had any problems, and it is because of this Tadić's actions have been condemned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glas-javnosti.rs/clanak/svet/glas-javnosti-28-07-2008/dan-pivljani-hoce-da-se-odreknu-borisa-tadica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2007, at [[Harvard University]], former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] credited Putin with having "pulled Russia out of chaos" and said he was "assured a place in history", despite Gorbachev's claim that the news media have been suppressed and that election rules run counter to the democratic ideals he has promoted".&lt;ref&gt;Struck, Doug.

In the U.S. embassy cables, published by [[WikiLeaks]] in late 2010, Putin was called "[[Alpha (biology)|alpha dog]]" and compared with [[Batman]] (while [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was compared with Batman's crime-fighting partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]). American diplomats said Putin's Russia had become "a corrupt, autocratic kleptocracy centred on the leadership of Vladimir Putin, in which officials, oligarchs and organised crime are bound together to create a "virtual [[mafia state]]."&lt;ref name="LeighHarding2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Leigh|author2=Luke Harding|title=WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGLjvFNuaM4C&amp;pg=PT223|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-61039-062-0|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herpen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Van Herpen|title=Putinism: The Slow Rise of a Radical Right Regime in Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ri6uez6FGVsC&amp;pg=PA161|date=25 January 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-28280-4|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putin called it "slanderous".&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, Tom.

Following Putin's re-election in March 2012, the movement struggled to redefine its new course of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/politics/20121205/177935896.html|title= Russia's Anti-Putin Opposition: One Year On|work=[RIA Novosti]|date= 12 December 2012 |accessdate= 10 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early September 2014 [[Filaret (Denysenko)|Patriarch Filaret]], head of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate]], linked Putin with the [[Cain and Abel|biblical figure Cain]] because Filaret believed that although Putin claimed to be their “brother” he was responsible for "shedding the brotherly blood" of [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] during the [[War in Donbass]].&lt;ref name="into Judas Iscariot"/&gt; Filaret believed "[[Satan]] [[Demonic possession|went into him]], as into [[Judas Iscariot]]".&lt;ref name="into Judas Iscariot"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukrainian-church-leader-likens-putin-to-cain-and-says-he-is-under-the-influence-of-satan-9716344.html Ukrainian Church leader likens Putin to Cain and says he is under the influence of Satan], [[The Independent]] (6 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[w:14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] criticized Putin's foreign policy practices, claiming it to be responsible for isolating Russia from the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dalai Lama: Putin wants to ‘rebuild’ the Berlin Wall|url=https://nypost.com/2014/09/07/dalai-lama-putin-wants-to-rebuild-the-berlin-wall/|date=September 7, 2014|publisher=New York Post|author=Golding}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Putin is 'self-centred', Dalai Lama says|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Putin-is-self-centred-Dalai-Lama-says/articleshow/41957066.cms|date=September 7, 2014|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dalai Lama attacks 'self-centred' Vladimir Putin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/11080133/Dalai-Lama-attacks-self-centred-Vladimir-Putin.html|publisher=The Telegraph|author=Henderson|date=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Denis Volkov from Moscow [[Levada Center]] drawing any conclusions from Russian poll results or comparing them with Western polls is pointless as there's no real political competition in Russia. Unlike in democratic states the Russian voters aren't offered any "credible alternatives" and the public opinion is formed primarily with state-controlled media which promotes the ruling party and discredits any alternative candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Opinion: The truth about Putin’s 86-percent approval rating.

Putin also is a subject of [[Russian jokes]] and [[chastushka|chastushki]], such as the popular "[Before Putin] There Was No [[Orgasm]]" featured in the comedy film ''[[:ru:День выборов (фильм)|The Day of Elections]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sergeysv.net/songs/?id=ne-bylo-orgazma |title=Частушки (Не было оргазма) |publisher=Sergeysv.net |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[meta-joke]] that, since the coming of Putin to power, [[Vovochka|all the classic jokes]] about a smart yet rude boy called ''Вовочка'' (''Vovochka'', diminutive from [[Vladimir (name)|Vladimir]]) have suddenly become [[political joke]]s.

Putin features in the colouring book for children ''Vova and Dima'' (presented on his 59th birthday),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenta.ru/photo/2011/10/06/vovaanddima/ Вова и Дима] [[Lenta.ru]]&lt;/ref&gt; where he and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] are drawn as good-behaving little boys, and in the ''Superputin'' online comics series, where Putin and Medvedev are portrayed first as [[superhero]]es,&lt;ref name=Superputin/&gt; and then as a [[Races and factions of Warcraft#Trolls|troll]] and an [[Durotar|orc]] in the [[World of Warcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superputin.ru/ |title=Superputin official site |publisher=Superputin.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimir Putin was portrayed by internet personality [[Nice Peter]] in  his YouTube series ''[[Epic Rap Battles of History]]'', in Season 2's finale episode, "Rasputin vs. Stalin" (aired on April 22, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT2z0nrsQ8o] Epic Rap Battles of History Stalin vs. Rasputin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Putin earned a popular nickname of "dickhead" or "fuckface" ("хуйло" in Russian and Ukrainian) following the spread of the [[Putin khuilo!|very popular chant of football hooligans]] in [[Ukraine]]. On 14 June 2014, Ukraine's acting Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia cited the chant in front of the cameras during an anti-Russian rally at Russia's Embassy in [[Kiev|Kyiv]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/ukraine-minister-deshchytsia-abusive-putin-russia] Guardian, 15 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin has produced a large number of popular aphorisms and catch-phrases, known as ''putinisms''.&lt;ref name=putinisms&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_3535000/3535811.stm Путинизмы – "продуманный личный эпатаж"?] [[BBC]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them were first made during his annual Q&amp;A conferences, where Putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language.&lt;ref name=putinisms/&gt; The examples of most popular putinisms include:&lt;ref name=rian-putinisms&gt;[http://ria.ru/politics/20080507/106744531.html 20 высказываний Путина, ставших афоризмами] [[RIAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''{{Interlanguage link multi|Dunk them in toilets|ru|3=Мочить в сортире}}'' – One of the earliest "putinisms", made in September 1999, when he promised to destroy terrorists wherever they were found, including in toilets.&lt;ref name=rian-putinisms/&gt; A literal translation is 'to [[wetwork|wet]] them in toilets'. In 2010, Putin also promised to scrape the remaining terrorists out from the bottom of a sewer (выковырять со дна канализации).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izvestia.ru/news/360123 Премьер-министр Владимир Путин: Их нужно выковырять со дна канализации] ''Izvestia''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Comrade Wolf'' - Vladimir Putin's remark, describing the policies of the United States, many non-Russians found cryptic (Russia's neighbors tend to think this an example of [[psychological projection]] by Putin, reflecting instead his own behavior).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article715218.ece "Putin takes swipe at hungry America's 'Comrade Wolf'"], ''[[Times Online]]'', May 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase comes from the following [[Russian joke]]:
** Rabinovich is walking through the forest with a sheep, when both of them stumble into a pit. A few minutes later, a wolf also falls into the pit. The sheep gets nervous and starts bleating. "What's with all the ''baaahh, baaahh''?" Rabinovich asks. "Comrade Wolf knows whom to eat."
*''It sank.'' (Она утонула.) – Putin's short answer to a question from [[Larry King]] in September 2000 asking what happened to the [[Russian submarine K-141 Kursk]].&lt;ref name=rian-putinisms/&gt; Many criticized Putin for the cynicism perceived in this answer.
*''Plowed away like a slave on a galley'' (Пахал, как раб на галерах) – (The Russian verb пахать also has the general meaning of "to do hard work".) This is how Putin described his work as President of Russia from 2000 to 2008 during a Q&amp;A conference in February 2008.&lt;ref name=putinisms/&gt; Not only did the phrase itself became popular, but a wrong hearing of it— как раб ("like a slave") in Russian [[mondegreen|sounds almost identical]] to как краб ("like a crab")—led to the appearance of a popular Internet nickname for Putin, "Crabbe" (Russian: Крабе), while [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was (for some reason) similarly nicknamed Shmele (Russian: Шмеле, a non-existent [[vocative]] form of шмель, meaning "[[bumblebee]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsland.ru/news/detail/id/844510/ |title=Почему Путин – краб, Ленин – гриб, Медведев – шмель? |publisher=Newsland.ru |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ears of a dead [[donkey]]'' (От мертвого осла уши) – Quoting [[Ostap Bender]] from a popular Soviet novel ''[[The Little Golden Calf]]'', that was, according to Putin, what [[Latvia]] would receive instead of the western [[Pytalovsky District]] of Russia claimed by Latvia in a territorial dispute stemming from the [[Baltic states in the Soviet Union (1944–1991)#Resistance and deportations|Soviet border redrawing]].&lt;ref name=putinisms/&gt; On 27 March 2007 Russia and Latvia signed the treaty on state border, in which Latvia renounced its territorial claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utro.ru/articles/2007/03/27/636217.shtml |title=Россия и Латвия подписали договор о рубежах |publisher=Utro.ru |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''At the very least, a civil servant should have a head.'' (Как минимум государственный деятель должен иметь голову.) – Putin's response to [[Hillary Clinton]]'s claim that Putin has no soul. He also recommended that international relations be built without emotion and instead on the basis of the fundamental interests of the states involved.&lt;ref name=rian-putinisms/&gt;
[[File:Vladimir Putin-6.jpg|thumb|Putin during one of his annual Q&amp;A conferences, indicating with his pen.]]
*''Give my pen back.'' (Ручку верните.) – A phrase said by Putin to the industrial oligarch [[Oleg Deripaska]], after Deripaska was forced by Putin to sign, using Putin's pen, an agreement aimed at resolving a socioeconomic crisis in the [[monograd]] of [[Pikalyovo, Leningrad Oblast|Pikalyovo]] on 4 June 2009, which had escalated after the different owners of the [[aluminum oxide]] plant and connected enterprises in the town did not pay their workers' salaries and were unable to negotiate the terms on which the local industrial complex would work. Putin came to the scene personally to conduct the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw3d.de/dw/article/0,,4324131,00.html |title=Блогозрение: Волшебная ручка Путина |publisher=Dw3d.de |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Shearing a piglet'' (''Стричь поросенка'') – On 25 June 2013, Vladimir Putin revealed the surveillance [[whistleblower]] [[Edward Snowden]] was indeed in a Moscow airport, ending a global guessing game over the US fugitive's whereabouts. Putin lashed out at US accusations that Russia was harbouring a fugitive, saying "I'd rather not deal with such questions, because anyway it's like shearing a piglet—a lot of squealing but little wool".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/25/edward-snowden-moscow-vladimir-putin Putin: NSA whistleblower Snowden is in Moscow airport | World news].

*''Russia is not the kind of a country that extradites [[human rights]] activists.'' (''Россия не та страна которая выдаёт борцов за права человека.'') – This comment on Snowden during the Q&amp;A session with [[CNBC]] at the [[SPIEF]] on 23 May 2014 was followed by a storm of laughter and applause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1611339 "Путин о Сноудене: Россия не та страна, которая выдает борцов за права человека"] (retrieved January 16, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2014/05/23/putin-asks-why-obama-doesnt-get-a-job-in-a-court-or-something/ "Putin asks why Obama doesn‘t get ‘a job in a court or something’"], ''[[New York Post]]'', May 23, 2014 (retrieved January 16, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kommersant]]'' described the reaction as follows: "A tempest of elation and applause erupted, and a howl of laughter and weeping hung over the hall" ("Поднялась просто буря восторга, аплодисментов, над залом застрял стон из хохота и плача"), and commented that not everybody grasped the full meaning of the utterance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/pda/kommersant.html?id=2478907 "Под хохот мощных канонад"] (retrieved January 16, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen, who was gay in his youth, underwent years of psychotherapy in an attempt to heal childhood issues which he felt had led to his [[homosexuality]]. He says that his therapy and personal growth helped him to understand his same-sex attractions, and to eventually transition to [[heterosexuality]].

Cohen lives in [[Washington, D.C.]], with his wife and has three adult children.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt;  His foundation, the International Healing Foundation, offers psychotherapy, [[coaching]], [[teleconferencing]] classes, and healing [[seminar]]s for members of the [[LGBT community]] and those with unwanted same-sex attraction.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Biography==
Cohen has described a troubled childhood that he regards as the cause of his [[homosexuality]] later in life.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

He belongs to a Jewish family which attended a [[Reform Judaism]] synagogue. He became a [[bar mitzvah]] and was confirmed in that synagogue.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt; While attending [[Boston University]], he became an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]], and he later joined the [[Unification Church]] (which disapproves of homosexual behavior),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_uni.htm THE UNIFICATION CHURCH AND HOMOSEXUALITY] B.A. Robinson, [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] 2005&lt;/ref&gt; where he says he remained [[Celibacy|celibate]] for long periods.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; In 1982, Cohen married Jae Sook, a [[South Korea]]n woman suggested to him by church leader [[Sun Myung Moon]]. Cohen says that, during the first three years of his marriage, he underwent psychotherapy but was unable to find the help he needed, and therefore he found some healing with a boyfriend in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite web

While attending Boston University, I was introduced to Christianity and read the New Testament for the first time.  I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior in October 1972.  A few years later, I met the Unification Church and felt called to join in 1974.  From 1983, when I began psychotherapy and my healing journey, my relationship with the Unification Church began to wane.  In 1988, my family and I lived with the Wesleyan Christian Community, outside of Seattle, Washington.  We attended fellowship services with them for two and a half years.  Our ties to the Unification Church weakened until we finally left altogether in 1995.  For the next few years we attended many Christian churches.  In the fall of 1997, we met a local evangelical church in our community and joined in 1998.   We have been members ever since.

==Education==
Cohen received a [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor of arts]] degree from [[Boston University]] and a [[Master of Arts|master's degree]] in [[counseling psychology]] from [[Antioch University]].&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;

==Career==

===International Healing Foundation===
Cohen founded the International Healing Foundation in 1990, a [[nonprofit]] and [[tax-exempt]] organization that promotes conversion therapy.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;

He is not licensed as a therapist. In order to get around the licensing requirement, he asks for donations to his foundation instead of requiring payment. He has said: "I am not doing therapy per se. I'm coaching." Today, he trains therapists and [[clergy]] worldwide how to assist members of the [[LGBT community]] and those who experience unwanted same-sex attraction.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;

===Expulsion from the ACA===
In 2002, Cohen was permanently expelled from the [[American Counseling Association]] (ACA), after it accused him of six violations of its ethics code, which bars members from actions which "seek to meet their personal needs at the expense of clients, those that exploit the trust and dependency of clients, and for soliciting testimonials or promoting products in a deceptive manner."&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawprint.com/besen/012504_aca_letter.php |title=Notification of Results Letter |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103080104/http://www.rawprint.com/besen/012504_aca_letter.php |archivedate=January 3, 2007 }}, [[American Counseling Association]]. Retrieved 04-07-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen stated that the expulsion was for his efforts in the [[ex-gay movement]], specifically for the book ''Coming Out Straight'', and for one complaint. He did not appeal, and called the ACA "a biased organization"&lt;ref name="najafi2005"&gt;{{cite web

None of the major mental health or medical professional organizations, including the American Counseling Association, the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[American Medical Association]], the [[National Association of School Psychologists]], or the [[American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy]] believe [[Conversion therapy|reparative therapy]] is effective or necessary, and they caution that it can be very harmful to the patient, resulting in an increased instance of [[clinical depression]] and/or [[suicide]].

===Controversy===
According to the American Psychological Association (APA) and numerous other professional health organizations,&lt;ref name=APAResolution&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts|url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lies and Dangers of Efforts to Change Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy|website=Human Rights Campaign|publisher=The Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no conclusive evidence that [[sexual orientation]] can be changed through counseling or other means. According to a statement by the APA, they are "concerned about ongoing efforts to mischaracterize homosexuality and promote the notion that sexual orientation can be changed, and about the resurgence of sexual orientation change efforts." Their official statement goes on to state that clinicians should approach clients who express a desire to change their sexual orientation by "affirmative multiculturally competent and client-centered approaches that recognize the negative impact of [[social stigma]] on [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], and balance ethical principles of [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[nonmaleficence]], [[justice]], and respect for people’s [[rights]] and [[dignity]]."&lt;ref name=APAResolution /&gt;

===Media appearances===
Cohen has given numerous interviews in newspapers, on radio shows, and on television shows, including ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show|Rachel Maddow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfq92Bw7FZY|title=Interview with Richard Cohen|last=|first=|date=|work=The Rachel Maddow Show|year=2010|access-date=|via=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'', ''[[Larry King Live]]'', ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'', ''[[Ricki Lake (TV series)|Ricki Lake]]'', and ''[[Paula Zahn]] Now''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/23/pzn.01.htm ''New Therapy Claims to "Cure" Homosexuality''], Paula Zahn Now, May 23, 2006, CNN.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen was also featured in an episode of ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/episodes.do?episodeid=123917&amp;ep=302 Showtime: Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! Season 3 Episode 2: "Family Values"]. Retrieved on February 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Cohen appeared in a documentary by Blackstone Films&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackstonefilms.org&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "The Third Way: Homosexuality and the Catholic Church."&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/93079367&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen was interviewed by [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]] on the March 19, 2007, episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-march-19-2007/diagnosis--mystery-pt--2&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen was on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on June 28, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837645/&lt;/ref&gt; was interviewed on ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' on December 8, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#34337416 Rachel Maddow: Debunking a 'cure' for homosexuality&lt;/ref&gt; and was on ''The [[Michelangelo Signorile]] Show'' on the [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] radio network on April 17, 2010.

==Ideas regarding sexual orientation==
Cohen claims there were multiple causes of his same-sex attraction, such as [[Sexual abuse|abuse]] by his uncle, over-attachment to his mother, and lack of sufficient father-son bonding. He mentioned that repeated [[Child sex abuse|molestation]] by a male relative was just one factor that caused him to develop same-sex attraction.  He says that dealing with the psychological damage that resulted from the abuse and from other factors allowed him to revert to his "natural [[heterosexuality]]". He believes that all homosexuals are actually heterosexuals who can find peace and self-esteem through healing and restoration of their natural heterosexuality.

In Cohen's 2001 book ''Coming Out Straight'', he calls homosexuality a "same-sex attachment disorder", and details his methods of [[Conversion therapy|sexual reorientation therapy]]. He outlines his theory of the causes of same-sex attraction (among them lack of bonding between father-son and mother-daughter, over-attachment with the opposite-sex parent, lack of same-gender peer bonding, hypersensitive temperament, potential [[sexual abuse]], and other factors)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/12/09/maddow Quote from book (link to Maddow interview in which he defends quote)]. Retrieved on 12-10-2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and his methods of changing sexual orientation, and relays stories of people who have undergone his therapies.

Cohen describes the "hidden meanings" of same-sex attraction as:
#need for same-sex parent's love
#need for gender identification
#fear of intimacy with the opposite sex&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaytostraight.org/resources.htm Audio Tapes and CDs (order page from Richard Cohen's website)]. Retrieved on 04-07-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen believes that there are temperamental, familial, and environmental causes for same-sex attraction in men and women. &lt;!--Cohen claims several root causes of same-sex attraction, including heredity; temperament; family dynamics; "wounds" from a parent or sibling; social, peer, or cultural "wounds"; body image "wounds"; and sexual abuse. Cohen employs as many as 22 techniques, including [[family systems therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], [[meditation]] and [[affirmation]]s, "[[inner child]] healing", and [[journaling]].--&gt; Cohen uses a variety of therapeutic techniques, including: [[behavior therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], [[psychodynamic]] modalities and [[bioenergetic analysis|bioenergetics]].&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;&lt;!--, which involves physical exercises that are purported to facilitate the resurgence of repressed feelings. The International Institute for Bioenergetic Analysis states that this activity allows the client to confront and process these feelings, working towards forgiveness and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.bioenergetic-therapy.com/iibamain/about/1frm_about.htm What is Bioenergetic Analysis?], The International Institute for Bioenergetic Analysis.  Retrieved on 04-11-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Cohen also uses [[holding therapy]], which involves using physical touch and repeating affirming words to attempt to establish healthy, non-sexual bonding that may have been absent during childhood.&lt;ref name="brown2006"&gt;Brown, J. [http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/6/202006a.asp Experts Split Over 'Bizarre' Sexual Orientation Therapy Techniques] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224190858/http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/6/202006a.asp |date=2007-02-24 }}, Agape Press, 06-20-2006.  Retrieved on 04-07-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Cohen's counselor-training program manual, he states that only opposite-sex attracted mentors or same-gender parents should give holding therapy, and he quotes from his own 2000 book ''Coming Out Straight'' that the mentor should not be the same person as the therapist.&lt;ref name="cohen2008-2000"&gt;{{cite web

In the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Sam''' was the third son of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]], and elder brother to the [[prophet]] [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]].  Early in the Book of Mormon narrative, Nephi confided in Sam.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|2|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lehi saw Sam in his vision of the tree of life, noting that he ate the precious fruit, symbolizing the righteousness of Sam, and that he would be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the death of Lehi, Sam followed his brother Nephi in the establishment of the [[Nephites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|5|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Alken''' Sr. ([[London]] October 22, 1756 &amp;ndash; November 9, 1815 [[London]]) was an English [[artist]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Grove Dictionary of Art'' David Alexander 
 on Samuel Alken at [http://www.artnet.com/library/00/0018/T001854.asp artnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a leading exponent of the newly developed technique of [[aquatint]].

==History==
Samuel Alken entered the [[Royal Academy Schools]], London, as a sculptor in 1772. He published ''A New Book of Ornaments Designed and Etched by Samuel Alken'' in 1779, and later established himself as one of the most competent engravers in the new technique of aquatint.

His works included plates after [[George Morland]], [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]] and [[Francis Wheatley (painter)|Francis Wheatley]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Alken, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plates for ''Sixteen views of the lakes in Cumberland and Westmorland''  after drawings  [[John Emes]] and John Smith &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=List Of New Publications, And New Editions|journal=The Register of the Times, Or: Political Museum|date=1795|volume=6|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NME_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixteen views of the lakes in Cumberland and Westmorland|url=http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/2034876|publisher=Yale Center For British Art|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were  published in 1796,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; and a set of aquatint views of North Wales  after drawings by the Rev.

'''"Star Collector"''' is a [[song]] written by [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]] in 1967 and recorded by [[The Monkees]] (with lead vocals by [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]]).  The song is included on their fourth album, ''[[Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.]]'' It was also featured in five second-season episodes of their [[The Monkees (TV series)|television series]]: "The Wild Monkees", "Hitting the High Seas", "Monkees Watch Their Feet", "Monkees in Paris" and "Monkees Mind Their Manor".  "The Wild Monkees" uses an early mix of the song (without Moog synthesizer) while the other episodes use the released mix.

The song is about the phenomenon of [[groupies]], and takes a dismissive attitude toward them ("Think I'll let her keep on going, wherever it is she's going to / Give her an autograph and tell her 'It's been nice knowing you'"... "It won't take much time / Before I get her off my mind").

The Monkees's version of the song was one of the first pop records to include a [[Moog synthesizer]], played and programmed by synthesist [[Paul Beaver]]. [[Peter Tork]] didn't think much of Beaver's performance, and told [[Rhino Records]] later "He played it like it was a flute or something," preferring [[Micky Dolenz]]'s more random use of the Moog on "[[Daily Nightly]]" (which also appeared on ''Pisces'') to produce spacey sounds.

'''''This is Your Day''''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[television]] show hosted by Pastor [[Benny Hinn]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=26217 '''Baptist Press''' 'Health &amp; wealth gospel' critiqued] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184511/http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=26217 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and broadcast several times a week in the United States and globally by the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], the [[Daystar Television Network]], [[Revelation TV]], [[Grace TV]], [[VisionTV]], [[INSP Networks]], [[The God Channel]] and various local affiliates to an estimated four million followers. The program began airing in 1990 and is a half-hour long.

==Synopsis==
During the program, Benny Hinn and his guests teach, read letters, pray, and show highlights from Hinn's "Miracle Healing Services." Hinn and his crew travel the world frequently, and a large part of the show is devoted to his global services, in which Hinn is said to imbue people with the power of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Many claim to have risen from wheelchairs, or to have been healed of other ailments. Towards the final portion of the program Hinn offers gifts such as books, CDs, DVDs and downloadable materials as a thank-you to viewers who donate to the ministry. He then prays for the prayer needs of his viewing audience.  Finally he concludes with an invitation for viewers to receive [[Jesus]] as their personal savior.

==Controversy==
The program has generated controversy due to widespread skepticism about Hinn's [[faith healing]]s depicted in the show. Investigative news programs such as ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[Dateline NBC]]'', and ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|the fifth estate]]''&lt;ref name="FifthEstate"&gt;{{cite news

'''Workers''' ({{zh|t=工人|s=工人|p=gongren}}) is a book of 143 portraits of migrant workers who participated in the construction of the [[Olympic Green]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in the lead up to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].  The book is the work of British artist Helen Couchman and consists primarily of photographs of the workers on the building site. The workers were photographed with the iconic buildings of the Beijing Olympics: The [[Beijing National Stadium]] (国家体育场), known colloquially as the "Bird's Nest" (鸟巢), and the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] (国家游泳中心), also known as the "Water Cube" (水立方).

[[File:Jhang Gao pages 22-23.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of Zhang Gao and his signature from the series ''Workers 工人''&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Background ==
At the height of its construction, nearly 17,000 workers were involved in building the "Bird's Nest".&lt;ref name=ReuDie&gt;{{cite news |first= Nick|last= Mulvenney|author2=Alex Richardson |title= Beijing says 2 died in Bird's Nest construction|url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKPEK10105320080128?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date= 28 Jan 2008|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Workers 工人'' documents the human side of construction with worker portraits, information on the workers themselves, and details on how Couchman carried out the project.  In December 2007, Couchman circumvented security on the Olympic construction site and was able to approach the workers about taking their pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Toy, Mary-Anne.

Retrieved 29 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  She later returned to the site with two copies of each photo, giving each of her subjects one copy to keep and asked the workers to write their name and hometown on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Dan. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/arts/design/10expatsweb.html?_r=1 "For Expatriates in China, Creative Lives of Plenty"], ''The New York Times'', 8 January 2010. Retrieved 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Couchman felt that the element of exchange was key to this project.&lt;ref&gt;Ghomeshi, Jian. [http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/qpodcast_20080630_6503.mp3 "Q: Arts and Culture"], ''CBC Radio'', 30 June 2008, Retrieved 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In the book's introduction, British art critic Peter Suchin writes that the way Couchman positions the workers at roughly the same spot for each portrait suggests they can also be seen as "one single portrait, that of `the worker' engaged in the making of the Place of the Games ... the central focus, the essential signifier of the new Beijing".  Photographs from this series were exhibited in [[London]], England and [[Hong Kong]]. Discussions of workers' rights have been raised in the context of this book, but it was not Couchman's reason for starting the project.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Tse-wei.
