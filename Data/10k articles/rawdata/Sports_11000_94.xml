'''Altitude training''' is the practice by some [[endurance]] [[Sportsperson|athlete]]s of training for several weeks at high [[altitude]], preferably over {{convert|8000|ft|m|disp=flip}} above [[sea level]], though more commonly at intermediate altitudes due to the shortage of suitable high-altitude locations. At intermediate altitudes, the air still contains approximately 20.9% [[oxygen]], but the [[barometric pressure]] and thus the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen is reduced.&lt;ref name="pmid8904608"&gt;{{cite journal |last=West|first=JB |title=Prediction of barometric pressures at high altitude with the use of model atmospheres |journal=J.

Some athletes live permanently at high altitude, only returning to sea level to compete, but their training may suffer due to less available oxygen for workouts.

Altitude training can be [[Simulation|simulated]] through use of an [[altitude tent|altitude simulation tent]], [[altitude room|altitude simulation room]], or mask-based [[hypoxicator]] system where the barometric pressure is kept the same, but the oxygen content is reduced which also reduces the partial pressure of oxygen. [[Hypoventilation training]], which consists of reducing the breathing frequency while exercising, can also mimic altitude training by significantly decreasing blood and muscle oxygenation.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Woorons, "[http://www.hypoventilation-training.com/Activity.html Hypoventilation training, push your limits!]", Arpeh, 2014, 176 p ({{ISBN|978-2-9546040-1-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background history ==
[[File:13-07-23-kienbaum-unterdruckkammer-33.jpg|thumb|Altitude training in a low-pressure room in East Germany]]
The study of altitude training was heavily delved into during and after the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], which took place in [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]]: elevation {{convert|7349|ft|m|disp=flip}}. It was during these Olympic Games that endurance events saw significant below-record finishes while anaerobic, sprint events broke all types of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico 1968 Summer Olympics|publisher=Olympics.org|url=http://www.olympic.org/mexico-1968-summer-olympics}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated prior to these events how the altitude might affect performances of these elite, world-class athletes and most of the conclusions drawn were equivalent to those hypothesized: that endurance events would suffer and that short events would not see significant negative changes. This was attributed not only to less resistance during movement—due to the less dense air&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward-Smith|year=1983|title=The influence of aerodynamic and biomechanical factors on long jump performance|journal=Journal of Biomechanics| volume=16| pages=655–658| doi=10.1016/0021-9290(83)90116-1| pmid=6643537| first1=AJ| issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but also to the anaerobic nature of the sprint events. Ultimately, these games inspired investigations into altitude training from which unique training principles were developed with the aim of avoiding underperformance.

==Training regimens==
Athletes or individuals who wish to gain a competitive edge for endurance events can take advantage of exercising at high altitude. [[High altitude]] is typically defined as any elevation above {{convert|5000|ft|m|disp=flip}}.

===Live-high, train-low===
One suggestion for optimizing adaptations and maintaining performance is the live-high, train-low principle. This training idea involves living at higher altitudes in order to experience the physiological adaptations that occur, such as increased [[Erythropoietin|erythropoietin (EPO)]] levels, increased red blood cell levels, and higher [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Acta Physiol Scand|year=2001|volume=173|pages=275–286|
title=Live high:train low increases muscle buffer capacity and submaximal cycling efficiency |first1=CJ |last1=Gore |first2=AG |last2=Hahn |first3=RJ |last3=Aughey |first4=DT |last4=Martin  |doi=10.1046/j.1365-201X.2001.00906.x |pmid=11736690 |issue=3 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11619152_Live_hightrain_low_increases_muscle_buffer_capacity_and_submaximal_cycling_efficiency/file/79e4150ed3857d7114.pdf|displayauthors=4|last5=Ashenden|last6=Clark|first6=S.

J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining the same exercise intensity during training at sea level. Due to the environmental differences at high altitude, it may be necessary to decrease the intensity of workouts. Studies examining the live-high, train-low theory have produced varied results, which may be dependent on a variety of factors such as individual variability, time spent at high altitude, and the type of training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=BD|first2=J|last2=Stray-Gunderson|year=2001|title=The effects of altitude training are mediated primarily by acclimatization rather than by hypoxic exercise|journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|volume=502|pages=75–88|pmid=11950157|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-3401-0_7|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-1-4419-3374-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stray-Gundersen|first1=J|last2=Chapman|first2=RF|last3=Levine|first3=BD|year=2001|title="Living high — training low" altitude training improves sea level performance in male and female elite runners|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=91|pages=1113–1120|pmid=11509506|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been shown that athletes performing primarily anaerobic activity do not necessarily benefit from altitude training as they do not rely on oxygen to fuel their performances.

Altitude training can produce increases in speed, strength, endurance, and recovery by maintaining altitude exposure for a significant period of time. A study using simulated altitude exposure for 18 days, yet training closer to sea-level, showed performance gains were still evident 15 days later.&lt;ref name="pmid16179396"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brugniaux|first1=JV|last2=Schmitt|first2=L|last3=Robach|first3=P|last4=Nicolet|first4=G|last5=Fouillot|first5=JP|last6=Moutereau|first6=S|last7=Lasne|first7=F|last8=Pialoux|first8=V|last9=Saas|first9=P|last10=Chorvot|first10=MC|last11=Cornolo|first11=J|last12=Olsen|first12=NV|last13=Richalet|first13=JP|displayauthors=4 |title=Eighteen days of "living high, training low" stimulate erythropoiesis and enhance aerobic performance in elite middle-distance runners |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=203–11 | date=January 2006 |pmid=16179396 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00808.2005 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/100/1/203.full|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of altitude training argue that an athlete's red blood cell concentration returns to normal levels within days of returning to sea level and that it is impossible to train at the same intensity that one could at sea level, reducing the training effect and wasting training time due to [[altitude sickness]]. Altitude training can produce slow recovery due to the stress of hypoxia.&lt;ref name=Smoliga&gt;{{cite journal|first=J|last=Smoliga|title=High-altitude training for distance runners|journal=Track Coach|volume=188|date=Summer 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to extreme hypoxia at altitudes above {{convert|5000|m|ft|disp=flip}} can lead to considerable deterioration of skeletal muscle tissue. Five weeks at this altitude leads to a loss of muscle volume of the order of 10–15%.&lt;ref name=HoppelerVogt&gt;{{cite journal|title=Muscle tissue adaptations to hypoxia|last1=Hoppeler|first1=H|last2=Vogt|first2=M|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=204|pages=3133–3139|year=2001|publisher=The Company of Biologists Ltd|issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live-high, train-high===
In the live-high, train-high regime, an athlete lives and trains at a desired altitude. The stimulus on the body is constant because the athlete is continuously in a hypoxic environment. Initially VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max drops considerably: by around 7% for every 1000&amp;nbsp;m above sea level) at high altitudes. Athletes will no longer be able to [[metabolize]] as much oxygen as they would at sea level. Any given velocity must be performed at a higher relative intensity at altitude.&lt;ref name=Smoliga/&gt; However, after long periods of training at altitude, highly trained athletes returning to sea level do not exhibit increased red blood cell count or improved performance on 4000&amp;nbsp;m cycling tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=C |last1=Gore |first2=N |last2=Hahn |first3=A |last3=Rice |first4=A |last4=Bourdon  |title=Altitude training at 2690m does not increase total Haemoglobin mass or sea level V̇O2max in world champion track cyclists |journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=September 1998 |pages=156–170 |doi=10.1016/S1440-2440(98)80011-X |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S144024409880011X |pmid=9783517 |displayauthors=4|last5=Lawrence |last6=Walsh |first6=Steve |last7=Stanef |first7=Charlie |last8=Barnes |first8=Tom |last9=Parisotto |first9=Peter |last10=Martin |first10=Robin |last11=Pyne |first11=David |last12=Pyne |first12=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeated sprints in hypoxia ===
In repeated sprints in [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] (RSH), athletes run short sprints under 30 seconds as fast as they can. They experience incomplete recoveries in hypoxic conditions. The exercise to rest time ratio is less than 1:4, which means for every 30 second all out sprint, there is less than 120 seconds of rest.&lt;ref name="hypoxia training"/&gt;

When comparing RSH and repeated sprints in [[normoxic|normoxia]] (RSN), studies show that RSH improved time to fatigue and power output. RSH and RSN groups were tested before and after a 4-week training period. Both groups initially completed 9–10 all-out sprints before total [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]].  After the 4 week training period, the RSH group was able to complete 13 all out sprints before exhaustion and the RSN group only completed 9.&lt;ref name="hypoxia training" /&gt;

Possible physiological advantages from RSH include compensatory [[vasodilation]] and regeneration of [[phosphocreatine]] (PCr). The body’s tissues have the ability to sense hypoxia and induce vasodilation. The higher blood flow helps the skeletal muscles maximize oxygen delivery. A greater level of PCr resynthesis augments the muscles power production during the initial stages of high-intensity exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contribution of phosphocreatine and aerobic metabolism to energy supply during repeated sprint exercise|first1=GC|last1=Bogdanis|first2=ME|last2=Nevill|first3=LH|last3=Boobis|first4=HK|last4=Lakomy|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology Published |date=1 March 1996|volume=80|issue=3|pages=876-884}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RSH is still a relatively new training method and is not fully understood.&lt;ref name="hypoxia training"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faiss|first1=Raphael|first2=Olivier|last2=Girard|first3=Gregoire P|last3=Millet|title=Advancing hypoxic training in team sports: from intermittent hypoxic training to repeated sprint training in hypoxia|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=47|date=11 September 2013|pages=i45–i50|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2013-092741|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/47/Suppl_1/i45.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial altitude===
Altitude simulation systems have enabled protocols that do not suffer from the tension between better altitude physiology and more intense workouts. Such simulated altitude systems can be utilized closer to competition if necessary.

In [[Finland]], a scientist named [[Heikki Rusko]] has designed a "high-altitude house." The air inside the house, which is situated at sea level, is at normal pressure but modified to have a low concentration of oxygen, about 15.3% (below the 20.9% at sea level), which is roughly equivalent to the amount of oxygen available at the high altitudes often used for altitude training due to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen at altitude. Athletes live and sleep inside the house, but perform their training outside (at normal oxygen concentrations at 20.9%). Rusko's results show improvements of EPO and red-cell levels.

Artificial altitude can also be used for hypoxic exercise, where athletes train in an altitude simulator which mimics the conditions a high altitude environment. Athletes are able to perform high intensity training at lower velocities and thus produce less stress on the musculoskeletal system.&lt;ref name=Smoliga/&gt; This is beneficial to an athlete who suffered a musculoskeletal injury and is unable to apply large amounts of stress during exercise which would normally be needed to generate high intensity cardiovascular training. Hypoxia exposure for the time of exercise alone is not sufficient to induce changes in hematologic parameters. Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations remain in general unchanged.&lt;ref name=HoppelerVogt/&gt; There are a number of  companies who provide altitude training system, most notably [[Hypoxico, Inc.]] who pioneered the artificial altitude training systems in the mid 1990s.

A South African scientist named Neil Stacey has proposed the opposite approach, using oxygen enrichment to provide a training environment with an oxygen partial pressure even higher than at sea level. This method is intended to increase training intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neil|first=Stacey,|date=2017-10-17|title=Oxygen enrichment to enhance training effectiveness and physiological adaptation|journal=Zenodo|language=en|doi=10.5281/zenodo.1013924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles and mechanisms ==

Altitude training works because of the difference in atmospheric pressure between sea level and high altitude. At sea level, air is denser and there are more molecules of gas per litre of air. Regardless of altitude, air is composed of 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen. As the altitude increases, the pressure exerted by these gases decreases. Therefore, there are fewer molecules per unit volume: this causes a decrease in partial pressures of gases in the body, which elicits a variety of physiological changes in the body that occur at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A High Altitude Resource|url=http://www.altitude.org/home.php|publisher=Altitude.org|access-date=2010-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416170609/http://www.altitude.org/home.php|archive-date=2010-04-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physiological adaptation that is mainly responsible for the performance gains achieved from altitude training, is a subject of discussion among researchers. Some, including American researchers Ben Levine and Jim Stray-Gundersen, claim it is primarily the increased red blood cell volume.&lt;ref name="pmid16227463"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levine|first1=BD|last2=Stray-Gundersen|first2=J |title=Point: positive effects of intermittent hypoxia (live high:train low) on exercise performance are mediated primarily by augmented red cell volume |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=99 |issue=5 |pages=2053–5 | date=November 2005 |pmid=16227463 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00877.2005 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/99/5/2053.long |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, including Australian researcher Chris Gore, and New Zealand researcher Will Hopkins, dispute this and instead claim the gains are primarily a result of other adaptions such as a switch to a more economic mode of oxygen utilization.&lt;ref name="pmid16227464"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gore|first1=CJ|last2=Hopkins|first2=WG |title=Counterpoint: positive effects of intermittent hypoxia (live high:train low) on exercise performance are not mediated primarily by augmented red cell volume |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=99 |issue=5 |pages=2055–7; discussion 2057–8 | date=November 2005 |pmid=16227464 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00820.2005 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/99/5/2055.full |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- many comments on this point-counterpoint discussion in the Journal of Applied Physiology --&gt;

===Increased red blood cell volume===
[[File:RBC micrograph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Human red blood cells]]
At high altitudes, there is a decrease in oxygen hemoglobin saturation. This hypoxic condition causes [[hypoxia-inducible factor 1]] (HIF1) to become stable and stimulates the production of [[erythropoietin]] (EPO), a [[hormone]] secreted by the [[kidneys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Erythropoietin and erythropoiesis: polycythemias due to disruption of oxygen homeostasis|first1=JT|last1=Prchal|first2=YD|last2=Pastore|journal=Hematology Journal|volume=5|pages=S110–S113|year=2004|doi=10.1038/sj.thj.6200434|pmid=15190290}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPO stimulates red blood cell production from [[bone marrow]] in order to increase hemoglobin saturation and oxygen delivery. Some athletes demonstrate a strong red blood cell response to altitude while others see little or no gain in red cell mass with chronic exposure.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLevine&gt;{{cite journal|title=Altitude training for the marathon|last1=Chapman|first1=R|last2=Levine|first2=BD|journal=Sports Medicine|volume=37|pages=392–395|year=2007|publisher=Springer|issue=4|doi=10.2165/00007256-200737040-00031}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain how long this adaptation takes because various studies have found different conclusions based on the amount of time spent at high altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rupert|first1=JL|first2=PW|last2=Hochachka|year=2001|title=Genetic approaches to understanding human adaptation to altitude in the Andes|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=204|pages=3151–60|pmid=11581329|issue=Pt 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While EPO occurs naturally in the body, it is also made synthetically to help treat patients suffering from [[kidney failure]] and to treat patients during [[chemotherapy]]. Over the past thirty years, EPO has become frequently abused by competitive athletes through [[blood doping]] and injections in order to gain advantages in endurance events. Abuse of EPO, however, increases RBC counts beyond normal levels ([[polycythemia]]) and increases the viscosity of blood, possibly leading to [[hypertension]] and increasing the likelihood of a [[blood clot]], [[heart attack]] or [[stroke]]. The natural secretion of EPO by the human kidneys can be increased by altitude training, but the body has limits on the amount of natural EPO that it will secrete, thus avoiding the harmful side effects of the illegal doping procedures.

===Other mechanisms===
Other mechanisms have been proposed to explain the utility of altitude training. Not all studies show a statistically significant increase in red blood cells from altitude training. One study explained the success by increasing the intensity of the training (due to increased heart and respiration rate).&lt;ref name="pmid16179396"/&gt; This improved training resulted in effects that lasted more than 15 days after return to sea level.

Another set of researchers claim that altitude training stimulates a more efficient use of oxygen by the muscles.&lt;ref name="pmid16227464"/&gt; This efficiency can arise from numerous other responses to altitude training, including [[angiogenesis]], glucose transport, [[glycolysis]], and pH regulation, each of which may partially explain improved endurance performance independent of a greater number of red blood cells.&lt;ref name="pmid17805094"/&gt; Furthermore, exercising at high altitude has been shown to cause muscular adjustments of selected gene transcripts, and improvement of mitochondrial properties in skeletal muscle.&lt;ref name="pmid16540710"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zoll|first1=J|last2=Ponsot|first2=E|last3=Dufour|first3=S|last4=Doutreleau|first4=S|last5=Ventura-Clapier|first5=R|last6=Vogt|first6=M|last7=Hoppeler|first7=H|last8=Richard|first8=R|last9=Flück|first9=M|displayauthors=4 |title=Exercise training in normobaric hypoxia in endurance runners.

In a study comparing rats active at high altitude versus rats active at sea level, with two sedentary control groups, it was observed that [[muscle fiber]] types changed according to [[homeostatic]] challenges which led to an increased metabolic efficiency during the beta oxidative cycle and [[citric acid cycle]], showing an increased utilization of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for aerobic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bigard|first1=AX|last2=Brunet|first2=A|last3=Guezennec|first3=CY|last4=Monod|first4=H|year=1991|title=Skeletal muscle changes after endurance training at high altitude|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=71|pages=2114–2121|pmid=1778900|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lower atmospheric pressure at high altitudes, the air pressure within the breathing system must be lower than it would be at low altitudes in order for inhalation to occur. Therefore, inhalation at high altitudes typically involves a relatively greater lowering of the thoracic diaphragm than at low altitudes.

'''Carlisle Cricket Club Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Kimmage]], [[South Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The grounds were built by members of the Jewish Community and finally opened in March 1954. Other sports such as Soccer, Rugby, Tennis were played on the grounds.

The first recorded senior league match on the ground was in 1970, when Carlisle joined the Senior League status.

South Leinster played North West in 1970 there also.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/60/1304_misc.html Other matches played on Carlisle Cricket Club Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

July 1990 saw the ground host its first International when Ireland played host to Wales for a 3 Day International Match.

The ground also hosted a single [[Women's One Day International cricket|Women's One Day International]] match which saw  [[Ireland women's cricket team|Ireland women]] played [[New Zealand women's cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/60/1304_wo.html Women's One-Day International Matches played on Carlisle Cricket Club Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

In local domestic cricket, the ground was the home ground of South Leinster, as well as Carlisle Cricket Club.  Sometime after the final recorded match on the ground in 1998, the ground was sold to Ben Dunne for development as a Gym and is today called "Carlisle Gym".

The '''Champion Stakes''' is a [[Group races|Group 1]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to [[thoroughbred]]s aged three years or older. It is run at [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]] over a distance of 1 mile and 2 furlongs (2,012 metres), and it is scheduled to take place as part of [[British Champions Day]] each year in October.

==History==
The event was established in 1877, and it was originally held at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]. The inaugural running was won by [[Springfield (horse)|Springfield]]. By the end of the century it had been won by five [[British Classic Races|Classic]] winners.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Champion Stakes was classed at the highest level, Group 1.

The race was included in the [[Breeders' Cup Challenge]] series in 2009 and 2010. The winner earned an automatic invitation to compete in the [[Breeders' Cup Turf]].

The Champion Stakes was transferred to Ascot in 2011. It became part of a newly created fixture called British Champions Day. It now serves as the middle-distance final of the [[British Champions Series]].

With an increased prize fund of £1,300,000, the Champion Stakes was Britain's richest horse race in 2011. The status was reclaimed by [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epsom Derby officially richest horse race in the country | url = http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/9675184.Epsom_Derby_officially_richest_horse_race/ | publisher = Your Local Guardian | date = 28 April 2012 | accessdate = 27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exercise-induced asthma''', or '''E.I.A.''', occurs when the airways narrow as a result of exercise.  The preferred term for this condition is '''exercise-induced bronchoconstriction''' ('''EIB'''); exercise does not cause [[asthma]], but is frequently an asthma trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=DA|title=Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: burden and prevalence|journal=Allergy and Asthma Proceedings|date=Jan–Feb 2012|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–6|pmid=22370526|doi=10.2500/aap.2012.33.3507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms ==
It might be expected that people with E.I.B. would present with [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], and/or an [[tachypnea|elevated respiratory rate]] and [[wheezing]], consistent with an asthma attack.  However, many will present with decreased stamina, or difficulty in recovering from exertion compared to team members, or paroxysmal coughing from an irritable airway.&lt;ref name=Parsons&gt;{{cite journal | title=Screening for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in college athletes |vauthors=Parsons JP, Cosmar D, Phillips G, Kaeding C, Best TM, Mastronarde JG | date=March 2012 | journal=J Asthma | volume=49 |issue=2 | pages=153–7 | pmid=22276571 |  doi= 10.3109/02770903.2011.652329 |pmc=3832203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, examination may reveal wheezing and  prolonged expiratory phase, or may be quite normal.  Consequently, a potential for under-diagnosis exists.  Measurement of airflow, such as peak expiratory flow rates, which can be done inexpensively on the track or sideline, may prove helpful.

== Cause==
While the potential triggering events for E.I.B. are well recognized, the underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood.&lt;ref name=CAAR&gt;{{cite journal | title=Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: Pathogenesis |vauthors=Anderson SD, Kippelen P |date=March 2005 | journal=Current Allergy and Asthma Reports | volume=5 |issue=2 | pages=116–22 | doi= 10.1007/s11882-005-0084-y |pmid=15683611}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually occurs after at least several minutes of vigorous, [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activity, which increases oxygen demand to the point where breathing through the nose (nasal breathing) must be supplemented by mouth breathing.  The resultant inhalation of air that has not been warmed and humidified by the nasal passages seems to generate increased blood flow to the linings of the bronchial tree, resulting in [[edema]].  Constriction of these small airways then follows, worsening the degree of obstruction to airflow.  There is increasing evidence that the smooth muscle that lines the airways becomes progressively more sensitive to changes that occur as a result of injury to the airways from dehydration.  The chemical mediators that provoke the muscle spasm appear to arise from [[mast cell]]s.&lt;ref name=CAAR /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can be difficult to diagnose clinically given the lack of specific symptoms&lt;ref name=Parsons /&gt; and frequent misinterpretation as manifestations of vigorous exercise.  There are many mimics that present with similar symptoms, such as [[vocal cord dysfunction]], [[cardiac arrhythmias]], [[cardiomyopathies]], and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].  It is also important to distinguish those who have asthma with exercise worsening, and who consequently will have abnormal testing at rest, from true exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, where there will be normal baseline results.  Because of the wide differential diagnosis of exertional respiratory complaints, the diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction based on history and self-reported symptoms alone has been shown to be inaccurate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hallstrand TS, Curtis JR, Koepsell TD, etal |title=Effectiveness of screening examinations to detect unrecognized exercise-induced bronchoconstriction |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=343–8 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12219053 |doi=10.1067/mpd.2002.125729 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-3476(02)00097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rundell KW, Im J, Mayers LB, Wilber RL, Szmedra L, Schmitz HR |title=Self-reported symptoms and exercise-induced asthma in the elite athlete |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=208–13 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11224807 |doi=10.1097/00005768-200102000-00006 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0195-9131&amp;volume=33&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will result in an incorrect diagnosis more than 50% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parsons JP, Kaeding C, Phillips G, Jarjoura D, Wadley G, Mastronarde JG |title=Prevalence of exercise-induced bronchospasm in a cohort of varsity college athletes |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1487–92 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17805078 |doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e3180986e45 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0195-9131&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=1487}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An important and often over-looked differential diagnosis is exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction [[EILO]]. The latter can co-exist with EIB and is best differentiated using objective testing and continuous laryngoscopy during exercise (CLE) testing. 

===Spirometry===
Objective testing should begin with [[spirometry]] at rest. In true exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, the results should be within normal limits. Should resting values be abnormal, then asthma, or some other chronic lung condition, is present. There is, of course, no reason why asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction should not co-exist but the distinction is important because without successful treatment of underlying asthma, treatment of an exercise component will likely be unsuccessful.  If baseline testing is normal, some form of exercise or pharmacologic stress will be required, either on the sideline or practice venue, or in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=ERS&gt;{{cite journal | title=Exercise-induced asthma, respiratory and allergic disorders in elite athletes: epidemiology, mechanisms and diagnosis: Part I of the report from the Joint Task Force of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) in cooperation with GA2LEN  |vauthors=Carlsen KH, Anderson SD, Bjermer L, etal | date=April 2008 | journal=Allergy | volume=63 |issue=4 | pages=387–403 | doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01662.x |pmid=18315727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise testing ===
Treadmill or ergometer-based testing in lung function laboratories are effective methods for diagnosing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but may result in false negatives if the exercise stimulus is not intense enough.

=== Field-exercise challenge ===
Field-exercise challenge tests that involve the athlete performing the sport in which they are normally involved and assessing [[FEV1/FVC ratio|FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] after exercise are helpful if abnormal but have been shown to be less sensitive than eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation.&lt;ref name="pmid10084470"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mannix ET, Manfredi F, Farber MO | title=A comparison of two challenge tests for identifying exercise-induced bronchospasm in figure skaters | journal=Chest | year= 1999 | volume= 115 | issue= 3 | pages= 649–53 | pmid=10084470 | doi= 10.1378/chest.115.3.649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation challenge ====
The [[International Olympic Committee]] recommends the [[eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation]] (EVH) challenge as the test to document exercise-induced asthma  in [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] athletes.&lt;ref name="McKeagMoeller2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Douglas B. McKeag|author2=James L. Moeller|author3=American College of Sports Medicine|title=ACSM's Primary Care Sports Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoeRrA_-td0C&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=21 April 2012|date=3 July 2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7028-6|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the EVH challenge, the patient voluntarily, without exercising, rapidly breathes dry air enriched with 5% {{CO2}} for six minutes.  The presence of the enriched {{CO2}} compensates for the {{CO2}} losses in the expired air, not matched by metabolic production, that occurs during hyperventilation, and so maintains {{CO2}} levels at normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosenthal |first=Richard |title=Eucapnic Voluntary Hyperventilation (EVH) A Test for the Presence of Asthma |url=http://image.lifeservant.com/siteuploadfiles/VSYM/E771344B-4428-4E27-8A0E0700B4A4CA31/098823F8-C29A-8FCE-4EC63CCB218901DC.doc |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medication challenge ====
Medication challenge tests, such as the [[methacholine]] challenge test, have a lower sensitivity for detection of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes and are also not a recommended first-line approach in the evaluation of exercise-induced asthma.&lt;ref name="pmid17433829"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weiler JM, Bonini S, Coifman R, Craig T, Delgado L, Capão-Filipe M, etal | title=American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Work Group report: exercise-induced asthma. | journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol | year= 2007 | volume= 119 | issue= 6 | pages= 1349–58 | pmid=17433829 | doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.02.041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mannitol]] inhalation&lt;ref name="pmid9769270"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brannan JD, Koskela H, Anderson SD, Chew N | title=Responsiveness to mannitol in asthmatic subjects with exercise- and hyperventilation-induced asthma. | journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med | year= 1998 | volume= 158 | issue= 4 | pages= 1120–6 | pmid=9769270 | doi= 10.1164/ajrccm.158.4.9802087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18756011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Muñoz PA, Gómez FP, Manrique HA, Roca J, Barberà JA, Young IH, etal | title=Pulmonary gas exchange response to exercise- and mannitol-induced bronchoconstriction in mild asthma. | journal=J Appl Physiol | year= 2008 | volume= 105 | issue= 5 | pages= 1477–85 | pmid=18756011 | doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00108.2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been recently approved for use in the United States.

It should be noted, however, that a relatively recent review of the literature has concluded that there is currently insufficient available evidence to conclude that either mannitol inhalation or eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation are suitable alternatives to exercise challenge testing to detect exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and that additional research is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Accuracy of eucapnic hyperpnea or mannitol to diagnose exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: a systematic review |vauthors=Stickland MK, Rowe BH, Spooner CH, Vandermeer B, Dryden DM | date=September 2011 | journal=Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol | volume=107 | pages=229–34 | pmid=21875541 | doi=10.1016/j.anai.2011.06.013 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
{{further|Asthma#Management}}

===Lifestyle===
The best treatment is avoidance of conditions predisposing to attacks, when possible.  In athletes who wish to continue their sport or do so in adverse conditions, preventive measures include altered training techniques and medications.

Some take advantage of the refractory period by precipitating an attack by "warming up," and then timing competition such that it occurs during the refractory period.  Step-wise training works in a similar fashion.  Warm up occurs in stages of increasing intensity, using the refractory period generated by each stage to reach a full workload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Effect of warm-up exercise on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction |vauthors=Stickland MK, Rowe BH, Spooner CH, Vandermeer B, Dryden DM | date=March 2012 | journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc | volume=44 | pages=383–91 | pmid=21811185 | doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e31822fb73a | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
The treatment of EIB has been extensively studied in asthmatic subjects over the last 30 years, but not so in EIB.{{clarify|date=July 2016}}  Thus, it is not known whether athletes with EIB or ‘sports asthma’ respond similarly to subjects with classical allergic or nonallergic asthma.  However, there is no evidence supporting different treatment for EIB in asthmatic athletes and nonathletes.&lt;ref name=ERS2/&gt;

The most common medication used is a [[beta agonist]] taken about 20 minutes before exercise.&lt;ref name=ERS2&gt;{{cite journal | title=Treatment of exercise-induced asthma, respiratory and allergic disorders in sports and the relationship to doping: Part II of the report from the Joint Task Force of European Respiratory Society (ERS) and European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) in cooperation with GA2LEN  |vauthors=Carlsen KH, Anderson SD, Bjermer L, etal | date=April 2008 | journal=Allergy | volume=63 |issue=4 | pages=492–505 | doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01663.x | pmid=18394123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some physicians prescribe inhaled anti-inflammatory mists such as [[corticosteroids]] or [[leukotriene antagonist]]s, and [[mast cell stabilizer]]s have also proven effective.&lt;ref name=ERS2 /&gt; A randomized [[crossover study]] compared oral [[montelukast]] with inhaled [[salmeterol]], both given two hours before exercise. Both drugs had similar benefit but [[montelukast]] lasted 24 hours.&lt;ref name="pmid17573489"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Philip G, Pearlman DS, Villarán C, etal |title=Single-dose montelukast or salmeterol as protection against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=875–83 |year=2007 |pmid=17573489 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-0550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three randomized double-blind cross-over trials have examined the effect of [[vitamin C]] on EIB.&lt;ref name=Hemila2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hemilä |first=H |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/6/e002416 |title=Vitamin C may alleviate exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: a meta-analysis |journal=[[BMJ Open]] |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=e002416 |date=7 June 2013 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002416 |pmid=23794586 |pmc=3686214}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meta-analysis|Pooling]] the results of the three vitamin C trials indicates an average 48% reduction in the FEV1 decline caused by exericise (Figure). The systematic review concluded that "given the safety and low cost of vitamin C, and the positive findings for vitamin C administration in the three EIB studies, it seems reasonable for physically active people to test vitamin C when they have respiratory symptoms such as cough associated with exercise."&lt;ref name=Hemila2013 /&gt; It should be acknowledged that the total number of subjects involved in all three trials was only 40.

In May 2013, the American Thoracic Society issued the first treatment guidelines for EIB.&lt;ref name=ATS2013&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Parsons JP, Hallstrand TS, Mastronarde JG, etal |title=An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: exercise-induced bronchoconstriction |journal=Am.

==Prognosis==
As evidenced by many professional athletes who have overcome EIB using some combination of accepted treatments, the prognosis is usually very good.{{dubious|date=August 2013}} Olympic swimmers [[Tom Dolan]], [[Amy Van Dyken]], and [[Nancy Hogshead]], Olympic track star [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]], baseball Hall of Famer [[Catfish Hunter]], and American football player [[Jerome Bettis]] are among the many who have done so. Tour de France winner [[Chris Froome]] admitted to suffer from the condition after being spotted using a nasal inhaler during race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/froome-surprised-at-controversy-over-in-race-inhaler-use|title=Froome surprised at controversy over in-race inhaler use}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sportspeople with EIB include racing cyclist [[Simon Yates (cyclist)|Simon Yates]], distance runner [[Paula Radcliffe]]&lt;ref name=graun&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/29/elite-athletes-asthma-simon-yates-team-sky-swimmers |title=Why do so many elite athletes have asthma?  |last1=Walker |first1=Peter|date=29 April 2016 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-country skier [[Marit Bjørgen]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/17/exercise.asthma.winter/ |title=For Olympians and weekend warriors, winter sports can trigger asthma |last1=Gardner |first1=Amanda  |date=17 February 2010 |website=[[cnn.com]] |access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by sports scientist John Dickinson found that 70 percent of UK-based members of the British swimming team had some form of asthma, as did a third of {{ct|SKY|2016}} cyclists, compared to a national asthma rate of eight to ten percent,&lt;ref name=graun /&gt; whilst a study by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] in 2000 found that half of cross-country skiers had EIB.&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;

School children are also one of the major groups impacted by EIB as exercise programs and sports activities form a big part of most schools.  Proactive schools usually set special EIB friendly guidelines for students with EIB so that they can be included in mainstream student exercise programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nobledrugstore.com/blog/diseases-condition/exercise-induced-asthma-affected-children-live|title=Tips for Exercise Induced Asthma (EIA) affected children to help them lead normal school lives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glasgow Cup''' is a [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] [[association football|football]] tournament open to teams from [[Glasgow]]. It was competed for annually by senior Glasgow clubs from 1887 until 1989. It is now competed for between the youth teams of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]],  [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

It was dominated by the City rivals, Rangers and Celtic, who have won the competition 48 times and 35 times respectively. The advent of European football tournaments led to the Glasgow Cup becoming less valued, and the tournament did not take place at all or was not finished several times in its later years.

== History ==
The Glasgow Football Association Cup used to be seen as an important competition, on a par with the League or the [[Scottish Cup]]. It was contested by the senior clubs in the Glasgow area, with the winners receiving a globular silver trophy. The competition was dominated by the old rivals of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], but the others, [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] and the now defunct [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] all enjoyed relative success.&lt;ref name="cuphist"&gt;{{cite web|title=History |url=http://www.glasgowfa.co.uk/history.html|website=Glasgow FA|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition's status diminished after [[World War II]], with European competition seeming more attractive and important. The competition was normally played early in the season, until 1960. After the demise of the Charity Cup, the fixtures would be put in any available space with the final being played at the end of the season. After 1971 the Glasgow Cup was not played until it was re-introduced for the 1974&amp;ndash;75 season, but it was generally seen as unappealing, and was even left incomplete on occasion, otherwise the final was often held over until the beginning of the following season. In the event of a Celtic v Rangers final both would still usually put out full-strength first teams. This remained the case up to 1986 when a crowd of over 40,000 saw Rangers take the trophy with a 3&amp;ndash;2 win over Scottish Champions Celtic, courtesy of an [[Ally McCoist]] hat-trick, to give manager [[Graeme Souness]] his first trophy days after taking charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/1986-05-09%3A+Rangers+3-2+Celtic%2C+Glasgow+Cup+Final+-+Pictures|website=The Celtic Wiki (hosting site for scans)|title=Rangers 3-2 Celtic, Glasgow Cup Final - Pictures (newspaper reports)|date=|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that it essentially became a [[reserve team]] tournament.&lt;ref name="cuphist" /&gt;

Rangers retained the trophy the following season in another old rivals final; only 15,000 were there to watch what were effectively two reserve teams. The following season's contest was never completed. Officially there were no suitable dates available to fit ties in; the competition had become irrelevant. In 1988 the competition was abandoned, and the final competition was played out in 1989 with Partick Thistle becoming the final winners of the competition in its original format. The Glasgow Cup was subsequently relaunched in 1990 as an Under-19 tournament competed for by the youth teams of Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle, Queen's Park and Rangers. It then became an Under-17 tournament in 2008, competed for by the same teams as previously.&lt;ref name="cuphist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1863_3941596,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914060359/http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1863_3941596,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 September 2012 |title=Old Firm take youth talent seriously |date=7 August 2008 |publisher=TEAMtalk.com |accessdate=27 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lets typically occur when an otherwise-valid serve makes contact with the net before hitting the ground. Theoretically, a player could serve an infinite number of otherwise-valid let serves, but a serve that touches the net and then lands out of bounds counts as one of the two allowed serves. A let can also be called during play when there is some distraction to either player not caused by the players themselves, such as a ball boy moving behind a receiver, debris flying across the court in windy conditions, or a ball accidentally falling out of a player's pocket or entering from a neighboring court. The call is made by the chair umpire when one is assigned to the match, as in professional matches, or one of the players when there is no chair umpire. When a receiver is legitimately unprepared for a serve, a let is technically the result, even if the word goes unspoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rules of Tennis|year=2012|publisher=ITF|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/117960/117960.pdf|page=9|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Shine|2003|pp=70–71|ps=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4201">A '''goal from mark''' is a former scoring move in [[rugby football]]. It occurred when a player "[[mark (rugby)|marked]]" the ball by making a [[fair catch]] and shouting "mark".  From this position the player could not be tackled. The player then had the option of a [[free kick (rugby union)|free kick]], which could be taken as a place-kick, drop-kick, punt, or tap kick. It was possible to score a goal from a place-kick or drop-kick.

The goal from mark was seldom seen for a number of reasons: the kicking team would have had to make the mark comfortably within range of the opponents' goal, usually implying a gross error on the part of a defending player. The player making the mark would presumably have considered a drop goal attempt from open play less likely to succeed than a goal from the mark. The defending team were allowed to advance as far as the mark, meaning that the kick had to be attempted from still further away, and were moreover permitted to charge the attempted kick as soon as the ball was placed on the ground, the kicker started to run up, or offered to kick the ball.
The points awarded for a goal from mark initially varied between three and four points as point scoring rules evolved in rugby. In the 1900s, the goal from mark was fixed at three points and it remained set at this amount until the rule's eventual abolition.  The goal from mark was a goal-scoring option distinct from the [[Drop kick|drop goal]].  The latter was worth four points in rugby union until 1948 when its value was also reduced to three points.

Under the original laws promulgated by Rugby School (from 1845 onwards), a touch-down behind the opposition's goal-line was followed by a "punt out", in which a member of the attacking team punted the ball backwards from the goal-line to a teammate, who could then catch the ball, make a mark (as from a fair catch), and then place the ball for a kick at goal.  This was originally the only means by which a goal could be scored following a touch-down. The option of a place-kick in line with the touch-down (as in a modern conversion) appeared in the first Rugby Football Union laws of 1871.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed description of the punt-out / mark / kick procedure is given in the [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Laws_of_Football_as_played_at_Rugby_School_(1862) 1862 edition of the laws of Rugby School]&lt;/ref&gt; The RFU would abolish the punt-out from goal in 1883.

The goal from mark was removed entirely from rugby league in 1922.
The goal from mark was permitted in rugby union games until the ''free-kick clause'' was added to the Laws of Rugby Union in 1977, which stipulated that a player could call a mark only in the defender's 22-metre area and only for a "non-scoring" free kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/91981.html|title=Goals from marks, numbering of players and Sunday internationals |author= John Griffits |publisher=www.espnscrum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This clause was applied to northern hemisphere games from September 1977 and for southern hemisphere games from January 1978 and remains part of the rules.

The last goal from a mark scored in an international match was by [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] against [[France national rugby union team|France]] in the [[1971–72 FIRA Nations Cup]] on 11 December 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrum.com/statsguru/rugby/match/20593.html Rugby Union - ESPN Scrum - France v Romania at Beziers, Dec 11, 1971&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other codes of football==

The scoring move continues as the [[set shot]] featuring heavily in [[Australian rules football]] or the unusual [[fair catch kick]] in [[American football]].  The original 1863 laws of association football also permitted a free kick from a fair catch, from which a goal could be scored; this provision was eliminated in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(1863) Laws of the game (1863)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indianapolis Tennis Center''' was a tennis stadium complex with additional outdoor and indoor tennis courts on the campus of [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]] (IUPUI) in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. The stadium, which seated 10,000 spectators, was built in 1979. At that time it was the venue for the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships  tournament. It was also the site of the tennis events for the [[1987 Pan American Games]].

When originally constructed, the {{convert|13|acre}} complex included 14 outdoor courts, all of which, including the stadium court, had a clay surface. In 1989 an indoor facility featuring 6 [[DecoTurf]] Ii courts was added, and the stadium court and other outdoor courts were converted from clay to DecoTurf.&lt;ref name=IUPUIJags&gt;{{cite web|title=Indianapolis Tennis Center|url=http://www.iupuijags.com/sports/2007/12/20/tennis_center.aspx|website=IUPUI Athletics|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the change in playing surface, the name of the tournament was changed to the RCA Tennis Championships. The name of the tournament changed again to the [[Indianapolis Tennis Championships]] in 2007 due to the loss of the [[RCA]] sponsorship.

Changes to the date of the tournament to a less desirable point in the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tour combined with the loss of sponsorship resulted in the tournament being sold and moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Maintenance costs due to the loss of tournament income plus IUPUI's need for the land for future development led to the closure of the facility in August 2010 and its subsequent demolition that year.&lt;ref name=IBJ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schoettle|first1=Anthony|title=UPDATE: Tennis Center set for summer demolition|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/19687-update-tennis-center-set-for-summer-demolition|publisher=Indianapolis Business Journal|accessdate=December 17, 2015|date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeunesse Arena''' is an [[indoor arena|indoor multi-purpose arena]], located in the region of [[Barra da Tijuca]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. It is named for the American cosmetics company Jeunesse Global through a [[naming rights]] deal closed in  2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jeunesseglobal.com/en-US/blog/jeunesse_acquires_naming_rights_to_olympic_arena_in_rio_de_janeiro Jeunesse Acquires Naming Rights to Olympic Arena in Rio de Janeiro]&lt;/ref&gt; Before, the sponsor name was '''[[HSBC]] Arena'''. The arena was completed in July 2007 and was first known as '''Arena Olímpica do Rio''' ''(Rio Olympic Arena)'', which it was known as during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. From December 2007 to March 2008, it was known as '''RioArena'''. The arena has a capacity of 14,981 people for sports and up to 18,768 for concerts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalgl.com.br/upload/hsbc/arquivo/quadra.pdf A Quadra] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalgl.com.br/upload/hsbc/arquivo/palco.pdf Configurações de palco] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports ==
The arena hosted the [[Basketball at the 2007 Pan American Games|basketball]] and [[Gymnastics at the 2007 Pan American Games|gymnastics]] events at the [[2007 Pan American Games]]. In December 2007, it started being operated by GL Events, who also operates the nearby [[Riocentro Convention Center]] and the [[Riocentro Sports Complex]], and started hosting many concerts from a variety of artists. It has also hosted the telethon show, ''Criança Esperança'', after 2008, replacing [[Ginásio Ibirapuera]] as the host. Starting on 29 March 2008, it was renamed as the [[HSBC]] Arena, as part of a [[naming rights]] agreement with the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.propmark.com.br/publique/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?UserActiveTemplate=propmark&amp;infoid=43972&amp;sid=3 Propaganda &amp; Marketing: "HSBC dá nome a espaço de eventos no Rio de Janeiro"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154335/http://www.propmark.com.br/publique/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?UserActiveTemplate=propmark&amp;infoid=43972&amp;sid=3 |date=2011-07-06 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena hosted [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]]'s second event in Brazil, [[UFC 134]], which took place on August 27, 2011. It was the first event in Brazil in over ten years. Five other UFC events have since been held in the arena: [[UFC 142]], on January 14, 2012; [[UFC 153]], on October 13, 2012; [[UFC 163]], on August 3, 2013; [[UFC 190]], on August 1, 2015, and [[UFC 212]] on June 3, 2017.

An [[NBA]] game between the [[Chicago Bulls]] and the [[Washington Wizards]] was also held at HSBC Arena in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottradecenter.com/events-tickets/2013/chicago-bulls-memphis-grizzlies.html NBA PRESEASON: CHICAGO BULLS VS. MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES]&lt;/ref&gt; The arena also hosted the [[2014 FIBA Intercontinental Cup|2014 edition]] of the [[FIBA Intercontinental Cup]] between [[Flamengo Basketball|Flamengo]] and [[Maccabi Tel Aviv BC|Maccabi Tel Aviv]]. The NBA also hosted a preseason game between the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and the [[Miami Heat]] on 11 October 2014, as part of the [[NBA Global Games]].

In 2017, the arena hosted the 2017 [[League of Legends]] Mid-Season Invitational.

In November 2018, the area will host the [[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege]] Season 8 Pro League finals.

==2016 Olympics==
The arena hosted all of the [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics|gymnastics events]] of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], being the first time all these events are held at the same venue, and wheelchair basketball events of the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rio2016.org.br/sumarioexecutivo/sumario/English/Per%20Theme/Volume%202/Theme_09.pdf Rio2016.org.br bid package.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112204539/http://www.rio2016.org.br/sumarioexecutivo/sumario/English/Per%20Theme/Volume%202/Theme_09.pdf |date=2010-11-12 }} - Volume 2. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The HSBC Arena name was not used during the Olympics (the original name of the arena, Arena Olímpica do Rio, was used instead), since corporate sponsorship is not allowed in the names of Olympic venues. In the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]], RioArena hosted the [[Wheelchair basketball at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|wheelchair basketball tournament]].

== Concerts ==
[[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] concluded their [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]] at the arena on 29 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenconcerts.com/detail/live/1821/queen-paul-rodgers-live-29-11-2008-hsbc-arena-rio-de-janeiro-brazil.html 29.11.2008 - Concert: Queen + Paul Rodgers live at the HSBC Arena, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demi Lovato]] performed at the arena for her South American Tour 2010 on May 27, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://g1.globo.com/pop-arte/noticia/2010/05/demi-lovato-faz-show-interativo-em-primeira-apresentacao-solo-no-rio.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miley Cyrus]] performed at the arena for her [[Gypsy Heart Tour]] on May 13, 2011, and it was Cyrus' first concert in Brazil. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.celebuzz.com/photos/miley-cyrus-performs-in-rio-de-janeiro-in-risque-outfit/1miley-cyrus-rio-akm-051311/&lt;/ref&gt; On March 27, 2011, [[Iron Maiden]]'s performance at the arena had to be postponed to the following night after a security barrier collapsed during the opening song. The entire audience was allowed to attend the following night's show, although those who couldn't attend were given a refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=155932 |title=Iron Maiden's Concert Promoter Releases Statement Regarding Rio Cancelation |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823124857/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=155932 |archivedate=2011-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 2017, [[Ariana Grande]] brought her [[Dangerous Woman Tour]] to the arena, had a very euphoric audience.

This is the '''list of world records in [[Olympic weightlifting]]'''. Records are maintained in each [[Olympic weightlifting#Competition|weight class]] for the [[snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]] lift, [[clean and jerk]] lift, and the total for both lifts.

The [[International Weightlifting Federation]] restructured its weight classes in 1993, 1998 and 2018, nullifying earlier records.

'''Lugogo Stadium''', also known as '''Lugogo Cricket Oval''', is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]]. The first recorded match held on the ground came in 1957 when Kenya Asians played Sunder Cricket Club. 

In that same year [[Uganda national cricket team|Uganda]] first used the ground when the national team played the Sunder Cricket Club.&lt;ref name="OTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/28/1748_misc.html|title=Other matches played on Lugogo Stadium|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground held its inaugural [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match when an [[East African Invitation XI cricket team|East African Invitation XI]] played the touring [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1963. 

A further first-class match followed in 1967 when a combined [[East Africa cricket team|East Africa]] team played the touring [[India national cricket team|Indians]]. The next first-class matches to be held on the ground didn't come until 2005, when Uganda played two matches there in the [[2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] against [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] and [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/28/1748_f.html|title=First-Class Matches played on Lugogo Stadium|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lugogo Stadium is the only cricket venue in Uganda to have held first-class cricket.

Surrounding the cricket ground there are [[tennis courts]] and a [[association football|football]] ground which is the home ground of [[Kampala City Council FC]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2974">'''Memorial Auditorium''' is a 6,000-seat indoor [[arena]] located in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. It was built in 1952 and dedicated to Moorhead-area residents who fought and served the United States during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]], and until the [[Fargodome]] was built forty years later, was the largest indoor venue in the [[Fargo-Moorhead]] area. It remains the largest arena in the area to be used primarily for [[basketball]], and has been the home of the [[Concordia College (Moorhead, Minnesota)|Concordia College]] Cobbers basketball, [[volleyball]] and [[wrestling]] teams for decades.

The arena contains only 1800 permanent seats, with the remaining seats in bleachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordiamn.prestosports.com/facilities/memorialauditorium Memorial Auditorium at gocobbers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  For concerts, floor seating can be brought in, bringing the total capacity to up to 7,000. The arena features a wood parquet hardwood floor, while the adjacent practice facility features a synthetic floor. The original locker rooms, located in the lower level of the arena, were rebuilt in anticipation of the venue's 60th anniversary in 2012. Memorial Auditorium is also home to the offices of Concordia's athletic department.

Memorial Auditorium's first sporting event, played on December 2, 1952, was a 69-59 Cobbers victory over [[North Dakota State University]], attended by 5,500 fans. It has hosted concerts by many recording artists over the decades.

Memorial Auditorium's roof suffered uneven snowloads, resulting in a basketball hoop being lowered by an inch early in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/89246/ Concordia Memorial Auditorium schedule changes due to structural changes, [[WDAY-TV]], October 25, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140107181906/http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/89246/ |date=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to these structural concerns, several events normally held at the Auditorium were moved to other venues, including the Fargodome, [[Bison Sports Arena]] and [[Scheels Arena]], all of which are located in [[Fargo, North Dakota]].

==Competition==
In addition to the FargoDome and Bison Sports and Scheels Arenas, Memorial Auditorium's competition includes, in the surrounding area, the [[Alerus Center]] and [[Ralph Engelstad Arena]] in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Target Center]] in [[Minneapolis]] and [[MTS Centre]] in [[Winnipeg]].

The '''North Adelaide Lacrosse Club''' was founded on 22 March 1887,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37169886 |title=LACROSSE. |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=23 March 1887 |accessdate=4 September 2015 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the oldest continually existing lacrosse club in [[South Australia]]. [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Sir William Henry Bragg]], previously a member of the Adelaide Lacrosse Club, was a founding member of North Adelaide as well as the [[Adelaide University Lacrosse Club]] later in 1889. NALC are currently located in the suburb of [[Gepps Cross]].

== Premierships ==
North Adelaide had early success in the South Australian Lacrosse Association, but have not won an A Grade premiership since 1960.

A Grade Premierships:

[[File:Melbourne Geelong Football.jpg|thumb|250px|An 1881 [[Australian rules football]] match between [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]. Both clubs were founded in 1859 and currently compete in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), making them the world's oldest football clubs that are now professional.]]

The history of the formation of the '''oldest football clubs''' is of interest to sport historians in tracing the origins of the modern codes of [[football]] from casual pastime to [[oldest football competitions|early organised competition]] and mainstream sport. The identity of the first or oldest football clubs in the world, or even in a particular country, is often disputed or claimed by several clubs, across several codes of football.

Late{{what|date=August 2018}} [[rugby football|rugby]] clubs also referred to themselves, or continue to refer to themselves, as simply a "football club", or as a "rugby football club". "[[Sports club|Club]]" has always meant an independent entity and, during the historical period in question, very few [[high school]] or university ''teams'' were independent of the educational institutions concerned. Consequently, school and university football teams were seldom referred to as "clubs". That has always been the case, for example, in [[American football]], which has always had ties to [[college sport]] in general. Conversely, however, the ''oldest'' still-existing "football club" with a well-documented, continuous history is [[Dublin University Football Club]], a rugby union club founded in 1854 at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], [[Ireland (country of the United Kingdom)|Ireland]], although there exists some record of [[Guy's Hospital Football Club]] being founded in 1843.

While the first clubs emerged in Britain, possibly, as early as the fifteenth century, these are poorly-documented and defunct. For example, the records of the Brewers' Company of London between 1421 and 1423 mention the hiring out of their hall "by the "football players" for "20 pence", under the heading "Trades and Fraternities".&lt;ref&gt;Magoun, Francis Peabody (1929) "Football in Medieval England and Middle-English Literature." ''The American Historical Review'', v.35, no. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The listing of football players as a "fraternity" or a group of players meeting socially under this identity is the earliest allusion to what might be considered a football club.&lt;ref&gt;M. Marples, 1954, ''A History of Football'', Secker &amp; Warburg, London, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early sporting bodies dedicated to playing football include "[[The Gymnastic Society]]" of London which met ''regularly'' during the second half of the eighteenth century to pursue two sports:  football and [[wrestling]]&lt;ref&gt;Football The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story by Adrian Harvey, Routledge 2005, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;  The club played its matches – for example between London-based natives of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] – at the [[Kennington]] Common from well before 1789 until about 1800.

The [[Foot-Ball Club (Edinburgh)|Foot-Ball Club]] (active 1824–41) of [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, is the first documented club dedicated to football, and the first to describe itself as a football club.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope, ''Accounts and papers of the football club kept by John Hope, WS, and some Hope Correspondence 1787–1886'' (National Archives of Scotland, GD253/183)&lt;/ref&gt; The only surviving club rules forbade tripping, but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071112.asp The Foot-Ball Club in Edinburgh, 1824–1841 – The National Archives of Scotland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other documents describe a game involving 39 players and "such kicking of shins and such tumbling".

Other early clubs include the Great Leicestershire Cricket and Football Club present in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Football The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story by Adrian Harvey, Routledge 2005, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Day 1841, an early documented match between two self-described "football clubs" took place.  The Body-guard Club (of Rochdale) lost to the Fear-nought Club after using an ineligible player as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Football The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story by Adrian Harvey, Routledge 2005, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roch1&gt;{{cite journal |work=Bell's Life in London |date=1841-12-12 |page=4 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bodyguard_vs_Fearnoughts_1841.png |title=Foot-ball}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roch2&gt;{{cite journal |work=Bell's Life in London |date=1842-01-02 |page=4 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bodyguard_vs_Fearnoughts_Report_1842.png |title=Foot-ball}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete rules used in this game are unknown, but they specified twelve players on each side,&lt;ref name=roch1/&gt; with each team providing its own umpire, and the game being started by the firing of a pistol.&lt;ref name=roch2/&gt;

A club for playing "cricket, quoits and football" was established in [[Newcastle on Tyne]] in or before 1848.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 June 1848.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Surrey Football Club was established in 1849 and published the first non-school football list of rules (which were probably based upon the eighteenth century Gymnastic Society cited above&lt;ref&gt;''Football The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story by Adrian Harvey'', Routledge (2005), pages 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Windsor Home Park F.C.]] was in existence as early as 1854,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Windsor and Eton Express |date=1854-10-07 |page=1 |title=W. Runicles: Carver, Gilder and Picture Frame Maker [advertisement]}}. A newspaper advertisement for W. Runicles, of Eton High Street, boasts of patronage by "H.R.H.

===Continuous clubs===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Firstfootballgame.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Drawing from the [[1869 college football season|first football game played]] between Rutgers and Princeton.]] --&gt;
[[Cambridge University A.F.C.|Cambridge University Association Football Club]] has been described by the university as the oldest club now playing [[association football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/newsletter/2006/2006newsletter_july_august.pdf |title=Cambridge University Newsletter July/August 2006 |date=July 2006 |page=4 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbccambridge&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cambridgeshire/content/articles/2006/06/09/cambridge_football_rules_parkers_piece_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC Cambridgeshire |title=Cambridge... the birthplace of football?! |date=13 June 2006 |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, : "[[Shrewsbury School|Salopians]] formed a club of their own in the late 1830s/early 1840s but that was presumably absorbed by the Cambridge University Football Club that they were so influential in creating in 1846".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adrian |last=Harvey |title=Football: The first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Charles Astor Bristed]], in the early 1840s at Cambridge, there were games played between clubs from colleges and houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles Astor |last=Bristed |year=1852 |title=Five Years in an English University |page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge rules dates from 1848 and football is documented as being played on the original club ground, [[Parkers Piece]], as early as 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuafc.org/Pages/History.html History of the Cambridge University AFC on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811080448/http://www.cuafc.org/Pages/History.html |date=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest existing evidence of the Cambridge University Football Club comes from "[[Cambridge rules|The Laws of the University Football Club]]" dated 1856, and held at Shrewsbury School.&lt;ref name=bbccambridge/&gt;

It has been claimed that the present-day [[Barnes Rugby Football Club]], from [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] in London, is a continuation of the nineteenth-century [[Barnes Football Club]], and moreover that the latter club was formed in 1839 and is thus the oldest club to have played football for its entire history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/sport/2005/11/02/srinve02.xml | title=My assumptions about 'oldest' were confounded by Barnes | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | first=John | last=Inverdale | date=2 November 2005 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2018, Barnes RFC's website claims only that the club was established in the 1920s, while alluding to "possibilities" that its history stretches back to 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Barnes RFC History |url=http://www.barnesrfc.org/a/barnes-rfc-history-28772.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence it is argued, and supported by the ''Guinness Book of Records'', that [[Guy's Hospital Football Club]], founded by staff at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London in 1843, is the oldest club. While a rugby club still exists at Guy's Hospital, the connection between the present club and the one formed in 1843 is still disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gktgazette.com/2004/mar/features.asp#2 | title=GKT Gazette – March 2004 – A history of rugby | publisher=Guy's, King's &amp; St.Thomas's Hospitals Medical &amp; Dental Schools Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest football club with the best-documented, continuous history is the [[Dublin University Football Club]], founded in 1854 at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ireland. The club plays [[rugby union]].

[[Sheffield F.C.]] in [[Sheffield, England]], is the world's oldest surviving ''independent'' football club – that is, the oldest club not associated with an institution such as a school, hospital or university. It was founded in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/club/history/ "Club history" on Notts County official site]&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield F.C. initially played [[Sheffield rules]], a code of its own devising, although the club's rules influenced those of the England [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (FA (1863) including handball, free kicks, corners and throw ins. While the international governing body of association football, [[FIFA]] and the FA recognise [[Sheffield F.C.]] as the "world's oldest football club",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=621801.html "Sheffield FC: 150 years of history"] at [[FIFA]], 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the club joined the FA in 1863, it continued to use the Sheffield rules. Sheffield F.C. did not officially adopt association football until 1877.

The only survivor among the FA's founding clubs still playing association football is [[Civil Service F.C.]]&lt;ref name="london24"/&gt; Six of the 18 founding members later adopted rugby exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Collins, 2009, ''A Social History of English Rugby Union'', Routledge, Abingdon, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cray Wanderers F.C.]] of [[St Mary Cray]], London, founded in 1860, is the oldest club now playing association football in Greater London.&lt;ref name="thisis"/&gt; The code played by Cray wanderers in its earliest years is unknown.

[[Liverpool St Helens F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]] (not to be confused with [[Liverpool F.C.]] of the Premier League), later known as Liverpool St Helens F.C. were formed in 1857, which claims to be the oldest open rugby club in the world.  The club adopted the Rugby Union rules in 1872, never playing association rules.

English club [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], which has existed informally from 1862, is the world's oldest fully professional association football club.&lt;ref&gt;The five oldest association football clubs in the world are: 1.[[Sheffield F.C.]] (1857), members of the Northern Premier League Division One South; 2. [[Hallam F.C.]] (1860) also a Sheffield football club, playing two division below the oldest club (Northern Counties East League Division One) 3. [[Cray Wanderers F.C.]] (1861) 4.

==Rest of the world==
===Australia===
In 1858 in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], members of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] formed a loosely organised football team, and played against other local football enthusiasts over the winter and spring of that year. The [[Melbourne Football Club]] was officially founded the following year on 17 May, and three days later, four members codified the first laws of [[Australian rules football]]. The [[Geelong Football Club]] was formed shortly afterwards, and over the next decade, many more Australian rules football clubs were formed in Victoria. Melbourne and Geelong were founding members of the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), making them the world's oldest football clubs that are now professional.

===South America===
[[Lima Cricket and Football Club]] claims to be the oldest football-practicing club in Peru and the Americas, having been founded in 1859 by the city's British community.{{sfn|Higgins|2005|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eli Schmerler and Carlos Manuel Nieto Tarazona |title=Peru - Foundation Dates of Clubs |publisher=RSSSF |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/perufound.html |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been established in 1875, [[Club Mercedes]] is considered the oldest association football club still in existence in Argentina.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2016/02/160211_deportes_futbol_argentina_federal_c_torneos_jmp El Federal C, el increíble campeonato de fútbol argentino con ¡266 equipos!], BBC.com, 12 Jan 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pagina&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-212513-2013-01-24.html Lo mató una patota futbolera] ''Página 12'', 24 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This places Mercedes above [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata]]&lt;ref&gt;''Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, 100 Años'', by Carlos Asnaghi.

[[Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club]] claims to be the oldest club still in existence in Argentina. According to the club's website, the club was founded before 8 December 1864 as a [[cricket]] institution.&lt;ref name=bacrc&gt;[http://www.bacrc.com/historia.php "Historia del Club" at BACRC official website]&lt;/ref&gt; The date of foundation has been recognized by the Buenos Aires Rugby Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urba.org.ar/clubes/guia-de-clubes/club/19/BUENOS-AIRES-CRICKET-&amp;-RUGBY-CLUB/ Buenos Aires CRC on "Guía de Clubes", URBA website]&lt;/ref&gt; It is however believed that the club was founded in 1831, with existing documentary evidence about a [[cricket]] match played by Buenos Aires that same year.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia de Fútbol de AFA: Orígenes 1891/1899'', by Carlos Yametti.

[[Club Atlético del Rosario]] was officially established in 1867 as a [[cricket]] institution. The club soon added association football, being the first club from [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] playing in the [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División]], the top division of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historiayfutbol.obolog.com/argentina-1ra-division-1894-161838 "Argentina: Primera División 1894" at Historia y Futbol]&lt;/ref&gt; In rugby union, Rosario AC played the first inter-clubs match in the country on 28 June 1886, when the team faced [[Buenos Aires Football Club (1886)|Buenos Aires Football Club]].&lt;ref name=cihf&gt;[http://www.cihf.org.ar/trabajos/RosarioAthleticcampeon.pdf "Cuando el Rosario Athletic salió campeón... de fútbol", CIHF Argentina] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234042/http://www.cihf.org.ar/trabajos/RosarioAthleticcampeon.pdf |date=18 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacrc.com/historia.php "Historia del Club", Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[São Paulo Athletic Club]] was founded on 13 May 1888 by English immigrants, and was the first football club in Brazil. Although association football is not practised anymore, SPAC still hosts rugby union.

[[Santiago Wanderers]] was founded on 15 August 1892 by Irish community and was the first football club in Chile.

===North America===
Although football variants have been played in [[North America]] since the 1820s, the claim of oldest continuous football club in North America is still a matter of debate. 

In terms of [[gridiron football]] the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] can trace their roots back to the [[Hamilton Tigers (football)|Hamilton Football Club]] (nicknamed the "Tigers") which formed in 1869, then later merged with the [[Hamilton Wildcats (Canadian football)|Hamilton Wildcats]] in 1950 to form the current franchise. Their rivals to the north, the [[Toronto Argonauts]], were founded four years later in 1873 and have a mostly unchanged franchise history. Both clubs began as [[rugby football]] clubs and only later adapted to the [[gridiron football|gridiron-style]] of play which would become known as [[Canadian football]]. The oldest continuous rugby club in North America which still plays rugby is the [[McGill University]] Rugby Football Club which was established in 1863, although their first recorded game was not until 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgillrfc.com/Team/history.html "Team history" on McGill RFC website]&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest independent (non-university) rugby club is the [[Westmount Rugby Club]] of [[Montreal]], which formed in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;[http://westmountrugby.com/newsnouvelles/history-histoire/ History of Westmount RC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, [[Rutgers University]] and [[Princeton University]] competed in the [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|first intercollegiate football game]]. According to [[U.S. Soccer]], the rules of this game resembled rugby and association football more closely than gridiron football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Soccer Timeline |url=https://www.ussoccer.com/about/history/timeline |website=www.ussoccer.com |publisher=[[United States Soccer Federation]] |accessdate=23 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clubs evolved into the [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers Scarlet Knights]] and [[Princeton Tigers football]] teams which have existed continuously since then.

In the United States, gridiron-based variants of the game did not distinguish themselves from existing codes until 1871, when [[Harvard University]] began playing a variation known as the "Boston Game." This allowed a player to pick up the ball and run with it if he were chased and it quickly spread, with innovations added by [[Yale University]] student [[Walter Camp]]. The oldest existing non-university semiprofessional football club is the [[Watertown Red &amp; Black]], which was founded in 1896. The [[Arizona Cardinals]], formed in [[Chicago]] in 1898, are the oldest team in the [[National Football League]].

===Continental Europe===
The first football club in France was established in Paris in 1863 by English expatriates, as the following excerpt from a contemporary newspaper shows: "A number of English gentlemen living in Paris have lately organised a football club.... The football contests take place in the Bois de Boulogne, by permission of the authorities and surprise the French amazingly."&lt;ref&gt;''The Scotsman Newspaper'', 22 December 1863, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Le Havre AC]] was founded as an athletics and rugby club in 1872, making it the oldest surviving football club registered in France and continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Anthony|title=Avec Louvel, "Le Havre est devenu un club de Ligue 2" selon les supporters|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2009/05/15/avec-louvel-le-havre-est-devenu-un-club-de-ligue-2-selon-les-supporters_1193671_3242.html|accessdate=20 September 2015|website=Le Monde.fr|publisher=Groupe Le Monde|date=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began playing association football on a regular basis in 1894. Technically [[AS Strasbourg]] could be considered the first French association football team, being established in 1890; they were however a German team at the time.

[[Dresden English Football Club]] was founded on 18 March 1874 and was the first association football club in Germany, and likely the first outside Great Britain.

|&lt;small&gt; A number of teams formed in the Richmond area during Australian rules football's rapid expansion of the 1870s, and early 1880s. However, all played at a junior level and it was considered an anomaly that Richmond, one of Melbourne's biggest locales, did not boast a senior team. The wait ended when the Richmond Football Club was officially formed on 20 February 1885.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''pocketknife''' is a foldable [[knife]] with one or more [[blade]]s that fit inside the handle that can still fit in a [[pocket]].  It is also known as a '''jackknife''' (jack-knife) or a '''[[penknife]]''', though the latter may also be a specific kind of pocketknife.&lt;ref name= jack-knife&gt;{{cite news | last = New York Times | first = (1884) | title = Handy With His Jack-Knife | publisher = www.nytimes.com | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/06/25/103443910.pdf | accessdate = 2011-02-04 | date=1884-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= jackknife&gt;{{cite web | last = The Norwalk Hour | first = 1961 May 31, p. 29 | title = How Did the Jackknife Get its Name? | publisher = www.news.google.com | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=duogAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6047,7104917&amp;dq=jackknife+history+word&amp;hl=en | accessdate = 2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical blade length is {{convert|5|to|15|cm|in|0}}.&lt;ref name="Lake"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lake| first1 = Ron|  last2 = Centofante| first2 = Frank |  last3 = Clay| first3 = Wayne |  title = How to Make Folding Knives: A Step-By-Step How-To | publisher =  Krause| year = 1995 |  pages = 190| isbn =0-87341-390-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocketknives are versatile tools, and may be used for anything from opening an [[envelope]], to cutting [[twine]], slicing a piece of [[fruit]] or even as a means of [[self-defense]].&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Stewart| first1 = Ron | last2 = Ritchie| first2 = Roy  |   title = Big Book of Pocket Knives: Identification &amp; Values | publisher = Collector Books| year = 2000 |  pages =348 | isbn =978-1-57432-178-4  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Roman pocket knife Roman Gellep Germany.jpg|thumb|Roman pocketknife: original with a modern reconstruction beside it]]

The earliest known pocketknives date to at least the early of Iron Age. A pocketknife with a bone handle was found at the [[Hallstatt Culture]] type site in Austria, dating to around 600-500 BCE.&lt;ref name="Transdanubia"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Horváth| first1 = László |  last2 = Kovács| first2 = Tibor |  last3 = Szabó| first3 = Miklós |  title = Transdanubia I (Corpus of Celtic Finds in Hungary) (v. 1) | publisher =  Akademiai Kiado| year = 1987 |  pages = 38–41| isbn =978-963-05-3807-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Iberia]]n folding-blade knives made by indigenous artisans and craftsmen and dating to the pre-Roman era have been found in Spain.

== Peasant knife ==
[[File:OpinelKnifeNo3.jpg|thumb|Smaller Opinels are a type of peasant knife]]

The peasant knife, farmer knife, or [[penny knife]] is the original and most basic design of a folding pocketknife, using a simple pivoted blade that folds in and out of the handle freely, without a backspring, slipjoint, or blade locking mechanism.&lt;ref name="AKTI"&gt;''[http://www.akti.org/resources/additional-definitions Diagrams of Knife Mechanisms]'', AKTI, retrieved 19 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The first peasant knives date to the pre-Roman era, but were not widely distributed nor affordable by most people until the advent of limited production of such knives in cutlery centers such as [[Sheffield, England]] commencing around 1650,&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, George C. (ed.), ''The Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute'', Volume 88, Edinburgh: Ballantyne Press (1913), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; with large-scale production starting around the year 1700 with models such as ''Fuller's Penny Knife'' and the ''Wharncliffe Knife''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, John (ed.), ''The Illustrated guide to Sheffield and the Surrounding District'', Sheffield, UK: Pawson and Brailsford (1879), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Some peasant knives used a bolster or tensioning screw at the blade to apply friction to the blade tang in order to keep the blade in the open position.  The smallest (Nos. 2 -5) [[Opinel]] knives are an example of the peasant knife.&lt;ref name="AKTI"/&gt;  The knife's low cost made it a favorite of small farmers, herdsmen, and gardeners in Europe and the Americas during the late 19th and early 20th century.

== Slip joint knife ==
{{main article|Slipjoint}}

Most pocketknives for light duty are slipjoints. This means that the blade does not lock but, once opened, is held in place by tension from a flat bar or leaf-type back[[spring (device)|spring]] that allows the blade to fold if a certain amount of pressure is applied.&lt;ref name="AKTI"/&gt;  The first spring-back knives were developed around 1660 in England,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Simon, ''Penknives and Other Folding Knives'', Buckinghamshire UK: Shire Publications Ltd. (2006), {{ISBN|978-0-85263-966-5}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; but were not widely available until the arrival of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the development of machinery capable of mass production.  Most locking knives have only one blade that is as large as can be fitted into the handle, because the locking mechanism relies on the spring along the back of the blade to lock it and it is difficult to build in multiple levers, one for each blade. Slipjoints tend to be smaller than other typical pocketknives. 

Some popular patterns of slipjoint knives include:

| '''Barlow'''
|The Barlow knife has a characteristically long [[Bolster (knife)#Handle|bolster]], an elongated oval handle, and one or two blades.&lt;ref name="barlow"&gt;{{Cite journal | surname=Emerson | given=Ernest R.| authorlink = Ernest Emerson|title=Grandpa Gave a Part of Himself With That First Knife | journal=Sporting Knives 2003 | isbn= 0-87349-430-X | year=2003 | pages=54–59 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In spite of its apparently British origins, the Barlow knife is often thought of as a quintessentially American pattern due to its popularity there beginning in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="barlowhistory1"&gt;{{cite web | last = Barlow | first = Edson | title = Our Knife | publisher = www.barlowgenealogy.com | url = http://www.barlowgenealogy.com/Edson/barlowknife.html | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barlowhistory2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barlow-knives.com/history.htm|title=History of Barlow Knives|publisher=Advantage-Advertising,LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-tool knives ===
[[File:MultiPurposePocketKnife 7244 03.jpg|thumb|A multitool knife]]
{{Main article|Multi-tool}}

[[Multi-tool]] knives formerly consisted of variations on the American ''camper'' style or the [[Swiss Army knife|''Swiss Army'' knives]] manufactured by [[Victorinox]] and [[Wenger]], however, the concept of a multitool knife has undergone a revolution thanks in part to an avalanche of new styles, sizes, and tool presentation concepts.  These new varieties often incorporate a pair of [[pliers]] and other tools in conjunction with one or more knife blade styles, either locking or nonlocking.

Multitool knives often have more than one blade, including an assortment of knife blade edges (serrated, plain, [[saw]]s) as well as a myriad of other tools such as [[bottle opener]]s, [[corkscrew]]s, and [[scissors]]. A large tool selection is the signature of the Swiss Army Knife. These knives are produced by [[Victorinox]] and [[Wenger]] and issued to military services and sold to the public.  Similar to the Swiss Army knife is the [[German Army]] knife, with two blades opening from each side and featuring hard plastic grips and aluminum liners.  The U.S. Military utility knife (MIL-K-818), issued by the [[United States Army]], Navy, and Marine Corps, was made for many years by the [[Camillus Cutlery Company]] and [[Imperial Schrade]] as well as many other companies.  It was originally produced with [[plain-carbon steel|carbon steel]] blades and [[brass]] liners (both vulnerable to [[corrosion]]), but with the onset of the [[Vietnam War]] was modified to incorporate all-[[stainless steel]] construction.  The current-issue U.S. military utility knife has textured stainless grips and four stainless blades/tools opening on both sides in the camper or scout pattern and has an extremely large clevis or bail.

=== Miscellaneous designs ===
Another style of folding, non-locking knife is the friction-folder. These use simple friction between the blade and scales to hold the blade in place once opened; an example is the Japanese [[higonokami]].

An [[electrician]]'s knife typically has a locking [[screwdriver]] blade but a non-locking knife blade. The two-blade Camillus Electrician's knife (the US military version is known as a TL-29) was the inspiration for the development of the [[linerlock]].&lt;ref name="GW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first= Greg|year=1993|title=Battle Blades: A Professional's Guide to Combat/Fighting Knives | pages =37–38| isbn= 0-87364-732-7|publisher=Paladin Press|location=Boulder, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terzuola|first= Robert|authorlink=Robert Terzuola|publisher= Krause Publications|year=2000| isbn =0-87341-858-1|page =47|title=The Tactical Folding Knife: A Study of the Anatomy and Construction of the Liner-Locked Folder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A credit card knife is a very thin knife that is the shape and size of a credit card. It is designed to be carried in the wallet along with regular credit cards. Some credit card knives can contain other small tools, such as tweezers, or toothpicks.

A [[ballpoint pen knife]] is generally a pen with a concealed knife inside, which can be used as a [[letter opener]] or as a self-defense weapon.

== Lock-blade knives ==
[[File:Small lockback Damascus antler.JPG|thumb|Medium-sized lockback knife with deer-antler grips, nickel-silver bolsters and brass liners]]

Knives with locking blades, often referred to as ''lock-blade knives'' or ''clasp knives'', have a locking mechanism that locks the blade into its fully opened position.  This lock must be released in a distinct action before the knife can be folded.  The lock-blade knife improves safety by preventing accidental blade closure while cutting.  It is this locking blade feature that differentiates the lock-blade knife from either the ''peasant knife'' or the ''slipjoint'' spring-back knife.

Lock-blade knives have been dated to the 15th century.  In Spain, one early lock-blade design was the [[Andalucia|Andalusian]] ''clasp knife'' popularly referred to as the [[navaja]].&lt;ref name="GP"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pacella | first = Gerard | authorlink = | title = 100 Legendary Knives | publisher = Krause Publications| year = 2002| location = | page = 101| isbn = 0-87349-417-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Opinel]] knives use a twist lock, consisting of a metal ferrule or barrel ring that is rotated to lock the blade either open or closed.  In the late 20th century lock-blade pocketknives were popularized and marketed on a wider scale. Companies such as [[Buck Knives]], [[Camillus Cutlery Company|Camillus]], [[W. R. Case &amp; Sons Cutlery Co.|Case]], and [[Gerber Legendary Blades|Gerber]], created a wide range of products with locks of various types. The most popular form, the ''lockback knife'', was popularized by Buck Knives in the 1960s, so much that the eponymous term "buck knife" was used to refer to lockback knives that were not manufactured by Buck.

The lockback's blade locking mechanism is a refinement of the slipjoint design; both use a strong backspring located along the back of the knife.  However, the lockback design incorporates a hook or lug on the backspring, which snaps into a corresponding notch on the blade's heel when the blade is fully opened, locking the blade into position.&lt;ref name="collect"&gt;{{cite book | last = Price | first = C. Houston | authorlink = |author2=Mark D. Zalesky | title = The Official Price Guide to Collector Knives, 15th edition  | publisher = House of Collectibles | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 164–166 | isbn = 978-0-375-72280-6  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Closing the blade requires the user to apply pressure to the bar spring located towards the rear of the knife handle to disengage the hook from the notch and thus release the blade.&lt;ref name="dick"/&gt;

The [[Walker Linerlock]], invented by knifemaker [[Michael Walker (knifemaker)|Michael Walker]], and the framelock came to prominence in the 1980s.  In both designs the liner inside the knife is spring-loaded to engage the rear of the blade when open and thus hold it in place.&lt;ref name="dick"/&gt;  In the case of the framelock, the liner is the handle, itself. The [[Swiss Army knife]] product range has adopted dual linerlocks on their 111&amp;nbsp;mm models. Some models feature additional "positive" locks, which essentially ensure that the blade cannot close accidentally. [[Columbia River Knife and Tool|CRKT]] has patented an "[[LAWKS|Auto-LAWKS]]" device, which features a second sliding switch on the hilt. It can operate as any linerlock knife if so desired, but if the user slides the second control up after opening, it places a wedge between the linerlock and the frame, preventing the lock from disengaging until the second device is disabled.

=== Tactical folding knife ===

Buck's lockback knife was originally marketed as a "folding hunting knife" and while it became popular with sportsmen, it saw use with military personnel as it could perform a variety of tasks.  Custom knife makers began making similar knives, in particular was knifemaker [[Bob Terzuola]]. Terzuola is credited with coining the phrase "Tactical Folder".&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite book | last = Terzuola | first = Bob | authorlink = Bob Terzuola| title = Title The Tactical Folding Knife: A Study of the Anatomy and Construction of the Liner-Locked Folder | publisher = Krause Publications| year = 2000| location = | page = 158| isbn = 978-0-87341-858-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, tactical folding knives became popular in the U.S.A.&lt;ref name="shot"&gt;{{Cite journal | surname=Hopkins| given=Cameron| title=The Worse it Gets, the Better We Like It| journal=American Handgunner Magazine | volume=25 | issue=157 | year=2000 | pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend began with custom knifemakers such as [[Bob Terzuola]], [[Michael Walker (knifemaker)|Michael Walker]], Allen Elishewitz, Mel Pardue, [[Ernest Emerson]], [[Ken Onion]], [[Chris Reeve]], Rick Hinderer, Warren Thomas, and Warren Osbourne.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book | last = Walker | first = Greg | authorlink = | title = Battle Blades: A Professional's Guide to Combat/Fighting Knives| publisher = Krause Publications| year = 1993| page = 210| isbn = 0-87364-732-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These knives were most commonly built as [[linerlock]]s.  Blade lengths varied from {{convert|3|to|12|in}}, but the most typical models never exceeded {{convert|4|in}} in blade length for legal reasons in most US jurisdictions.&lt;ref name ="hartink"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hartink| first = A.E.| authorlink = |  title = Complete Encyclopedia of Knives| publisher =Chartwell Books| date = September 30, 2005| location = Lisse, The Netherlands| pages = 448| isbn =978-1-85409-168-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the demand for these knives, production companies offered mass-produced tactical folding knives.  Companies such as [[Benchmade]], [[Kershaw Knives]], [[Buck Knives]], [[Gerber Legendary Blades|Gerber]], [[CRKT]], and [[Spyderco]] collaborated with tactical knifemakers; in some cases retaining them as full-time designers.&lt;ref name="Spyderco"/&gt;  Tactical knifemakers such as Ernest Emerson and Chris Reeve went so far as to open their own mass-production factories.&lt;ref name ="wsj"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fritz | first = Mark | title = How New, Deadly Pocketknives Became a $1 Billion Business | publisher = The Wall Street Journal | date = 2006-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been criticism against the notion of a "Tactical Folding Knife" when employed as a weapon instead of a utility tool.  Students of [[knife fight]]ing point out that any locking mechanism can fail and that a folding knife regardless of lock strength can never be as reliable as a fixed-blade [[combat knife]]. Lynn Thompson, martial artist and CEO of [[Cold Steel]] pointed out in an article in ''Black Belt'' magazine that most tactical folding knives are too short to be of use in a knife fight and that even though he manufactures, sells, and carries a tactical folder, it is not ideal for fighting.&lt;ref name="RY"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Young | first = Robert | authorlink =  | title = Secrets of the Blade | journal = Black Belt| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 92–97|  year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other features ==

Traditional folding knives are opened using nail-nicks, or slots where the user's [[fingernail]] would enter to pull the blade out of the handle. This became somewhat cumbersome and required use of two hands, so there were innovations to remedy that. The thumb-stud, a small stud on the blade that allows for one-handed opening, led the way for more innovations. One of these being the thumb hole: a [[Spyderco]] patent where the user presses the pad of the thumb against a hole and opens the blade by rotating the thumb similarly to using the thumb-stud.&lt;ref name="Spyderco"&gt;{{cite book |last=Delavigne|first=Kenneth|title=Spyderco Story: The New Shape of Sharp (Hardcover)|year= 2004|publisher=Paladin Press |location=Colorado |isbn=1-58160-060-7 |page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another innovation of [[Spyderco|Sal Glesser]], Spyderco founder, was the clip system, which he named a "Clip-it". Clips are usually metal or plastic and similar to the clips found on pens except thicker. Clips allow the knife to be easily accessible, while keeping it lint-free and unscathed by pocket items such as [[coin]]s.  Assisted opening systems have been pioneered by makers like [[Ken Onion]] with his "Speed-Safe" mechanism and [[Ernest Emerson|Ernest Emerson's]] Wave system, where a hook catches the user's pocket upon removal and the blade is opened during a draw.&lt;ref name="dick"&gt;{{Cite book | surname=Dick | given=Steven| title=The Working Folding Knife | year=1997| publisher= Stoeger Publishing Company |isbn= 978-0-88317-210-0|pages=280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first one handed devices was the automatic spring release, also known as a [[switchblade]]. An innovation to pocketknives made possible by the thumb-stud is the replaceable blade insert developed in 1999 by Steven Overholt (U.S. Patent no. 6,574,868), originally marketed by TigerSharp Technologies and as of 2007 by Clauss. Some systems are somewhat between assisted opening and the normal thumb stud. [[Columbia River Knife and Tool|CRKT]] knives designed by Harold "Kit" Carson often incorporate a "Carson Flipper", which is a small protrusion on the rear of the base of the blade such that it protrudes out the obverse side of the handle (when closed). By using an index finger and a very slight snapping of the wrist, the knife opens very quickly, appearing to operate like a spring assisted knife. When opened, the protrusion is between the base of the sharp blade and the user's index finger, preventing any accidental slipping of the hand onto the blade. Some designs feature a second "Flipper" on the opposite side of the blade, forming a small "hilt guard" such as a fixed blade knife has, which can prevent another blade from sliding up into the hilt in combat.

== Legal issues ==
{{Main article|Knife legislation}}

Pocketknives are legal to own in most countries, but may face legal restrictions on their use. While pocketknives are almost always designed as tools, they do have the potential to be considered by legal authorities as [[weapon]]s.

In the United States, knives are regulated by federal, state, and municipal laws. Some jurisdictions prohibit the possession or use of pocketknives that feature locking blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Roger|title=Massachusetts Knife Law|url=http://www.knifeup.com/massachusetts-knife-law/|publisher=KnifeUp.com|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Roger|title=Ohio Knife Laws|url=http://www.knifeup.com/ohio-knife-laws/|publisher=KnifeUp.com|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Roger|title=West Virginia Knife Laws|url=http://www.knifeup.com/west-virginia-knife-laws/|publisher=KnifeUp.com|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others prohibit certain blade styles perceived by law enforcement and legal authorities as optimal for offensive fighting, transforming the pocketknife from a utility tool into a deadly weapon.&lt;ref name=WLC&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassidy|first= William L.|title=The Complete Book Of Knife Fighting|isbn = 978-0-87364-029-9|year=1997|pages=9–18, 27–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; These might include knives with [[dirk]], [[dagger]] (double-edge), [[Bowie knife#Legal status|bowie]], or [[stiletto]] blades.&lt;ref name=WLC/&gt; In some jurisdictions it is illegal to conceal knives larger than a certain size or with blades over a certain length, particularly when combined with locking blade mechanisms. The possession or carrying of a folding pocketknife with a quick-opening mechanism such as a [[gravity knife]], [[butterfly knife]]/[[Balisong (knife)|balisong]], or [[switchblade]] may be prohibited.  Under U.S. federal law, switchblades and [[ballistic knife|ballistic knives]] are banned from interstate shipment, sale, or import, or possession on federal or Indian lands or U.S. possessions and may be prohibited entirely in some states. Knives of any size or configuration may be prohibited by federal or state laws in certain designated areas or places, such as schools, courthouses, jails, power plants, or airports.&lt;ref name=WLC/&gt;

In the United Kingdom it is illegal to carry a folding knife having a blade more than 3 inches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/139 | title = Criminal Justice Act 1988, Section 139 (revised) | accessdate = 2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (just over 7.6&amp;nbsp;cm) in length in public without "good reason". The terms "in public" and "good reason" are not defined, but examples of "religious duty", "national dress" and "requirement of employment or hobby" are given.  It is left up to a police officer's individual subjective discretion, and ultimately a [[magistrate]] to decide if a knife is being carried "in public", and for a "good reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bkcg.co.uk/guide/law.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020614095108/http://www.bkcg.co.uk/guide/law.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2002-06-14 | title = British Knife Collectors Guild 'The Law' page | accessdate = 2006-11-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Folding knives with blades of {{convert|3|in}} or less may be carried without needing to provide "good reason" so long as the blade is not capable of being locked in the open position. However, it is illegal to have the intention of using any object in public as a weapon, meaning that even a knife that is legal to carry without needing "good reason" may still be found to be illegal if the police officer has grounds to suspect it will be used as a weapon. The onus lies on the officer to prove that intent.  Recent court decisions in the U.K. have made it easier for public prosecutors to obtain knife possession convictions by preventing the accused from citing self-defence or even fear of attack as a justifiable reason for carrying a knife.  The U.K. government advisory website on crime and justice formerly stated that "even if you carry a knife to protect yourself or make yourself feel safer but don’t intend to use it then you are committing a crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/CrimeJusticeAndTheLaw/Typesofcrime/DG_181675 |title=Knife crime |publisher=Directgov |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908135839/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/CrimeJusticeAndTheLaw/Typesofcrime/DG_181675 |archivedate=2012-09-08 |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richmond Coliseum''' is an [[arena]] located in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. It is a venue most often used for various large concerts. Holding 13,500 people, the arena opened in 1971, and the region is looking to replace the aging facility with a larger one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wtvr.com/2018/02/20/replace-richmond-coliseum/ |title=City asks for plan to replace Richmond Coliseum, one group replies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=20 February 2018 |website=wtvr.com |publisher=[[WTVR-TV]] |access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:RichmondColiseumDG.jpg|thumb|200px|Interior of arena, 2010]]
Until [[John Paul Jones Arena]] opened in 2006, the Richmond Coliseum was the largest sports arena in Virginia. The [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] Rams men's basketball team played in the arena until the 7,500-seat [[Stuart C. Siegel Center|Siegel Center]] opened on the VCU campus in 1999.

[[Elvis Presley]] performed a concert at the coliseum on April 10, 1972 with (mostly backstage) footage being used in the film ''[[Elvis on Tour]]'' which documented Presley's spring tour of that year.

The Richmond Coliseum was the former part-time home of the [[Virginia Squires]] of the [[American Basketball Association]]. The Squires played there in addition to [[Roanoke Civic Center]], [[Norfolk Scope]] and [[Hampton Coliseum]] (all within the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]]) from 1970 until just before the [[ABA–NBA merger]] in 1976. The Coliseum also hosted the [[Southern Conference]] men's basketball tournaments in 1973 and 1974.

The [[Sun Belt Conference]] men's basketball tournament was held there in 1988. The [[Colonial Athletic Association]] men's (NCAA) collegiate basketball tournament has been contested at the Richmond Coliseum since 1990. On March 1, 2006, a deal was signed to keep the tournament in Richmond until 2012. The Coliseum served as the primary home for the [[MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament]] between 1998 and 2005, with some games played at the [[Arthur Ashe Athletic Center]].

In 1994, the Coliseum hosted the Women's NCAA Division I Basketball Championship. [[Charlotte Smith (basketball)|Charlotte Smith]] of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] sank a buzzer-beating three-pointer to defeat [[Louisiana Tech University|Louisiana Tech]], 60–59, in the final. The Richmond Coliseum also held the men's NCAA Tournament 1st and second rounds there in 1990 and 1996.

In 1997, a transformer fire caused electrical problems and forced events to be canceled or postponed that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hessler |first=Warner |date=26 January 1997 |title=Admirals Again Stop Richmond |url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1997-01-26/sports/9701260005_1_hampton-roads-admirals-renegades-adrenalin |work=[[Daily Press (Virginia)]] |location=Newport News, Virginia |access-date=22 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been a regular stop for [[professional wrestling]] promotions through the years, including the old [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] ([[Jim Crockett Promotions]]) Mid-Atlantic territory, and more recently, [[WWE]].  In recent years, it hosted the fifteenth [[WWE|WWF]] [[In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell]] pay-per-view in 1997, ''[[Armageddon (2006)|WWE Armageddon]]'' on December 17, 2006, and hosted the televised portion of the [[2010 WWE Draft]]. It held ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown]]'' on November 16, 2010. It held ''[[WWE Raw]]'' on Monday, June 6, 2011 featuring WWE Hall of Famer [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] to announce the winner of ''[[WWE Tough Enough]]''. It also held ''Monday Night Raw'' again May 21, 2012, immediately following [[Over the Limit (2012)|Over the Limit]] in which [[John Cena]] lost a match against [[John Laurinaitis]], with Laurinaitis only winning after The [[Big Show]] intervened. It also held WWE Friday Night SmackDown on December 30, 2012, the final WWE event of the year. It hosted the December 30th, 2013, the July 14, 2014 and the May 18, 2015 editions of Raw. On September 11, 2016, it hosted the return of [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]].

The Coliseum has also been a site for the [[Professional Bull Riders]]. In 1998 and 1999, a Built Ford Tough Series Bud Light Cup event known as the [[Lane Frost]] Memorial was held in the Coliseum; the PBR returned in 2007 to host minor-league tour stops sponsored by former bull rider Greg Potter.

==Layout==
The Richmond Coliseum is laid out on six levels. In order from lowest to highest they are the event level, the mezzanine, the lower concourse, the upper concourse, the 300 level and the ring. The event level is where the event floor (and ice rink) is located, as well as all the support rooms for events and the building. Team locker rooms, star dressing rooms, Exhibition halls, the Coliseum Club and the kitchens are located on the event level. The Clay Street tunnel, one of the innovative features of the coliseum, is on the event level and allows vehicles, including tractor trailers and monster trucks, to pull into the coliseum. It is accessed at the intersection of Clay Street and Eighth Street. The tunnel provides storage for shows and parking for coliseum personnel. The mezzanine is where the administrative offices for the coliseum are located. The Leigh Street entrance is on this level. The lower concourse is the access for all lower level seating and suites. The Fifth Street and Sixth Street entrances are located on this level, as well as exits to the areas above Clay Street and Leigh Street. The upper concourse is the access for all upper level seating and the 300 level is access to the highest seats on either radius of the coliseum. The ring is where the spotlights are operated and is the access to the catwalk.

'''James Robert Cade''' (September 26, 1927 – November 27, 2007) was an American physician, university professor, research scientist and inventor. Cade, a native of [[Texas]], earned his bachelor and medical degrees at the [[University of Texas]], and became a professor of medicine and [[nephrology]] at the [[University of Florida]]. Although Cade engaged in many areas of medical research, he is most widely remembered as the leader of the research team that created the sports drink [[Gatorade]].&lt;ref name=han2242003&gt;Arline Phillips-Han, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060903033228/http://news.health.ufl.edu/story.aspx?ID=703 Dr. Robert Cade . . . saga of the world's best-selling sports drink and the creative physician scientist behind it]," ''Health Science Center News'', University of Florida (February 24, 2003). Retrieved December 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Gatorade would have significant medical applications for treating dehydration in patients, and has generated over $150 million in royalties for the university.

In his later years, Cade became a prominent philanthropist, donating significant sums to charities affiliated with the Lutheran Church, creating scholarships and donating freely to the University of Florida and other colleges and universities, and endowing his own charitable foundations.

==Invention of Gatorade==

In 1965, Cade was approached by [[Dewayne Douglas]], an assistant coach for the [[Florida Gators football]] team, about the extreme [[dehydration]] faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the [[Deep South]] in late summer and early fall.&lt;ref name=mcleod8142005&gt;Michael McLeod, "[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-08-14/news/GATORADE14_1_gatorade-cade-shires Gator-made]," ''Orlando Sentinel'' (August 14, 2005). Retrieved February 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games.&lt;ref name=mcleod8142005/&gt; Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games.&lt;ref name=mcleod8142005/&gt; Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a [[college football]] game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water.&lt;ref name=ap11272007/&gt; A player's [[blood plasma|plasma]] volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.&lt;ref name=ap11272007/&gt;

During 1965 and 1966, Cade, together with his team of research doctors [[Dana Shires]], James Free, and Alejandro M. de Quesada, conducted a series of trial-and-error experiments with his [[glucose]]-and-[[electrolyte]]s rehydration drink on members of the Gators football team of coach [[Ray Graves]], first with members of the freshman squad, and after initially promising results, with starting members of the varsity team.&lt;ref name=han2242003/&gt; "It didn't taste like Gatorade," Cade said in a 1988 interview with ''[[Florida Trend]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=martin11282007/&gt; In fact, according to Cade, when Gators lineman [[Larry Gagner]] first tried it, he spat it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste.&lt;ref name=martin11282007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00006169/00001/68j Cade Interview], pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Dana Shires remembered that "it sort of tasted like toilet bowl cleaner."&lt;ref name=times11292007&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100523042933/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2962479.ece Robert Cade: Scientist who invented Gatorade, the world's first and biggest-selling sports drink]," ''The Times'' (November 29, 2007).

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=October 2016}}
Artyom Kolchin, the story's protagonist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinokadr.ru/articles/2005/03/16/shadowboxing_2.shtml Кино в сверхтяжёлом весе]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[boxing|boxer]], who has become a contender for the world boxing championship. The whole country knows him and wants him to win. In the beginning of the film, while they are both waiting at a crosswalk for the light to change, [[Brigada|Sasha Belov]] asks for his autograph for his son Ivan, who is in [[England]] and is learning boxing. Artyom likes his car and Sasha says he will give it to Artyom if he wins the fight. Valiyev, a man well known in both the criminal and business worlds, takes care of Artyom and refuses to accept the fights scenario presented by the opponent's manager, according to which Artyom should lose the first fight, win a return-match; after the third fight both opponents will be famous and TV channels will fight to get permission to show the match. However, Artyom cannot fight because he has eye problems. The doctor does not want to grant him permission to fight, but he asks her very pitifully, and, unable to endure the begging, she gives him the permit.

During the fight in the ring, Aryom receives a severe blow and his vision becomes worse and worse. Soon, he can only guess where his opponent is, and after a short attack exchange, he loses consciousness.

Artem ends up in a hospital; the doctor, who has fallen in love with him, visits him and tells him the diagnosis: [[Retinal detachment]]. At the moment, it is possible to save his sight, she says, but the blindness is going to progress. If it is not cured in three days, it will never be curable. The operation costs $30,000. Artyom does not have this much money, and neither does the doctor. Artyom had been like a son to his benefactor, Valiyev, who has several million dollars, but Artyom has disappointed him, so he refuses to pay for the operation.

The only thing Artyom can do is to violate the law to save his own sight and his new love, the doctor Victoria. She becomes a witness to a murder of her ex-boyfriend who was a drug dealer and to whom she came to borrow money, so someone is after her in order to arrest her, kill her, and register her death as an accident. A hired killer is also hunting her. She, her teenage [[communist]] brother Konstantin (Kostya), and Artyom hide. The police are told to hunt Artyom but they are given no instructions and the policemen do not know why they must watch him.

Artyom, with Kostya's help, prepares to rob a bank belonging to Valiyev. They buy a powerful fire cracker and put it into a beer can. Kostya passes the guard, holding the can and gets stopped. He is told that he may not bring beer into the bank. Konstantin agrees, throws the can into a trash bin and walks away to hide at a corner. Artyom goes into the bank, pulls a debit card from his pocket and feigns trying to get cash from the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. A guard helps him. At that moment, cash messengers arrive. Kostya detonates the [[firecracker]], and Artyom attacks the guards and the cashiers. When nearly everyone is knocked down, one cashier pulls out his gun. Artyom hears the trigger click and knocks down this cashier too.

One of Artyom's fans arranges for Artyom to have an illegal operation. After the procedure, Artyom's eyes are bandaged. Valiyev's people get him, but Artyom does not know it. They bring him to Valiyev's house and discover his eyes, but Artyom pretends he still cannot see. Valiyev says: "You're not in a hospital."&lt;!-- I've deleted word "son" because really "sonny" was said and it was not in this sentence but the previous one --&gt; They are going to torture Artyom to learn where the money is, and then continue to torture him until he dies. But Artyom's feigned helplessness stills their suspicions, and they leave the room, leaving only two men there. Artyom asks them to fetch some water for him. One man goes for water. Artyom then calls another man and tells him that he stole more than 2 million dollars, he will not return the money to Valiyev so he wants to tell him (the second guard) where the money is. The guard bends down over his bed, and Artyom suddenly knocks him down. He knocks down the other guard and leaves the house.

During an open air play of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', a hired killer finds Vika. Artyom gave her a gun before being taken to the operation, so she pulls it out and points it at the killer, but her hands are trembling and she is not able to pull the trigger. Grinning, the killer slowly takes the gun and points it at Vika just as Artyom appears behind his back and hits him.

A bit later Valiyev finds Artyom and shoots him. Artyom is badly wounded, arrested and taken to a hospital. Next day the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] arrests Valiyev.

After some years have passed, Artyom's term of imprisonment is over. He is let out and is met by Vika and their mutual friends. Suddenly, someone calls one of his friends and asks in [[English language|English]] to call Artyom. Artyom answers. The camera quickly pans from the prison's walls to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The caller is Larry, his opponent in the fight during which he lost ability to see. He says he knows that Artyom is free and asks him if he wants a rematch. Artem is silent. Larry repeats his question, "I said, how 'bout a rematch?". The camera quickly pans back and shows wild snowy field and far forest. Artyom looks at the field, smiles widely and lowers the phone and the film ends without showing the answer.

'''South Gloucestershire and Stroud College''', also known as '''SGS College''' is a college of [[further education]] and [[higher education]] based in [[South Gloucestershire]] and [[Stroud (district)|Stroud]], England. It was established in February 2012 following the merger of Filton College and Stroud College. The college is made up of five campuses located in and around [[Bristol|North Bristol]] and [[Stroud]].

==History==
South Gloucestershire and Stroud College was formed when Filton College and Stroud College merged in early 2012.

Filton College was founded in 1960 as Filton Technical College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lytton|first1=Charlotte|title=South Gloucestershire and Stroud College guide|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/9978702/South-Gloucestershire-and-Stroud-College-guide.html|accessdate=11 December 2015|work=Telegraph|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965 the college had over 2000 students, many of whom were part-time. In 1990 the college officially changed its name to Filton College. The next major development for the college was in 2005 when the WISE Campus (West of England Institute of Specialised Education) was opened, at a cost of £17.5 million. It is dedicated to performing arts, fine art and sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College History|url=http://www.sgscol.ac.uk/college-history/|publisher=South Gloucestershire and Stroud College.|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroud College started in the School of Art in 1860.  This was later renamed The Technical College, and was located in various buildings in  Stroud. Only in the 1950s, after the town council was gifted [[Stratford Park]], did the college relocate to the present campus on Stratford Road.  The Art Department remained for many years in the Art School in Stroud. The Gloucestershire College of Art was created from the merger of the Stroud School of Art and the Cheltenham College of Art in 1959.&lt;ref name="University timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.glos.ac.uk/ucu/uni-timeline.htm |title=Timeline of two centuries of educational history |publisher= University of Gloucestershire |accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="150 art education"&gt;'150 years of Art Education', 2002, University of Gloucestershire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
SGS provides a number of qualifications including [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] and [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]], as well as a number of [[Vocational education|vocational courses]] leading to [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] First and National Diplomas and other similar qualifications, and some higher education courses leading [[Higher National Diploma|HND]], foundation degrees and full BA/BSc (Hons) degrees through partnership with the [[university of Gloucestershire]] It also runs [[Teaching English as a foreign language|EFL]] programmes for non-native speakers of English.

The college offers a range of BA/BSc top ups, [[foundation degree]] and [[Higher National Certificate|HNC]] courses in conjunction with the [[University of Gloucestershire]].

The college is a [[Centre of Vocational Excellence]] in [[Natural gas|gas engineering]] in partnership with [[Centrica]] and is a partner in a CoVE in [[aeronautical engineering]] led by [[City of Bristol College]].

==Campuses==
South Gloucestershire and Stroud College (SGS) has six campuses, Filton, WISE, Queens Road, Clifton, Stroud and Berkeley Green.

===SGS Filton===
The Filton campus of the college is located in Filton Avenue, Filton, Bristol.
A-level students attend classes at the main A-level Block (A-Block), adjacent to the main campus or in classrooms within the main site. At the A-level Block there is a small cafe selling hot drinks and a few hot meals.

This article presents a [[chronology]] of sporting development and events from time immemorial until the end of the 10th century CE. The major sporting event of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman periods]] was the original [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], which were held every four years at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] for over a thousand years. [[Gladiator]]ial contests and [[chariot racing]] were massively popular. Some modern sports such as [[archery]], [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], [[boxing]], [[football]], [[horse racing]] and [[wrestling]] can directly trace their origins back to this period while later sports like [[cricket]] and [[golf]] trace their evolution from basic activities such as hitting a stone with a stick.

==Ball and stick games==
There are many modern games which call upon the basic action of hitting a ball with some kind of club or stick. These include [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[croquet]], [[golf]], all forms of [[hockey]], [[rounders]] and all forms of [[tennis]]. It can be argued that these sports share a common origin which dates back to time immemorial and, as such, can never be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Major |first=John |authorlink=John Major |title=More Than A Game |page=17 |year=2007 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-718364-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surf art''' is [[visual art]] about or related to the sport of [[surfing]], waves, and the culture that surrounds beaches.
There is a strong connection between [[art]] and [[surf culture]], which reaches back 3,000 years to [[Peru]], where some of the world's first historians carved [[bas-relief]]s of surfers. The intersection of surf and art realms today, however, extends far beyond art documenting life.  Both have stretched to encompass each other and the areas of [[popular culture]] and [[commercialism]]. Art today incorporates [[graffiti]], advertisements and everyday items, and surfing is as much about clothes, attitude and [[Punk rock|punk music]] as it is hitting the waves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sjmusart.org/exhibition/surf-culture-art-history-surfing|title=Exhibitions + Collection|date=2009-12-21|work=San José Museum of Art|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photography]] is a popular and influential medium of surf art. Imagery documents life, and in surfing terms, it encapsulates a passion, a sport, and a lifestyle. The main objective of surf photography is to not only enlighten the viewer of the pleasures of surfing, but also to demonstrate other facets of the life of a surfer.&lt;ref name= "photography"&gt;[http://www.legendarysurfers.com/surf/legends/ls07.shtml Gault-Williams, Malcolm.  "Legendary Surfers: A Definitive History of Surfing's Culture and Heroes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

While many artists within the field of 'surf art' do not attach themselves to the specific moniker as creators of only surf related art. Other terms often used are 'ocean art', 'wave art', and 'art of the sea' among others.

Variations of surf art as a subject matter can fall within other art styles such as Impressionism, surrealism, abstract, realism, et al.

Among coastal communities around the world, surf art in any form is growing in popularity and price. Recently in 2011 Contemporary Artist Raymond Pettibon sold 'No Title (But the sand)' at Christies for $820,000 USD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/raymond-pettibon-no-title-5478933-details.aspx] From Christies: "In No Title (But the sand...), a wave of gigantic proportions forms a high, foamy peak against a flat, dark-blue ocean with no land visible on the horizon. Multicolored surfboards without their riders are caught in free-fall down the side of the wave. A text is inscribed at the bottom-left: "But the sand or clay to which by one or the other process we are reducible are turned to glass and foam."&lt;/ref&gt;

Surf art has been created as cave drawings by old [[native Hawaiians]] along with [[Painting|painters]], [[Surrealism|surrealists]], [[graphic designer]]s, [[sculpture]]s and [[installation art]]ists. Many are surfers themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Surf art has spread from coastal areas to urban cities, such as New York, where surf culture and art exhibitions can now be found.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/nyregion/17surfboard.html|title=Art for Catching the Eye, and the Waves|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Notable surf artists include [[Rick Griffin]], [[Raymond Pettibon]], [[Leroy grannis|Leroy Grannis]], [[John Van Hamersveld]], [[Kevin A Short]], [[Drew Brophy]], [[Ithaka Darin Pappas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/art-530385-board-boards.html|title=Broken boards given new life as art|date=2013-10-09|work=Orange County Register|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zak Noyle]], [[Jay Alders]], and [[Aaron Chang]].

==Surf Graphics==
The term “Surf Graphics” is used to describe the style of artwork associated with the subculture of surfing when applied to posters, flyers, T-shirts and logos. It is heavily influenced by skate art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Surf Graphics|date=2012|publisher=Korero Press|isbn=9781907621086|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kustom Kulture]] and [[tiki culture]].

==Brazilian Surf Art==
In Brazil, an artist and curator named Fernando Bari, who created in 2004 a unique website gathering surf artists around the world, have been searching for Brazilian artist who represents the beach culture. The meaning of the community is to share knowledge, mediums and spread the surf art in Brazil. The site also keeps and promotes art exhibitions, uniting artists and keep the community alive.

'''Weserstadion''' ({{IPA-de|ˈveːzɐˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn|-|}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Bremen]], Germany. The Weserstadion is scenically situated on the north bank of the [[Weser River]] and is surrounded by lush green parks (the name 'Werder' is a regional German word for "river peninsula"). The city center is only about a kilometer away. It is the home stadium of German [[Bundesliga]] club [[Werder Bremen]].

Artists that have performed at the stadium include [[Bon Jovi]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Metallica]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Van Halen]], among others.

The stadium originally included an athletics track, but that was partially removed in 2002 when the pitch was sunk by {{convert|2.1|m}} and the stands at the straights were lengthened to the new pitch. With this the capacity rose with about 8,000 places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weserstadion.de/weser-stadion/historie/ |title=Historie - Weser-Stadion - Bremer Weser-Stadion GmbH |website=Weserstadion.de |date= |accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 four office towers were built behind the north stand. These towers offer a restaurant and offices for the club and local companies.

Starting in 2008 the stadium was completely rebuilt. The façade was coated with [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic panels]] and a new roof was built on top of the old roof supporting structure (the old roof itself was torn down). Both ends (east and west) were torn down and rebuilt parallel to the endline of the pitch, removing what was left of the old athletics track.

'''William Bowra''' (1752 – 7 May 1820) was an English [[cricket]]er who played regularly for Kent teams from 1768 until 1788 and then for Sussex until 1792.  He had 47 known first-class appearances between 1775 and 1792.  His name was pronounced "Borra".

Bowra is thought to have been born at [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]].  In a ''Hampshire Chronicle'' report of a 1775 game, his name is spelt "Bower".  Bowra, probably the son of [[John Bowra]], was a very useful batsman who was employed by [[John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]] as a gamekeeper.  He is believed to have been an outstanding fielder in close positions as a great many catches were credited to him.&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke of Dorset was a great admirer of his play and the sources have recorded, perhaps as an anecdote, that Dorset used to sit on the railing round the [[Vine Cricket Ground|Sevenoaks Vine]] ground to watch him bat, often exclaiming: "Bravo, my little Bowra".&lt;ref name=JN&gt;[[Ashley Mote]], ''John Nyren's "The Cricketers of my Time"'', Robson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowra subsequently played for the Brighton team during 1790–1792 and once made 60* for Brighton v [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).  At this time he was perhaps employed on one of Dorset’s estates in Sussex.  He returned to [[Knole House]] in 1807, again as gamekeeper, and it is believed he stayed there till his death in 1820.&lt;ref name=LLB&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153249/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1761.html#bowraw |date=10 October 2012 |title=From Lads to Lord's – biography of William Bowra }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
