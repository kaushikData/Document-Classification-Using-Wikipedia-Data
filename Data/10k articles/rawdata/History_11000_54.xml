The '''21st''' ('''twenty-first''') '''century''' is the current [[century]] of the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' era or [[Common Era]], in accordance with the [[Gregorian calendar]]. It began on January 1, 2001,&lt;!-- DON'T CHANGE YEAR TO 2000. THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY STARTS 2001, NOT 2000. --&gt; and will end on December 31, 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/millennium.php|title=The 21st Century and the 3rd Millennium|website=aa.usno.navy.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first century of the [[3rd millennium]]. It is distinct from the century known as the 2000s which began on January 1, 2000 and will end on December 31, 2099.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-is-the-beginning-of/|title=When is the beginning of the new millennium?

According to [[World Economic Forum]], 65% of children entering [[primary school]] will end up in jobs or careers that currently do not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/31/the-future-of-work-wont-be-about-degrees-it-will-be-about-skills.html&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[United Nations]] World Urbanization prospects, 60% of the world's human population are projected to live in [[megacity|megacities]] and [[megalopolis]]es by 2030, and 70% by 2050. By 2040, more than 5 times the current global GDP are expected to be invested in urban infrastructure and its use.&lt;ref&gt;https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/publications/files/wup2014-highlights.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions and changes==
[[File:Shanghai Skyline, Dec2014.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Shanghai]] has become a symbol of the recent economic boom of [[China]].]]
The first years of the 21st century have thus far been marked by the rise of a [[global economy]] and [[Third World]] [[consumerism]], mistrust in [[government]], deepening global concern over terrorism and an increase in the power of [[private enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Majority of Americans distrust the government|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/19/us-americans-government-poll-idUSTRE63I0FB20100419|newspaper = Reuters|date = April 19, 2010|access-date = June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Rational Extremism: Understanding Terrorism in the Twenty-first Century|author=David A.

In [[contemporary history]], the 21st century essentially began in 1991 (the end of the [[Short Twentieth Century]]) with the [[United States]] as the sole [[superpower]] in the absence of the [[Soviet Union]], while [[China]] began its [[Chinese Century|rise]]  and the [[BRICS]] countries aimed to create more [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance]] in the [[Global politics|global political]] and economic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Why The U.S. Remains The World's Unchallenged Superpower|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/11/24/why-the-u-s-remains-the-worlds-unchallenged-superpower/|accessdate = June 1, 2015|first = Capital|last = Flows}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Bric tries to shift power balance|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8620178.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = April 15, 2010|access-date = June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religion]] has been declining worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/|title=The World's Newest Major Religion: No Religion|date=April 22, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated 1.1 billion unaffiliated people in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec|title=The Global Religious Landscape|date=December 18, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completion of the [[Human Genome Project]] in 2003 marks the continual rise of life sciences, making mankind's long-held dreams, such as curing cancer, more realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From human genome to cancer genome: The first decade|journal = Genome Research|date = July 2013|issn = 1088-9051|pmc = 3698498|pmid = 23817046|pages = 1054–1062|volume = 23|issue = 7|doi = 10.1101/gr.157602.113|first = David A.|last = Wheeler|first2 = Linghua|last2 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2010s, [[gene therapy]], first performed somatically in late 1990 and heritably in 1996, showed promise but remains an experimental and emerging technology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Assistive reproductive technology]] developed in the 1980s, such as [[polar body biopsy]] and [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], has allowed for the selection of genetic traits, and, along with the advent of [[ultrasound]], has increased the number of boys and decreased the number of girls in many countries, most notably in China and India but also in other Asian and eastern Europe countries.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Sex%20Imbalances%20at%20Birth.%20PDF%20UNFPA%20APRO%20publication%202012.pdf|title=Sex Imbalances at Birth: Current trends, consequences and policy implications|date=August 2012|publisher=UNFPA Asia and the Pacific Regional Office |accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began in the late 1980s in China and India and after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in the Balkans and Caucasus regions, concurrent with both the advent of [[capitalism]] in those countries and the widespread availability of reproductive technology.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;

While digital telecommunications technology became widely used by most of the world, concerns about [[Stress (biological)|stress]] from the overuse of [[mobile phone]]s, the [[Internet]], and related technologies remain controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Workplace trends: Technology increases workplace stress|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3840/is_199910/ai_n8869850|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206092116/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3840/is_199910/ai_n8869850|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-06|work=Office World News|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, about 80% of the world's population used [[mobile phone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techi.com/2013/06/the-growth-of-mobile/|title=The growth of mobile|work=Techi.com|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 33% owned personal computers in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15062710|title=It's a PC world: Global computer ownership will continue to rise in 2010|author=|publisher=The Economist|date=December 29, 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 46% used the Internet by 2016, compared to about 1% in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/|title=Internet Users|author=|publisher=InternetLiveStats.com|date=March 2016|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of modern technology is not equal – in 2012 it was estimated that 1.5 billion people, or about 20% of the world's population still lacked access to [[electric power]], with many more having only intermittent or poor access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/statoil/2015/02/17/how-microgrids-could-bring-electricity-to-1-5-billion-people/|title=StatoilVoice: How Microgrids Could Bring Electricity To 1.5 Billion People|author=Statoil|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Isolierte-Völker.png|thumb|300px|A map of [[uncontacted tribes]], around the start of the 21st century]]

The [[International Energy Agency]] estimates that 83% of the global population has access to [[electricity]] as of 2013 with the percentage projected to increase to 88% by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energydevelopment/energyaccessdatabase/|title=Access to Electricity|author=|publisher=[[International Energy Agency]]|date=2016|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2014/march/when-measuring-energy-poverty-the-best-and-latest-data-come-from-the-iea.html|title=When measuring energy poverty, the best and latest data come from the IEA|author=|publisher=[[International Energy Agency]]|date=March 7, 2014|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population===
The [[world population]] was about 6.1 billion at the start of the 21st century and reached 7.5 billion in 2017. It is [[Projections of population growth|estimated to reach]] about 8.5 billion by the year 2030, and 9.37 billion by the year 2050.&lt;ref name="World Population"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_population.php | title=World Population | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, International Data Base. | date=December 2013 | accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation==
There is a debate among experts and the general public on how to pronounce specific years of the 21st century in English. Regarding this, academics suggested that since former years such as 1805 and 1905 were commonly pronounced as "eighteen oh" or "nineteen oh" five, the year 2005 should naturally have been pronounced as "twenty oh-five".&lt;ref name="preferMC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article376957.ece|title=Login|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less common variation would have been "twenty nought-five". Generally, the [[2000s (decade)|early years of the 21st century]] were pronounced as "two-thousand (and) five", with a change taking place in 2010, where pronunciations often shift between the early-year standard of "two-thousand and ten" and the common approach used in the late 20th century of "twenty-ten".

The [[2010 Winter Olympics|Vancouver Olympics]], which took place in 2010, was being officially referred to by ''Vancouver 2010'' as "the twenty-ten Olympics". The latest timeframes for change are usually placed at 2020.&lt;ref name="preferMC" /&gt;

According to The [[Stanley Kubrick]] Archives, in the press release for his film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', film director Stanley Kubrick included specific instructions for journalists to refer to the movie as "two thousand and one" instead of the commonplace pronunciation of "twenty-oh-one". Kubrick said he did this in the hope that if the film became popular, it would influence the pronunciation of that year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/film/new/00301/facts.the_stanley_kubrick_archives.htm|title=The Stanley Kubrick Archives|author=TASCHEN|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genocide still remains a problem in this century with the concern of the [[war in Darfur]] and the growing concern in [[Sri Lanka]]. Low estimates on the deaths in Darfur stand around 200,000 deaths with 2.5 million in displacement, there has been much outcry against the [[Janjaweed|perpetrators]], the Sudanese government, and the very weak international response. Also, controversies from past genocides remain commonplace in the minds of victims and average people alike.

====2000s====
*1998–2002 – The [[Second Congo War]] continued into the early 21st century. A 1999 ceasefire quickly broke down and a UN peacekeeping mission, [[MONUC]], was unable to control the fighting. Troops from [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] continued to support rebel groups against the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and rifts also grew between Rwanda and Uganda as they accused each other of supporting rival rebel groups as well. [[Laurent Kabila]], president of the DRC, was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, [[Joseph Kabila]], took power. Throughout 2002 steps were made towards peace and Rwanda and Uganda both removed their troops from the country. On December 17, 2002, a massive treaty officially ended the war. However, the DRC only holds power in less than half of the country, with most of the eastern and northern portions still controlled by rebel groups, where there is still significant infighting. In addition, Rwanda still supports anti-DRC rebels and anti-Rwandan rebels continue to operate from the DRC. The war killed an estimated 3.9 million people, displaced nearly 5.5 million, and led to a widespread and ongoing famine that continues to result in deaths. Severe human rights violations continue to be reported.
*2001 - The [[Nepalese royal massacre|Nepalese Royal Massacre]] occurred on 1 June 2001, at a house on the grounds of the [[Narayanhity Palace|Narayanhity Royal Palace]], the residence of the Nepalese monarchy. Ten members of the family were killed during a party or monthly reunion dinner of the royal family in the house. The dead included [[King Birendra of Nepal]] and [[Queen Aishwarya of Nepal|Queen Aishwarya]].
*2001 – [[George W. Bush]] is [[First inauguration of George W. Bush|inaugurated]] as the 43rd President of the United States. He is the second president from the [[Bush family]].
*2001 – [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] becomes the second woman [[President of the Philippines]] and the first to be the child of a previous President, [[Diosdado Macapagal]].
*2001 – More than 200,000 [[Anti-globalization movement|Anti-globalization protesters]] marched in [[Genoa]], during the [[27th G8 summit]]. Two demonstrators were killed by the [[Italian police]]. On July 21 a group of [[Carabinieri]] [[2001 Raid on Armando Diaz|attacked the school Armando Diaz]], seriously injuring many peaceful protesters. Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] insisted that police used the minimum amount of force necessary to achieve their goals.
*[[September 11 attacks|2001]] – Nineteen [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijack]] four [[commercial airliner]]s and [[September 11 attacks|crash two of them]] into the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], one into [[the Pentagon]] and one into a field in [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]] of the United States on September 11, killing nearly 3,000 people. The United States subsequently declares the [[War on Terror]].
*2001–2014 – The [[Northern Alliance]] and [[NATO]]-led [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invaded]] [[Afghanistan]] on [[Operation Enduring Freedom|October 7, 2001]], and overthrew the Al-Qaeda-supportive [[Taliban]] government. Troops remained to install a democratic government, fight a slowly escalating insurgency, and to hunt for Al-Qaeda leader [[Osama bin Laden]] who was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|killed]] by [[SEAL Team Six|American troops]] nearly 10 years later, on May 2, 2011. On December 24, 2014 NATO forces officially ended combat operations in Afghanistan; but forces still remain to the present.
*2001 – The [[Netherlands]] become the first country in the world to legalize [[same-sex marriage]].
*2001 – After 15 years of negotiations, the [[People's Republic of China]] became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 11 December 2001.
*2002 – The [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) was established on July 1.
*2002 – [[Switzerland]], a [[neutral country]], becomes a member of the [[United Nations]], on September 10.
*2002 – [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], a violent Islamist group, claimed responsibility for the [[2002 Bali bombings|detonation of three bombs]] in the tourist district of [[Kuta]] on the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Bali]]. The attack killed 202 people and 209 people were injured.
*2002 – After a long period of [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation by Indonesia]], [[East Timor]]'s independence is recognized by [[Portugal]] and by the [[United Nations|UN]].
*2003–present – In February 2003, a conflict in [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]], began and soon escalated into [[War in Darfur|full-scale war]]. By 2008 it was believed that up to 400,000 people had been killed and over 2.5 million displaced. In 2005, the ICC decided that Darfur war criminals would be tried, and on July 14, 2008, Sudanese president [[Omar al-Bashir]] was charged with 5 accounts of [[crimes against humanity]] and 2 accounts of war crimes, although the ICC has no power to enforce these charges.
*2003–2010 – The [[Multinational force in Iraq|U.S.-led coalition]] [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded]] [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] on March 20, 2003, and overthrew the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] (who was executed by the Iraqi government on December 30, 2006). Coalition troops remain in the country to install a democratic government and fight an escalating insurgency. In addition to an insurgency against the American presence, Iraq also suffered from a [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|civil war]] for several years. The war was soon seen as the central front of the War on Terror by many governments, despite growing international dissatisfaction with the war. The [[Casualties of the Iraq War|total death toll]] has been estimated at near 150,000 but these estimations are highly disputed, with one highly disputed study guessing even over 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiwar.com/casualties/|title=Estimated casualties in Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the U.S.-led coalition initiated a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge]] in 2007, casualty numbers have decreased significantly. Combat ended, at least officially, in August 2010.
*2003–2005 – A series of [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[revolution]]s known as the [[colour revolution]]s overthrew governments in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Lebanon]].
*2003 – Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] announced that Libya would voluntarily eliminate all [[Libya and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].
*2004 – [[2004 Madrid train bombings|Ten explosions occurred]] at the [[Cercanías Madrid|Cercanías]] commuter train system of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], on the morning of March 11. The explosions killed 191 people and injured around 2,000.
*2004 – The [[European Union]] [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|expanded]] by 10 countries (8 former communist countries, plus [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]]).

===Storage and media===

[[Image:iPhone First Generation.jpg|thumb|The original [[iPhone (1st generation)|iPhone]], launched in 2007.]]
* [[DVD]]s and subsequently [[digital video recorder]]s (DVRs) replaced [[videotape]]-based [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] at the start of the 21st century, circa 2007.
* [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] technology emerged.
* [[Compact disc]]s succeeded [[Compact Cassette|Cassettes]], and they were rapidly outpaced by digital music downloads and online streaming services. As of 2018, compact discs are still sold in stores while cassettes became obsolete during the early 21st century.
* [[High-definition television]] (HDTV) began to replace [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] during the first decade of the century. [[Ultra-high-definition television]] (UHDTV) begins to emerge in the 2010s.
* The [[World Wide Web]] and websites became a major new medium for storing files and information.
* Mobile devices such as [[Smartphone|''smartphones'']] ([[iPhone]] was introduced in 2007) and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] ([[iPad]] introduced in 2010) connect to the Internet. These gradually started to replace desktop and laptop computers in the early and mid-2010s, although laptop and desktop computers are still common in business, financial, medical,  governmental, and educational settings.  Desktop computers in home settings gradually became less common during the 2010s.  Laptop computers grew rapidly in popularity from 2000 until the early 2010s, when growth leveled off due to the growth of smartphones and tablets.  The smartphone and tablets became standard for many consumers.
* Online streaming services such as [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], and [[Amazon Video]] became an alternative to traditional television and movie entertainment throughout the second decade of the 21st century.
* [[USB flash drive|Flash drives]], [[memory card]]s, and [[File hosting service|online storage]] mediums are replacing the more traditional forms of computer storage, such as [[CD-RW]], although this type of media still exists.  Floppy disks became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century.  Such forms of storage media is able to store massive amounts of data in smaller sizes. 
* Broadband internet becomes widespread throughout most developed countries. [[Fiber optics]] makes extremely fast internet connections, 1 Gbit/s speeds and higher available for consumers and businesses.  Lower income regions of the world use mobile internet services often delivered over [[2G]], [[3G]], or [[4G]]/[[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] wireless networks.  This has created a [[digital divide]] between areas where high speed internet service is ubiquitous and where it is very limited. Broadband internet still lacks availability in isolated, rural communities compared to populated, urban and suburban communities.
* [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]] technology becomes a widespread commercial industry in 2016 with the release of the [[Oculus Rift]] and subsequent releases of the [[HTC Vive]] and [[PlayStation VR]].

===Social technology===
* The Digital Revolution continued into the early 21st century with mobile usage and Internet access growing massively in the early 21st century. By the 2010s, the majority of people in the developed world had Internet access and the majority of people worldwide had a mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;

*The [[Internet]] (created in 1969) and [[World Wide Web]] (created in 1991) continue to rise in popularity and [[social networking]] emerges in the early 21st century as a popular social communication, largely replacing much of the function of [[email]], [[message board]]s and [[instant messaging]] services, although instant messaging services such as [[WhatsApp]] are popular among smartphone users as of circa 2015. [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]] and [[Snapchat]] are all major examples of social media apps to gain widespread popularity.
*The use of [[webcam]]s and [[front-facing camera]]s on PCs and related devices, and services such as [[Skype]] and [[FaceTime]], make [[video calling]] and [[video conferencing]] a modern form of digital communication.

==Society==
As the century began, the generations which had experienced the crises of the mid and the late 20th century (the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]) as adults, were retiring from leadership positions and public life. Taking their places were members of the postwar [[baby boom|"Boom"]] generations, whose formative experiences were the social upheavals (and, in the Western world, relative prosperity) of the 1960s and 1970s.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] which emerged in the 1980s continued to spread yet more treatment of AIDS made the disease less of a deadly threat to those with access to treatment. A cure was still not found in the 2000s despite expectations.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[Same-sex marriage]] has slowly become more accepted, and has become legal in some countries. In 2001 the [[Netherlands]] became the first nation in the world to legalize this type of marriage. The 2000s decade saw significant change surrounding this social issue and the change has continued into the 2010s.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

By 2001 most Western countries had removed the remaining racial language in their laws.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Linguistic diversity===

As of 2009, [[SIL Ethnologue]] catalogued 6,909 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/ "Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition"]. Retrieved June 28, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55671-159-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact number of known living languages will vary from 5,000 to 10,000, depending generally on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular on how one classifies dialects.

Estimates vary depending on many factors but the general consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages currently spoken, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{Cite book |last=Roell|first=Craig|title=Battle of Coleto|publisher=Handbook of Texas|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qec01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]] spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with fewer than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

==Arts and entertainment==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Entertainment during the 21st century had evolved from the same types of entertainment which emerged around the middle of the 20th century. Sports, films, music, TV series' and books remained popular into the early 21st century but new forms of entertainment including social networking and internet accessed videos became popular. Video games had emerged from a childhood pastime in the late 20th century to an fully grown adult pastime by the beginning of the 21st century. The most popular mediums of entertainment in the first decade at least were televisions, the internet, CDs, DVDs and paper. Digital information begins to complete its succession over analog information and storage techniques.

==Issues and concerns==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
''There are several points-of-view pertaining to the following items, all of which should be considered accordingly.''

Issues that have been frequently discussed and debated so far in this century include:
* '''[[Global warming]].''' Climate scientists have reached a consensus that the earth is undergoing significant [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] (human-induced) [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686|title=The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change|accessdate=October 6, 2014 | doi=10.1126/science.1103618|volume=306|journal=Science|page=1686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting economic and ecological costs are hard to predict. Some scientists argue that human-induced global warming risks considerable [[biodiversity loss|losses in biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem services]] unless considerable sociopolitical changes are introduced, particularly in patterns of mass consumption and transportation. [[File:GlobalPeakOilForecast.jpg|thumb|Global [[Peak Oil]] forecast. Virtually all economic sectors rely heavily on petroleum.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/rising-seas/if-ice-melted-map|title=What the World Would Look Like if All the Ice Melted|date=September 1, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fossil fuel]]s''' are becoming scarce and more expensive, due to the escalating [[demand (economics)|demand]] for [[petroleum]] ("oil") and oil-based products such as [[gasoline]] and [[kerosene]], unmatched by production. Discovery of new [[oil field]]s has not been sufficient to sustain current levels of production, and some fear that the earth may be running out of economically viable oil, pressing for alternatives. As [[Biofuel|Agrofuel]], one possible alternative, yields further hazards for the environment and endangers food security, debate is far from over. [[Electric car]]s such as the [[Nissan Leaf]] have been built to address the problem of [[peak oil]].
* '''[[Globalization]].''' Advances in [[telecommunications]] and [[transportation]], the expansion of [[capitalism]] and [[democratization|democracy]], and [[free trade]] agreements have resulted in unprecedented global economic and cultural integration. This has caused (and is continuing to cause) economic and cultural shifts which have been the subject of considerable controversy.[[File:Dhaka street crowds.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] in 2006. Almost 97% of future population growth will occur in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-08-12/tech/world.population_1_fertility-rates-world-population-data-sheet-population-reference-bureau?_s=PM:TECH World population projected to reach 7 billion in 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402225025/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-08-12/tech/world.population_1_fertility-rates-world-population-data-sheet-population-reference-bureau?_s=PM%3ATECH |date=April 2, 2012 }}". CNN. August 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* '''[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]].''' The [[United Nations]] [http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/24/un.population/ estimates] that [[world population]] will reach 9.2 billion by mid-century. Such growth raises questions of ecological [[sustainability]] and creates many [[economic]] and [[political]] disruptions. In response, many countries have adopted policies which either force or encourage their citizens to have fewer children, and others have limited [[immigration]]. Considerable debate exists over what the ultimate carrying capacity of the planet may be; whether or not population growth containment policies are necessary; to what degree growth can safely occur thanks to increased economic and [[ecological efficiency]]; and how distribution mechanisms should accommodate demographic shifts. Evidence suggests that developed countries (such as Japan) suffer population ''[[Population decline|implosion]],'' and the population debate is strongly tied with discussions about the [[distribution of wealth]].
* '''[[Poverty]].''' Poverty remains the root cause of many of the world's other ills, including [[famine]], [[disease]], and insufficient [[education]]. Poverty contains many self-reinforcing elements (for instance, poverty can make education an unaffordable luxury, which tends to result in continuing poverty) that various aid groups hope to rectify in this century. [[Microcredit]] lending has also started to gain a profile as a useful anti-poverty tool.
* '''[[Disease]].''' [[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[malaria]] each kill over a million people annually. [[HIV]] remains without a cure or vaccine, and is growing rapidly in India and much of the African continent. [[Antibiotic resistance]] is a growing concern for organisms such as [[tuberculosis]]. Other diseases, such as [[SARS]], [[ebola]], and [[flu]] variations, are also causes for concern. The [[World Health Organization]] has [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3524824.stm warned] of a possible coming flu [[pandemic]] resulting from [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] [[mutation]]s. In 2009, there was an outbreak of [[2009 flu pandemic|swine flu]] whose country of origin is still unknown.
* '''[[War]] and [[terrorism]].''' [[Ongoing wars|Active conflicts]] continue around the world, including civil wars in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (the largest war since [[World War II]]), [[Chechnya]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Somalia]], [[Senegal]], [[Colombia]], [[Sudan]] (mainly in [[Darfur]]), [[Libya]], and [[Syria]]. The [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] triggered invasions of [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and partially and controversially [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. The [[War on Terrorism]] has seen controversies over [[civil liberties]], accusations of [[torture]], continued terrorist attacks and ongoing instability, violence, and military occupation. Violence continues in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. Considerable concern remains about [[nuclear proliferation]], especially in [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], and the availability of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to rogue groups.
* '''[[Power in international relations]].''' Issues surrounding the cultural, economic, and military dominance of the United States and its role in the world community have become even more pointed given its recent military activities, problematic relations with the [[United Nations]], disagreement over several international treaties, and its economic policies with regard to globalization. Integration of the [[European Union]] and the [[African Union]] have proceeded.[[File:The_West_vs._Russia.svg|thumb|The world map with [[European Union|EU]]/[[NATO]] countries in blue and [[Russia]] in red.]]
* '''[[Intellectual property]].''' The increasing popularity of digital formats for entertainment media such as movies and music, and the ease of copying and distributing it via the [[Internet]] and [[peer-to-peer]] networks, has raised concerns in the media industry about [[copyright infringement]]. Much debate is proceeding about the proper bounds between protection of [[copyright]], [[trademark]] and [[patent]] rights versus [[fair use]] and the [[public domain]], where some argue that such laws have shifted greatly towards intellectual property owners and away from the interests of the general public in recent years, while others say that such legal change is needed to deal with a perceived threat of new technologies against the rights of authors and artists (or, as others put it, against the outmoded business models of the current entertainment industry). [[Domain name]] "cybersquatting" and access to patented drugs and generics to combat epidemics in third-world countries are other IP concerns.
* '''[[Technology]]''' developments show no sign of slowing. [[Cybernetics|Communications and control]] technology continues to augment the intelligence of individual humans, collections of humans, and machines. Cultures are forced into the position of sharply defining humanity and determining boundaries on desire, thought, communication, behavior, and manufacturing. Some, notably [[Ray Kurzweil]], have predicted that by the middle of the century there will be a [[technological singularity]] if [[artificial intelligence]] that outsmart humans is created. In addition, some [[economists]] have expressed concerns over [[technological unemployment]].[[File:World laws pertaining to homosexual relationships and expression.svg|thumb|Same-sex intercourse illegal: {{legend|#800000|Death penalty for [[homosexuality]]}}]]  
* [[LGBT rights by country or territory|'''LGBT rights''']] are a major political issue in many places, with [[same sex marriage]] being legalized in several jurisdictions during the first two decades of the century, but outlawed by constitutional amendment in other places. Meanwhile, some countries such as [[Uganda]] and [[Russia]] moved to toughen their laws against any sort of [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior or expression. Political battles over pro- or anti-gay legislation provoked much activism in the streets and on the Internet.
* '''[[NATO–Russia relations]]''' seem to remain strained as the "Western Alliance" and NATO square off with Russia and other nations over international policy and the future of the ex-Soviet sphere. An Eastern Europe Missile Defense Shield, military and social conflicts in former Yugoslavia and the Caucasus (particularly Georgia and Chechnya), fossil fuel infrastructures like the [[Nabucco pipeline]] and the future of nuclear arsenals are among the topics that have strained the relations between the two sides with eerie reminders reminiscent of the Cold War.
*'''[[Water crisis]].''' As the human population increases, so has the demand for water. [[Desalination]] has been used more and more to address this issue.
*'''[[War on Drugs]].''' Increasingly, the legal, social and military battle led by governments against drug cartels around the world show little results in ending drug trading and consumption, and a constant increase in the lives taken from this struggle. Notably, after 2006 in the [[Mexican Drug War]], more than 100,000 human lives have been lost to this conflict. Some jurisdictions have enacted some degree of legalization or decriminalization of some kinds of drugs, notably including several U.S. states legalizing [[marijuana]] either for recreational or medical use.
The [[United Nations]] lists global issues on its [https://web.archive.org/web/20050328020647/http://www.un.org/issues/ agenda] and lists a set of [https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ Millennium Development Goals] ([[Millennium Development Goals|MDG]]s) to attempt to address some of these issues.

Since the foreign intervention in [[Mali]], Kidal was retaken by French, Malian, and Chadian troops. On 17 May 2014, Moussa Mara, the Malian prime minister came to visit Kidal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20140521-mali-moussa-mara-kidal-retour-une-visite-mouvementee/|title=Moussa Mara à Kidal: retour sur une visite mouvementée|author=RFI|date=21 May 2014|work=RFI|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[lawyer]] and [[historian]], the Marquess de la Floresta is the Chronicler of Arms for the Autonomous Community of Castille &amp; Leon. He also claims the title of [[Duke]] of [[Ostuni]] ([[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|in the Two Sicilies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/H/per_page.php?id=618273 |title=Alfonso de Ceballos-Escalera y Gila, 3. marqués de la Floresta, * 1957 |website=Geneall.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cf.

He is a retired Lieutenant-Commander (Teniente de Navío OF-2) of the [[Spanish Navy]] and holds the rank of Captain in the [[Merchant Navy|Merchant Marine Fleet]]. He has also been awarded a doctorate in [[law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chivalricorders.org/orders/spanish/chas3.htm |title= www.chivalricorders.org|accessdate=September 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824193610/http://www.chivalricorders.org/orders/spanish/chas3.htm |archivedate=August 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as receiving many other [[orders of knighthood]].

==King of Arms of Spain==
The [[heraldic]] [[office]] of [[Cronista Rey de Armas|Spanish King of Arms]] dates back to the 16th century. Historically [[herald]]s were accorded titles of office after Iberian provinces or major cities, whilst the Reyes de armas represented Spanish kingdoms. Accordingly, chroniclers of arms were variously named for España, Castilla, León, Frechas, Sevilla, Córdoba, Murcia, Granada (created in 1496 to honor the reunification of Spain), Bethune, Estella, Viana, Libertat, Blanc Lévrier, Bonne Foy, Las, Gounzcuant, Lamas, Navarra, Cataluña, Sicilia, Aragón, Nápoles, Toledo (depicting Azure an Imperial Crown Or), Valencia and Mallorca. Such appointments were for life (''ad vitam'') and at least fifteen Spanish families produced more than one [[herald]] over the past five hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heraldry.freeservers.com/heralds.html |title=Spanish Heralds|website=Heraldry.freeservers.com |date=1931-05-16 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role as King of Arms combines that of formally registering pedigrees and the granting of new armorial bearings. In the past the nature of continuous border conflict between the Moorish and Christian kingdoms of medieval Iberia helped to create a sense of ethnic identity, or ''limpieza de sangre'', and heraldry was a significant outlet for expressing national identity; attempts from time to time were made to make arms distinctive of class as well as ethnicity, and the Castilian kings restricted arms to members of the nobility by virtue of Law 64 of the 1583 Cortes de Tudela and was again reiterated by Law 13 of the 1642 Cortes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heraldry.freeservers.com/heralds.html |title=Untitled Normal Page |website=Heraldry.freeservers.com |date=1931-05-16 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cronista Rey de Armas|Cronistas Reyes de Armas]] are, by custom, appointed by the [[Ministry of Justice (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Justice]] on behalf of the Casa real, and have authority to grant [[armorial bearings]] to subjects of the Spanish Crown as well as being tasked with approving the genealogies of claimants to noble titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amateurheralds.org/authorities-rev.html |title=The International Association of Amateur Heralds |website=Amateurheralds.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cronista de armas de Castilla y León, the [[marquess]] continues this tradition being mandated to grant [[coat of arms|arms]] and verify [[genealogy|family pedigrees]].&lt;ref&gt;Decreto 105/1991, 9 May (Boletín Oficial de Castilla y León de 16 May 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Mazar''' ({{lang-he|בנימין מזר}}; born Binyamin Zeev Maisler, June 28, 1906 – September 9, 1995) was a pioneering Israeli historian, recognized as the "dean" of [[biblical archaeologists]].  He shared the national passion for the [[archaeology of Israel]] that also attracts considerable international interest due to the region's [[Bible|biblical]] links. He is known for his excavations at the most significant biblical site in Israel: south and south west of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.  In 1932 he conducted the first archaeological excavation under Jewish auspices in Israel at [[Beit She'arim National Park|Beit She'arim]] (the largest catacombs ever found in Israel) and in 1948 was the first archaeologist to receive a permit granted by the new State of Israel ([[Tell Qasile]], 1948). Mazar was trained as an Assyriologist and was an expert on biblical history, authoring more than 100 publications on the subject. He developed the field of  historical geography of Israel. For decades he served as the chairman of the Israel Exploration Society and of the Archaeological Council of Israel (which he founded as the authority responsible for all archaeological excavations and surveys in Israel).  Between 1951 and 1977, Mazar served as Professor of Biblical History and Archaeology at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1952 he became Rector of the University and later its president for eight years commencing in 1953.

He founded the Hebrew University's new campus at Givat Ram and Hadasah Medical School and Hospital at Ein Karem and led the academic development of the university into one of the leading Universities of the World (see [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]). He was regarded by his students as an inspiring teacher and academic leader and many of these students are now considered leading historians and archaeologists in Israel today.

==Biography==
Mazar was born in [[Ciechanowiec]], [[Poland]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was educated at [[Berlin University|Berlin]] and [[Giessen University|Giessen]] universities in [[Germany]]. At the age of 23, he [[Aliyah|emigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] and in 1943 joined the faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, whose original campus at [[Mount Scopus]] was an enclave in the [[Jordan]]ian sector of Jerusalem following the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].

==Archaeological career==
[[File:TempleStepsMay2009.JPG|thumb|250px|Remnants of the 1st century Stairs of Ascent, discovered by archaeologist Benjamin Mazar, to the entrance of the Temple Courtyard. Pilgrims coming to make sacrifices at the Temple would have entered and exited by this stairway.]]
In 1936 Mazar started the excavations of Beth Shearim, the first archaeological excavation organized by a Jewish institution, and uncovered there the large Jewish catacombs dated to the 2nd-4th centuries CE, known as the burial place of the Jewish leader Rabbi [[Yehudah hanasi|Yehudah Hanasi]], the compiler of the [[Mishnah]]. In 1948 he was the first archaeologist to receive a permit to dig in the new State of Israel, and explored the Philistine town of Tell Qasile in northern Tel Aviv. He later conducted excavations at [[Ein Gedi]] and between 1968 and 1978 directed the excavations south and south-west of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, including an area popularly known as the [[Ophel]], uncovering extensive remains from the Iron Age through the [[Second Temple period]] and to Jerusalem's Islamic Period.

== Tomb of Himyarites ==
[[File:Tomb_Inscription_of_Himyarite_buried_in_Beit_She'arim_National_Park_(Israel).jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Himyarite, in [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Uncial script|uncials]]]]
In 1937, Benjamin Mazar revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of [[Himyar|Ḥimyar]] (now southern [[Yemen]]) dating back to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946,  pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt, of course, by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being buried in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the tombs of the [[Sanhedrin]]. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet ''qyl ḥmyr'' [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called ''Menae presbyteros'' (Menaḥem, the community's elder).&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies, 43 (2013): British Museum, London; Article by Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen in light of the excavation of the Jewish synagogue in Qanī’'', p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of a woman in Greek letters, in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, was also engraved there, meaning either ‘virtue’, ‘blessing’, or ‘gratis’.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 56 – 57; p. 33 plate b. Christian Robin rejects the interpretation of the ligature ''qyl ḥmyr''. He notes that today the inscription ''Menae presbyteros'' can no longer be seen. The only secured inscription is ''Ômêritôn'' [the Ḥimyari].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mazar family ==
Benjamin Mazar's son Ory Mazar, grandchildren [[Eilat Mazar]] and Dan Mazar and nephew [[Amihai Mazar]] all played an important role in the study and dissemination of Israeli archaeology and historical knowledge. [[Eilat Mazar]] has been a frequent spokesperson for concerns regarding the archaeology of the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] while [[Amihai Mazar]] was the recipient of the 2009 [[Israel Prize]] for Archaeology. Benjamin Mazar is the brother-in-law of Israel's second and only three-term President, [[Yitzhak Ben Zvi]].

== Awards ==

The '''Brinton Collection''' is a collection of early [[cinematography]] which was used by William Franklin Brinton (July 12, 1857-Dec. 16, 1919) for his [[traveling show]] in the [[Midwestern United States]].   It was preserved by history teacher, Michael Zahs, in a barn in [[Ainsworth, Iowa]].  The collection includes works by [[Georges Méliès]] which were thought to have been lost: ''[[The Wonderful Rose-Tree]]'' and ''[[The Triple-headed Lady]]''.  The collection's history was recounted in a film documentary, ''[[Saving Brinton]]'' in 2017.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Camillo Almici''' (2 November 1714 – 30 December 1779&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a priest of the [[Congregation of the Oratory]], of distinguished theological attainments.

==Biography==
Almici was born at [[Brescia]], of a noble family.&lt;ref name="ngb"&gt;{{Cite Newgenbio |title=Almici, Camillo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the Congregation of the Oratory at a very early age, and devoted himself to the study of [[theology]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the [[Bible]], [[chronology]], sacred and profane [[history]], [[antiquities]], [[criticism]], [[diplomacy]], and [[liturgy]], and was held in much esteem for his great and wide learning. Amongst his contemporaries, he was regarded as an oracle upon many subjects, and is looked upon as one of the most celebrated theologians of his order.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

He has left critical reflections on the work of [[Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim|Febronius]]'s ''De Statu Ecclesiae'' (1763), together with some treatises, part of which are still in manuscript.&lt;ref name="ngb"/&gt; His ''Méditations sur la vie et les écrits du P. Sarpi'' is a critical examination of [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s partisan history of the [[Council of Trent]].&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

He wrote under multiple pseudonyms, including '''Callimaco Limi''', '''Callimaco Mili''', and '''N. N.'''&lt;ref&gt;Authors named "[http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/NAQ3TI65B6D3V39M7IDLDQRF6DVNHRQ86JSD8IA5XNQYTH8FXX-64155?func=find-b&amp;request=almici&amp;find_code=WNA&amp;adjacent=N&amp;image.x=56&amp;image.y=8 Almici]", Integrated Catalogue, the British Library. URL accessed 2006-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother [[Giambattista Almici]] was a celebrated Italian [[jurist]].&lt;ref name="ngb"/&gt;

==Works==

Of the many works he wrote, the principal are the following:

* ''Riflessioni sù di un libro di G. Febronio'' (1766)
* ''Critica contro le opere del pericoloso Voltaire'' (1770)
* ''Dissertazione spora i Martiri della Chiesa cattolica'' (1765, 2 vols.)

He also discusses Stonehenge, which he believes was also a calendar.

This structure is known by archaeologists as a medicine wheel dated to 3200 BCE (5200 years ago) by careful [[stratification (archeology)|stratification]] of known artifact types.&lt;ref&gt;The Majorville Cairn and Medicine Wheel Site, James M Calder, National Museum of Man Series, Archaeology Survey of Canada No. 62, Ottawa, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/medwheel.htm |title=Medicine Wheel National Historic Landmark |accessdate=2008-01-05 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080125062135/http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/medwheel.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medicine wheels are constructed by laying stones in a particular pattern on the ground oriented to the [[Four Directions|four directions]]. Most medicine wheels follow the basic pattern of having a center of stone, and surrounding that is an outer ring of stones with "spokes" (lines of rocks) radiating from the center to the [[cardinal directions]] (East, South, West and North).medicine wheels are sited throughout the northern [[United States]] and southern [[Canada]], specifically [[South Dakota]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]].

Gordon Freeman challenges their assumption in his book, stating that it is actually a 26 square-kilometer stone calendar that marks the changing seasons better than our modern calendar.  Freeman believed that those rocks and rock piles were "highly engineered," and could not be natural. He spent 28 years photographing the site at different times of year and looking for astronomical alignments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2009/01/29/alberta_sun_temple_has_5000yearold_calendar.html|title = An academic maverick is challenging conventional wisdom on Canada's prehistory by claiming an archeological site in southern Alberta is really a vast, open-air sun temple with a precise 5,000-year-old calendar predating England's Stonehenge and Egypt's pyramids.|last = Weber|first = Bob|date = 2009-01-29|newspaper = The Toronto Star|issn = 0319-0781|access-date = 2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to discover that the 28 rays that radiate from the central cairn correspond exactly to the length of a lunar cycle. This assured Freeman that the rocks are not just randomly distributed but were actually precisely placed there for a reason.&lt;ref name="Canada's Stonehenge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadastonehenge.com/about-the-book/|title=About the Book|year=2013|work=Canada's Stonehenge|accessdate=11 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426085509/http://canadastonehenge.com/about-the-book/|archivedate=26 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been noted, however, that the author engages in "speculation that treads close to fiction", often using conditional phrases "such as ''perhaps, presumably, seems to be'', and ''might have been''".&lt;ref name = "Yellowhorn"/&gt;

Unlike Stonehenge which is megalithic, or constructed of extremely large rocks, the Majorville site is  constructed of small piles of rocks (cairns) which Freeman says are patterned over an extremely large area. He describes it as a complex, spider-web‐like pattern of stones extending over an area of about thirty square kilometres. He views the hilltop centrepiece of the site as a sunburst image made of stones.&lt;ref name="hiddenstonehenge"/&gt;

Freeman believed that those rocks and rock piles were "highly engineered," and could not be natural. He spent 28 years photographing the site at different times of year and looking for astronomical alignments.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Freeman argues that the 28 rays of the medicine wheel show that it is a lunar calendar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[University of Alberta]] archaeologist Jack Ives is cautious about accepting Freeman's ideas. He notes that as the area is an ancient glacial [[moraine]] "[y]ou have to be very careful about what you line up". However, he did agree that the radial lines "may certainly reflect solstices and equinoxes. How much more sophisticated beyond that has been a subject of debate".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2009/01/29/alberta_sun_temple_has_5000yearold_calendar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chen Yuan''' (1880–1971) was a Chinese historian and educator. He is known by his work in the fields of [[religious history]], [[Yuan Dynasty]] history, [[textology]] and textual criticism. Chen was professor of [[Peking University]], [[Beijing Normal University]] and [[Fu Jen Catholic University]], and later served as the president of Beijing Normal University. Before 1949, he also served as the president of [[Metropolitan Library]] and the [[Palace Museum]] library.

From 1917, Chen began to work on history of Christianity in China, and later published his name-earning book ''Research of Arkaguns in Yuan Dynasty'' (《元也里可溫考》). Arkagun is the name given to Christian in [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Subsequently, he published several books about the spreading of [[Manichaeism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Islam]] in China. Chen also paid great attention to collation work on [[Code of Yuan Dynasty]] (《元典章》).&lt;ref&gt;《中国大百科全书》总编委会编. 中国大百科全书 3. 北京市：中国大百科全书出版社, 2009.03. {{ISBN|9787500079583}}. p.434&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Jeanne Theoharis and Komozi Woodard, Gore edited a collection of essays ''Want to Start A Revolution? Radical Women In The Black Freedom Struggle'' (NYU Press, 2009), to which she contributed the chapter "From Communist Politics to Black Power: The Visionary Politics and Transnational Solidarities of [[Vicki Garvin|Victoria Ama Garvin]]".

[[Ernesto Aguilar]] in ''Political Media Review'' summed up the importance of ''Want to Start A Revolution?'' and similar work in forging connections between radical and progressive scholars and activism:

{{quote|Whether it was the [[Black Arts Movement]] or [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] schools, the women profiled in ''Want to Start A Revolution?'' gave life to movements.

A chapter on [[Johnnie Tillmon]] and the welfare rights movement explores this theme of poor Black women's triple exploitation, and [[Esther Cooper Jackson]], the subject of the first chapter, directly addressed this triad in her 1940 thesis, "The Negro Woman Domestic Worker in Relation to Trade Unionism."|}}

It expands the author's project &lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~shs/newsletter/2001/Dayo.html&lt;/ref&gt; to recuperate the voices and histories of radical black women in the US in the early [[Cold War]] era, and their militancy which produced the pre-history of the better-remembered civil rights and feminist/women's movements.

This is a timeline of formal '''declarations of War during [[World War II]]'''.

A [[declaration of war]] is a formal act by which one nation goes to war against another.  The declaration is usually an act of delivering a performative speech (not to be confused with a mere ''speech'') or the presentation of a signed document by an authorized party of a national government in order to create a [[War|state of war]] between two or more sovereign states.  The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|The Hague Peace Conference of 1907]] (or Hague II).&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague03.asp ''On the Opening of Hostilities'']; 1907; [[Yale]] Law School Library; retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the diplomatic maneuvering behind these events, which led to hostilities between nations during World War II, see the article entitled [[Diplomatic history of World War II]].

==List of war declarations==
Below is a table showing the outbreak of wars between nations which occurred during World War II.  Indicated are the dates (during the immediate build-up to, or during the course of, [[World War II]]), from which a ''[[de facto]]'' [[War|state of war]] existed between nations.  The table shows both the "Initiator Nation(s)" and the nation at which the aggression was aimed, or "Targeted Nation(s)".  Events listed include those in which there were simple diplomatic breaking of relations that did not involve any physical attack, as well as those involving overt declarations or acts of aggression. In rare cases, war between two nations occurred twice, with an intermittent period of peace. The list here does not include peace treaties or periods of any armistice


Table Legend: Concerning Declaration of War:  '''A''' = Attack without prior, formal declaration of war; '''U''' = State of war arrived at through use of ultimatum; &lt;br&gt;'''W''' = Formal declaration of war made.

The '''Dhofar Rebellion''' ({{lang-ar|ثورة ظفار}}), also known as the '''War in Dhofar''' ({{lang-ar|الحرب في ظفار }}) or the '''Omani Civil War''' ({{lang-ar|الحرب الأهلية العمانية}}), was waged from 1962 to 1976 in the province of [[Dhofar]] against the [[Sultanate of Muscat and Oman]], which had British support. It ended with the defeat of the rebels.

==Background==
In 1962, [[Oman]] was a very underdeveloped country. Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]], an absolute ruler under British control,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/britains-secret-wars-oman|title=Britain's secret wars - Ian Cobain|first=Ian|last=Cobain|date=8 September 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; had outlawed almost all technological development and relied on British support to maintain the rudimentary functions of the state. [[Dhofar]] itself was a dependency of Oman but was culturally and linguistically distinct from Oman proper.

The province of Dhofar consists of an intermittent narrow, fertile coastal plain, on which stand [[Salalah]], the provincial capital, and other towns such as [[Mughsayl]], [[Taqah]] and [[Mirbat]]. Behind this are the rugged hills of the [[Jebel Dhofar]]. The western portion of this range is known as the [[Jebel Qamar]], the central part as the [[Jebel Qara]] and the eastern part as the [[Jebel Samhan]]. From June to September each year, the jebel receives moisture-laden winds (the [[Khareef]] or monsoon) and is shrouded in cloud. As a result, it is heavily vegetated, and for much of the year is green and lush. The inhabitants of the villages and communities on the jebel are known as ''jibalis'' (Mountain people). To the north, the hills slope down via rough [[wadi]]s and cliffs into the gravel plains and sand seas of the [[Rub' al Khali|Empty Quarter]].

==History==

===Early years of the rebellion===
{{see also|Jebel Akhdar War}}
In 1962 a dissatisfied tribal leader, [[Musallam bin Nufl]] (Mussalim bin Nafl), formed the [[Dhofar Liberation Front]] (DLF) and obtained arms and vehicles from [[Saudi Arabia]]. Saudi Arabia and Oman had earlier clashed over ownership of the [[Buraimi|Buraimi Oasis]], and the Saudis had already supported two failed insurrections in the [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]] in the interior of Oman in 1957–59. The DLF also received support from [[Imam Ghalib Bin Ali]], the exiled Imam of Oman, who had led these earlier revolts.

Bin Nufl and his men made an epic crossing of the [[Rub' al Khali|Empty Quarter]] to reach Dhofar. As early as December 1962, Bin Nufl's guerrilla band performed sabotage operations on the British air base at Salalah and ambushed oil industry vehicles; however, they then withdrew, having been sent by Saudi Arabia to [[Iraq]] for more guerrilla training.

From 1964 the DLF began a campaign of hit-and-run attacks on oil company installations and government posts. Many of the DLF were trained former soldiers of the [[Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces]] (SAF), or of the [[Trucial Oman Scouts]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

The Sultan had relied on the "Dhofar Force", a locally recruited irregular unit of only 60 men, to maintain order in the region. In April 1966, members of this unit attempted to assassinate the Sultan. This event apparently changed the nature of the conflict. The Sultan retired to his palace in Salalah, never to be seen in public again. This only served to add to rumours that the British were running Oman through a "phantom" Sultan. The Sultan also launched a full-scale military offensive against the DLF, contrary to the advice of his British advisors. Heavy-handed [[search and destroy]] missions were launched in Dhofar, villages were burned and wells were concreted over or blown up. A member of the SAF reported that after receiving heavy resistance, it "proved that the position was unattainable, and after blowing up the village wells we evacuated the camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hepworth|first=Captain N.G.R|title=The Unknown War|publisher=The White Horse and Fleur de Lys|volume=6|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===An emboldened movement===
From the early days of the rebellion, [[Nasserism|Nasserite]] and other [[left wing]] movements in the neighbouring [[Aden Protectorate]], later the [[Protectorate of South Arabia]], were also involved. In 1967, two events combined to give the Rebellion a more revolutionary complexion. One was the [[Six-Day War]] which radicalised opinion throughout the [[Arab world]]. The other was the British [[Aden Emergency|withdrawal from Aden]] and the establishment of the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (PDRY). From this point, the rebels had a source of arms, supplies and training facilities adjacent to Dhofar, and fresh recruits from groups in the PDRY. Training camps, logistical bases and other facilities were set up in the coastal town of [[Hawf District|Hawf]], only a few miles from the border with Oman.

In May 1968, an attack by a battalion of the Sultan's Armed Forces against a rebel position at [[Deefa]] in the Jebel Qamar was defeated by heavily armed and well-organised and trained rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Fiennes, pp. 116–120&lt;/ref&gt;

At a "Second Congress" of the insurgent movement in September 1968, most of the official posts within the movement passed into the hands of radicals, and the movement renamed itself the '''[[Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf]]''' (''al-Jabha al-Sha'abiya li-Tahrir al-Khalij al-'Arabi al-Muhtall''), or PFLOAG. The move towards [[Marxism–Leninism]] ensured that the PFLOAG received sponsorship from both [[South Yemen]] and China. China in particular was quick to support the PFLOAG as it was a [[peasant]]-based organisation, giving it a strong [[Maoism|Maoist]] credibility. Chinese support for the PFLOAG also had another benefit for them, as it acted as a counterbalance to increasing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in the [[Indian Ocean]]. China was quick to establish an embassy in Aden and "the Yemeni regime allowed its territory to be used for channelling weapons" to the PFLOAG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calabrese|first=J.|title=From Flyswatters to Silkworms: The Evolution of China's Role in West Asia|series=Asian Survey|volume=30|year=1990|page=867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Chinese and Soviets also provided members of the PFLOAG with indoctrination and training in [[unconventional warfare]].

The transformation of the DLF, combined with a new supply of Chinese and Soviet&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; weaponry and better training, ensured that the armed wing of the PFLOAG turned into an effective fighting force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beasant|first=J.|title=Oman: The True-Life Drama and Intrigue of an Arab State|location=Edinburgh|year=2002|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also led to a split between those such as bin Nufl who were fighting mainly for local autonomy and recognition, and the more doctrinaire revolutionaries (led by Mohammad Ahmad al-Ghassani). One of bin Nufl's lieutenants, Said bin Gheer, was an early and influential defector to the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Fiennes, pp. 127–129, 153–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by 1969 the DLF and PFLOAG fighters (known widely as ''Adoo'', Arabic for 'enemy') had overrun much of the Jebel Dhofar, and cut the only road across it—that from Salalah to "Midway" ([[Thumrait]]) in the deserts to the north. They were well-armed with such weapons as the [[AK-47]] [[assault rifle]]. They also used heavy machine guns (the [[DShK]]),&lt;ref&gt;Fiennes, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; mortars up to 82mm in calibre and 140mm [[BM-14]] or 122mm "Katyusha" rockets. By 1970 communists controlled the entire Jebel. Terror was then used to break up the traditional tribal structure. Five elderly sheikhs were pushed over a 450 feet high cliff. Other sheikhs were machine gunned with their sons. Children were forcibly removed from their families and sent to train in Yemen. Young men were sent to train for guerilla warfare in China and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oman. Dhofar 1972 (8626836339).jpg|left|thumb|A "hedgehog" defensive sangar, made from oil drums filled with sand, protecting Salalah airfield]]
The units of the Sultan's Armed Forces were under strength with only 1,000 men in Dhofar in 1968. They were also badly equipped, mainly with [[World War II]] vintage weapons such as [[bolt action|bolt-action]] rifles, which were inferior to the PFLOAG's modern firearms. These rifles were replaced by the [[FN FAL]] only late in 1969. Even the SAF's clothing and boots were ragged and unsuitable for the terrain. The units of the SAF were generally not properly trained to face hardy guerrillas on their own ground, and no Omani held a rank above that of Lieutenant (a result of the Sultan's fears of opposition to his rule among the armed forces). The SAF generally were unable to operate in less than company strength on the jebel, and were mainly restricted to Salalah and its immediate area. At various times, small detachments from Nos. 2 (Para), 15 (Field) and 51 (Field) squadrons of the British [[RAF Regiment]], and other units (a [[Royal Artillery]] locating troop, a [[BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun|5.5-inch]] medium battery of the Royal Jordanian Artillery, and a [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25-pounder]] battery of the Sultan's artillery)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Through Adversity|last=Oliver|first=Kingsley M|publisher=Forces &amp; Corporate|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; had to be deployed to protect the vital airfield at Salalah from infiltrators and from harassing mortar and rocket fire.

Other insurgents in the northern section of Oman formed a separate resistance movement, the '''[[National Democratic Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arabian Gulf]]''' (NDFLOAG). In June 1970 they attacked two SAF posts at [[Nizwa]] and [[Izki]]. They were repulsed but the incident convinced many (including the Sultan's British advisers and backers) that new leadership was required.

===Coup===
In the [[1970 Omani coup d'état]] on 23 July 1970, Said bin Taimur was deposed and went into exile in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 23–27, 32–37&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by his son, [[Qaboos of Oman|Qaboos bin Said]], who immediately instigated major social, educational and military reforms. Qaboos was well educated, first in Salalah by an old Arab scholar and then at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], after which he was commissioned into the [[Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)|Cameronians]], a regiment of the British Army. He then completed his education sitting in on councils, attending committee meetings and visiting industry and administrative centres in Britain before returning to Oman.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; His "five point plan" involved:
* A general amnesty to all those of his subjects who had opposed his father;
* An end to the archaic status of Dhofar as the Sultan's private fief and its formal incorporation into Oman as the "southern province";
* Effective military opposition to rebels who did not accept the offer of amnesty;
* A vigorous nationwide programme of development;
* Diplomatic initiatives with the aims of having Oman recognised as a genuine Arab state with its own legal form of government, and isolating the PDRY from receiving support from other Arab states.

Within hours of the coup, British [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) soldiers were flown into Oman to further bolster the counterinsurgency campaign. They identified four main strategies that would assist the fight against the PFLOAG:
* Civil administration and a [[Hearts and minds (concept)|hearts and minds]] campaign;
* Intelligence gathering and collation;
* Veterinary assistance;
* Medical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;TNA, DEFE 25/186: UK Forces in Oman, 26 July 1971{{clarify|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military commanders on the ground (rather than the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]]) suggested the implementation of a "hearts and minds" campaign, which would be put into operation primarily by a troop (25 men) from the SAS. The British government (then under [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[Edward Heath]]) supported this unconventional approach to the counterinsurgency campaign. It approved the deployment of 20 personnel of the British [[Royal Engineers]], who would aid in the construction of schools and health centres, and drilled wells for the population of Dhofar.&lt;ref&gt;Walter C. Ladwig III, "Supporting Allies in Counterinsurgency: Britain and the Dhofar Rebellion", ''Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies'', Vol. 19, No. 1 (March 2008), [http://www.walterladwig.com/Articles/Supporting%20Allies%20in%20COIN_wcl2.pdf p. 72].&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Army Medical Corps Field Surgical Teams and some  Royal Air Force medical teams would also operate out of Salalah hospital, in order to open a humanitarian front in the conflict. The operation was almost a carbon copy of a system that had proved successful in the [[Malayan Emergency]] some twenty years previously. The British government additionally provided monetary support for the creation of the Dhofar Development Programme, whose aim was to wrest support from the PFLOAG through the modernisation of Dhofar.

To assist in the civil development and coordinate it with the military operations, the command structure in Dhofar was reorganised, with the newly appointed [[Wāli]] or civilian governor (Braik bin Hamoud) being given equal status to the military commander of the Dhofar Brigade (Brigadier Jack Fletcher to 1972, Brigadier [[John Akehurst (British Army officer)|John Akehurst]] from that date).

[[File:Hand of God.jpg|thumb|right|Caption on British poster: "''The Hand of God Destroys Communism''"]]
A major effort was made to counter rebel propaganda and induce the Dhofari population to support the government. In particular, appeals were made to Islam and to traditional tribal values and customs, against the rebels' secular or materialistic teachings. A significant outlet for government propaganda was the many inexpensive Japanese transistor radios which were sold cheaply or distributed free to [[jibalis]] who visited Salalah and other government-held towns to sell firewood or vegetables. Although the PFLOAG could also broadcast propaganda by radio, the Government's propaganda was factual and low-key, while that of the rebels, broadcast by [[Radio Aden]], was soon perceived to be exaggerated and stereotyped.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government counter-attacks===
One step which had a major impact on the uprising was the announcement of an amnesty for surrendered fighters, and aid in defending their communities from rebels. A cash incentive was offered to rebels who changed sides, with a bonus if they brought their weapon. Following the split between the PFLOAG and DLF wings of the rebel movement, several prominent rebel leaders changed sides, including bin Nufl himself and his deputy, Salim Mubarak, who had commanded the eastern region.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, pp.30, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels who defected to the Sultan formed ''[[Firqa (military)|Firqat]]'' irregular units, trained by British Army Training Teams, or BATTs, from the Special Air Service. Salim Mubarak played a major role in establishing the first ''Firqat'' (and the only one to be formed from members of more than one tribe), but died, apparently of heart failure, shortly after its first successful actions.&lt;ref&gt; Jeapes, pp.88-89&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen ''Firqat'' units, numbering between 50 and 150 men each, were eventually formed.&lt;ref&gt;Walter C. Ladwig III, "Supporting Allies in Counterinsurgency: Britain and the Dhofar Rebellion", ''Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies'', Vol. 19, No. 1 (March 2008), [http://www.walterladwig.com/Articles/Supporting%20Allies%20in%20COIN_wcl2.pdf p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt; They usually gave themselves names with connections to Islam, such as the ''Firqat [[Saladin|Salahadin]]'' or ''Firqat [[Khalid ibn al-Walid|Khalid bin Walid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; (Some of the PFLOAG units also gave themselves ideological names such as [[Ho Chi Minh]] or [[Che Guevara]].)&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; These ''firqat'' irregular groups played a major part in denying local support to the rebels. Being ''jibalis'' themselves (and in many cases with family connections among the communities on the Jebel), they were better at local intelligence-gathering and "hearts and minds" activities than the northern Omani or [[Baloch people|Baluchi]] personnel of the regular SAF,&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; although they exasperated commanders of the regular SAF by refusing to take part in operations outside their tribal areas, or during [[Ramadan]].

The first serious step in re-establishing the Sultan's authority on the Jebel took place in October 1971, when [[Operation Jaguar (Oman)|Operation Jaguar]] was mounted, involving five ''Firqat'' units and two squadrons of the SAS. After hard fighting, the SAS and ''Firqats'' secured an enclave on the eastern Jebel Samhan from which they could expand.&lt;ref&gt;Allen &amp; Rigsbee, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; The SAS introduced two new weapons to support the mobile but lightly equipped ''firqats'': the rapid firing [[FN MAG|GPMG]], which could lay down a heavier weight of fire than the [[Bren light machine gun]] previously available to the SAF,&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Browning M2]] heavy machine gun, which was deployed to match the [[DShK]] machine guns used by the ''adoo''.

Meanwhile, the regular units of the SAF were expanded and re-equipped. Extra officers and NCO instructors from the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Marines]] (and also the [[Pakistan Army]])&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; were attached to all units (there were nominally twenty-two British or contracted personnel with each infantry battalion) while Omani personnel were educated and trained to become officers and senior [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]]. British specialist elements, including mortar locating radar troops and artillery observation officers, also rotated through Oman over several years.

The revitalised SAF created fortified lines running north from the coast and up to the summit of the Jebel, to interdict the movement of rebels and the camel trains carrying their supplies from the PDRY. The "Leopard Line" was established in 1971, but this line had to be abandoned during the following monsoon season as it could not be supplied.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, pp.140-141, 164&lt;/ref&gt; The more effective "Hornbeam Line" was set up in 1972, running north from Mughsayl on the coast. The lines consisted of fortified platoon and company outposts on commanding peaks, linked by barbed wire. The posts possessed mortars and some also had artillery, to provide cover for patrols and to harass rebel positions and tracks used by them. The SAF soldiers continually sortied from their outposts to set ambushes on the most likely enemy infiltration routes and mount attacks against rebel mortar- and rocket-launching positions. Anti-personnel land mines were sown on infiltration routes. The rebels also used anti-personnel mines against suspected SAF patrol bases, and even laid anti-tank land mines on tracks used by SAF vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;The SAF supposedly marked and recorded all mines laid; but some were moved by the ''adoo'' or by animals, and the records of mine locations were subsequently lost. Gardiner, pp. 124–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Air Force of Oman|Sultan of Oman's Air Force]] was also expanded, acquiring [[BAC Strikemaster]] aircraft which provided air support to units on the ground, and eight [[Shorts Skyvan]] transport aircraft and eight [[UH-1 Iroquois|Agusta Bell 205]] transport helicopters which supplied ''firqat'' and SAF posts on the jebels. A flight of RAF [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters also operated from Salalah.

On 17 April 1972, a battalion of the SAF made a helicopter landing to capture a position codenamed ''Simba'' at [[Sarfait]] near the border with the PDRY. The captured position overlooked the rebels' supply lines along the coastal plain, but did not block them. Although the demands on its transport aircraft and helicopters to maintain the post at Sarfait forced the SAF to abandon some positions in the eastern Jebel, Sarfait was nevertheless retained for four years.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 157–160, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat of the rebellion===
[[File:Dhofar-BATT house (2).jpg|thumb|left|British Base at Mirbat which was a site of the hard-fought [[Battle of Mirbat]]]]

Immediately after China established relations with Iran, all support to the rebels in Dhofar was cut off by China which had changed its mind about insurgencies, since it viewed them as counterproductive to countering the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CPMoRVo3fSwC&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Garver 2006], p. 49.&lt;br/&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq77jvNypkcC&amp;pg=PA338#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Robinson 1995], p. 338.&lt;br/&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xvuuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA336#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Garver 2015], p.336.&lt;br/&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U2jADzIM2hEC&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sutter 2013], p. 270.&lt;br/&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J6nrPFbQfygC&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sutter 2011], p. 85.&lt;br/&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N0arBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jones &amp; Ridout 2012], p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the various measures undertaken by the Omani government, ''firqats'' and regular SAF, the rebels were being deprived both of local support and supplies from the PDRY. To retrieve the situation, they mounted a major attack on the coastal town of Mirbat during the monsoon season of 1972. On 19 July 1972, at the [[Battle of Mirbat]], 250 ''adoo'' attacked 100 assorted ''Firqat'' under training, paramilitary ''askars'' (armed police) and a detachment of the Special Air Service. In spite of the low ''khareef'' cloud cover, air support from Strikemaster aircraft was available, and helicopters landed SAS reinforcements. The ''adoo'' were repulsed with heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 257–364&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point on, the rebel defeat was inevitable. In January 1974, after several splits and defections, the rebel movement renamed itself the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman]]. This public contraction of their aims coincided with a reduction in the support they received from the Soviet Union and China. Meanwhile, the ''adoo'' were steadily cleared from the Jebel Qara and Jebel Samhan by ''firqats'' and were driven into the western part of the Jebel Qamar.

As a result of Sultan Qaboos's diplomatic initiatives, the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] had sent an [[Iranian Army]] brigade numbering 1,200 and with its own helicopters to assist the Sultan's Armed Forces in 1973. The Iranian brigade first secured the Salalah-Thumrait road, while their helicopters played a vital role in keeping the isolated ''Simba'' position supplied. In 1974, the Iranian contribution was expanded into the Imperial Iranian Task Force, numbering 4,000. They attempted to establish another interdiction line, codenamed the "Damavand Line", running from ''Manston'', a few miles east of Sarfait, to the coast near the border with the PDRY. Heavy opposition from the ''adoo'', which included artillery fire from within the PDRY, thwarted this aim for several months. Eventually, the town of Rahkyut, which the PFLO had long maintained as the capital of their liberated territory, fell to the Iranian task force.&lt;ref&gt;Allen &amp; Rigsbee, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the ''adoo'' kept the respect of their opponents for their resilience and skill. In January 1975, the SAF attempted to capture the main ''adoo'' logistic base in the Shershitti Caves. A SAF company from a battalion which took a wrong route blundered into an ambush in an ''adoo'' "killing ground" above the caves and suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, pp.198-206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oman. Dhofar 1972 (8626144207).jpg|right|thumb|The view from Akoot, in the Jebel Qara, at the start of the ''khareef'' (monsoon) season]]
During the next few months, the SAF seized an airsrtrip at Deefa, but were unable to make immediate use of it during the ''khareef''. Some regular troops from the PDRY reinforced the ''adoo'',&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; who also deployed [[9K32 Strela-2|SAM-7]] anti-aircraft missiles for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, p.227&lt;/ref&gt; However, their premature use of this weapon deprived them of the advantage of surprise. Also, the Sultan's Air Force had acquired 31 [[Hawker Hunter]] aircraft from the [[Royal Jordanian Air Force]]. The SAM-7 was much less effective against these aircraft than against Strikemasters.

In October 1975, the SAF launched a final offensive. An attack from ''Simba'', intended to be a diversion, nevertheless succeeded in descending cliffs and slopes {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in total height to reach the coast at Dalqhut, and thus finally cut off the ''adoo'' from their bases in the PDRY.&lt;ref&gt;Jeapes, pp.228-229&lt;/ref&gt; While the Iranian Task Force threatened the Shershitti Caves from the south, another SAF battalion advanced from Deefa, threatening to surround the remaining ''adoo'' territory in the Jebel Qamar. Hawker Hunter aircraft of the Sultan's Air Force attacked artillery positions in the PDRY. Over the next few months, the remaining rebel fighters surrendered or sought sanctuary in the PDRY. The Rebellion was finally declared to be Jebel  defeated in January 1976, although isolated incidents took place as late as 1979.

==Foreign involvement==

===Baluchis===
The port city of [[Gwadar]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]] had been Omani territory until 1958. Baluch troops formed a substantial part of the Sultan's Army.&lt;ref&gt;Walter C. Ladwig III, "Supporting Allies in Counterinsurgency: Britain and the Dhofar Rebellion," ''Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies'', Vol. 19, No. 1 (March 2008), [http://www.walterladwig.com/Articles/Supporting%20Allies%20in%20COIN_wcl2.pdf p. 68].&lt;/ref&gt; During the rebellion, Oman sought to hire more Baluchi troops. [[Baloch Students Organization|Baluch Students Organization]] (BSO), a leftist students' organization, expressed solidarity with the Dhofari rebels. In 1979 BSO activist [[Hameed Baloch]] tried to shoot at an Omani military officer who was visiting Balochistan to recruit more Baluchi troops. The Omani officer was unhurt, and Baloch was convicted by a Pakistani military court and [[execution|executed]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2149">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Dindymon'''&lt;ref&gt;Rarely '''Dindymus''', as in [[Pliny's Natural History]] V.142 and [[Sextus Propertius]], III.22.3.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|n|d|ə|ˌ|m|ɒ|n}} ({{lang-grc|Δίνδυμον}}), was a mountain in eastern [[Phrygia]] (today's [[Murat Dağı]] of [[Gediz, Kütahya|Gediz]]), later part of [[Galatia]], that was later called [[Agdistis]], sacred to the "mountain mother", [[Cybele]], whom the Hellenes knew as [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. [[Strabo]] sited Dindymon above [[Pessinos]], sacred to Cybele.

A Mount Dindymon might also be placed on the peninsula of [[Cyzicus]] facing the [[Sea of Marmara]], as in [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'', or by [[Stephanus Byzantinicus]] further south, in the [[Troad]], thus near [[Mount Ida]]. ''[[Argonautica]]'' book I sets a scene at Mount Dindymon, where [[Jason]] placates the goddess of the mountain, "the mother of all the blessed gods, where she sits enthroned".&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius of Rhodes (Peter Green, tr.), ''Argonautika'', expanded ed. 2007, book I.1093-94.&lt;/ref&gt; identified as "Dindymene [Δινδυμηνή] the mother, Lady of many names,"&lt;ref&gt;''Argonautika''  I.1125&lt;/ref&gt; among which was [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]].&lt;ref&gt;(Apollonius of Rhodes), Richard Hunter, tr., 1993. ''Jason and the Golden Fleece'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press), Book I, p. 29f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various applications of Dindymon, as the mountain of the Anatolian [[Mother Goddess]], the "Mountain Mother", is explained by Robinson Ellis:&lt;ref&gt;Robinson Ellis, 1876. ''A Commentary on Catullus'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press), Catullus LXIII.91 (p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt; "The name Dindymenian mother would in the first instance no doubt be connected with the earliest seat of the worship, the Phrygian Dindymon, but as soon as the worship spread farther and the name of Dindymon with it, the Goddess of Dindymon would lose its original definiteness and be variously applied by different writers."

'''Giorgio Colli''' (1917 – 6 January 1979) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[philosopher]], [[philologist]] and [[historian]]. A native of [[Turin]], he taught [[ancient philosophy]] at [[Pisa]]'s university for thirty years; he edited and translated [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'' and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' for Einaudi, a major publishing house in Italy. Subsequently, he produced the first complete edition of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s work (including all the posthumous fragments chronologically ordered) together with his friend [[Mazzino Montinari]]. His work culminated in ''La Sapienza greca'', an edition and translation of the "[[Presocratics]]" (a term he rejected). Interrupted by his death in January 1979, it was supposed to be in eleven volumes.

'''Hans Delbrück''' (11 November 1848 – 14 July 1929) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]]. Delbrück was one of the first modern military historians, basing his method of research on the critical examination of ancient sources, and using auxiliary disciplines, like [[demography]] and [[economics]], to complete the analysis and the comparison between different epochs to trace the evolution of military institutions.

Delbrück's writings are chiefly concerned with the history of the art of [[war]], his most ambitious work being his ''Geschichte der Kriegskunst im Rahmen der politischen Geschichte'' (History of warfare in the framework of political history, four volumes, third edition published in 1920). Other works are ''Die Perserkriege und die Burgunderkriege'' (The Persian and Burgundian Wars, 1887), ''Die Strategie des Perikles erläutert durch die Strategie Friedrichs des Grossen'' (The strategy of [[Pericles]] described through the strategy of [[Frederick the Great]], 1890) and ''Das Leben des Feldmarschalls Grafen Neithardt von Gneisenau'' (Life of Marshal Count [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Neithardt von Gneisenau]], 1894).

== Biography ==

Delbrück was born in [[Bergen auf Rügen|Bergen]] on the island of [[Rügen]], and studied at the universities of [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]. As a soldier, he fought in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], after which, in 1874, he became for some years tutor to [[Prince Waldemar of Prussia (1868–1879)]] of the German imperial family, a brother of the future emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]].&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Delbrück, Hans|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the Reichstag from 1882 to 1883,&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Delbrück, Hans|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; and afterward, in 1883, he became an editor of the ''Preussische Jahrbücher'', a noted political magazine. He assumed charge of this publication in 1889,&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt; and kept working on it in that capacity until 1920.&lt;ref name=eb1922&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Delbrück, Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, he became professor of modern history in the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], where his lectures were highly popular.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; He was a member of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|German Reichstag]] from 1884 to 1890.&lt;ref name=eb1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Delbrück, Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delbrück vigorously opposed the policy of the Prussian government in dealing with the Danes and the Poles, with the result that he was twice subjected to disciplinary penalties as a professor and therefore, in Prussia, a civil servant.  But it was his main role as editor of ''Preussen Jahrbücher'' that provided a platform for a growing interest in Germany's diplomatic relationship with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;  This took the form of a roving commission to Herr [[Paul Rohrbacher]] to enquire about German opinion.  The findings from the 1890s tours formed a racial policy of dismemberment of Russia by seizing Slavic territory that belonged to them.  The controversialist Fritz Fischer argued that they were socialists forcing extremists into the hands of revolutionaries. At an early stage of [[World War I]], he became pessimistic regarding the possibility of any real success for Germany except by military and political strategy and tactics of a purely defensive character. He was, on tactical rather than on moral grounds, a strenuous opponent of intensified submarine warfare, and did not conceal his conviction that the result of this method of warfare would ultimately be the intervention of America. He was a member of the German Delegation during the [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] Peace Conference that ended [[World War I]] where he mainly endeavoured to prove that Germany could not be made solely responsible for the outbreak of war.&lt;ref name="eb1922"/&gt; He died in [[Berlin]].

He was the father of [[Max Delbrück]], who did pioneering work in physics and also won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1969.

Delbrück's works tried to place military history in the framework of general history. He regarded warfare as a cultural feature of societies, subject to evolution and influenced by the economy and the political system. His works, however, were not translated into English for some time, hence his reputation among professional military theorists in English-speaking countries is not held in the same esteem or significance as [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]].

=== Ancient warfare ===

Singular conclusions on [[ancient warfare]] challenged [[historiography]] in so far as he tried to show that the figures for armies in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] were inflated in the original sources, and that, contrary to what is stated in most writings, the winner in a battle usually had more troops than the loser.  Consequently, he gave completely different interpretations to some of the most famous battles in history, like [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], and [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] by concluding that Rome's vaunted advantage over "[[barbarian]]s" rested, not so much in their discipline and refined tactics, but rather in their superior logistical support.&lt;ref name="Welch2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kathryn |last=Welch|title=Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter: The War Commentaries as Political Instruments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1v1ODgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187|date=31 December 2009|publisher=Classical Press of Wales|isbn=978-1-910589-36-6|page=187 |quote=His [Delbrück's] analysis of the Gallic campaigns of Caesar effectively brought out the logistic problems facing both sides. His thesis was that Caesar, because of Rome's civilisation and long sophistication in the art of war, was able to gain a numerical superiority in virtually every battle, which inevitably enabled him to overcome the raw courage of militarily naive and unsophisticated natives.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans were able to raise and maintain huge armies on the field, while the "barbarians" were unable to match their numbers.  The theory aimed to criticize Germany's political class and practice of warfare which were under the heavy sway of nationalistic ideas at the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Medieval warfare ===

Regarding medieval warfare, Delbrück's findings were more controversial.{{according to whom|date=February 2013}} He made a distinction between knights (mounted warriors) and [[cavalry]] (an organized mass of mounted troops), and regarded the medieval warrior as an independent fighter, unable to join others and form units with any decisive tactical significance.  Their conclusions were tested by later scholars, in particular the Belgian historian [[J. F. Verbruggen]].

=== Modern warfare ===

When moving into modern warfare, Delbrück showed his intellectual origins in [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] making a distinction between two possible strategies respectively: 'exhausting' the enemy and 'throwing down' the enemy (in German, ''Ermattungsstrategie'' and ''Niederwerfungsstrategie''; often mistakenly translated as 'attrition' and 'annihilation').  These were derived from Clausewitz's distinctions between strategies seeking limited objectives and strategies aimed at rendering one's opponent militarily helpless, the latter often confused with the concept of "Total War" advocated by Ludendorff and rejected by Delbrück during wartime.  The choice depended on the nature of the political objectives and existing political and economic limitations, as well as on the correlation of force numbers.  He applied this analytical tool to the wars of [[Frederick the Great]], concluding that, due to their numerical inferiority, the Prussians had pursued a strategy of exhaustion.  His overall treatment of the era was, however, disappointing,{{according to whom|date=February 2013}} in partially overlooking the Spanish wars.  Very critical of his country's strategic thinking he averred it would have been preferable to seek victory in the Eastern front, gain minor objectives on the West and then sue for peace.  This was one example of the general principle maintained, that military and political manoeuvres should be integrated.

== In fiction ==

{{original research|section|date=May 2012}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
In [[Mel Brooks]]'s comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', Doctor Frankenstein sends his assistant, Igor, to retrieve the brain of Hans Delbrück for transplant into Frankenstein's monster. The tag on the beaker containing the brain reads "scientist and saint," so it is debatable whether Brooks intended the actual historian or a fictional Delbrück.

In a clearer reference to the historical figure, in Mel Brooks's comedy ''The Producers: The Movie Musical'', Hans Delbrück is the name of the man to whom Franz Liebkind sends a letter by carrier pigeon.

In [[Victor Serge]]’s novel ''Unforgiving Years (Les Années sans pardon)'' the character Herr Schiff—an old German professor loyal to the Nazi regime, demoralized and disoriented in war-ravaged Berlin in the closing days of the Second World War—rereads Hans Delbrück’s ''The History of Warfare'': "Lately, it was true, the sense of most of what he read escaped him; but being incapable of inattention, the mechanical act of reading acted upon him like a sedative.  His cheek cupped in his hand, he reread the works he admired out of duty."  Hans Delbrück appears in the professor’s thoughts again while contemplating the meaning of the war as American soldiers overtake Berlin: "The Second World War was already down as a great historical tragedy—a quasi-mythological one—which neither Mommsen, Hans Delbrück, Gobineau, Houston Stewart Chamberlin, Oswald Spengler, or ''Mein Kampf'' could elucidate entirely…."

A succinct statement of Delbrück's views on Germany's responsibility for World War I and an English reply can be found in articles by Delbrück and J. W. Headlam-Morley in the ''Contemporary Review'' (March 1921).&lt;ref name=eb1922/&gt;

[[Encyclopedia]]s have progressed from the beginning of history in written form, through medieval and modern times in print, and most recently, displayed on computer and distributed via computer networks.

K&lt;
* Bulleted list item
&lt;/ref&gt;==Ancient times==
Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years.

===Marcus Terentius Varro===
[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|k|ə|s|_|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|ʃ|ə|s|_|ˈ|v|æ|r|oʊ}}; 116 BC – 27 BC) was an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] scholar and writer.

His ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' became a model for later [[encyclopedists]], especially [[Pliny the Elder]].  The most noteworthy portion of the ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' is its use of the [[liberal arts]] as organizing principles.&lt;ref name=Lindberg&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beginnings of Western Science |last=Lindberg |first=David |year=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-48205-7 |page=137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Varro decided to focus on identifying nine of these arts: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astronomy]], [[musical theory]], [[medicine]], and [[architecture]].  Using Varro's list, subsequent writers defined the seven classical "liberal arts of the medieval schools".&lt;ref name=Lindberg/&gt;

===Pliny the Elder===
[[Image:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiæ'', 1669 edition, title page]]
The earliest encyclopedic work to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the [[1st century AD]]. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering [[natural history]], architecture, medicine, [[geography]], geology, and all aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77-79, although he probably never finished proofing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.&lt;ref name=naturalis&gt;Naturalis Historia&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, many barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one Greek who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also elaborates on the difficulties of writing such a work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a difficult task to give novelty to what is old, authority to what is new, brilliance to the common-place, light to the obscure, attraction to the stale, credibility to the doubtful, but nature to all things and all her properties to nature.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This work became very popular in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], and survived, with many copies being made and distributed in the western world. It was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed in 1470, and has remained popular ever since as a source of information on the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world, and especially [[Roman art]], [[Roman technology]] and [[Roman engineering]]. It is also a recognised source for [[medicine]], [[art]], [[mineralogy]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[geology]] and many other topics not discussed by other classical authors. Among many interesting entries are those for the [[elephant]] and the [[murex]] snail, the much sought-after source of [[Tyrian purple]] dye.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;

Although his work has been criticized for the lack of candor in checking the "facts", some of his text has been confirmed by recent research, like the spectacular remains of Roman [[gold mines]] in [[Spain]], especially at [[Las Médulas]], which Pliny probably saw in operation while a [[Promagistrate|Procurator]] there a few years before he compiled the encyclopedia. Although many of the [[mining]] methods are now redundant, such as [[hushing]] and [[fire-setting]], it is Pliny who recorded them for posterity, thereby helping us understand their importance in a modern context. Pliny makes clear the fact in the preface to his work that he had checked his facts by reading and comparing the works of others, as well as referring to them by name. Many such books are now [[lost works]] and remembered only by his references, much like the lost sources mentioned in the work of [[Vitruvius]] a century earlier.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Etymologiae Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|First printed edition of 1472 (by Guntherus Zainer, [[Augsburg]]), title page of book 14 (''de terra et partibus''), illustrated with a [[T and O map]].]]
The work ''De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'' ("About the wedding of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and Philologia") written by [[Martianus Capella]] (4th-5th century) was very influential on the successive medieval encyclopedias. It consists in a complete encyclopedia of classical erudition. It firstly introduced the division and classification of the seven [[liberal arts]] ([[trivium]] and [[quadrivium]]), followed by many successive works along the [[Middle Ages]].

The first Christian encyclopedia were the ''Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum'' of [[Cassiodorus]] (543-560), which were divided in two parts: the first one dealt with Christian Divinity; the second one described the seven liberal arts.

Saint [[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized as being the author of the first known encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and modern. The encyclopedia has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had they not been collected by Saint Isidore.

The most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian]] Age was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830, which was based on ''Etymologiae''.

Many encyclopedic works were written during the [[12th century|12th]] and [[13th centuries]]. Among them, ''[[Hortus deliciarum]]'' (1167–1185) by [[Herrad of Landsberg]] which is thought to be the first encyclopedia written by a woman. ''[[De proprietatibus rerum]]'' by [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]] (1240) is often described as the most widely read and quoted encyclopedia in the [[High Middle Ages]]&lt;ref name="dotma"&gt;See "Encyclopedia" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Vincent of Beauvais]]'s ''[[Speculum Majus]]'' (1260) was the most ambitious encyclopedia in the [[Late medieval|late-medieval period]] at over 3 million words.&lt;ref name=dotma/&gt;

The first encyclopedias in vernacular languages were translations or abridgements of works in [[Latin]]. Among them, the most famous is ''Li livre dou Trésor'', written in [[French language|French]] by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Brunetto Latini]]. It is mainly based on the ''Speculum Majus''. The works by the [[Flemish]] [[Jacob van Maerlant]], as a whole, are regarded as an encyclopedia. These works, too, are based on former Latin texts.

=== Byzantine encyclopedias ===

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] encyclopedias were compendia of information about both [[Ancient Greece|Ancient]] and Byzantine Greece. The first of them was the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' written by the [[patriarch]] [[Photius]] (9th century).

The ''[[Suda]]'' or Souda (Greek: Σοῦδα) is a massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, formerly attributed to an author called Suidas. It is an encyclopedic [[lexicon]], written in Greek, with 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers.

===Arabic and Persian===
The [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]]&lt;ref&gt;P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''&lt;/ref&gt; were engaged in their [[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]. Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose [[Muqaddimah]] contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

These scholars have influenced methods of research and editing, due in part to the Islamic practice of [[isnad]] which emphasized fidelity to written record, checking sources, and skeptical inquiry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} An acquisition of knowledge it was believed not only enlightened the mind but also led to a greater appreciation of God. To be remarkable during these times was to keep pace with the ‘march of intellect’ and the printing press became a necessity for the widespread dissemination of this commodity called knowledge. As a means of cultural production, the printing press was the very embodiment of the ideal of ‘Enlightenment’.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, Savithri Preetha. "'...Of real use to the people': The Tanjore printing press and the spread of useful knowledge." Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

[[Varāhamihira]]'s (505–587 CE) [[Brihat Samhita]] ("large compilation") is an encyclopedic work, not only dealing with astrology but also rainfall, clouds, water-divination, intentions and characteristics of animals, perfumes, erotic recipes, pimples, temples, architecture and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita|author=M. Ramakrishna Bhat|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|url=http://www.astroamerica.com/text/brihatsamhita.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|Chinese encyclopedia}}
The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4 million [[Chinese characters]] in 1,000 written volumes. There were many great encyclopedists throughout Chinese history, including the scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) with his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088, the statesman, inventor, and agronomist [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (active 1290–1333) with his ''Nong Shu'' of 1313, and the written ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' of [[Song Yingxing]] (1587–1666), the latter of whom was termed the "[[Denis Diderot|Diderot of China]]" by British historian [[Joseph Needham]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 102"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] oversaw the compilation of the ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'', one of the largest encyclopedias in history, which was completed in 1408 and comprised over 370 million Chinese characters in 11,000 handwritten volumes, of which only about 400 remain today. In the succeeding [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Qianlong Emperor]] personally composed 40,000 poems as part of a 4.7 million page library in 4 divisions, including thousands of essays, called the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' which is probably the largest collection of books in the world. It is instructive to compare his title for this knowledge, ''Watching the waves in a Sacred Sea'' to a Western-style title for all knowledge. Encyclopedic works, both in imitation of Chinese encyclopedias and as independent works of their own origin, have been known to exist in Japan since the 9th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Renaissance==
[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]
These works were all hand copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.&lt;ref name="dotma"/&gt;

During  the [[Renaissance]],  the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy.

The ''De expetendis et fugiendis rebus'' by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated.

The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts.

Much encyclopaedism of the [[French Renaissance]] was based upon the notion of not including every fact known to humans, but only that knowledge that was necessary, where necessity was judged by a wide variety of criteria, leading to works of greatly varying sizes. [[Béroalde de Verville]] laid the foundation for his encyclopaedic works in a [[hexameral poem]] entitled ''Les cognoissances nécessaires'' for example. Often, the criteria had moral bases, such as in the case of [[Pierre de La Primaudaye]]'s ''L'Académie française'' and Guillaume Telin's ''Bref sommaire des sept vertus &amp;c.''. Encyclopaedists encountered several problems with this approach, including how to decide what to omit as unnecessary, how to structure knowledge that resisted structure (often simply as a consequence of the sheer amount of material that deserved inclusion), and how to cope with the influx of newly discovered knowledge and the effects that it had on prior structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Palace of Secrets: Beroalde de Verville and Renaissance Conceptions of Knowledge|author=Neil Kenny|pages=12–13|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-815862-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term encyclopaedia was coined by 15th century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Quintilian]], and combined the two Greek words "''enkyklios paideia''" into one word. The phrase ''enkyklios paideia'' (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word Enciclopedia came from him.&lt;br&gt;The first work titled in this way was the ''Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio'' written by [[Johannes Aventinus]] in 1517.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The English physician and philosopher, Sir [[Thomas Browne]], specifically employed the word ''encyclopaedia'' for the first time in English{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} as early as 1646 in the preface to the reader to describe his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' or ''Vulgar Errors'', a series of refutations of common errors of his age. Browne structured his encyclopedia upon the time-honoured schemata of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends a hierarchical ladder via the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary and cosmological worlds. Browne's compendium went through no less than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' found itself upon the bookshelves of many educated European readers, for throughout the late 17th century and early 18th century it was translated. For many years it was thought incompatible with the French and Dutcheze, into the French, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and German languages as well as [[Latin]].

==18th–19th centuries==
[[Image:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclopédie]]'', 1773]]
The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of Diderot and D'Alembert (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content "A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves".

[[Image:1708-harris-ttlpg.jpg|left|thumb|Harris' ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'', title page of 2nd edition, 1708]]

[[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] is often credited with introducing the now-familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English ''Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves'' – to give its full title. Organized alphabetically, its content does indeed contain explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but of the arts and sciences themselves. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710. Its emphasis was on science—and conformably to the broad 18th-century understanding of the term 'science', its content extends beyond what would be called science or technology today, and includes topics from the humanities and fine arts, e.g. a substantial number from law, commerce, music, and heraldry. At about 1,200 pages, its scope can be considered as more that of an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] than a true encyclopedia. Harris himself considered it a dictionary; the work is one of the first technical dictionaries in any language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[Ephraim Chambers]] published his ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopædia]]'' in 1728. It included a broad scope of subjects, used an alphabetic arrangement, relied on many different contributors and included the innovation of cross-referencing other sections within articles. Chambers has been referred to as the father of the modern encyclopedia for this two-volume work.

A French translation of Chambers' work inspired the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', perhaps the most famous early encyclopedia, notable for its scope, the quality of some contributions, and its political and cultural impact in the years leading up to the [[French Revolution]]. The ''Encyclopédie'' was edited by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Denis Diderot]] and published in 17 volumes of articles, issued from 1751 to 1765, and 11 volumes of illustrations, issued from 1762 to 1772. Five volumes of supplementary material and a two volume index, supervised by other editors, were issued from 1776 to 1780 by [[Charles-Joseph Panckoucke]].

The ''Encyclopédie'' represented the essence of the [[French Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Stephen J. Gendzier (1967), cited in Hillmelfarb 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot, in his [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;idno=did2222.0000.004;rgn=main;view=text ''Encyclopédie'' article of the same name], went further: "to collect all the knowledge that now lies scattered over the face of the earth, to make known its general structure to the men among we live, and to transmit it to those who will come after us", to make men not only wiser but also "more virtuous and more happy."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot, ''Rameau's Nephew and Other Works'', trans. and ed. Jacques Barzun and Ralph H. Bowen (1956), cited in Himmelfarb 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing the inherent problems with the model of knowledge he had created, Diderot's view of his own success in writing the ''Encyclopédie'' were far from ecstatic. Diderot envisioned the perfect encyclopedia as more than the sum of its parts. In his own article on the encyclopedia, Diderot also wrote, "Were an analytical dictionary of the sciences and arts nothing more than a methodical combination of their elements, I would still ask whom it behooves to fabricate good elements." Diderot viewed the ideal encyclopedia as an index of connections. He realized that all knowledge could never be amassed in just one large work, but he hoped the relations among the subjects could be.

The ''Encyclopédie'' in turn inspired the venerable ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which had a modest beginning in Scotland: the first edition, issued between 1768 and 1771, had just three hastily completed volumes – A–B, C–L, and M–Z – with a total of 2,391 pages. By 1797, when the third edition was completed, it had been expanded to 18 volumes addressing a full range of topics, with articles contributed by a range of authorities on their subjects.

The German-language ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Conversations-Lexikon]]'' was published at [[Leipzig]] from 1796 to 1808, in 6 volumes. Paralleling other 18th century encyclopedias, its scope was expanded beyond that of earlier publications, in an effort at comprehensiveness. It was, however, intended not for scholarly use but to provide results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form without extensive detail. This format, a contrast to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', was widely imitated by later 19th century encyclopedias in Britain, the United States, France, Spain, Italy and other countries. Of the influential late-18th century and early-19th century encyclopedias, the ''Conversations-Lexikon'' is perhaps most similar in form to today's encyclopedias.

[[File:eclairage.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical custom-made encyclopedia engraving by [[Maurice Dessertenne]] for the ''Nouveau Larousse illustré'' (France, 1898–1907)]]
The early years of the 19th century saw a flowering of encyclopedia publishing in the United Kingdom, Europe and America. In England ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' (1802–19) contains an enormous amount in information about the industrial and scientific revolutions of the time. A feature of these publications is the high-quality illustrations made by engravers like [[Wilson Lowry]] of art work supplied by specialist draftsmen like [[John Farey, Jr.]] Encyclopedias were published in Scotland, as a result of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], for education there was of a higher standard than in the rest of the United Kingdom. The [[Bulgarian National Revival|National Revival]] of [[Bulgaria]], influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], resulted in [[Petar Beron]]'s ''[[Primer with Various Instructions]]'' (also known as the ''Fish Primer'') in 1824. It was a small encyclopedia for children, containing fables, proverbs, ancient history, basic [[arithmetics]], [[zoology]] and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulgaria: historical and geographical outline|last=Todorov|first=Nikolai|year=1968|page=263|location=Sofia|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=fxidT834J_LZ4QTM7d2pDg&amp;hl=bg&amp;id=zXlpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fish+primer+beron+bulgarian+encyclopedia+-april&amp;q=fish+primer+beron+encyclopedia+-april}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beron later published a 7-volume work in natural sciences known as ''[[Panepisteme]]'' in 1867.

The 17-volume ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle]]'' and its supplements were published in France by [[Pierre Larousse]] from 1866 to 1890.

''Encyclopædia Britannica'' appeared in various editions throughout the century, and the growth of [[popular education]] and the [[Mechanics' Institutes]], spearheaded by the [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]] led to the production of the ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]]'', as its title suggests issued in weekly numbers at a penny each like a newspaper.

In the early 20th century, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' reached its eleventh edition, and inexpensive encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and ''[[Everyman's Encyclopaedia]]'' were common.

===International development===
During the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages.

The first large encyclopedia in Russian, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'' (86 volumes, 1890–1906), was a direct cooperation with the German Brockhaus.

Without such a formal cooperation, the Swedish ''Conversations-lexicon'' (4 volumes, 1821–1826) was a translation of Brockhaus 2nd edition. The first encyclopedia written originally in Swedish was ''Svenskt konversationslexikon'' (4 volumes, 1845–1851) by Per Gustaf Berg. A more ambitious project was ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'', established in 1875 and intended to comprise 6 volumes. But in 1885, when it had published 8 volumes and gotten only halfways (A–K), the publisher turned to the government for extra funding; encyclopedias had become national monuments. It was finished in 1894 with 18 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfar/slutord.html Slutord], postscriptum to the 1st edition, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; with two supplement volumes (1896–1899).
[[File:Göttingen-SUB-Encyclopedia.Americana.JPG|thumb|180px|''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' at Göttingen State and University Library.]]
The first major Danish encyclopedia was ''[[Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon]]'' (19 volumes, 1893–1911).

In Norway, encyclopedias follow the unique history of the [[Norwegian language]], the [[Bokmål]] variant having branched off from Danish during the 19th century. After the national independence in 1905, publisher [[Aschehoug]] (owned by [[William Martin Nygaard]]) hired librarian Haakon Nyhuus to edit ''Illustreret norsk konversationsleksikon'' (6 volumes, 1907–1913), in later editions known as ''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon''. In the [[Nynorsk]] variant of the language, ''Norsk Allkunnebok'' (10 volumes, 1948–1966) was the only encyclopedia until the arrival of Wikipedia.

The first major Finnish encyclopedia was ''[[Tietosanakirja]]'' (11 volumes, 1909–1922). Inspired by the minority language example of ''Norsk Allkunnebok'', a Swedish-language encyclopedia of Finland was initiated in 1969 and eventually published as ''[[Uppslagsverket Finland]]'' (3 volumes, 1982–1985; 2nd edition in 5 volumes, 2003–2007). With such a small market, the sales revenue only covered the printing cost, while editors were paid by endowments. In 2009 the entire contents was made available online, free of charge.

Already during [[czarist Russia]]n rule, two editions appeared of the Latvian ''Konversācijas vārdnīca'' (2 volumes, 1891–1893; 4 volumes, 1906–1921). The larger ''Latviešu konversācijas vārdnīca'' (21 volumes, A–Tjepolo, 1927–1940) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. After the war, Latvian emigrants in Sweden published ''Latvju enciklopēdija'' (3 volumes, 1950–1956, with a supplement volume in 1962). Soviet authories published ''Latvijas PSR mazās enciklopēdijas'' (3 volumes, 1967–1970) and ''Latvijas padomju enciklopēdija'' (10 volumes, 1981–1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia.lv/encuklopedijas/manualo_enciklopediju_saraksts.htm List of Latvian encyclopedias] from the website Historia.lv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the history of [[Lithuanian encyclopedias]], the ''Lietuviškoji enciklopedija'' (9 volumes A–J, 1933–1941) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. Lithuanian emigrants in the United States published ''Lietuvių enciklopedija'' (35 volumes, 1953–1966). Soviet authorities published ''Mažoji lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija'' (3 volumes, 1966–1971), ''Lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija'' (12 volumes, 1976–1985), and ''[[Encyclopedia of Soviet Lithuania|Tarybų Lietuvos enciklopedija]]'' (4 volumes, 1985–1988).
First Turkish encyclopedia was Kamus-ül-Ulûm ve’l-Maarif written by Ali Suvai in 1870 after that Ahmet Rifat Efendi's 7 volumes work "Lûgaat-i Tarihiye ve Coğrafiye" (Dictionary of History and Geography) published in Istanbul at 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/ansiklopedi/ |title=Ansiklopedi (encyclopedia) (tr) |publisher=Yeniansiklopedi.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|left|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias.]]

Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and ''[[The Children's Encyclopædia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.

In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'' and ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia]]''.

The second half of the 20th century also saw the publication of several encyclopedias that were notable for synthesizing important topics in specific fields, often by means of new works authored by significant researchers. Such encyclopedias included ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (first published in 1967 and now in its second edition), and ''Elsevier's Handbooks In Economics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/S04.cws_home/books |title=Economics and Finance – Elsevier |publisher=Elsevier.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; series. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including, typically, such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]] and [[African-American history]].

By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', launched in 1993, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images. After sixteen years, Microsoft discontinued the Encarta line of products in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwblMaEW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional encyclopedias are written by a number of employed text writers, usually people with an [[academic degree]], and distributed as [[Intellectual property|proprietary]] content.

Encyclopedias are essentially derivative from what has gone before, and particularly in the 19th century, [[copyright infringement]] was common among encyclopedia editors. However, modern encyclopedias are not merely larger compendia, including all that came before them. To make space for modern topics, valuable material of historic use regularly had to be discarded, at least before the advent of digital encyclopedias. Moreover, the opinions and world views of a particular generation can be observed in the encyclopedic writing of the time. For these reasons, old encyclopedias are a useful source of historical information, especially for a record of changes in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Kobasa, Paul A. "Encyclopedia." World Book Online Reference Center. 2008. [Place of access.] 13 Jan. 2008 &lt;http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Login?ed=wb&amp;tu=%2Fwb%2FArticle%3Fid%3Dar180800&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, old encyclopedias whose [[public domain|copyright has expired]], such as the 1911 edition of ''Britannica'', are also the only [[free content]] English encyclopedias released in print form. However, works such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', which were created in the public domain,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} exist as free content encyclopedias in other languages.

===Emergence of free encyclopedias===
{{See also|History of wikis}}
The concept of a new free encyclopedia began with the [[Interpedia]] proposal on [[Usenet]] in 1993, which outlined an Internet-based [[online encyclopedia]] to which anyone could submit content and that would be freely accessible. Early projects in this vein included [[Everything2]] and [[Open Site]]. In 1999, [[Richard Stallman]] proposed the [[GNUPedia]], an online encyclopedia which, similar to the [[GNU operating system]], would be a "generic" resource. The concept was very similar to Interpedia, but more in line with Stallman's [[GNU]] philosophy.

It was not until [[Nupedia]] and later Wikipedia that a stable free encyclopedia project was able to be established on the Internet.

==Twenty-first century==
[[File:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg|thumb|upright|Wikipedia is one of the first "[[user generated content]]" encyclopedias]]

The English Wikipedia, which was started in 2001, became the world's largest encyclopedia in 2004 at the 300,000 article stage&lt;ref&gt;[http://linuxreviews.org/news/2004/07/07_3000k/ "Wikipedia Passes 300,000 Articles making it the worlds largest encyclopedia"], ''Linux Reviews'', 2004 Julich y 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and by late 2005, Wikipedia had produced over two million articles in more than 80 languages with content licensed under the [[copyleft]] [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. As of August 2009, Wikipedia had over 3 million articles in English and well over 10 million combined in over 250 languages. Wikipedia currently has [[Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}]] articles in English. Since 2003, other free encyclopedias like the Chinese-language [[Baidu Baike]] and [[Hudong]], as well as English language encyclopedias like [[Citizendium]] and [[Knol]] have appeared. Knol has been discontinued.

An encyclopedia's hierarchical structure and evolving nature is particularly adaptable to a [[Digital media|digital format]], and all major printed general encyclopedias had moved to this method of delivery by the end of the 20th century. [[Disk storage|Disk-based]], typically [[DVD-ROM]] or [[CD-ROM]] format, publications have the advantage of being cheaply produced and easily portable. Additionally, they can include [[Electronic media|media]] which are impossible to store in the printed format, such as [[animation]]s, [[sound recording|audio]] and [[video]]. [[Hyperlink]]ing between conceptually related items is also a significant benefit, although even Diderot's encyclopedia had cross-referencing.

On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic: new information can be presented almost immediately, rather than waiting for the next release of a static format, as with a disk- or paper-based publication. Many printed encyclopedias traditionally published annual supplemental volumes ("yearbooks") to update events between editions, as a partial solution to the problem of staying up-to-date, but this of course required the reader to check both the main volumes and the supplemental volumes. Some disk-based encyclopedias offer subscription-based access to online updates, which are then integrated with the content already on the user's [[hard disk]] in a manner not possible with a printed encyclopedia.

Information in a printed encyclopedia necessarily needs some form of hierarchical structure. Traditionally, the method employed is to present the information ordered alphabetically by the article title. However, with the advent of dynamic electronic formats the need to impose a pre-determined structure is less necessary. Nonetheless, most electronic encyclopedias still offer a range of organizational strategies for the articles, such as by subject, area, or alphabetically.

Digital encyclopedias also offer greater search abilities than printed versions. While the printed versions rely on indexes to assist in searching for topics, computer accessible versions allow searching through article text for keywords or phrases.

Specialized encyclopedias may offer a more comprehensive content. For example, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ADAM Medical Encyclopedia (which includes over 4,000 articles about diseases, tests, symptoms, injuries, and surgeries), the Wiki Encyclopedia of Law and the Encyclopedia of Earth all provide a more focused list of topics.

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, recent works include the ''Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam'' prepared in 10 volumes by The Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/ |title=Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation. بنیاد دائره المعارف اسلامی |publisher=Encyclopaediaislamica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Islam'' published as a four-volume English encyclopedia including around 1200 entries. Other such works are: the ''Encyclopedia of  Imam Ali'', the ''Encyclopedia of Qur'anology'', and the ''Encyclopedia of Lady Fātima'', all published by the Islamic Research Institute for Culture and Thought (IICT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ency.iict.ac.ir |title=پژوهشكده دانشنامه نگاري – پژوهشکده دانشنامه نگاری دینی |publisher=Ency.iict.ac.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irwin Martin Abrams''' (February 24, 1914 – December 16, 2010) was a long-time professor of history at [[Antioch College]], a pioneer in the field of peace research, and a global authority on the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. His book, ''The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates'', first published in 1988 and subsequently updated and revised, is regarded as the authoritative reference work on the subject. His other books included ''Words of Peace'', which brought together selections from the acceptance speeches of Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and five volumes of ''Nobel Lectures in Peace''.

==Life and career==

Irwin Abrams was born in San Francisco in 1914. He graduated from [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]] in December 1930 at the age of 16. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from [[Stanford University]] and a master's degree and Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]]. In 1936-37, he traveled to Europe to do research for his dissertation. It was a formative experience. He met many outstanding leaders and scholars of the international peace movement and delved into previously unknown source materials.

"Abrams opened and explored archival sources on which a generation of historians would come to depend," the Magazine of History said in a 1994 profile. "His dissertation, A History of European Peace Societies, 1867-1899, won the Charles Sumner Peace Prize and, although it was never published, it has been called 'the most quoted unpublished dissertation in history'. Whether or not that is factual, it has the ring of truth, for Abrams's 1938 work and his subsequent writing gave direction and inspiration to historians on both sides of the Atlantic when the study of peace in history blossomed a generation later."&lt;ref&gt;Chatfield, Charles; [http://www.irwinabrams.com/bio/chatfield.html "Profile of a Peace Historian"], ''The OAH Magazine of History", Spring 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born Jewish, Abrams became a Quaker in the late 1930s, inspired in part by his research on the early peace movement and his friendships with British philosopher [[Gerald Heard]] and others. He later wrote that joining the Society of Friends was the final step in a move away from liberal humanism toward the ideal of pacifism and nonviolence. He came to believe that "to change the world you had to change yourself." &lt;ref&gt;Chatfield, Charles; [http://www.irwinabrams.com/bio/chatfield.html "Profile of a Peace Historian"], ''The OAH Magazine of History'', Spring 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Abrams fulfilled his obligations as a conscientious objector by working with the [[American Friends Service Committee]], or AFSC, in Philadelphia. He researched international relief work, directed training for AFSC relief workers from 1943 to 1946 and organized the Quaker International Workcamp Program the following year. During that time, his wife Freda, whom he had married in 1939, stayed home with their two young children, David and Carole. A third child, James, was born a few years later.

The family moved to Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1947 when Abrams joined the faculty of [[Antioch College]]. He organized the Department of History and created an introduction to western civilization still fondly remembered by many Antioch alumni. He became a full professor in 1951, Distinguished University Professor in 1979, and "emeritus" two years later.

Throughout his Antioch years, Abrams was nudged beyond the classroom by his Quaker concern for peace, his pioneering studies of the historic European peace movement and his own international experience. He became, as he wrote, "a theorist and practitioner" in study abroad and intercultural experience. The number of international exchanges, including study abroad, was rising rapidly, and he saw this as a valuable opportunity to encourage cross-cultural understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Andrzej; [http://aea.antioch.edu/IrwinAbrams.html "Antioch Education Abroad: Irwin Abrams"], Antioch University, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement from teaching, Abrams published the first of several books on the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. His ''The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History'' was published in 1989. It was recognized as an "outstanding reference work" by the American Library Association.  He went on to publish other works on the prize, including ''Words of Peace'', which brings together selections from the acceptance speeches of the prizewinners, and five volumes of ''Nobel Lectures in Peace''.

Of writing about the laureates, he wrote, "It's been a rich experience to live with these people all of these years."&lt;ref&gt;Chiddister, Diane; [http://www.irwinabrams.com/bio/ysnews.pdf "Historian Irwin Abrams Captures Inspirational Work of Peacemakers"], Yellow Springs News, January 3, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He met many of the prizewinners, including the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Willy Brandt]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Another laureate, [[José Ramos-Horta]], the current president of [[East Timor]], considered him a friend. Abrams "led a life of scholarly integrity, intellectual and moral rectitude, compassion and faith in humanity, encompassing a whole century of profound transformation in the history of our small world", he said.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos-Horta, José; From unpublished remarks on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, June 28, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrams was honored on numerous occasions by colleagues and former students. In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate from Antioch University. In 2000, he was given a distinguished lifetime service award by the Peace History Society and the Peace History Commission of the [[International Peace Research Association]].

In 2003, the Antioch College Alumni Association presented him with the Arthur Morgan Award "for his long and exemplary service to the Antioch College community, the education community and the global community".

Abrams said that the happiest outcome of his teaching years was when his students from the class of 1955 came together in 2005 – 50 years later – and raised funds for a peace education memorial fund in his name.

He was inducted into the "Walk of Fame" in [[Dayton]], [[Ohio]], in the fall of 2007 and has a square on the sidewalk on W. Third Street in [[Dayton]] commemorating his achievements. The inscription states that "Dr. Abrams brought recognition to Antioch University" as a "scholar, author, educator and humanitarian."

'''James Naismith''' (November 6, 1861 – November 28, 1939) was a Canadian-American physical educator, physician, chaplain, sports coach and innovator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/james-a-naismith-9420059|title=James A. Naismith|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the game of [[basketball]] at age 30 in 1891. He wrote the [[James Naismith's Original Rules of Basketball|original basketball rule book]] and founded the [[Kansas Jayhawks basketball|University of Kansas]] basketball program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/sports/basketball/basketballs-birth-in-james-naismiths-own-spoken-words.html|title=Basketball's Birth, in James Naismith's Own Spoken Words|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=2015-12-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-19|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naismith lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] and as an official event at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], as well as the birth of the [[National Invitation Tournament]] (1938) and the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] (1939).

Born in [[Canada]], Naismith studied [[physical education]] at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] before moving to the [[United States]], where he designed the game in late 1891 while teaching at the [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|International YMCA Training School]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Porter. (2005). ''Basketball: a biographical dictionary'' p.346.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after inventing basketball, Naismith received his [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] in 1898. He then arrived at the [[University of Kansas]], later becoming the [[Kansas Jayhawks]]' athletic director and coach.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Porter. (2005). ''Basketball: A biographical dictionary.'' p.347.&lt;/ref&gt; While a coach at Kansas, Naismith coached [[Phog Allen]], who later became the coach at Kansas for 39 seasons, beginning a lengthy and prestigious coaching tree. Allen then went on to coach legends including [[Adolph Rupp]] and [[Dean Smith]], among others, who themselves coached many notable players and future coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEAN SMITH'S COACHING TREE DISPLAYS INCREDIBLE REACH ACROSS DECADES|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2358295-dean-smiths-coaching-tree-displays-incredible-reach-across-decades|website=BleacherReport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite coaching his final season in 1907, Naismith is still the only coach in Kansas men's basketball history with a losing record.

Struggling in school but gifted in farm labour, [https://www.thoughtco.com/james-naismith-basketball-1991639 Naismith] spent his days outside playing catch, hide-and-seek, or [[duck on a rock]], a medieval game in which a person guards a large [[stone skipping|drake stone]] from opposing players, who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it. To play ''duck on a rock'' most effectively, Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought that later proved essential for the invention of [[basketball]].&lt;ref name=museumtimeline&gt;

'''Springfield college: Invention of Basketball'''
{{Wikisource|Basket Ball}}
[[File:Firstbasketball.jpg|thumb|upright|The original 1891 "Basket Ball" court in [[Springfield College]]. It used a peach basket attached to the wall.]]
At the Springfield YMCA, Naismith struggled with a rowdy class that was confined to indoor games throughout the harsh [[New England]] winter and thus was perpetually short-tempered. Under orders from Dr. Luther Gulick, head of Physical Education there, Naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an "athletic distraction": Gulick demanded that it would not take up much room, could help its track athletes to keep in shape&lt;ref name=mcgill/&gt; and explicitly emphasized to "make it fair for all players and not too rough."&lt;ref name=hofsummary/&gt;

In his attempt to think up a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts.&lt;ref name=museumtimeline/&gt; Firstly, he analyzed the most popular games of those times ([[Rugby union|rugby]], [[lacrosse]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[Gridiron football|football]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], and [[baseball]]); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball and concluded that the big soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game ''duck on a rock''. Naismith christened this new game "Basket Ball"&lt;ref name=museumtimeline/&gt; and put his thoughts together in [[James Naismith's Original Rules of Basketball|13 basic rules]].&lt;ref name=13rules&gt;{{cite web 
 |last=Naismith

 |deadurl=yes 
 |df= 
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game of "Basket Ball" was played in December 1891. In a handwritten report, Naismith described the circumstances of the inaugural match; in contrast to modern [[basketball]], the players played nine versus nine, handled a [[association football|soccer]] ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: "When Mr. Stubbins brot {{sic}} up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put [[James Naismith's Original Rules of Basketball|the 13 rules]] on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class ... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead ... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men &amp; tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon."&lt;ref name=firstgame&gt;{{cite web

Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each "goal" a [[jump ball]] was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in [[Rules of basketball|the rules of modern basketball]].&lt;ref name=modernrules&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a radio interview in January 1939, Naismith gave more details of the first game and the initial rules that were used:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I showed them two peach baskets I'd nailed up at each end of the gym, and I told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket. I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began. ... The boys began tackling, kicking and punching in the clinches. They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. [The injury toll: several black eyes, one separated shoulder and one player knocked unconscious.] "It certainly was murder." [Naismith changed some of the rules as part of his quest to develop a clean sport.]  The most important one was that there should be no running with the ball. That stopped tackling and slugging. We tried out the game with those [new] rules (fouls), and we didn't have one casualty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/sports/basketball/basketballs-birth-in-james-naismiths-own-spoken-words.html|title=Basketball's Birth, in James Naismith's Own Spoken Words|date=16 December 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1892, basketball had grown so popular on campus that Dennis Horkenbach (editor-in-chief of ''The Triangle'', the Springfield college newspaper) featured it in an article called "A New Game",&lt;ref name=kuhistory/&gt; and there were calls to call this new game "Naismith Ball", but Naismith refused.&lt;ref name=museumtimeline/&gt; By 1893, basketball was introduced internationally by the [[YMCA]] movement.&lt;ref name=kuhistory/&gt; From Springfield, Naismith went to [[Denver]] where he acquired a medical degree and in 1898 he joined the [[University of Kansas]] faculty at [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name=hofsummary/&gt;

The family of [[Lambert G. Will]] has claimed that Dr. Naismith borrowed components for the game of basketball from Will to dispute Naismith's sole creation of the game, citing alleged photos and letters.&lt;ref name=VPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Baruth|first=Philip|title=Basketball Inventor|url=http://www.vpr.net/episode/33157/|work=Basketball Inventor|publisher=Vermont Public Radio|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Box&gt;{{cite web|last=Fosty|first=George &amp; Darril|title=Basketball's Origins, Lingering Questions Remain|url=http://boxscorenews.com/basketballs-origins-lingering-questions-remain-p783-78.htm|publisher=Box Score News|accessdate=27 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727022410/http://boxscorenews.com/basketballs-origins-lingering-questions-remain-p783-78.htm|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common opponents were [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] and [[William Jewell College]]. Under Naismith, the team played only one current [[Big 12]] school: [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]] (once).

During his time at Kansas, Allen coached [[Dean Smith]] (1952 National Championship team) and [[Adolph Rupp]] (1922 Helms Foundation National Championship team). Smith and Rupp have joined Naismith and Allen as [[List of members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|members of the Basketball Hall of Fame]].

By the turn of the century, there were enough college teams in the East that the first intercollegiate competitions could be played out.&lt;ref name=kshs/&gt; Although the sport continued to grow, Naismith long regarded the game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and [[wrestling]] as better forms of physical activity.&lt;ref name=kshs/&gt; However, basketball became a [[Basketball at the 1904 Summer Olympics|demonstration sport]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].

He took American citizenship in 1925.&lt;ref name=museumtimeline/&gt; In 1909, Naismith's duties at Kansas were redefined as a Professorship; he served as the ''de facto'' athletic director at Kansas for much of the early 20th century.

In 1923, Dr. Naismith was a founder of the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity at the University of Kansas.  Naismith was deeply involved with the members, serving as Chapter Counselor for sixteen years, from 1923 until his death in 1939.  He eventually married SigEp's Housemother, Mrs. Florence Kincaid.  Members interviewed from that era remembered Dr. Naismith: "He was deeply religious" "He listened more than he spoke" "He thought sports were nothing but an avenue to keep young people involved so they could do their studies and relate to their community" "It was real nice having someone the caliber of Dr. Naismith so involved ... he helped many a SigEp!"

In 1935, the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (created by Naismith's pupil Phog Allen) collected money so that the 74-year-old Naismith could witness the introduction of basketball into the official Olympic sports program of the [[1936 Summer Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; There, Naismith handed out the medals to three North American teams: United States, for the gold medal, Canada, for the silver medal, and [[Mexico]], for their bronze medal win.&lt;ref&gt;

Naismith became professor emeritus in Kansas when he retired in 1937 at the age of 76. Including his years as coach, Naismith served as athletic director and faculty at the school for a total of almost 40 years. Naismith died in 1939 after he suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage. He was interred at Memorial Park Cemetery in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. His masterwork "Basketball&amp;nbsp;— its Origins and Development" was published posthumously in 1941.&lt;ref name=museumtimeline/&gt; In Lawrence, Kansas, James Naismith has a road named in his honor, Naismith Drive, which runs in front of [[Allen Fieldhouse]] (the official address of Allen Fieldhouse is 1651 Naismith Drive), the university's basketball facility. The university also named the court in [[Allen Fieldhouse]] ''James Naismith Court'' in his honor, despite Naismith having the worst record in school history. Naismith Hall, a college residential dormitory, is located on the northeastern edge of 19th Street and Naismith Drive.&lt;ref name=googlemaps&gt;{{cite web

Naismith's home town of [[Almonte, Ontario]], hosts an annual 3-on-3 tournament for all ages and skill levels in his honor. Every year this event attracts hundreds of participants and involves over 20 half court games along the main street of the town. All proceeds of the event go to youth basketball programs in the area.

Basketball today is played by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it one of the most popular team sports.&lt;ref name=mcgill/&gt; In North America, basketball has produced some of the most-admired athletes of the 20th century. [[ESPN]] and the [[Associated Press]] both conducted polls to name the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century.

The original rules of basketball written by James Naismith in 1891, considered to be basketball's founding document, was auctioned  at Sotheby's, New York in December, 2010. [[Josh Swade]], a [[University of Kansas]] alumnus and basketball enthusiast, went on a crusade in 2010 to persuade moneyed alumni to considering bidding on and hopefully winning the document at auction to gift it to the University of Kansas. Swade eventually persuaded [[David G. Booth]], a billionaire investment banker and KU alumnus, and his wife Suzanne Booth to commit to bidding at the auction. The Booths won the bidding and purchased the document for a record $4,338,500 USD, the most ever paid for a sports memorabilia item, and gifted the document to the University of Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2010/james-naismith39s-founding-rules-of-basketball-n08735.html|title=Sotheby's - Auctions - James Naismith's Founding Rules of Basketball - Sotheby's|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swade's project and eventual success are chronicled in a 2012 ESPN [[30 for 30]] documentary "There's No Place Like Home" and in a corresponding book, "The Holy Grail of Hoops: One Fan's Quest to Buy the Original Rules of Basketball".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=theres-no-place-like-home|title=There's No Place Like Home - ESPN Films: 30 for 30|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Kansas constructed an $18 million building named the Debruce Center, which houses the rules and opened in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/weblogs/heard_hill/2016/jan/15/updates-from-the-debruce-center-future-h/|title=Updates from the DeBruce Center, future home of Naismith's 'Rules of Basket Ball' - Heard on the Hill / LJWorld.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

His mother, Margaret Young, was born in 1833 and immigrated to [[Lanark County, Ontario|Lanark County]], Canada in 1852 as the fourth of 11 children.&lt;ref name=museumtimeline/&gt; His father, John Naismith, was born in 1833,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stepaside.net/drjanaismith/dat4.htm#5|title=Dr. James A.

On June 20, 1894, Naismith married Maude Evelyn Sherman (1870–1937) in Springfield, MA, USA. The couple had five children: Margaret Mason (Stanley) (1895–1976), Helen Carolyn (Dodd) (1897–1980), John Edwin (1900–1986), Maude Ann (Dawe) (1904–1972) and James Sherman (1913–1980).&lt;ref name=hofsummary/&gt; He was a member of the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] and [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] fraternities.&lt;ref name=hofsummary/&gt; Naismith was a Presbyterian minister, and was also remembered as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref name="masons"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3866">'''Jean-M.-Vincent Audin''' was a French Roman Catholic author, journalist and historian.

==Biography ==
He was born at Lyons in 1793. He first studied [[theology]] in the [[seminary]] of [[Argentiere]], and afterwards pursued the study of law. He passed his law examination but never practiced the legal profession, having decided to enter on a literary career.
 
He soon left his native city and settled in Paris, where he opened a bookstore and at the same time was active with his pen. He died in Paris on 21 February 1851.

==Writings==
His first publications, concerning the [[French Revolution]], Napoleon and the [[Bourbon Restoration]], were "La lanterne magique" (1811); "Blanc, bleu et rouge" (1814) and a "Tableau historique des événements qui se sont accomplis depuis le retour de [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] jusqu'au rétablissement de [[Louis XVII]]" (1815). He contributed to the "Journal de Lyon" founded by [[Pierre-Simon Ballanche]].

Once in Paris, he first published articles of a political cast, and historical tales in the style of the time, such as "Michel Morin et la Ligue"; "Florence ou la Religieuse"; "Le Régicide" and others.
 
He then took up historical writing, his first work of this kind being "Le Concordat entre Léon X et François I" (1821), which is for the most part a translation of the [[Concordat]] between [[pope Leo X]] and renaissance king [[Francis I of France]]. This was followed by his "Histoire de la St. Barthélemy" (2 volumes, 1826) on the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] of 24 August 1572. These two works were fairly well received although some ecclesiastical critics accused him of being too favorable to the Protestants. Audin publicly defended himself against this imputation, and asserted his firm belief in the doctrines of the Catholic Church.
 
He now began his most important work, the history of the [[Protestant Reformation]], which he published from 1839 to 1842 in four books, as follows: # "Histoire de la vie, des ouvrages et de la doctrine de Luther" (2 volumes, Paris, 1839; 2d ed., 3 volumes, 1850) on [[Martin Luther]]
# "Histoire de la vie, des ouvrages et de la doctrine de Calvin" (2 volumes, 1841; 2d ed., 1851) on [[John Calvin]]
# "Histoire de Léon X et de son siecle" (2 volumes, 1844; 2d ed., 1851) on pope Leo X's time
# "Histoire de Henri VIII et du schisme d'Angleterre" (2 volumes, 1847; 2d ed., 1862) on [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII Tudor]] and the [[Anglican Schism]].
 
The author claims to have based his statements upon researches which he made in the archives of various European cities, especially in the archives of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The work shows that this assertion cannot be accepted in its entirety. The volumes are written in a romantic manner, and contain many particulars which sober criticism has long proved to go false. [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger]] said of the work on Luther: "Audin's work is written with an extraordinary, and at times almost naive ignorance of Luther's writings and contemporary literature, and of the general condition of Germany at that period" (Kirchenlexikon, s.v. Luther).

The '''Kearny fallout meter''', or '''KFM''', is an [[Civil defense Geiger counters|expedient radiation meter]]. It is designed such that someone with a normal mechanical ability would be able to construct it before or during a nuclear attack, using common household items.&lt;ref name=NWSS11&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, Tennessee|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=95–100|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p921.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kearny fallout meter was developed by [[Cresson Kearny]] from research performed at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] and published in the [[civil defense]] manual ''[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]'' ({{ISBN|0-942487-01-X}}). The plans were originally released in Oak Ridge National Laboratory publication ORNL-5040, ''The KFM, A Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meter''&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=The KFM, A Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meter|year=1978|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, Tennessee|url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030174241/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|archivedate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been formatted in a newsprint-ready layout so that they may be quickly printed with accurate dimensions in local newspapers. It must be built from a correctly scaled copy of the plans; photocopies and printouts of digital copies may not be to scale.&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

==History==
Devised in 1978 by Cresson Kearny, the Kearny fallout meter is an application of the [[Electroscope#Gold-leaf electroscope|gold-leaf electroscope]] developed in 1787 by [[Abraham Bennet]].&lt;ref name="Derry"&gt;{{cite book| last = Derry| first = Thomas K.|author2=Williams, Trevor| title = A Short History of Technology from Earliest Times to A.D.1900| publisher = Courier Dover| year = 1993| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PoAJbWm3nEUC&amp;pg=PA609| isbn = 0-486-27472-1|page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the use of the [[Electrometer#Gold-leaf electroscopes|electrometer]] principle for radiation detection had seen widespread application in the form of the [[quartz fiber dosimeter]]. Professional radiation meters, while more accurate and more durable, had a number of potential issues, including cost and lack of availability, which it was hoped the Kearny fallout meter would address.&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

==Use==
Commercially made radiation meters are typically based on electronic circuitry or require a battery-powered charging apparatus, allowing susceptibility to battery shortages and to [[electromagnetic pulse]]. The Kearny fallout meter was designed to utilize static electricity, produced by (for example) a hard plastic rubbed on dry paper.&lt;ref name=A /&gt; The KFM was also designed to be less expensive to build than the purchase price of dosimeters and to be made out of commonly available materials, such that they could be constructed even after a disaster.&lt;ref name=A /&gt; Most commercial radiation meters also require initial and periodic professional calibration, but "...&amp;nbsp;if a KFM is made and maintained with the specified dimensions and of the specified materials, its accuracy is automatically and permanently established by unchanging laws of nature".&lt;ref name=NWSS11 /&gt;

The designed operating range is from 30 m[[Roentgen (unit)|R]]/h to 43 R/h, with accuracy of ±25%.&lt;ref name=H /&gt;&amp;nbsp; "A KFM looks like a toy" has been cited as a "major disadvantage" of the design.&lt;ref name=NWSS11 /&gt;

==How it works==
{{See also|Quartz fiber dosimeter#Theory of operation}}
An electrostatic charge is placed upon two aluminium foil leaves, causing them to [[Electroscope#Gold-leaf electroscope|repel]]. As radiation strikes the meter, the foil leaves lose their charge and start to droop. This droop can be measured, and its rate can be established.&lt;ref name=A /&gt; The KFM has been used as a science project, demonstrating the effects of [[ionizing radiation]].

The dimensions of a KFM and the weight of its leaves permanently establish its calibration, when built as specified with a properly sized scale.&lt;ref name=H&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=The KFM, A Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meter|year=1978|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, Tennessee|page=3|url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030174241/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|archivedate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leopold Janauschek''' (13 October 1827 &amp;ndash; 23 July 1898) was an [[Austria]]n [[Cistercian]] historian.

==Life==
Janauschek was born at [[Brünn]], [[Moravia]]. In 1846 he received the religious habit at the Cistercian [[Zwettl Abbey]], Lower Austria, where he was professed in 1848. His superiors then sent him to their house of studies at [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] near Vienna, where he studied philosophy and theology. After his ordination to the priesthood he was made professor of history and canon law. His scholarly works attracted attention and won for him in 1858 the chair of ecclesiastical history in the [[University of Vienna]].

In 1859 he was recalled by his superiors to Heiligenkreuz, where he continued as professor until 1877. During this time he composed his first major work, ''Originum Cisterciensium Liber Primus'' (Vienna, 1877), in which he describes the foundation of the Cistercian Order, its organization and extension, and mentions many of those who, under various titles, had honoured it. He gives a lengthy account of 742 ancient abbeys of monks, founded between the end of the 11th and the end of the 17th centuries. The genealogical and chronological tables, as well as the work itself, required a colossal labour of research and compilation. He was unable to publish the second volume, which was to have been devoted to [[Cistercian nunneries]], and for which he had collected a great deal of material. He also published, at this period, a work of lesser importance on the history of the Cistercian Order.

His second major work is ''Bibliographia Bernardina''. In 1891, on the occasion of the eighth centenary of the birth of [[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]], the Cistercian Congregation of Austria prepared four volumes, under the title of ''Xenia Bernardina''. Janauschek gave assistance in the preparation of the first three volumes, but the fourth, ''Bibliographia Bernardina'' (Vienna, 1891), was entirely his own work. He there discusses successively the different editions of the works of Saint Bernard and their translations, the essays on the life of the saint, various [[panegyric]]s, his biographers, the inscriptions in his honour, the opinions of ecclesiastical historians, etc. The books noticed in ''Xenia Bernardina'' amount to 2,761 printed works and 119 manuscripts.

Despite weak health, which for many years permitted him to leave his room only at rare intervals, he worked on until his death in [[Baden, Austria|Baden]], near [[Vienna]].

[[File:Man and the Natural World by Keith Thomas, cover.jpg|thumb|right|''Man and the Natural World'' by [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]]]]
'''''Man and the Natural World. Changing Attitudes in England 1500–1800''''' by historian [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] was originally published in Great Britain by Allen Lane in 1983.

==Outline==
* '''Anthropocentric worldview'''. The first chapter introduces us to the extreme human-centred view of the natural world in early modern England. This chapter is very educational because the extreme anthropocentric view of that period is far removed from our modern worldview. This anthropocentric view had theological foundations and roots in Greek philosophers such as Aristotle. All things were created for the benefit and pleasure of man. Wild animals, birds and fish are God's gift to all men. Plants were created by God for the sake of animals and animals for the sake of men. Humans are [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. Animals might be lawfully killed. Cattle and sheep had only been given life in the first place to keep their meat fresh ''till we shall have need to eat them''. Furthermore, they were better off in man's care than left to the mercy of wild predators. Suffering of animals was denied. If not for food, animals were created for moral or aesthetic purposes. The [[louse]] was created to provide ''a powerful incentive to habits of cleanliness''. Weeds exercised ''the industry of man to weed them out''. The purpose of singing-birds was to entertain mankind. No animal or plant existed for itself. This worldview was all-embracing and unquestioned at the time. Only after travellers came back with stories about the respectful treatment of animals by Buddhists and Hindus, an alternative worldview was possible in theory. But the general reaction was of baffled contempt. Humans are superior, animals are inferior.
* '''Human uniqueness'''. One of the pillars of the anthropocentric world view was the biblical view of human uniqueness. Humans are superior because humans have an immortal soul. There is an absolute and fixed barrier between humans and animals. This doctrine was reinforced by the philosophy of René Descartes (1630s onwards): animals are machines and cannot feel pain.
[[File:William Hogarth 048.jpg|thumb|right|Children with cat and cage-bird, 1742. The bird is probably a [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]].]]
* '''Influence of botanists and zoologists'''. The rise of [[natural history]] helped to undermine this anthropocentric view. Anthropocentric classifications such as edible-inedible, useful-useless animals were gradually being replaced by more objective classifications based on neutral observational criteria. That was real progress because old classifications were highly arbitrary and had harmful effects on wild animals. Gamekeepers slaughtered innocent [[Eurasian jay|jays]] and [[woodpecker]]s. Gardeners destroyed worms. The [[wren]] and the [[squirrel]] were ritually hunted at Christmas. On the other hand, in some parts of England the [[European robin|robin]] and [[swallow]] were more or less sacred and treated with respect. The naturalists of the 17th century were beginning to study plants and animals for their own sake, independent of their utility or meaning for man.
* '''Pets narrowing the gap'''. In the 16th and 17th centuries pets had established themselves in the English households for company, especially in towns. Not only dogs and cats, but also pet [[monkey]]s, [[tortoise]]s, [[otter]]s, rabbits, [[squirrel]]s and songbirds such as [[domestic canary|canaries]],&lt;ref&gt;Canaries had been imported annually by the thousand since the mid-16th century (p. 111).&lt;/ref&gt; [[nightingale]]s, [[European goldfinch|goldfinches]], [[lark]]s, [[linnet]]s, parrots, [[magpie]]s and [[jackdaw]]s. In the 18th century pets were given human names, and were never eaten. Observation of pets provided support for the view that pets could be intelligent, sensitive, responsive and almost every other human quality. All this helped to break down the absolute gap between animals and humans.
* '''Cruelty to animals'''. Cruelty to animals (bull-baiting, cockfighting, mistreatment of donkeys, horses) was almost universal in England before 1700. However, attitudes to cruelty were changing. Already theologian [[John Calvin]], still firmly within the anthropocentric tradition, remembered that animals, like men, were part of God's creation, and were created for Man's sake, but we should handle them gently. From the 1740s onwards, there was a growing stream of writings by philosophers, scientists, and poets attacking cruelty, culminating in the foundation of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA) in 1824. Man was fully entitled to domesticate animals and to kill them for food and clothing, but to cause unnecessary suffering was morally wrong. This was a significant change. However, the question remained: Which animals? What is 'unnecessary' suffering?  [[Quaker]]s forbid hunting for sport altogether. Philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote in 1789: the question is not 'Can they ''reason''?' nor 'Can they ''talk''?' but 'Can they ''suffer''?'.
* '''Influence of astronomers and geologists'''. Unexpectedly, astronomers and geologists too had a profound effect on changing attitudes, just like botanists and zoologists did earlier. As astronomers revealed that the earth was not the centre of the universe, it became increasingly hard to maintain that the universe was exclusively created for humans. Geologists discovered that the earth must have existed 'some 70.000 years' &lt;!--168--&gt;before the appearance of man. So, what was the point of an Earth without Man? If the universe and the earth were not specially created for humans, why would animals and plants be specially created for man?
* '''Attitudes to trees and flowers'''. Initially, the forest had been seen as wild and hostile, providing shelter for dangerous wild beasts and a refuge for outlaws. It was believed that the first human beings were 'woodland men', ''homines sylvestres''. The progress of mankind was from the forest to the field. This resulted in large-scale forest clearance. Woodlands became a resource for shipbuilding. Between 1500 and 1700 the number of trees was substantially reduced. Later forests became 'romantic', they added beauty and dignity to the scene. Private landowners planted some 50,000,000 timber trees between 1760 and 1835. New exotic species were imported.&lt;ref&gt;In the 16th century 89 new species of trees and shrubs came into England, 131 in the 17th, 445 in the 18th, 699 in the first 30 years of the 19th century (p. 211). Examples: [[Cedrus libani|Lebanon cedar]], false [[acacia]], [[horse chestnut]], [[Tilia|lime]], [[Lombardy poplar]], [[Weymouth pine]], [[Laburnum]], [[Philadelphus]], [[Syringa|Lilac]], [[Hydrangea]], [[Buddleia]] and [[Rhododendron]].&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers were grown not because they were medicinally useful or symbolically meaningful, but because they were aesthetically pleasing. Flowers were imported from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;In 1500 there were perhaps 200 kinds of cultivated plant in England. In 1839 the figure was 18,000 (p. 226). Examples: [[tulip]]s, [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]]s, [[anemone]]s, [[crocus]]es, [[lupin]]s, [[phlox]], [[dahlia]]s, [[fuchsia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Attitudes to nature'''. Mountains are a good example of changing attitudes to nature. In the mid-17th century mountains were hated as barren 'deformities', 'monstrous excrescences', 'rubbish of the earth', useless, unproductive and dangerous for men. Then theologians remembered that all God's works served a purpose, and that the purpose of mountains was supplying rivers with water and offering a home for goats. A century later mountains became objects of the highest aesthetic admiration. It was forgotten that mountains are agriculturally unproductive.
* '''Vegetarianism'''. The argument against cruelty to animals was carried one step further. Once it was accepted that domesticated animals should be treated with kindness, it seemed increasingly repugnant to kill them for food. Furthermore, the anthropocentric view that animals were made for man became a minority view, and biblical arguments became unconvincing in a secular world. Non-religious arguments were put forward: the slaughter of animals has a brutalising effect upon the human character, because it makes men cruel and ferocious; the consumption of meat is bad for human health because it is physiological unnatural; it inflicts untold suffering upon man's fellow-creatures; stock-breeding is a wasteful form of agriculture compared with arable farming, because crops produce far more food per acre. Despite all these arguments for vegetarianism, England did not become a vegetarian nation.&lt;ref&gt;In 1847 the [[Vegetarian Society|Vegetarian Society of Great Britain]] was founded, but 50 years later its membership was still only 5,000 (p. 297).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, pigs, calves, hares and rabbits were no longer served at dinner with their heads attached, concealing the true origin of meat, and slaughterhouses were concealed from public view.
* '''Conclusion'''. The conflict between new attitudes to nature and the realities of society, with its growing cities and growing population, was not resolved.&lt;blockquote&gt;"A mixture of compromise and concealment has so far prevented this conflict from having to be fully resolved. It is one of the contradictions upon which modern civilization may be said to rest. About its ultimate consequences we can only speculate.".&lt;ref&gt;p. 303. These are the closing lines of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15504">The term '''middlebrow''' describes easily accessible [[art]], usually [[literature]], and the people who use the arts to acquire culture and "class" ([[Reputation|social prestige]]). First used in the British satire magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1925, the term ''middlebrow'' is the intermediary "brow" descriptor between ''[[highbrow]]'' and ''[[Low culture|lowbrow]]'', which are terms derived from the pseudo-science of [[phrenology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Middlebrow |work=Oxford English Dictionary |date=23 February 2008 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00309091?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=middlebrow&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term middlebrow became a pejorative usage in the [[Modernism|modernist]] cultural criticism, by [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Russell Lynes]], which served the cause of the marginalization of the popular culture in favor of [[high culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Pask, K. ''The Fairy Way of Writing'' (2013) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, the middlebrow is classed as a forced and ineffective attempt at cultural and intellectual achievement, and as characterizing literature that emphasizes emotional and sentimental connections, rather than intellectual quality and literary innovation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/10/12/middlebrow_origins_and_insults.html |title=Is "Middlebrow" Still An Insult? |work=Slate |date=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[postmodernism]] more readily perceives the advantages of the middlebrow cultural-position that is aware of high culture, but is able to balance aesthetic claims with the claims of the everyday world.&lt;ref&gt;David Cardiff, ''Mass Middlebrow Laughter' ''Media, Culture and Society'' 10 (1988), 41-60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virginia Woolf ==
[[Virginia Woolf]] derided the middlebrow in an un-posted letter to the editor of the ''New Statesman &amp; Nation'', concerning a radio broadcast that attacked the Highbrows.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (1996) p. 634&lt;/ref&gt; That letter was posthumously published in the essay collection ''[[The Death of the Moth]]'' (1942).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woolf |first=Virginia |chapter=Middlebrow |title=The Death of the Moth, and Other Essays |location=London |publisher=Hogarth Press |year=1942 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hilobrow.com/2009/03/04/woolf-contra-middlebrow/|title=Woolf contra Middlebrow – HiLobrow|website=hilobrow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woolf criticizes middlebrows as petty purveyors of highbrow cultures for their own shallow benefit. Rather than selecting books for their intrinsic cultural value, middlebrow people select and read what they are told is best. Middlebrows are concerned with ''how'' what they do makes them appear, unlike highbrows, the avant-garde men and women who act according to their indelible commitment to [[beauty]], [[value (ethics)|value]], [[art]], form, and [[integrity]]. Woolf said that, "We highbrows read what we like and do what we like and praise what we like". Likewise, a lowbrow is devoted to a singular interest, a  person "of thoroughbred vitality who rides his body in pursuit of a living at a gallop across life"; and, therefore, the lowbrow are equally worthy of reverence, as they, too, are living for what they intrinsically know as valuable.

Instead of such freedom, the middlebrows are "betwixt and between", which Woolf classifies as "in pursuit of no single object, neither Art itself nor life itself, but both mixed indistinguishably, and rather nastily, with money, fame, power, or prestige." Their value system rewards quick gains through literature already designated as 'Classic' and 'Great', never of their own choosing, because "to buy living art requires living taste." The middlebrow are meretricious—which is much less demanding than [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

== Russell Lynes: "Highbrow, Lowbrow, Middlebrow" ==
''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' editor [[Russell Lynes]] satirized Virginia Woolf's highbrow scorn in the article "Highbrow, Lowbrow, Middlebrow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lynes |first=Russell |title=The Tastemakers |location=New York |publisher=Harper |year=1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting her and other highbrow proponents, such as art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], Lynes parodied the highbrow's pompous superiority by noting how the subtle distinctions Woolf found significant among the "brows" were just means of upholding cultural superiority. Specifically, he parodies the highbrow claim that the products a person uses distinguishes his or her level of cultural worth, by satirically identifying the products that would identify a middlebrow person.

Lynes continued distinguishing among "brows", dividing middlebrow into upper-middlebrow and lower-middlebrow. The upper-middlebrow's arts patronage makes highbrow activity possible. Museums, orchestras, operas, and publishing houses are run by upper-middlebrows. The lower middlebrows attempt using the arts for self-enhancement: "hell-bent on improving their minds as well as their fortunes". They also intend to live the simple, easy life outlined in advertisements; "lower middlebrow-ism" was "a world that smells of soap". Caricaturing Woolf, Lynes outlined the perfect world without middlebrows; lowbrows work and highbrows create pure art.

Months later, ''Life'' magazine asked Lynes to specifically distinguish among the right foods, furniture, clothes, and arts for each of the four 'brows'. That began national preoccupation, as people tried to identify their proper social class, based upon their favorite things. Although ''middlebrow'' often has connoted contempt, Lynes lauded the zeal and aspirations of the middlebrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubin |first=Joan Shelley |title=The Making of Middlebrow Culture |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1992 |isbn=0807820105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priestley's defence==
[[J. B. Priestley]] sought to create a positive cultural space around the concept of middlebrow &amp;ndash; one characterised by earnestness, friendliness and ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;B. Driscoll, ''The New literary Middlebrow'' (2014) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; He couched his defense of the middlebrow in terms of radio stations, praising the [[BBC Home Service]] for its cosiness and plainness, midway between the [[Light Programme]] and the [[Third Programme]]: "Between the raucous lowbrows and the lisping highbrows is a fine gap, meant for the middle or broadbrows...our homely fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Richard Hoggart]], ''The Uses of Literacy'' (1957) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In a struggle that involved competition for readers as well as for cultural capital, Virginia Woolf responded by renaming the BBC the "Betwixt and Between Company".&lt;ref&gt;M. Cuddy-Keane, ''Virginia Woolf, the Intellectual, and the Public Sphere'' (2014) p. 21-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dwight Macdonald: "Masscult and Midcult"==
[[Dwight Macdonald]]'s critique of middlebrow culture, "Masscult and Midcult" (1960), associated the modern industrial drive, away from specialization and the folk, with creating a mass-market arts, and, therefore, anonymous consumers of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macdonald |first=Dwight |chapter=Masscult and Midcult |title=Essays Against the American Grain |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., highbrow culture is associated with specialization for the connoisseurs, while lowbrow culture entails authentic folk products made for specific communities. Mass culture (masscult) copies and manipulates both traditions, with factory-created products, made without innovation or care, expressly for the market, "to please the crowd by any means", thereby creating an American society in which "a pluralistic culture cannot exist", wherein the rule is cultural homogeneity.

In contrast Midcult (middle culture), came about with middlebrow culture, and dangerously copies and adulterates high culture, by way of "a tepid ooze of Midcult", which threatens high culture, with dramaturgy, literature, and architecture, such as ''[[Our Town]]'' (1938), ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' (1952), and [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|American collegiate gothic architecture]].

The Middlebrow "pretends to respect the standards of High Culture, while, in fact, it waters them down and vulgarizes them." Macdonald recommended a separation of the brows, so that "the few who care about good writing, painting, music, architecture, philosophy, etc. have their High Culture, and don't fuzz up the distinction with the Midcult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collected|title=The Oprah Affect: Critical Essays on Oprah's Book Club|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fisVBiAYCAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=oprah+winfrey+book+club+middlebrow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R1mzZA8aBr&amp;sig=54AusU_yUzMbuGFCBad494UJDX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0EIoU4KWLtOP0gHcnYGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=oprah%20winfrey%20book%20club%20middlebrow&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketed middlebrow==
The [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Oprah's Book Club|Book Club]] have been widely characterized as middlebrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Hillary|title=We Don't Need Oprah's Book Club | url=https://newrepublic.com/article/88941/oprah-winfrey-book-club-dickens-karenina |publisher=[[The New Republic]] | date = May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; marketed to bring classics and 'highbrow' literature to the middle class. This was particularly highlighted when author [[Jonathan Franzen]], after his book ''[[The Corrections]]'' was selected, remarked in several publications that some of Oprah's book club picks were middlebrow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosman|first=Julie|title=Oprah Picks Franzen for Final Book Club|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/oprah-picks-franzen-for-final-book-club/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her seminal account of the Book-of-the-Month Club (as it was from its inception in 1926 to the 1980s before it transformed to a purely commercial operation), ''A Feeling for Books'', Janice Radway argues that middlebrow culture is not simply a diluted impersonation of highbrow, but instead distinctly defined itself in defiance of avant-garde high culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radway|first=Janice|title=A Feeling for Books: The Book-Of-The-Month Club, Literary Taste, and Middle-Class Desire|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/426514.A_Feeling_for_Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club provided subscribers with literature selected by expert and 'generalist' judges, but held the personal, emotional experience of reading a good book as paramount, while simultaneously maintaining 'high standards' for literary quality. In this way, the club was in opposition to the general criticism of middlebrow culture in that it is forced high culture. Instead, Radway demonstrates that the middlebrow culture allows readers to simultaneously access the emotional and intellectual challenges that good reading provides. Radway also identifies the conflicting gender messages sent by the selections. While the club was marketed extensively to the female reader, including its emphasis on the emotional pleasure of books, the focus on intellectual, academic literature of the middlebrow trapped the reader into the constrictive masculine standards of value, classifying 'great books' as those that fell in line with male, technical classifications of excellence.

==Contemporary middlebrow==
''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'' suggests that the late 2000s and early 2010s could potentially be considered the "golden age of middlebrow art"—pointing to television shows ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'' and novels ''[[Freedom (Jonathan Franzen novel)|Freedom]]'', ''[[The Marriage Plot]]'' and ''[[A Visit from the Goon Squad]]''. ''Slate'' also defines the films of [[Aaron Sorkin]] as middlebrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_completist/2012/06/the_complete_works_of_aaron_sorkin_from_the_west_wing_to_the_social_network_to_the_newsroom_.html |title=You Can't Handle the Truth About Aaron Sorkin |work=Slate |date=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that ''Slate'' itself is middlebrow journalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://declineofgenius.com/media/has-slate-declined-31082010/ Has Slate Declined?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105023911/http://declineofgenius.com/media/has-slate-declined-31082010/ |date=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2012 article for ''[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]'', Peodair Leihy described the work of poet and songwriter [[Leonard Cohen]] as "a kind of pop—upper-middle-brow to lower-high-brow, to be sure, but pop nonetheless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/1086/features/old-new-leonard/ |title=Old-New Leonard |work=Jewish Ideas Daily |date=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aesthetic was further theorized in an essay from November that year for ''[[The American Scholar]]'' that saw [[William Deresiewicz]] propose the addition of "upper middle brow," a culture falling between masscult and midcult. He defined it as, "infinitely subtler than Midcult. It is post- rather than pre-ironic, its sentimentality hidden by a veil of cool. It is edgy, clever, knowing, stylish, and formally inventive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamericanscholar.org/upper-middle-brow/|title=Upper Middle Brow|first=William|last=Deresiewicz|date=4 November 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Macy Halford characterizes ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and ''The New Yorker'' itself as "often [being] viewed as prime examples of the middlebrow: both magazines are devoted to the high but also to making it accessible to many; to bringing ideas that might remain trapped in ivory towers and academic books, or in high-art (or film or theatre) scenes, into the pages of a relatively inexpensive periodical that can be bought at bookstores and newsstands across the country (and now on the Internet)." She also notes the internet's effect on the middlebrow debate: "[[Internet]] is forcing us to rethink (again) what "middlebrow" means: in an era when the highest is as accessible as the lowest—accessible in the sense that both are only a click away ... —we actually have to think anew about how to walk that middle line." Halford describes [[Wikipedia]]: "...Wiki is itself a kind of middlebrow product" and links to this middlebrow entry "because it actually provides a smart summary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halford|first=Macy|title=On "Middlebrow"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/02/on-middlebrow.html}}''The New Yorker''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miriam Daly''' (1928 – 26 June 1980) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Irish republicanism|republican]] activist and university lecturer who was assassinated by the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA).

==Background and personal life==
She was born in the [[Curragh]] [[Irish Army]] camp, [[County Kildare]], [[Ireland]]. She grew up in Hatch Street, [[Dublin]], attending Loreto College on St Stephen's Green and then [[University College, Dublin]], graduating in history. The economic historian George O'Brien&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/o/OBrien_G1/life.htm&lt;/ref&gt; supervised her MPhil in economic history, on [[Irish emigration to England]]. She went on to teach [[economic history]] in UCD for some years before moving to [[Southampton University]] with her husband, Joseph Lee. Two years after her first husband died, she remarried, to James Daly, returning to Ireland with him in 1968. They both were appointed lecturers in [[Queen's University, Belfast]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Civil Rights activist ==
She soon became an activist in the civil rights movement, particularly following the introduction of [[internment]] without trial by the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Stormont government]]. She was active in the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] and the [[Northern Resistance Movement]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

She was a militant member of the [[Prisoners' Relatives Action Committee]], and the national [[Hunger Strike]] Committee. &lt;!-- She was a founder member of the [[Murray Defence Committee]] to save the Murrays from the death sentence in Dublin. QUESTION: Who are the Murrays? Death sentence in Dublin in what year?? --&gt;In that campaign, she worked with [[Seamus Costello]], and soon joined him in the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://irsm.org/statements/irsp/current/030603.html Unveiling of Memorial for Miriam Daly] 3 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; After Costello was assassinated, she became chairperson, leading the party for two years. During this time she and her husband James were instrumental in opposing [[Sinn Féin]]'s drift towards [[federalism]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Death==
On 26 June 1980&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irsm.org/fallen/daly/ IRSM Roll of Honour]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=26&amp;month=06&amp;year=1980 Sutton Index of Deaths: 26 June 1980], CAIN&lt;/ref&gt; Daly was shot dead at home, in the [[Andersonstown]] area of west [[Belfast]]. At the time of her assassination, she was in charge of the IRSP prisoners' welfare.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

According to reports in ''[[The Irish Times]]'', members of the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) had gained entry to her home with the intention of killing her husband, who was also a republican activist.&lt;ref name="lost"&gt;David McKittrick et al, ''Lost Lives'', Mainstream Publishing, 208, p. 830&lt;/ref&gt; Daly was captured and tied up whilst they waited for him to return home.  However, he was in Dublin at the time and so did not arrive.&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt; After a considerable time, the UDA men decided to kill Daly instead.  Muffling the sound of the gun with a cushion, they shot her in the head and cut the phone lines before fleeing. Her body was discovered when her ten-year-old daughter arrived home from school.&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt;

Daly was buried in [[Swords, County Dublin]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Mourners at her funeral, which featured the firing of a volley of shots over her coffin, included [[Seán Mac Stíofáin]] and [[Ruairí Ó Brádaigh]].&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt; She is included as a [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteer]] on the INLA monument in [[Milltown Cemetery]]&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt; and is one of several commemorated by an IRSP mural on the [[Springfield Road, Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/mni/id/2759/rec/5 Murals of Northern Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nell Irvin Painter''' (born '''Nell Elizabeth Irvin'''; August 2, 1942) is an American [[historian]] notable for her works on southern history of the nineteenth century.

==Biography==
She was born Nell Irvin to Dona and Frank E. Irvin, Sr. She had an older brother Frank who died young. Her family moved from [[Houston, Texas]], to [[Oakland, California]] when she was ten weeks old.&lt;ref name=FrankBio&gt;{{cite web |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2010-07-05 |title=Frank E. Irvin, Sr. (autobiography) |author=Frank E. Irvin, Sr. |date=December 27, 2004 |url=http://www.nellpainter.com/assests/pdfs/frank2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the second wave of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of millions of African Americans from the [[Deep South]] to urban centers. Some of their relatives had been in California since the 1920s. The Irvins went to California in the 1940s with the pull of increasing jobs in the defense industry. Nell attended the [[Oakland Unified School District|Oakland Public Schools]], including [[Oakland Technical High School]], from which she graduated in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Oral History With Williams (Bil) Banks|url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/roho/ucb/text/banks_bil.pdf|website=The Bancroft Library, University of California at Berkeley|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nell Irvin Painter, Class of 1959|url=http://oaklandtech.com/staff/centennial/2015/03/30/nell-irvin-painter-59/|website=School Historical Archive|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother Dona Irvin held a [[Academic degrees|degree]] from [[Houston College for Negroes]] (1937), and later taught in the public schools of Oakland.  Her father had to drop out of college in 1937 during the [[Great Depression]]; he eventually trained for work as a laboratory [[technician]].  He worked for years at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], where he trained many students in lab techniques.&lt;ref name=FrankBio/&gt;

Painter earned her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] - [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1964.  During her undergraduate years, she studied [[France in the Middle Ages|French medieval history]] at the [[University of Bordeaux]], [[France]], 1962–63.

'''Non-Referential Architecture''' is the architecture of the 21st century. It is distinct of the [[architecture]] of [[postmodernity]] in as much as Non-Referential Architecture is a response to a non-referential world. Non-Referential Architecture is liberated of a vocabulary of fixed semantic images, symbols, and historical connotations. Buildings of Non-Referential Architecture are based upon themselves – they are based on architecture-inherent qualities such as architectural space and form and the experience of space they cause in the inhabitants and visitors. Buildings of Non-Referential Architecture are distinctly different from their precursors of modernism and postmodernism because they are not the outcome of extra-architectural concepts and ideas, such as importations and thematizations, for example, taken from the realms of the economic, the ecological, or the political. 

In the book Non-Referential Architecture, Swiss [[architect]] [[Valerio Olgiati]] and USA-based Swiss [[architectural theoretician]] [[Markus Breitschmid]] write: "Non-referential architecture is not an architecture that subsists as a referential vessel or as a symbol of something outside itself. Non-referential buildings are entities that are themselves meaningful and sense-making and, as such, no less the embodiment of society than buildings were in the past when they were the bearers of common social ideals."&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati. Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Referential Architecture is a response to a contemporary societal current that increasingly rejects ideologies of any kind, political and otherwise. While ideologies were the innovation of [[modernity]] and [[postmodernity]], the non-referential world is increasingly devoid of ideologies or it rejects to order the world in ideological ways. Valerio Olgiati has worked on the possibilities of a Non-Referential Architecture for years. The first documented use of the term Non-Referential in architecture appears in a reprint of an interview between Olgiati and Breitschmid in the Italian architecture journal Domus.&lt;ref&gt;Valerio Olgiati [in an interview with Markus Breitschmid], “Sulla non referezialita” in: Domus No. 974, Milano: 13/2013, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Breitschmid publishes a rebuttal titled "Architektur leitet sich von Architektur ab" (Architecture is Derived from Architecture) in the Swiss journal Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, thereby responding to an architectural claim made by others that attempts to imbue meaning into architecture from the extra-architectural, such as the economic, ecological, political. &lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. “Architektur leitet sich von Architektur ab” in: Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, Zurich: 9/2014, 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Architect [[Christian Kerez]] investigated the limits of referentiality and speaks of "non-referential space" as a quality of his contribution for the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archdaily.com/867558/columbia-gsapp-conversations-4-wonder-structure-christian-kerez-contemporary-swiss-architecture&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, architect [[Peter Eisenman]] points out that architecture has been moving toward a “non-referential ‘objectivity’” for some time, in as much as architectural form is increasingly reduced “to a pure reality.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pantagruelista.com/blogeng/architecture-fiction-eisenman&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2018, Olgiati and Breitschmid published the architectural treatise Non-Referential Architecture, a book that has been in the making since 2013. It analyses the societal currents of the early 21st century and argues that those currents are radically different from the epoch of postmodernity.&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The book proposes a new framework for architecture and defines the seven underlying principles for Non-Referential Architecture:&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
1) Experience of Space; 
2) Oneness; 
3) Newness; 
4) Construction; 
5) Contradiction; 
6) Order; 
7) Sensemaking.

One of the hallmarks of Non-Referential Architecture is that each building exists for itself. Each building is governed by an architectural idea – and that idea has to be form-generative and sense-making.&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, pp. 13-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Referential Architecture states: "Non-referential architecture denotes but it refuses to explain or narrate, and it leaves behind any vestiges of a theatrical mode of persuasion and propagation."&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the intent of the exhibition ‘Inscriptions: Architecture before Speech’, held at [[Harvard University]]’s [[Graduate School of Design]] in 2018, [[K. Michael Hays]] argues that today’s architecture presupposes “not a particular meaning, but a specific kind of potentiality — a non-semantic materiality, a non-referential construct that can be developed into an actual architectural project.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.designboom.com/architecture/harvard-gsd-inscriptions-exhibition-03-01-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation SUPPORT''' is the name given to [[Canadian Forces]] activities directly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] of September 11, 2001. The CF had two immediate goals: to provide support for stranded aircrew and passengers from diverted commercial flights, and to increase emergency preparedness. [[Transport Canada]] called their operation [[Operation Yellow Ribbon|Yellow Ribbon]].

Stranded travellers were received at several CF bases and stations, including [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay]], [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] and [[Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Shearwater, Nova Scotia|Shearwater]] and [[Aldershot, Nova Scotia]]. Also, CF units in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] region provided thousands of beds and ration packs; nine CF transport aircraft delivered about 8,800 [[Camp bed|cot]]s, 8,300 blankets and 55 support personnel to places where commercial flights had been diverted. CF aircraft also transported [[Canada Customs and Revenue Agency]] officials to those locations so stranded travellers could clear Customs and enter Canada — many of them to accept the hospitality of the communities in which they found themselves.

Several steps were taken to increase emergency preparedness. Additional [[CF-18]] fighters were assigned to [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]]. The [[Disaster Assistance Response Team]] (DART) was placed on stand-by at [[8 Wing Trenton]], [[Ontario]]. Also, HMC Ships [[HMCS Preserver (AOR 510)|''Preserver'']], [[HMCS Iroquois (DDH 280)|''Iroquois'']] and [[HMCS Ville de Québec (FFH 332)|''Ville de Québec'']] were put in a higher state of readiness in case they were required to go to a U.S. port to provide [[humanitarian]] assistance.

'''Phillip George Knightley''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (23 January 1929 – 7 December 2016) was an Australian journalist, critic, and non-fiction author. He became a visiting Professor of Journalism at the [[University of Lincoln]], England, and was a media commentator on the [[intelligence services]] and propaganda.

==Biography==

Born in Sydney, he began his career in 1946 as a copyboy with the Sydney ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]''. Two years as a cadet reporter with ''[[The Northern Star]]'' ([[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]]) followed. He then temporarily left journalism to become a [[copra]] trader in Fiji before joining the ''[[Oceania Daily News]]'' ([[Suva]]), which prided itself as being the "First Paper Published in the World Today" because of Suva's proximity to the [[International Dateline]].

Knightley returned to Australia and worked for ''[[The Herald (Melbourne)|The Herald]]'' in Melbourne. He returned to Sydney in 1952 joining the city's ''[[The Daily Mirror (Australia)|Daily Mirror]]'' and covered [[Elizabeth II]]'s visit to Australia in 1953/54. He left for London in November 1954 as foreign correspondent for the ''Daily Mirror'', and then went to [[India]] as managing editor of the Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) literary magazine, ''[[Imprint (trade name)|Imprint]]''.

Migrating to the UK in 1965, he became a special correspondent for ''The [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' of London, remaining there until 1985. During this time he was a member of the 'Insight' investigative team.

After leaving ''The Sunday Times'', he contributed literary criticism to the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' (London), ''[[The Independent]]'' (London), ''[[The Australian]]'' 's Review of Books, ''[[The Age]]'' (Melbourne), and the ''[[New York Review of Books]]''.

He lectured on journalism, law, and war at the [[National Press Club (Australia)|Australian National Press Club]] in Canberra, the [[Australian Senate]], [[City University, London|City University]], London, [[University of Manchester]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[University of California Los Angeles]], [[Stanford University]], the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], the [[Inner Temple]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), and to the [[University of Düsseldorf]].

Knightley's main professional interests were war reporting, propaganda, and espionage. In more than 30 years of writing about espionage, he met most of the spy chiefs of all the major intelligence services in the world, and interviewed numerous officers and agents from all sides during the [[Cold War]] and since. In December 2010, he received media coverage for acting as a [[bail surety|bail sureties]] provider for [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]].&lt;ref name="WikiLeaks"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 17 December 2010
| publisher = BBC
| date=17 December 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having backed Assange by pledging bail in December 2010, Knightley lost the money in June 2012 when a judge ordered it to be forfeited, as Assange had sought to escape the jurisdiction of the [[English courts]] by entering the embassy of Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mail 4 September 2012 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198072/Julian-Assanges-high-profile-backers-set-lose-340-000-bail-money-remains-holed-Ecuador-Embassy.html#ixzz25XOfdk4R&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Knightley was a judge for Canada's [[Lionel Gelber Prize]], which honours the world's best book on international relations. He was the European representative on the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] and patron of the [[C. W. Bean Foundation]] in Canberra. He was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] in June 2005, for "services to journalism and as an author".

Knightley was married with two daughters, Aliya and Marisa, a son, Kim, and two granddaughters. He lived between London, Sydney and [[Goa]] in India. He died on 7 December 2016 at the age of 87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jack|first=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/07/phillip-knightley-obituary|title=Phillip Knightley obituary|work=The Guardian|date=7 December 2016|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postmodern philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that arose in the second half of the 20th century as a critical response to assumptions allegedly present in [[modern philosophy|modernist philosophical ideas]] regarding culture, identity, history, or language that were developed during the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duignan|first1=Brian|title=postmodernism (philosophy) (Encyclopædia Britannica)|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postmodern|title=Definition of POSTMODERN|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Postmodernist thinkers developed concepts like [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]], repetition, [[Trace (deconstruction)|trace]], and [[hyperreality]] to subvert "[[grand narratives]]," [[univocity of being]], and epistemic certainty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/postmodernism/|chapter=Postmodernism|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Aylesworth|first=Gary|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern philosophy questions the importance of power relationships, personalization, and [[discourse]] in the "construction" of truth and world views. Many postmodernists appear to deny that an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] reality exists, and appear to deny that there are objective moral values.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined philosophical postmodernism in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'', writing "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge|last=Lyotard|first=J.-F.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where what he means by [[metanarrative]] is something like a unified, complete, universal, and epistemically certain story about everything that is. Postmodernists reject metanarratives because they reject the concept of truth that metanarratives presuppose. Postmodernist philosophers in general argue that truth is always contingent on historical and social context rather than being absolute and universal and that truth is always partial and "at issue" rather than being complete and certain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Postmodern philosophy is often particularly skeptical about simple binary oppositions characteristic of [[structuralism]], emphasizing the problem of the philosopher cleanly distinguishing knowledge from ignorance, social progress from reversion, dominance from submission, good from bad, and presence from absence.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Stuart. ''Routledge Companion to Postmodernism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Victor and Charles Winquist. ''Encyclopedia of Postmodernism'' "Binary Opposition"&lt;/ref&gt; But, for the same reasons, postmodern philosophy should often be particularly skeptical about the complex spectral characteristics of things, emphasizing the problem of the philosopher again cleanly distinguishing concepts, for a concept must be understood in the context of its opposite, such as existence and nothingness, normality and abnormality, speech and writing, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques; Bass, Alan (2001). "7 :Freud and the Scene of Writing". Writing and Difference (New ed.). London: Routledge. p. 276. {{ISBN|0203991788}}. Retrieved 8 September 2017. The model of hieroglyphic writing assembles more strikingly—though we find it in every form of writing—the diversity of the modes and functions of signs in dreams. Every sign—verbal or otherwise—may be used at different levels, in configurations and functions which are never prescribed by its "essence," but emerge from a play of differences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern philosophy also has strong relations with the substantial literature of [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society. Vol. 23 (2–3). Sage, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristic claims ==
Many postmodern claims are a deliberate repudiation of certain 18th-century Enlightenment values. Such a postmodernist believes that there is no objective natural reality, and that logic and reason are mere conceptual constructs that are not universally valid. Two other characteristic postmodern practices are a denial that [[human nature]] exists, and a (sometimes moderate) skepticism toward claims that science and technology will change society for the better. Postmodernists also believe there are no objective moral values. Thus, postmodern philosophy suggests equality for all things. One's concept of good and another's concept of evil are to be equally correct, since good and evil are subjective. Since both good and evil are equally correct, a postmodernist then [[tolerate]]s both concepts, even if he or she disagrees with them subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, Maria and Carter, J. Adam, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/relativism/ Relativism]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Simon|title=[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|entry=Postmodernism|isbn=9780198610137|language=en|quote=In its poststructuralist aspects it includes a denial of... any fixed reality or truth or fact to be the object of enquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern writings often focus on [[deconstruction|deconstructing]] the role that power and ideology play in shaping discourse and belief. Postmodern philosophy shares [[ontology|ontological]] similarities with classical [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical]] and [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] belief systems, and shares political similarities with modern [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;

The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' states that "The assumption that there is no common denominator in 'nature' or 'truth' ... that guarantees the possibility of neutral or objective thought" is a key assumption of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Ermarth, Elizabeth Deeds. Postmodernism, 1998, doi:10.4324/9780415249126-N044-1. Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Taylor and Francis, https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/postmodernism/v-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] has characterized the belief that "social science research can never generate objective or trustworthy knowledge" as an example of a postmodernist belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council|first1=National Research|last2=Education|first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last3=Education|first3=Center for|last4=Research|first4=Committee on Scientific Principles for Education|title=Scientific Research in Education|date=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=9780309082914|pages=20, 25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s seminal 1979 ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' stated that its hypotheses "should not be accorded predictive value in relation to reality, but strategic value in relation to the questions raised". Lyotard's statement in 1984 that "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives" extends to incredulity toward science. [[Jacques Derrida]], who is generally identified as a postmodernist, stated that "every referent, all reality has the structure of a differential trace".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; [[Paul Feyerabend]], one of the most famous twentieth-century philosophers of science, is often classified as a postmodernist; Feyerabend held that modern science is no more justified than witchcraft, and has denounced the "tyranny" of "abstract concepts such as 'truth', 'reality', or 'objectivity', which narrow people's vision and ways of being in the world".&lt;ref name="sep feyerabend"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preston|first1=John|title=Paul Feyerabend|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/feyerabend/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 April 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Denis Charles|last2=Burbules|first2=Nicholas C.|title=Postpositivism and Educational Research|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847691227|page=1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidd|first1=Ian James|title=Was Feyerabend a Postmodernist?|journal=International Studies in the Philosophy of Science|date=21 December 2016|volume=30|issue=1|pages=55–68|doi=10.1080/02698595.2016.1240463|quote=This article asks whether the philosophy of Paul K.

Defenders of postmodernism state that many descriptions of postmodernism exaggerate its antipathy to science; for example, Feyerabend denied that he was "anti-science", accepted that some scientific ''theories'' are superior to other theories (even if science itself is not superior to other modes of inquiry), and attempted conventional medical treatments during his fight against cancer.&lt;ref name="sep feyerabend"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horgan|first1=John|authorlink1=John Horgan|title=Was Philosopher Paul Feyerabend Really Science's "Worst Enemy"?|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/was-philosopher-paul-feyerabend-really-science-s-worst-enemy/|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=[[Scientific American]] Cross-check (blog)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierre|first1=Elizabeth Adams St|title=Comment: "Science" Rejects Postmodernism|journal=Educational Researcher|date=July 2016|volume=31|issue=8|pages=25–27|doi=10.3102/0013189X031008025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitional issues ==
Philosopher [[John Deely]] has argued for the contentious claim that the label "postmodern" for thinkers such as [[Derrida]] ''et al.'' is ''premature''.  Insofar as the "so-called" postmoderns follow the thoroughly ''modern'' trend of [[idealism]], it is more an ''ultra''modernism than anything else. A postmodernism that lives up to its name, therefore, must no longer confine itself to the premodern preoccupation with "things" nor with the modern confinement to "ideas," but must come to terms with the way of signs embodied in the semiotic doctrines of such thinkers as the Portuguese philosopher [[John Poinsot]] and the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;John Deely, ''Four Ages of Understanding: The First Postmodern Survey of Philosophy from Ancient Times to the Turn of the Twenty-First Century'' (Toronto: U. of Toronto, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Writes Deely,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The epoch of Greek and Latin philosophy was based on ''being'' in a quite precise sense: the existence exercised by things independently of human apprehension and attitude. The much briefer epoch of modern philosophy based itself rather on the instruments of human knowing, but in a way that unnecessarily compromised being. As the 20th century ends, there is reason to believe that a new philosophical epoch is dawning along with the new century, promising to be the richest epoch yet for human understanding. The postmodern era is positioned to synthesize at a higher level—the level of experience, where the being of things and the activity of the finite knower compenetrate one another and provide the materials whence can be derived knowledge of nature and knowledge of culture in their full symbiosis—the achievements of the ancients and the moderns in a way that gives full credit to the preoccupations of the two. The postmodern era has for its distinctive task in philosophy the exploration of a new path, no longer the ancient way of things nor the modern way of ideas, but the way of signs, whereby the peaks and valleys of ancient and modern thought alike can be surveyed and cultivated by a generation which has yet further peaks to climb and valleys to find.&lt;ref&gt;John Deely, "Philosophy and Experience," ''American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly'' LXVI.4 (Winter 1992), 299–319, esp. 314–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
===Precursors===
Postmodern philosophy originated primarily in France during the mid-20th century. However, several philosophical antecedents inform many of postmodern philosophy's concerns.

It was greatly influenced by the writings of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in the 19th century and other early-to-mid 20th-century philosophers, including [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[Roland Barthes]], [[Georges Bataille]], and the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Postmodern philosophy also drew from the world of the arts and architecture, particularly [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[John Cage]] and artists who practiced [[collage]], and the architecture of [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] and the [[Pompidou Centre]].

===Early postmodern philosophers===
The most influential early postmodern philosophers were [[Jean Baudrillard]],  [[Jean-François Lyotard]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].  [[Michel Foucault]] is also often cited as an early postmodernist although he personally rejected that label. Following Nietzsche, Foucault argued that knowledge is produced through the operations of ''power'', and changes fundamentally in different historical periods.

The writings of Lyotard were largely concerned with the role of narrative in human culture, and particularly how that role has changed as we have left modernity and entered a "postindustrial" or [[postmodernity|postmodern condition]].  He argued that modern philosophies legitimized their truth-claims not (as they themselves claimed) on logical or empirical grounds, but rather on the grounds of accepted stories (or "[[metanarratives]]") about knowledge and the world—comparing these with Wittgenstein's concept of [[language-game]]s.  He further argued that in our postmodern condition, these metanarratives no longer work to legitimize truth-claims.  He suggested that in the wake of the collapse of modern metanarratives, people are developing a new "language-game"—one that does not make claims to absolute truth but rather celebrates a world of ever-changing relationships (among people and between people and the world).

Derrida, the father of [[deconstruction]], practiced philosophy as a form of textual criticism.  He criticized Western philosophy as privileging the concept of presence and ''logos'', as opposed to absence and markings or writings.

In the United States, the most famous pragmatist and self-proclaimed postmodernist was [[Richard Rorty]].  An analytic philosopher, Rorty believed that combining [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction with [[Wilfrid Sellars]]'s critique of the "[[Myth of the Given]]" allowed for an abandonment of the view of the thought or language as a mirror of a reality or external world.  Further, drawing upon [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s criticism of the dualism between conceptual scheme and empirical content, he challenges the sense of questioning whether our particular concepts are related to the world in an appropriate way, whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways.  He argued that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of a social practice and language was what served our purposes in a particular time; ancient languages are sometimes untranslatable into modern ones because they possess a different vocabulary and are unuseful today.  Donald Davidson is not usually considered a postmodernist, although he and Rorty have both acknowledged that there are few differences between their philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~knobe/rorty.html|title=An interview with Rorty|author=|date=|website=unc.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, D., 1986, "A Coherence Theory of Truth and Knowledge," Truth And Interpretation, Perspectives on the Philosophy of Donald Davidson, ed. Ernest LePore, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, afterwords.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Swedish Ballet''' is one of the oldest ballet companies in Europe. Based in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], [[Gustav III of Sweden|King Gustav III]] founded the [[ballet]] in 1773 as a part of his national cultural project in response to the French and Italian dominance in this field; he also founded the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] and the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]]. All of these were initially located in the old theatre of [[Bollhuset]]. The troupe was founded with the opening of the Royal Swedish Opera, which has served as its home since that time.

== History ==
In 1773, the cultural professions of acting, opera-singing and ballet-dancing in Sweden were all performed by foreign troupes. The first ballet performance was performed at the Swedish court when the French ballet troupe of [[Antoine de Beaulieu]] was hired at the court of [[Queen Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] in 1638, and the first Public ballet performance were performed by the foreign theatre troupes at the theatre of Bollhuset later the same century. The only exception had been the period of 1737–1753, when the first professional Swedish troupe of actors had performed at Bollhuset; during this period, ballets were performed by the first Swedish dancers in this troupe. The perhaps first ballet performed by professional native Swedish dancers was in the play ''Den afvundsiuke'' ("The Envious") by [[Olof von Dahlin]] in August 1738. However, no names are known about these first dancers. They were probably educated by Jean Marquard as dancing-master, and one of the dancers were also French, Gabriel Senac. In 1753, however, the first Swedish ballet, theatre and opera at Bollhuset were dissolved.    
[[File:Ringaren i Notre-Dame ballet 2009.jpg|thumb|Nadja Sellrup as Esmeralda in "Ringaren i Notre-Dame" ("[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]"), a 2009 ballet at the Royal Swedish Opera.]]
Gustav III wanted to create and educate native talents in these professions. To accomplish this, he used the same method in the ballet as he was to use with the theatre; by having the first generation of native dancers educated by foreign professionals. When he fired the French theatre-company to create his national-stage in 1773, he kept many of the French dancers of this troupe. Dancers from [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Belgium]], such as [[Antoine Bournonville]], [[Louis Gallodier]], [[Giovanna Bassi]] and [[Julie Alix de la Fay]] were hired to perform and to educate Swedish students. Most of the first students to the troupe were taken among children to the staff at the royal court and to professional musicians, as were the first students to the theatre and the opera. In the first ballet-troupe in the national stage of 1773, they were very few native talents with former professional experience; one of them was [[Charlotte Slottsberg]], who could be counted as the first native Swedish ballerina known by name. The greatest triumph of the Swedish ballet during the 18th century is considered to be the Ballet performed by Gallodier to the Opera ''Gustav Adolf och Ebba Brahe'' (Gustav Adolf and Ebba Brahe) (1786); also the Ballet ''Fiskarna'' (The Fishes) by Antoine Bournonville (1789) became a great success. 

The Ballet was from the beginning closely linked to the Opera; ballets were a part of the performances of the Opera, and the dancers were also active on the Royal Dramatic Theatre. When the Royal Swedish Opera were closed down between 1806 and 1809–1812, the Ballet was not closed, only moved over to the theatre. 

During the 19th century, new ballets were made all the time, and older ones seldom performed; ''En komisk balett'' (A comic Ballet) by [[Louis Deland]] was given 127 times between 1796 and 1809, followed by [[La Fille Mal Gardée]], given 54 times in 1812–1842. [[August Bournonville]] was active as a guest Ballet master 1839, 1847, 1857, 1858 and 1861–1864, and his favorite Swedish ballerinas [[Charlotta Norberg]] and Johanna Sundberg educated students in his techniques. The Ballet is considered to have been in a state of decay during the end of the 19th century; after the dismissal of [[Anders Selinder]] and [[Sophie Daguin]] in 1856, the Ballet was used more as a supplement to the opera and not as an independent artform, and Sigurd Lund, a student of Bournonville, was not independent enough to prevent this. It was not until 1913, that the Ballet returned to a more independent form.        

The ''[[Kungliga Hovkapellet]]'' (Royal Swedish Orchestra), the orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera, is the performing partner for the Royal Swedish Ballet.

Nicolas LeRiche is the director of the Royal Swedish Ballet.
[[Birgitta Svendén]] is the general director of the Royal Swedish Opera. The members of Operans Balettklubb&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dansportalen.se/111/balettklubben.html Operans Balettklubb]&lt;/ref&gt; are supporters of the Royal Swedish Ballet.

'''Sociocultural evolution''', '''sociocultural evolutionism''' or '''cultural evolution''' are theories of cultural and [[social evolution]] that describe how [[culture]]s and [[Society|societies]] change over time. Whereas '''sociocultural development''' traces processes that tend to increase the [[complexity]] of a society or culture, sociocultural evolution also considers process that can lead to decreases in complexity ([[degeneration]]) or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity ([[cladogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="World Religions and Social Evolution of the Old World Oikumene Civilizations: A Cross-cultural Perspective" /&gt; Sociocultural evolution is "the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches to socioculture aimed to provide models for the evolution of [[humankind]] as a whole, arguing that different societies have reached different stages of [[social development]]. The most comprehensive attempt to develop a general theory of social evolution centering on the development of sociocultural systems, the work of [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979), operated on a scale which included a theory of [[world history]]. Another attempt, on a less systematic scale, originated with the [[World-systems theory|world-systems]] approach from the 1970s.
 
More recent approaches focus on changes specific to individual societies and reject the idea that cultures differ primarily according to how far each one is on some linear scale of [[social progress]]. Most modern [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] work within the frameworks of [[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], and [[modernization theory]].

Many different societies have existed in the course of human history, with estimates as high as a total of over one million separate societies; however, {{as of | 2013 | lc = on}}, the number of current, distinct societies had been estimated as only about two hundred.&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=103"&gt;

== Introduction ==

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]] often assume that human beings have [[nature|natural]] [[Social animal|social tendencies]] and that particular human [[social behaviour]]s have non-[[Genetics|genetic]] causes and dynamics (i.e. people learn them in a [[social environment]] and through [[social interaction]]). Societies exist in complex social environments (i.e. with natural resources and constraints) and [[Adaptation|adapt]] themselves to these environments. It is thus inevitable that all societies change.

Specific theories of social or cultural evolution often attempt to explain differences between [[wikt:coeval|coeval]] societies by positing that different societies have reached different stages of development. Although such theories typically provide models for understanding the relationship between [[Technology|technologies]], [[social structure]] or the values of a society, they vary as to the extent to which they describe specific mechanisms of variation and change.

Early sociocultural evolution theories{{spaced ndash}}the ideas of [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903) and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881) {{spaced ndash}}developed simultaneously with, but independently of, [[Charles Darwin]]'s works and were popular from the late 19th century to the end of [[World War I]]. These 19th-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a ''primitive'' state and gradually become more ''civilized'' over time; they equated the culture and technology of [[Western civilization]] with [[social progress|progress]]. Some forms of early sociocultural evolution theories (mainly unilineal ones) have led to much-criticised theories like [[social Darwinism]] and [[scientific racism]], sometimes used in the past{{by whom|date=October 2017}} to justify existing policies of [[colonialism]] and [[slavery]] and to justify new policies such as [[eugenics]].

Most 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a single entity. However, most 20th-century approaches, such as [[multilineal evolution]], focused on changes specific to individual societies. Moreover, they rejected directional change (i.e. [[orthogenetic]], [[teleological]] or progressive change). Most archaeologists work within the framework of multilineal evolution. Other contemporary approaches to social change include [[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], [[dual inheritance theory]], [[modernisation theory]] and [[postindustrial]] theory.

In his seminal 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote that "there are some examples of cultural evolution in birds and monkeys, but&amp;nbsp;... it is our own species that really shows what cultural evolution can do".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stadial theory ==

Enlightenment and later thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages: in other words, they saw history as [[Stadial history|stadial]]. While expecting humankind to show increasing development, theorists looked for what determined the course of [[human history]]. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831), for example, saw  social development as an inevitable process.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} It was assumed that societies start out primitive, perhaps in a [[state of nature]], and could progress toward something resembling industrial Europe.

While earlier authors such as [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) had discussed how societies change through time, the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] of the 18th century proved key in the development of the idea of sociocultural evolution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In relation to Scotland's [[Act of Union 1707|union with England in 1707]], several{{quantify|date=July 2015}} Scottish thinkers pondered the relationship between progress and the affluence brought about by increased trade with England. They understood the changes Scotland was undergoing as involving transition from an agricultural to a [[mercantile]] society. In [[Conjectural history|"conjectural histories"]], authors such as [[Adam Ferguson]] (1723–1816), [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]] (1735–1801) and [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790) argued that societies all pass through a series of four stages: hunting and gathering, pastoralism and nomadism, agriculture, and finally a stage of [[commerce]].

[[File:Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857)]]

Philosophical concepts of [[Progress (history)|progress]], such as that of Hegel, developed as well during this period. In [[France]], authors such as [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] (1715–1771) and other [[philosophe]]s were influenced by the Scottish tradition. Later thinkers such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Comte de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825) developed these ideas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Auguste Comte (1798–1857) in particular presented a coherent view of social progress and a new discipline to study it: sociology.

These developments took place in a context of wider processes. The first process was colonialism. Although [[Imperialism|imperial powers]] settled most differences of opinion with their colonial subjects through force, increased awareness of non-Western peoples raised new questions for European scholars about the nature of society and of culture. Similarly, effective colonial [[Public administration|administration]] required some degree of understanding of other cultures. Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution allowed Europeans to organise their new knowledge in a way that reflected and justified their increasing political and economic domination of others: such systems saw colonised people as less evolved, and colonising people as more evolved. Modern civilization (understood as the Western civilization), appeared the result of steady progress from a state of barbarism, and such a notion was common to many thinkers of the Enlightenment, including [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778).

The second process was the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise of [[capitalism]], which together allowed and promoted continual revolutions in the [[means of production]]. Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution reflected a belief that the changes in Europe brought by the Industrial Revolution and capitalism were improvements. Industrialisation, combined with the intense political change brought about by the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and the [[U.S. Constitution]], which paved the way for the [[History of democracy|dominance of democracy]], forced European thinkers to reconsider some of their assumptions about how society was organised.

Eventually, in the 19th century three major classical theories of social and historical change emerged:

* sociocultural evolutionism
* the [[social cycle]] theory
* the [[Marxist]] theory of [[historical materialism]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="psz491"/&gt;--&gt;

These theories had a common factor: they all agreed that the history of humanity is pursuing a certain fixed path, most likely that of social progress.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=psz491/&gt;--&gt; Thus, each past event is not only chronologically, but causally tied to present and future events.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=psz491/&gt;--&gt; The theories postulated that by recreating the sequence of those events, sociology could discover the "laws" of history.&lt;ref name=psz491/&gt;

===Sociocultural evolutionism and the idea of progress===
{{main article|Unilineal evolution}}
While sociocultural evolutionists agree that an evolution-like process leads to social progress, classical social evolutionists have developed many different theories, known as theories of unilineal evolution. Sociocultural evolutionism became the prevailing theory of early sociocultural anthropology and [[social commentary]], and is associated with scholars like [[Auguste Comte]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Benjamin Kidd]], [[L. T. Hobhouse]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Sociocultural evolutionism attempted to formalise social thinking along scientific lines, with the added influence from the biological theory of [[evolution]]. If organisms could develop over time according to discernible, deterministic laws, then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well. Human society was compared to a biological organism, and social science equivalents of concepts like  [[Genetic diversity|variation]], [[natural selection]], and [[inheritance]] were introduced as factors resulting in the progress of societies. The idea of progress led to that of a fixed "stages" through which human societies progress, usually numbering three{{spaced ndash}}savagery, barbarism, and civilization{{spaced ndash}}but sometimes many more. As early as the late 18th century, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794) listed ten stages, or "epochs", each advancing the rights of man and perfecting the human race. At that time, anthropology was rising as a new scientific discipline, separating from the traditional views of "primitive" cultures that was usually based on religious views.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[File:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Herbert Spencer]]]]

Classical social evolutionism is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte and of Herbert Spencer (coiner of the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]").&lt;ref name="psz495"/&gt; In many ways, Spencer's theory of "[[cosmic evolution]]" has much more in common with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of Charles Darwin. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as social evolutionism. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed{{spaced ndash}}and that progress was accomplished through competition{{spaced ndash}}he stressed that the individual rather than the [[Collectivism|collectivity]] is the [[unit of analysis]] that evolves; that, in other words, evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon. Nonetheless, the publication of Darwin's works{{which|date=July 2015}} proved a boon to the proponents of sociocultural evolution, who saw the ideas of biological evolution as an attractive explanation for many questions about the development of society.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent comparison between biological and social evolution see [https://www.academia.edu/36551094/On_Similarities_between_Biological_and_Social_Evolutionary_Mechanisms_Mathematical_Modeling Grinin, L., Markov, A., &amp; Korotayev, A. (2013). On similarities between biological and social evolutionary mechanisms: Mathematical modeling. Cliodynamics, 4(2).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Spencer and Comte view society as a kind of organism subject to the process of growth—from simplicity to complexity, from chaos to order, from generalisation to specialisation, from flexibility to organisation.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=psz495/&gt;--&gt; They agree that the process of societal growth can be divided into certain stages, have{{clarify|date=July 2015}} their beginning and eventual end, and that this growth is in fact social progress: each newer, more-evolved society is "better".&lt;!--&lt;ref name=psz495/&gt;--&gt; Thus [[progressivism]] became one of the basic ideas underlying the theory of sociocultural evolutionism.&lt;ref name=psz495/&gt;

Auguste Comte, known as "the father of sociology", formulated the [[law of three stages]]: human development progresses from the [[Theology|theological]] stage, in which nature was [[myth]]ically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings; through a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical stage]] in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them; until the final [[Positivism#Social Science|positive]] stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship.&lt;ref name="psz498-499"/&gt; This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and through increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://radicalacademy.com/adiphilpositivism.htm The Philosophy Of Positivism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310034130/http://radicalacademy.com/adiphilpositivism.htm |date=10 March 2005 }}". ''Adventures in Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; Comte saw the science-valuing society as the highest, most developed type of human organization.&lt;ref name=psz498-499/&gt;

Herbert Spencer, who argued against [[government intervention]] as he believed that society should evolve toward more individual freedom,&lt;ref name="fordham"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/spencer-darwin.html|publisher=fordham.edu|title= Modern History Sourcebook: Herbert Spencer: Social Darwinism, 1857 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; differentiated between two phases of development as regards societies' internal regulation:&lt;ref name=psz498-499/&gt; the "military" and "industrial" societies.&lt;ref name=psz498-499/&gt; The earlier (and more primitive) military society has the goal of conquest and defense, is [[Centralisation|centralised]], [[Autarky|economically self-sufficient]], [[Collective|collectivistic]], puts the good of a group over the good of an individual, uses compulsion, force and repression, and rewards loyalty, obedience and discipline.&lt;ref name=psz498-499/&gt; The industrial society, in contrast, has a goal of [[Manufacturing|production]] and [[trade]], is [[Decentralisation|decentralised]], interconnected with other societies via economic relations, works through voluntary cooperation and individual self-restraint, treats the good of individual as of the highest value, regulates the social life via voluntary relations; and values initiative, independence and innovation.&lt;ref name=psz498-499/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bolender.com/Dr.%20Ron/SOC4044%20Sociological%20Theory/Class%20Sessions/Sociological%20Theory/Spencer,%20Herbert/spencer,_herbert.htm Herbert Spencer]". ''Sociological Theorists Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition process from the military to industrial society is the outcome of steady evolutionary processes within the society.&lt;ref name=psz498-499/&gt;

Regardless of how scholars of Spencer interpret his relation to Darwin, Spencer became an incredibly popular figure in the 1870s, particularly in the [[United States]]. Authors such as [[Edward L. Youmans]], [[William Graham Sumner]], [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]], [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John W. Burgess]], [[Lester Frank Ward]], [[Lewis H. Morgan]] (1818–1881) and other thinkers of the [[gilded age]] all developed theories of social evolutionism as a result of their exposure to Spencer as well as to Darwin.

[[File:Morgan.jpg|thumb|[[Lewis H. Morgan]]]]

In his 1877 classic ''Ancient Societies'', Lewis H. Morgan, an anthropologist whose ideas have had much impact on sociology, differentiated between three eras: [[wiktionary:savagery|savagery]], [[barbarian|barbarism]] and [[civilization]], which are divided by technological inventions, like fire, [[bow (weapon)|bow]], [[pottery]] in the savage era, [[domestication of animals]], [[agriculture]], [[metalworking]] in the barbarian era and [[alphabet]] and [[writing]] in the civilization era.&lt;ref name="psz499-500"/&gt; Thus Morgan drew a link between social progress and [[technological progress]]. Morgan viewed technological progress as a force behind social progress, and held that any [[social change]]—in [[social institution]]s, organizations or ideologies—has its beginnings in technological change.&lt;ref name=psz499-500/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Lewis H.(1877) "[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/ch03.htm Chapter III: Ratio of Human Progress]". ''Ancient Society.''&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's theories were popularized by [[Friedrich Engels]], who based his famous work ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' on them.&lt;ref name=psz499-500/&gt; For Engels and other Marxists this theory was important, as it supported their conviction that materialistic factors—economic and technological—are decisive in shaping the fate of humanity.&lt;ref name=psz499-500/&gt;

Edward Burnett Tylor (1832–1917), a pioneer of anthropology, focused on the [[evolution of culture]] worldwide, noting that culture is an important part of every society and that it is also subject to a process of evolution. He believed that societies were at different stages of cultural development and that the purpose of anthropology was to reconstruct the evolution of culture, from primitive beginnings to the modern state.
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Edward Burnett Tylor]]]]

Anthropologists Sir E.B. Tylor in England and Lewis Henry Morgan in the United States worked with data from [[indigenous people]], who (they claimed) represented earlier stages of cultural evolution that gave insight into the process and progression of evolution of culture. Morgan would later{{when|date=July 2015}} have a significant influence on [[Karl Marx]] and on Friedrich Engels, who developed a theory of sociocultural evolution in which the internal contradictions in society generated a series of escalating stages that ended in a socialist society (see [[Marxism]]). Tylor and Morgan elaborated the theory of unilinear evolution, specifying criteria for categorising cultures according to their standing within a fixed system of growth of humanity as a whole and examining the modes and mechanisms of this growth. Theirs was often a concern with culture in general, not with individual cultures.

Their analysis of cross-cultural data was based on three assumptions:
# contemporary societies may be classified and ranked as more "primitive" or more "civilized"
# there are a determinate number of stages between "primitive" and "civilized" (e.g. [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[chiefdom]], and [[State (polity)|state]])
# all societies progress through these stages in the same sequence, but at different rates
Theorists usually measured progression (that is, the difference between one stage and the next) in terms of increasing social complexity (including class differentiation and a complex division of labour), or an increase in intellectual, theological, and aesthetic sophistication. These 19th-century [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] used these principles primarily to explain differences in religious beliefs and kinship terminologies among various societies.

[[File:ЛестерФВорд.jpeg|200px|left|thumb|Lester Frank Ward]]

Lester Frank Ward (1841–1913), sometimes referred to{{by whom|date=July 2015}} as the "father" of American sociology, rejected many of Spencer's theories regarding the evolution of societies. Ward, who was also a botanist and a paleontologist, believed that the law of evolution functioned much differently in human societies than it did in the plant and animal kingdoms, and theorized that the "law of nature" had been superseded by the "law of the mind".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Mind: An Interpretation of American Thought and Character Since the 1880's|author=Commager, H.S.|date=1950|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300000467|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=De5sdTFRt5YC&amp;pg=PA199|page=199|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stressed that humans, driven by emotions, create goals for themselves and strive to realize them (most effectively with the modern [[scientific method]]) whereas there is no such intelligence and awareness guiding the non-human world.&lt;ref name="psz500-501"/&gt; Plants and animals adapt to nature; man shapes nature. While Spencer believed that competition and "survival of the fittest" benefited human society and sociocultural evolution, Ward regarded competition as a destructive force, pointing out that all human institutions, traditions and laws were tools invented by the mind of man and that that mind designed them, like all tools, to "meet and checkmate" the unrestrained competition of natural forces.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Ward agreed with Spencer that authoritarian governments repress the talents of the individual, but he believed that modern democratic societies, which minimized the role of religion and maximized that of science, could effectively support the individual in his or her attempt to fully utilize their talents and achieve happiness. He believed that the evolutionary processes have four stages:

* First comes [[cosmogenesis]], creation and evolution of the world.
* Then, when life arises, there is [[biogenesis]].&lt;ref name=psz500-501/&gt;
* Development of humanity leads to [[wikt:Hominization|anthropogenesis]], which is influenced by the [[human mind]].&lt;ref name=psz500-501/&gt;
* Finally there arrives [[sociogenesis]], which is the science of shaping the evolutionary process itself to optimize progress, human happiness and individual self-actualization.&lt;ref name=psz500-501/&gt;

While Ward regarded modern societies as superior to "primitive" societies (one need only look to the impact of medical science on health and lifespan{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}) he rejected theories of [[white supremacy]]; he supported the [[Out-of-Africa]] theory of human evolution and believed that all races and social classes were equal in talent.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=obeYTY7LJpDLtwf-jvnnCw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=WUucYTW6ug0C&amp;dq=gosset+race&amp;q=lester+ward|title=Race: The History of an Idea in America|first=Thomas F.|last=Gossett|date=14 August 1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ward did not think that evolutionary progress was inevitable and he feared the degeneration of societies and cultures, which he saw as very evident in the historical record.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lester F. Ward; a Personal Sketch|author=Cape, E.P.|date=1922|publisher=G. P. Putnam's sons|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KmFJAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward also did not favor the radical reshaping of society as proposed by the supporters of the eugenics movement or by the followers of Karl Marx; like Comte, Ward believed that sociology was the most complex of the sciences and that true sociogenesis was impossible without considerable research and experimentation.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;

[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]

Émile Durkheim, another of the [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|"fathers" of sociology]], developed a [[dichotomy|dichotomal]] view of social progress.&lt;ref name="psz500"/&gt; His key concept was [[social solidarity]], as he defined social evolution in terms of progressing from [[mechanical solidarity]] to [[organic solidarity]].&lt;ref name=psz500/&gt; In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for the use of force and repression to keep society together.&lt;ref name=psz500/&gt; In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation are extensive.&lt;ref name=psz500/&gt; Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based firstly on [[population growth]] and increasing [[population density]], secondly on increasing "morality density" (development of more complex social interactions) and thirdly on increasing specialisation in the workplace.&lt;ref name=psz500/&gt; To Durkheim, the most important factor in social progress is the [[division of labour]].&lt;ref name=psz500/&gt;  This{{clarify|date=July 2015}} was later used in the mid-1900s by the economist [[Ester Boserup]] (1910–1999) to attempt to discount some aspects of [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthusian theory]].

[[Ferdinand Tönnies]] (1855–1936) describes evolution as the development from informal society, where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations, to modern, formal rational society, dominated by traditions and laws, where people are restricted from acting as they wish.&lt;ref name="psz501"/&gt; He also notes that there is a tendency to [[standardisation]] and unification, when all smaller societies are absorbed into a single, large, modern society.&lt;ref name=psz501/&gt; Thus Tönnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as [[globalization]]. Tönnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that social progress is not perfect, and it can even be called a regression as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high cost, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of the individuals making up that society.&lt;ref name=psz501/&gt; Tönnies' work became the foundation of neoevolutionism.&lt;ref name=psz501/&gt;

Although [[Max Weber]] is not usually counted{{by whom|date=July 2015}} as a sociocultural evolutionist, his theory of [[tripartite classification of authority]] can be viewed{{by whom|date=July 2015}} as an evolutionary theory as well. Weber distinguishes three [[ideal type]]s of political [[leadership]], [[wikt:domination|domination]] and [[authority]]:

# [[charismatic domination]]
# [[traditional domination]] (patriarchs, patrimonalism, feudalism)
# [[legal domination|legal (rational) domination]] (modern law and state, bureaucracy)

Weber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly [[traditional authority|traditional]] and [[charismatic authority|charismatic authorities]] to mostly [[rational-legal authority|rational and legal ones]].

===Critique and impact on modern theories===
The early 20th-century inaugurated a period of systematic critical examination, and rejection of the sweeping generalisations of the unilineal theories of sociocultural evolution. Cultural anthropologists such as [[Franz Boas]] (1858–1942), along with his students, including [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Margaret Mead]], are regarded{{by whom|date=July 2015}} as the [[leader]]s of anthropology's rejection of classical social evolutionism.

They used sophisticated [[ethnography]] and more rigorous empirical methods to argue that Spencer, Tylor, and Morgan's theories were speculative and systematically misrepresented ethnographic data. Theories regarding "stages" of evolution were especially criticised as illusions. Additionally, they rejected the distinction between "primitive" and "civilized" (or "modern"), pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history, and were just as evolved, as so-called civilized societies. They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate (i.e. leaving no historical documents) peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific.

They observed that the postulated progression, which typically ended with a stage of civilization identical to that of modern Europe, is [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]]. They also pointed out that the theory assumes that societies are clearly bounded and distinct, when in fact cultural traits and forms often cross social boundaries and diffuse among many different societies (and are thus an important mechanism of change). Boas in his [[culture history|culture-history]] approach focused on anthropological fieldwork in an attempt to identify factual processes instead of what he criticized as speculative stages of growth. His approach greatly influenced American anthropology in the first half of the 20th century, and marked a retreat from high-level generalization and from "systems building".

Later critics observed that the assumption of firmly bounded societies was proposed precisely at the time when European powers were colonising non-Western societies, and was thus self-serving. Many anthropologists and social theorists now consider unilineal cultural and social evolution a Western [[mythology|myth]] seldom based on solid empirical grounds. [[Critical theory|Critical theorist]]s argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for [[power (sociology)|power]] by the élites of society. Finally, the devastating World Wars that occurred between 1914 and 1945 crippled Europe's self-confidence. After millions of deaths, genocide, and the destruction of Europe's industrial infrastructure, the idea of progress seemed dubious at best.

Thus modern sociocultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems:
# The theory was deeply [[ethnocentric]]—it makes heavy value judgments about different societies, with [[western culture|Western civilization]] seen as the most valuable.
# It assumed all cultures follow the same path or progression and have the same goals.
# It equated civilization with [[material culture]] (technology, cities, etc.)

Because social evolution was posited as a scientific theory, it was often used to support unjust and often [[racist]] social practices — particularly colonialism, slavery, and the unequal economic conditions present within industrialized Europe. Social Darwinism is especially criticised, as it purportedly led to some philosophies used by the [[Nazis]].

===Max Weber, disenchantment, and critical theory===
[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Max Weber in 1917]]
{{Main article|Max Weber|Critical theory}}
Weber's major works in [[economic sociology]] and the [[sociology of religion]] dealt with the [[Rationalisation (sociology)|rationalization]], [[secularisation]], and so called "[[disenchantment]]" which he associated with the rise of capitalism and [[modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity|date=1985|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=0-7456-0830-2|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sociology, rationalization is the process whereby an increasing number of [[social action]]s become based on considerations of teleological efficiency or calculation rather than on motivations derived from [[morality]], [[emotion]], [[Norm (sociology)|custom]], or [[tradition]]. Rather than referring to what is genuinely "rational" or "logical", rationalization refers to a relentless quest for goals that might actually function to the ''detriment'' of a society. Rationalization is an ambivalent aspect of modernity, manifested especially in [[Western society]] - as a behaviour of the capitalist market, of rational administration in [[Sovereign state|the state]] and [[bureaucracy]], of the extension of modern [[science]], and of the expansion of modern technology.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Weber's thought regarding the rationalizing and secularizing tendencies of modern Western society (sometimes described as the "[[Rationalization (sociology)|Weber Thesis]]") would blend with Marxism to facilitate critical theory, particularly in the work of thinkers such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] (born 1929). Critical theorists, as [[antipositivist]]s, are critical of the idea of a hierarchy of sciences or societies, particularly with respect to the sociological [[positivism]] originally set forth by Comte. Jürgen Habermas has critiqued the concept of pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself. For theorists such as [[Zygmunt Bauman]] (1925-2017), rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be most closely and regrettably associated with the events of [[the Holocaust]].

When the critique of classical social evolutionism became widely accepted, modern anthropological and sociological approaches changed respectively. Modern theories are careful to avoid unsourced, ethnocentric speculation, comparisons, or value judgments; more or less regarding individual societies as existing within their own historical contexts. These conditions provided the context for new theories such as [[cultural relativism]] and multilineal evolution.

In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Gordon Childe]] revolutionized the study of cultural evolutionism. He conducted a comprehensive pre-history account that provided scholars with evidence for African and Asian cultural transmission into Europe. He combated scientific racism by finding the tools and artifacts of the indigenous people from Africa and Asia and showed how they influenced the technology of European culture. Evidence from his excavations countered the idea of Aryan supremacy and superiority. Childe explained cultural evolution by his theory of divergence with modifications of convergence. He postulated that different cultures form separate methods that meet different needs, but when two cultures were in contact they developed similar adaptations, solving similar problems. Rejecting Spencer’s theory of parallel cultural evolution, Childe found that interactions between cultures contributed to the convergence of similar aspects most often attributed to one culture. Childe placed emphasis on human culture as a [[social construct]] rather than products of environmental or technological contexts. Childe coined the terms "[[Neolithic Revolution]]", and "[[Urban Revolution]]" which are still used today in the branch of pre-historic anthropology.

In 1941 anthropologist [[Robert Redfield]] wrote about a shift from ‘folk society’ to ‘urban society’. By the 1940s cultural anthropologists such as [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] sought to revive an evolutionary model on a more scientific basis, and succeeded in establishing an approach known as neoevolutionism. White rejected the opposition between "primitive" and "modern" societies but did argue that societies could be distinguished based on the amount of energy they harnessed, and that increased energy allowed for greater social differentiation (White’s law). Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of "adaptation", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way.

The anthropologists [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Elman Service]] prepared an edited volume, ''Evolution and Culture'', in which they attempted to synthesise White’s and Steward’s approaches.&lt;ref&gt;''Evolution and culture''. Ed. by Marshall David Sahlins and Elman Service. Ann Arbor, MI: Univ. of Michigan Press, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Other anthropologists, building on or responding to work by White and Steward, developed theories of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology. The most prominent examples are [[Peter Vayda]] and [[Roy Rappaport]]. By the late 1950s, students of Steward such as [[Eric Wolf]] and [[Sidney Mintz]] turned away from cultural ecology to Marxism, [[World Systems Theory]], [[Dependency theory]] and [[Marvin Harris]]’s [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|Cultural materialism]].

Today most anthropologists reject 19th-century notions of progress and the three assumptions of unilineal evolution. Following Steward, they take seriously the relationship between a culture and its environment to explain different aspects of a culture. But most modern cultural anthropologists have adopted a general systems approach, examining cultures as emergent systems and arguing that one must consider the whole social environment, which includes political and economic relations among cultures. As a result of simplistic notions of "progressive evolution", more modern, complex cultural evolution theories (such as [[Dual Inheritance Theory]], discussed below) receive little attention in the social sciences, having given way in some cases to a series of more humanist approaches. Some reject the entirety of evolutionary thinking and look instead at historical contingencies, contacts with other cultures, and the operation of cultural symbol systems. In the area of development studies, authors such as [[Amartya Sen]] have developed an understanding of ‘development’ and ‘human flourishing’ that also question more simplistic notions of progress, while retaining much of their original inspiration.

===Neoevolutionism===

{{Main article|Neoevolutionism}}

Neoevolutionism was the first in a series of modern multilineal evolution theories. It emerged in the 1930s and extensively developed in the period following the [[Second World War]] and was incorporated into both anthropology and sociology in the 1960s. It bases its theories on empirical evidence from areas of archaeology, [[palaeontology]], and [[historiography]] and tries to eliminate any references to systems of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], be it moral or cultural, instead trying to remain objective and simply descriptive.&lt;ref name="psz502-503"/&gt;

While 19th-century evolutionism explained how culture develops by giving general principles of its evolutionary process, it was dismissed by the [[Historical particularism|Historical Particularists]] as unscientific in the early 20th century. It was the neo-evolutionary thinkers who brought back evolutionary thought and developed it to be acceptable to contemporary anthropology.

Neo-evolutionism discards many ideas of classical social evolutionism, namely that of social progress, so dominant in previous sociology evolution-related theories.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; Then neo-evolutionism discards the [[determinism]] argument and introduces [[probability]], arguing that accidents and free will greatly affect the process of social evolution.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; It also supports [[counterfactual history]]—asking "what if" and considering different possible paths that social evolution may take or might have taken, and thus allows for the fact that various cultures may develop in different ways, some skipping entire stages others have passed through.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; Neo-evolutionism stresses the importance of [[empirical]] evidence. While 19th-century evolutionism used value judgments and assumptions for interpreting data, neo-evolutionism relies on measurable information for analysing the process of sociocultural evolution.

[[Leslie White]], author of ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome'' (1959), attempted to create a theory explaining the entire [[history of humanity]].&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; The most important factor in his theory is technology.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; ''[[Social system]]s are determined by technological systems'', wrote White in his book,&lt;ref&gt;''The Evolution of Culture'', Leslie White&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the earlier theory of Lewis Henry Morgan. He proposes a society’s [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]] as a measure of its advancement.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; He differentiates between five stages of human development.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; In the second, they use the energy of domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to agricultural revolution here).&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]].&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; White introduced a formula, P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy.&lt;ref name=psz502-503/&gt; This theory is similar to Russian astronomer [[Nikolai Kardashev]]’s later theory of the [[Kardashev scale]].

[[Julian Steward]], author of ''Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution'' (1955, reprinted 1979), created the theory of "multilinear" evolution which examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment. This approach was more nuanced than White’s theory of "unilinear evolution." Steward rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of "adaptation", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way. He argued that different adaptations could be studied through the examination of the specific resources a society exploited, the technology the society relied on to exploit these resources, and the organization of human labour. He further argued that different environments and technologies would require different kinds of adaptations, and that as the resource base or technology changed, so too would a culture. In other words, cultures do not change according to some inner logic, but rather in terms of a changing relationship with a changing environment. Cultures therefore would not pass through the same stages in the same order as they changed—rather, they would change in varying ways and directions. He called his theory "multilineal evolution". He questioned the possibility of creating a social theory encompassing the entire evolution of humanity; however, he argued that anthropologists are not limited to describing specific existing cultures. He believed that it is possible to create theories analysing typical common culture, representative of specific eras or regions. As the decisive factors determining the development of given culture he pointed to technology and economics, but noted that there are secondary factors, like political system, ideologies and religion. All those factors push the evolution of a given society in several directions at the same time; hence the application of the term "multilinear" to his theory of evolution.

[[Marshall Sahlins]], co-editor with Elman Service of ''Evolution and Culture'' (1960), divided the evolution of societies into ‘general’ and ‘specific’.&lt;ref name="psz504"/&gt; General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organization and adaptiveness to environment.&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a [[Diffusionism|diffusion]] of their qualities (like technological [[invention]]s).&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; This leads cultures to develop in different ways (specific evolution), as various elements are introduced to them in different combinations and at different stages of evolution.&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt;

In his ''Power and Prestige'' (1966) and ''Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology'' (1974), [[Gerhard Lenski]] expands on the works of Leslie White and Lewis Henry Morgan,&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; developing the [[ecological-evolutionary theory]]. He views technological progress as the most basic factor in the evolution of societies and cultures.&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; Unlike White, who defined technology as the ability to create and utilise [[energy]], Lenski focuses on [[information]]—its amount and uses.&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environment) a given society has, the more advanced it is.&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; He distinguishes four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]].&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through by experience.&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; In the third, humans start using [[signage|sign]]s and develop [[logic]].&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt; In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s and develop [[language]] and writing.&lt;ref name="psz504" /&gt; Advancements in the technology of communication translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], distribution of [[good (economics)|goods]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) agricultural, (3) industrial, and (4) special (like fishing societies).&lt;ref name=psz504/&gt;

[[Talcott Parsons]], author of ''Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives'' (1966) and ''The System of Modern Societies'' (1971) divided evolution into four subprocesses: (1) division, which creates functional subsystems from the main system; (2) adaptation, where those systems evolve into more efficient versions; (3) inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems; and (4) generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the ever more complex system.&lt;ref name="psz505"/&gt; He shows those processes on 4 stages of evolution: (I) primitive or foraging, (II) archaic agricultural, (III) classical or "historic" in his terminology, using formalized and universalizing theories about reality and (IV) modern empirical cultures. However, these divisions in Parsons’ theory are the more formal ways in which the evolutionary process is conceptualized, and should not be mistaken for Parsons’ actual theory. Parsons develops a theory where he tries to reveal the complexity of the processes which take form between two points of necessity, the first being the cultural "necessity," which is given through the values-system of each evolving community; the other is the environmental necessities, which most directly is reflected in the material realities of the basic production system and in the relative capacity of each industrial-economical level at each window of time. Generally, Parsons highlights that the dynamics and directions of these processes is shaped by the cultural imperative embodied in the cultural heritage, and more secondarily, an outcome of sheer "economic" conditions.

[[Michel Foucault]]’s recent, and very much misunderstood, concepts such as [[Biopower]], [[Biopolitics]] and [[Power-knowledge]] has been cited as breaking free from the traditional conception of man as cultural animal. Foucault regards both the terms “cultural animal” and "human nature"as misleading abstractions, leading to a non critical exemption of man and anything can be justified when regarding social processes or natural phenomena (social phenomena).&lt;ref&gt;Phil. Trans. Royal. Soc. B  366, pp.444–453  Exploring the folkbiological conception of human nature (2011)
&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault argues these complex processes are interrelated, and difficult to study for a reason so those 'truths' cannot be topled or disrupted. For Foucault, the many modern concepts and practices that attempt to uncover “the truth” about human beings (either psychologically, sexually, religion or spiritually) actually create the very types of people they purport to discover. Requiring trained "specialists" and knowledge codes and know how, rigorous pursuit is "put off" or delayed which makes any kind of study not only a ‘taboo’ subject but deliberately ignored. He cites the concept of ‘truth’&lt;ref&gt;W.T.H. van de Ven The Social Reality Of Truth Foucault Searle and The Role Of Truth Within Social Reality 2012&lt;/ref&gt; within many human cultures and the ever flowing dynamics between truth, power, and knowledge as a resultant complex dynamics (Foucault uses the term regimes of truth) and how they flow with ease like water which make the concept of ‘truth’ impervious to any further rational investigation. Some of the West’s most powerful social institutions are powerful for a reason, not because they exhibit powerful structures which inhibit investigation or it is illegal to investigate there historical foundation. It is the very notion of "legitimacy" Foucault cites as examples of "truth" which function as a "[[Foundationalism]]" claims to historical accuracy. Foucault argues, systems such as [[Medicine]], [[Prisons]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault Discipline and Punish 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CRS Report For Congress Federal Prison Industries 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Religion]], as well as groundbreaking works on more abstract theoretical issues of power are suspended or buried into oblivion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kantorowicz]] The Kings Two Bodies 1956&lt;/ref&gt; He cites as further examples the ‘Scientific study’ of [[Population biology]] and [[Population genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault Bio‐history and bio‐politics Originally published in Le Monde, no. 9869 (17‐18 October 1976) Review of [[Jacques Ruffié]] From Biology to Culture and republished in Foucault Studies 18 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  as both examples of this kind of “Biopower” over the vast majority of the human population giving the new founded political population their ‘politics’ or polity. With the advent of biology and genetics teamed together as new scientific innovations notions of study of knowledge regarding truth belong to the realm of experts who will never divulge their secrets openly, while the bulk of the population do not know their own biology or genetics this is done for them by the experts.
This functions as a truth ignorance mechanism: “where the “subjugated knowledge’s,” as those that have been both written out of history and submerged in it in a masked form produces what we now know as truth. He calls them “Knowledge’s from below” and a “historical knowledge of struggles”.[[Genealogy]], Foucault suggests, is a way of getting at these knowledge’s and struggles; “they are about the insurrection of knowledge’s.”Foucault tries to show with the added dimension of “[[Milieu intérieur|Milieu]]”(derived from [[Newtonian mechanics]]) how this Milieu from the 17th century with the development of the [[Biological Science|Biological]] and [[Physical Sciences|Physical sciences]] managed to be interwoven into the political, social and biological relationship of men with the arrival of the concept [[Work (physics)|Work]] placed upon the industrial population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Foucault uses the term borrowed from [[Jakob von Uexküll]]
[[Umwelt]] meaning environment within.
Technology, production, [[Cartography]] the production of [[Nation states]] and Government making the efficiency of the [[Body politic]], [[Law]], [[Heredity]] and [[Consanguine]]&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Kantorowicz The Kings Two Bodies 1956&lt;/ref&gt; not only sound genuine and beyond historical origin and foundation it can be turned into ‘exact truth’ where the individual and the societal body are not only subjugated and nullified but dependent upon it. Foucault is not denying that genetic or biological study is inaccurate or is simply not telling the truth what he means is that notions of this newly discovered sciences were extended to include the vast majority (or whole populations) of populations as an exercise in “regimes change”.Foucault argues that the conceptual meaning from the [[Middle ages]] and [[Canon law]] period, the [[Geocentric model]], later superseded by the [[Heliocentrism]] model placing the position of the [[Natural and legal rights|law of right]] in the Middle ages ([[Exclusive right]] or its correct legal term ''[[Sui generis]]'') was the [[Divine right of kings]] and [[Absolute monarchy]] where the previous incarnation of truth and rule of political sovereignty was considered absolute and unquestioned by [[Political philosophy|Political Philosophy]](monarchs, popes and emperors). However, Foucault notices that this [[Pharaonic]] version of [[Political power]] was transversed and it was with 18th-century emergence of Capitalism and [[Liberal democracy]] that these terms began to be “democratized”.The modern Pharaonic version represented by the [[President]], the monarch, the [[Pope]] and the [[Prime minister]] all became propagandized versions or examples of symbol agents all aimed at towards a newly discovered phenomenon, the population.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault [[Security, Territory, Population]] pp.135-163 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Security, Territory, Population pp.311-332 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As symbolic symbol agents of power making the mass population having to sacrifice itself all in the name of the newly formed voting franchise we now call [[Democracy]]. However, this was all turned on its head (when the [[Medieval]] rulers were thrown out and replaced by a more exact apparatus now called the state) when the human sciences suddenly discovered: “The set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became an object of a political strategy and took on board the fundamental facts that humans were now a biological species."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault Lectures At The College de France 1977–1978 Security, Territory, Population pp.1-23 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population pp.54-86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociobiology===

{{Main article|Sociobiology}}

Sociobiology departs perhaps the furthest from classical social evolutionism.&lt;ref name="psz506"/&gt; It was introduced by [[Edward Osborne Wilson|Edward Wilson]] in his 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' and followed his adaptation of evolutionary theory to the field of social sciences. Wilson pioneered the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviours such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance.&lt;ref name=psz506/&gt; In doing so, Wilson sparked one of the greatest scientific [[controversy|controversies]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=psz506/&gt;

The current theory of evolution, the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] (or neo-darwinism), explains that evolution of [[species]] occurs through a combination of Darwin’s mechanism of natural selection and [[Gregor Mendel]]’s theory of genetics as the basis for biological inheritance and mathematical population genetics.&lt;ref name=psz506/&gt; Essentially, the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries; the units of evolution (genes) with the main mechanism of evolution (selection).&lt;ref name=psz506/&gt;

Due to its close reliance on biology, sociobiology is often considered a branch of the biology, although it uses techniques from a plethora of sciences, including [[ethology]], evolution, [[zoology]], archaeology, population genetics, and many others. Within the study of human [[societies]], sociobiology is closely related to the fields of [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

Sociobiology has remained highly controversial as it contends [[genes]] explain specific human behaviours, although sociobiologists describe this role as a very complex and often unpredictable interaction between nature and nurture. The most notable critics of the view that genes play a direct role in human behaviour have been biologists [[Richard Lewontin]] [[Steven Rose]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

Since the rise of evolutionary psychology, another school of thought, [[Dual Inheritance Theory]], has emerged in the past 25 years that applies the mathematical standards of Population genetics to modeling the adaptive and selective principles of culture. This school of thought was pioneered by [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and Peter Richerson at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] and expanded by [[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]], among others. Boyd and Richerson’s book, ''Culture and the Evolutionary Process'' (1985),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/240.ctl&lt;/ref&gt; was a highly mathematical description of cultural change, later published in a more accessible form in ''Not by Genes Alone'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/16460.ctl |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528194900/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/16460.ctl |archivedate=28 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Boyd and Richerson’s view, cultural evolution, operating on socially learned information, exists on a separate but co-evolutionary track from genetic evolution, and while the two are related, cultural evolution is more dynamic, rapid, and influential on human society than genetic evolution. Dual Inheritance Theory has the benefit of providing unifying territory for a "nature and nurture" paradigm and accounts for more accurate phenomenon in evolutionary theory applied to culture, such as randomness effects (drift), concentration dependency, "fidelity" of evolving information systems, and lateral transmission through communication.&lt;ref name="Culture and the Evolutionary Process"/&gt;

===Theory of modernization===

{{Main article|Modernization theory}}
Theories of [[modernization]] have been developed and popularized in 1950s and 1960s and are closely related to the dependency theory and [[development theory]].&lt;ref name="psz507-508"/&gt; They combine the previous theories of sociocultural evolution with practical experiences and empirical research, especially those from the era of [[decolonization]]. The theory states that:
* Western countries are the most developed, and the rest of the world (mostly former colonies) is in the earlier stages of development, and will eventually reach the same level as the Western world.&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt;
* Development stages go from the [[Traditional society|traditional societies]] to developed ones.&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt;
* [[Third World]] countries have fallen behind with their social progress and need to be directed on their way to becoming more advanced.&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt;
Developing from classical social evolutionism theories, the theory of modernization stresses the modernization factor: many societies are simply trying (or need) to emulate the most successful societies and cultures.&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt; It also states that it is possible to do so, thus supporting the concepts of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and that the developed countries can and should help those less developed, directly or indirectly.&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt;

Among the scientists who contributed much to this theory are [[Walt Rostow]], who in his ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the economic system side of the modernization, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernization in his [[Rostovian take-off model]].&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt; [[David Apter]] concentrated on the political system and history of democracy, researching the connection between democracy, good [[governance]] and efficiency and modernization.&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt; [[David McClelland]] (''The Achieving Society'', 1967) approached this subject from the [[psychology|psychological]] perspective, with his [[motivation]]s theory, arguing that modernization cannot happen until given society values innovation, success and free enterprise.&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt; Alex Inkeles (''Becoming Modern'', 1974) similarly creates a model of ''modern personality'', which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open to new experiences, rational and able to create long-term plans for the future.&lt;ref name=psz507-508/&gt; Some works of Jürgen Habermas are also connected with this subfield.

The theory of modernization has been subject to some criticism similar to that levied against classical social evolutionism, especially for being too ethnocentric, one-sided and focused on the Western world and its culture.

===Prediction for a stable cultural and social future===

Cultural evolution follows [[punctuated equilibrium]] which Gould and Eldredge developed for biological evolution. Bloomfield&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Masse.''[[Mankind in Transition]]'', Masefield Books, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Masse.''The Automated Society'', Masefield Books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; has written that human societies follow punctuated equilibrium which would mean first, a stable society, and then a transition resulting in a subsequent stable society with greater complexity. This model would claim mankind has had a stable animal society, a transition to a stable tribal society, another transition to a stable peasant society and is currently in a transitional industrial society.

The status of a human society rests on the [[productivity]] of food production. [[Edward Smith Deevey Jr.|Deevey]]&lt;ref&gt;Deevey, E. S., [[The Human Population]], Scientific American 203, September 1960, p.226.&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the growth of the number of humans. Deevey also reported on the productivity of food production, noting that productivity changes very little for stable societies, but increases during transitions. When productivity and especially food productivity can no longer be increased, Bloomfield has proposed that man will have achieved a stable automated society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korotaev|first1=A. V.|last2=Malkov|first2=Artemiĭ Sergeevich|last3=Khaltourina|first3=D.|title=Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends|date=2006|publisher=URSS|location=Moscow|isbn=5-484-00559-0|pages=5–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space is also assumed to allow for the continued growth of the human population, as well as providing a solution to the current pollution problem by providing limitless energy from solar satellite power stations.

==Contemporary perspectives==

=== Political perspectives ===
The [[Cold War]] period was marked by rivalry between two superpowers, both of which considered themselves to be the most highly evolved cultures on the planet. The [[USSR]] painted itself as a [[socialism|socialist]] society which emerged from [[class struggle]], destined to reach the state of [[communism]], while sociologists in the United States (such as Talcott Parsons) argued that the freedom and prosperity of the United States were a proof of a higher level of sociocultural evolution of its culture and society. At the same time, decolonization created newly independent countries who sought to become more developed—a model of progress and industrialization which was itself a form of sociocultural evolution.

There is, however, a tradition in European [[social theory]] from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] to Max Weber arguing that this progression coincides with a loss of human freedom and dignity. At the height of the Cold War, this tradition merged with an interest in [[ecology]] to influence an [[activist]] culture in the 1960s. This movement produced a variety of political and philosophical programs which emphasized the importance of bringing society and the environment into harmony.

=== Technological perspectives ===
[[File:Major Evolutionary Transitions digital.jpg|thumb|340px|Schematic Timeline of Information and Replicators in the Biosphere: [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|major evolutionary transitions]] in information processing&lt;ref name=" InfoBiosphere2016"/&gt;]]
Many{{who|date=December 2016}} argue that the next stage of sociocultural evolution consists of a merger with technology, especially information processing technology. Several [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|cumulative major transitions of evolution]] have transformed life through key innovations in information storage and replication, including [[RNA]], [[DNA]], [[multicellularity]], and also [[language]] and [[culture]] as inter-human information processing systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E., &amp; Szathmáry, E. (1995). The evolution of information storage and heredity. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution, 10(5), 206–211. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(00)89060-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szathmáry, E. (2015). Toward major evolutionary transitions theory 2.0. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(33), 10104–10111. http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1421398112&lt;/ref&gt; in this sense it can be argued that the carbon-based biosphere has generated a [[cognitive system]] (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary
transition. "Digital information has reached a similar magnitude to information in the biosphere. It increases exponentially, exhibits high-fidelity replication, evolves through differential fitness, is expressed through artificial intelligence (AI), and has facility for virtually limitless recombination. Like previous
evolutionary transitions, the potential symbiosis between biological and digital information will reach a critical point where these codes could compete via natural
selection. Alternatively, this fusion could create a higher-level superorganism employing a low-conflict division of labor in performing informational tasks...humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels, ...most transactions on the stock market are executed by automated trading algorithms, and our electric grids are in the hands of artificial intelligence. With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction".&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016"&gt;[http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013 "Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds"], Gillings, M.

=== Anthropological perspectives ===
Current political theories of the [[new tribalists]] consciously mimic ecology and the life-ways of [[indigenous peoples]], augmenting them with modern sciences. [[Ecoregional Democracy]] attempts to confine the "shifting groups", or tribes, within "more or less clear boundaries" that a society inherits from the surrounding ecology, to the borders of a naturally occurring [[ecoregion]]. Progress can proceed by competition between but not within tribes, and it is limited by ecological borders or by [[Natural Capitalism]] incentives which attempt to mimic the pressure of natural selection on a human society by forcing it to adapt consciously to scarce energy or materials. [[Gaianism|Gaians]] argue that societies evolve deterministically to play a role in the ecology of their [[biosphere]], or else die off as failures due to competition from more efficient societies exploiting nature's leverage.

Thus, some have appealed to theories of sociocultural evolution to assert that optimizing the ecology and the social harmony of closely knit groups is more desirable or necessary than the progression to "civilization." A 2002 poll of experts on [[Neoarctic]] and [[Neotropic]] indigenous peoples (reported in ''Harper's'' magazine)[citation needed] revealed that ''all of them'' would have preferred to be a typical New World person in the year 1491, prior to any European contact, rather than a typical European of that time. This approach has been criticised by pointing out that there are a number of historical examples of indigenous peoples doing severe environmental damage (such as the [[deforestation]] of [[Easter Island]] and the extinction of [[mammoth]]s in North America) and that proponents of the goal have been trapped by the European stereotype of the [[noble savage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9275">The '''Stonehenge Riverside Project''' was a major [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]]-funded archaeological research study of the development of the [[Stonehenge]] landscape in Neolithic and [[Bronze Age Britain]]. In particular, the project examined the relationship between the Stones and surrounding monuments and features including the [[River Avon, Hampshire|River Avon]], [[Durrington Walls]], the [[Stonehenge Cursus|Cursus]], the [[Stonehenge Avenue|Avenue]], [[Woodhenge]], burial mounds, and nearby standing stones. The project involved a substantial amount of fieldwork and ran from 2003 to 2009. It found that Stonehenge was built 500 years earlier than previously thought and was built to unify the peoples of Britain.&lt;ref name="endBBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stonehenge was built to unify Britain, researchers conclude|publisher=BBC | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-18550513 |date= 22 June 2012|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endSHEF"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/news/nr/stonehenge-monument-unification-britain-1.188608 |title=Research finds Stonehenge was monument marking unification of Britain | publisher=Sheffield University | date= 22 June 2012|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found a new stone circle, [[Bluestonehenge]].

== Background ==

The project was directed by [[Mike Parker Pearson]] ([[Sheffield University]]), [[Julian Thomas]] ([[Manchester University]]), Colin Richards ([[Manchester University]]), [[Kate Welham]] ([[Bournemouth University]]), [[Joshua Pollard]] ([[University of Southampton]]) and [[Chris Tilley]] ([[University College London]]).  The main aims of the project were to test the hypotheses of earlier studies that Stonehenge was a monument dedicated to the dead, whilst Woodhenge &amp; Durrington Walls, two miles away, were monuments to the living and more recently deceased.

== Previous excavations ==

The area immediately inside Stonehenge Bowl has been excavated several times throughout history, but to the east around Durrington Walls there have only been two major studies conducted within recent times.  The first was between 1926 and 1929 when [[Maud Cunnington]] excavated around Woodhenge, discovering several Neolithic and Bronze Age features to the south.  Later, when the nearby A345 was improved and routed through Durrington Walls in 1967, two timber circles were discovered within the henge.  Also discovered were vast amounts of animal bones and associated Neolithic pottery and tools.

== Fieldwork ==

=== 2003 surveys ===

2003 fieldwork involved sampling and geophysical surveys of the land around Durrington Walls in preparation for future study. This work helped identify two previously unrecognised entranceways to the henge, to the North and South.

=== 2004 excavations ===

2004 marked the start of annual excavations in the Stonehenge landscape. Trenches were dug on the riverbank of the River Avon next to Durrington Walls, and at the eastern entrance to the henge.  On this occasion various finds suggesting neolithic occupation were found around the area.

=== 2005 excavations ===

More fieldwork was carried out in the summer of 2005. Excavations were made around the land east of Durrington Walls near the river, and north west outside the west gate. A large amount of digging was done on the eastern banks of the henge, and inside the walls to expose the southernmost timber circle discovered in 1967. A great deal of work was also carried out 2 miles east, around a fallen sarsen stone known locally as the Bulford stone. Channel 4's archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' attended and built a temporary reconstruction of the timber circle in the nearby village of [[Upavon]].

=== 2006 ===
Over 20 researchers and 170 students and volunteers were involved in excavations around the Durrington Walls and investigations into the Stonehenge landscape. Among other things, new dating suggested that the Sarsen phase of Stonehenge was contemporary with Durrington Walls at around 2640-2480 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2006 Interim Report|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/content/1/c6/02/21/27/summary-interim-report-2006.pdf|publisher=Stonehenge Riverside Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007 excavations ===

In late summer of 2007, four weeks of fieldwork was carried out by several hundred students and volunteers. Excavations were carried out at the western end of the Cursus; around the southern, western and eastern gates of Durrington Walls; at the site of Maud Cunnington's digs immediately south of Woodhenge; and around another nearby fallen sarsen stone, known locally as the [[Cuckoo Stone]]. Geophysical surveys were also carried out across much of the surrounding area and around Stonehenge Bowl. Residencies for six artists and two graduate art student placements were arranged by Artists in Archaeology to record the processes of uncovering and interpreting this location.

=== 2008 excavations ===

In the late summer of 2008, a further four weeks of excavations were carried out. The year's excavation focused largely upon the [[Avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]], largely re-excavating work by [[Richard J. C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]].  More work was carried out upon the Eastern end of the [[Stonehenge Cursus]], [[Long Barrow 42]] (which is at the eastern terminal of the Cursus), the field to the west of Stonehenge, and a re-excavation of one of the [[Aubrey]] Holes within the stonehenge bowl. The excavation was covered by ''Time Team'' but was also covered by ''[[Nova]]'' and ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''.  Residencies for six visual artists were arranged by [[Artists in Archaeology]], to explore connections between archaeological processes and artistic practices.

In 2008, and again in 2009, the team excavated the remains of a henge beside the river, about {{convert|1|mi}} south-east of Stonehenge.  The discovery attracted media coverage and the name  "Bluehenge" or "[[Bluestonehenge]]".&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web  | title =Mini-Stonehenge find 'important'    | work =  | publisher =[[BBC]]  | date =3 October 2009  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/8288567.stm  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate =3 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sheffield&gt;{{cite web| title =Archaeologist at University finds 'Bluestonehenge' site  | work =  | publisher =[[Sheffield University]]  | date =5 October 2009  | url =http://www.shef.ac.uk/mediacentre/2009/1363.html| doi =  | accessdate =6 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stonehenge as a cemetery ==
Stonehenge is effectively Britain's largest third millennium BC cemetery, containing 52 cremation burials and many other fragments of both burnt and unburnt bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker Pearson M, Chamberlain A, Jay M, Marshall P, Pollard J, Richards C, Thomas J, Tilley C, Welham K |year=2009 |title=Who was buried at Stonehenge? |journal=Antiquity |volume=83 |issue=319 |pages=23–39 |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/083/ant0830023.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the cremation deposits contained more than one individual, so that an estimate of the number of people buried here during that period may be between 150 and 240. In 2007 the Stonehenge Riverside Project and the Beaker People Project jointly embarked upon a radiocarbon dating programme of the surviving skeletal remains to establish when Stonehenge was used as a burial space.  As a result of this, it is argued that the site began as a cremation cemetery in the early third millennium BC.

==Conclusion==
The research concluded  that stonehenge was built to unify the people of Stone Age Britain.&lt;ref name="endBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="endSHEF"/&gt;
The result were published in a 2012 book ''Stonehenge, Exploring the greatest Stone Age mystery'' by Mike Parker Pearson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stonehenge, Exploring the greatest Stone Age mystery|author=Mike Parker Pearson|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|place=UK| isbn= 9780857207302 | date=June 2012 | url=http://books.simonandschuster.co.uk/Stonehenge/Mike-Parker-Pearson/9780857207302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13952">'''Studio pottery''' is [[pottery]] made by  professional and  amateur [[artist]]s or artisans working alone or in small groups, making unique items or short runs. Typically, all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Emmanuel Cooper, ''Ten Thousand Years of Pottery''. [[British Museum Press]], 2000. {{ISBN|0-7141-2701-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Studio pottery includes functional wares such as [[tableware]] and [[Cookware and bakeware|cookware]], and non-functional wares such as [[sculpture]]. Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium. Much studio pottery is [[tableware]] or [[cookware]], but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional (sometimes called decorative) or sculptural items. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] since the 1980s,&lt;ref name=gowing/&gt; there has been a distinct trend away from functional pottery, for example, the work of artist [[Grayson Perry]]. Some studio potters now prefer to call themselves ceramic artists, [[ceramist]]s or simply artists. Studio pottery is represented by potters all over the world and has strong roots in Britain.

Since the second half of the 20th century [[ceramic art|ceramics]] has become more highly valued in the art world. There are now several large exhibitions worldwide, including ''Collect and Origin'' (formerly the Chelsea crafts fair) in [[London]], ''International Sculpture Objects &amp; Functional Art Fair'' (SOFA) [[Chicago]] and ''International Sculpture Objects &amp; Functional Art Fair ''(SOFA) [[New York City]] which includes ceramics as an art form. Ceramics have realized high prices, reaching several thousands of pounds for some pieces, in auctions houses such as [[Bonhams]] and [[Sotheby's]].

== British studio pottery ==

===Pre-1900===
[[File:Martin Brothers00.jpg|thumb|The Martin brothers in their studio]]

Notable studios included [[Brannam Pottery]], [[Castle Hedingham Ware]], [[Martin Brothers]] and [[Sir Edmund Elton, 8th Baronet|Sir Edmund Harry Elton]].

===1900-1960: Development of contemporary British ceramics===

Several influences contributed to the emergence of studio pottery in the early 20th century: art pottery (for example the work of the [[Martin Brothers]] and [[William Moorcroft (potter)|William Moorcroft]]); the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], the [[Bauhaus]]; a rediscovery of traditional artisan pottery and the excavation of large quantities of Song pottery in China.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

Leading trends in British studio pottery in the 20th century are represented by [[Bernard Leach]], [[William Staite Murray]], [[Dora Billington]], [[Lucie Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]].

Originally trained as a fine artist, [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) established a style of pottery, the [[ethical pot]], strongly influenced by Chinese, Korean, Japanese and medieval English forms. After briefly experimenting with [[earthenware]], he turned to [[stoneware]] fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns. This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th century. Leach's influence was disseminated by his writings, in particular ''A Potter's Book''&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Bernard. ''A Potter’s Book'', Faber and Faber, 1988. {{ISBN|0-571-04927-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the apprentice system he ran at his pottery in St Ives, Cornwall, through which many notable studio potters passed. ''A Potter's Book'' espoused an anti-industrial, Arts and Crafts ethos, which persists in British studio pottery. Leach taught intermittently at [[Dartington Hall]], [[Devon]] from the 1930s.

Other ceramic artists exerted an influence through their positions in art schools. William Staite Murray, who was head of the ceramics department of the [[Royal College of Art]], treated his pots as works of art, exhibiting them with titles in galleries. [[Dora Billington]] (1890–1968) studied at Hanley School of Art, worked in the pottery industry and was latterly head of pottery at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]]. She worked in media that Leach did not, e.g. [[tin-glazed]] earthenware, and influenced potters such as [[William R. Newland (potter)|William Newland]], [[James Tower]],&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Wilcox, ''The ceramic art of James Tower'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Hine]],&lt;ref name=watson&gt;Oliver Watson, ''Studio Pottery'', London: Phaidon Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;[[Nicholas Vergette]]&lt;ref&gt;Julian Stair, "Dora Billington", ''Crafts'', 154, September/October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alan Caiger-Smith]].
[[File:Thrown vase by Lucie Rie (YORYM-2004.1.100).JPG|thumb|Thrown vase by Lucie Rie]]
[[Lucie Rie]] (1902–1995) came to London in 1938 as a refugee from Austria. She had studied at the Vienna [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] and has been regarded as essentially a [[modernist]]. Rie experimented and produced new glaze effects. She was a friend of Leach and was greatly impressed by his approach, especially about the "completeness" of a pot.&lt;ref name=gowing&gt;Gowing, Christopher, and Rice, Paul, ''British Studio Ceramics in the 20th Century'', Barrie and Jenkins, 1989, p. 113. {{ISBN|0-7126-2042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bowls and bottles which she specialised in are finely potted and sometimes brightly coloured. She taught at [[Camberwell College of Arts]] from 1960 until 1972.

[[Hans Coper]] (1920–1981), also a refugee, worked with Rie before moving to a studio in Hertfordshire. His work is non-functional, sculptural and unglazed. He was commissioned to produce large ceramic candlesticks for [[Coventry Cathedral]] in the early 1960s. He taught at [[Camberwell College of Arts]] from 1960 to 1969, where he influenced [[Ewen Henderson (artist)|Ewen Henderson]]. He taught at the [[Royal College of Art]] from 1966 to 1975, where his students included [[Elizabeth Fritsch]], [[Alison Britton]], Jacqui Poncelet, [[Carol McNicoll]], Geoffrey Swindell, Jill Crowley and [[Glenys Barton]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} all of whom produce non-functional work.

After the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by two forces: the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref name=harrod&gt;Harrod, Tanya, "From A Potter's Book to The Maker's Eye: British Studio Ceramics 1940-1982", in ''The Harrow Connection'', Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Studio potters provided consumers with an alternative to plain industrial ceramics. Their simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos. [[Cranks (restaurant)|Cranks]] restaurant, which opened in 1961, used Winchombe pottery throughout, which Tanya Harrod describes as "handsome, functional with pastoral but up to date air".&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Cranks represented the look of the period. [[Elizabeth David]]'s food revolution of the post-war years was associated with a similar kitchen look and added to the demand for hand-made tableware.

Harrod notes that several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom. There was in turn a demand for potters trained in workshop practice and able to throw quickly. As this training was not offered by the art schools of the period, the [[University of Westminster|Harrow Art School]] studio pottery diploma was created to fill the gap. According to Harrod, "the production potter of the Harrow type had a good innings well into the seventies", by which time the market for this style of pottery was falling away.

=== 1960s-present: Modern British potters ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Quantum Pocket.jpg|thumb|Quantum Pocket Elizabeth Fritsch]] --&gt;
From the 1960s onwards, a new generation of potters, influenced by [[Camberwell School of Art]] and the [[Central School of Art and Design]] including [[Ewen Henderson (artist)|Ewen Henderson]], [[Alison Britton]], [[Elizabeth Fritsch]], [[Gordon Baldwin]], [[Ruth Duckworth]] and [[Ian Auld]]&lt;ref name=gowing/&gt; began to experiment\abstract ceramic objects, varied surface and glaze effects to critical acclaim. [[Elizabeth Fritsch]] has work represented in major collections and museums worldwide.

The number of potters increased in the mid-1970s the [[Craft Potters Association]] had 147 members and by the mid-1990s it had 306.&lt;ref&gt;''Potters'', The Craft Potters' Association members directory, 3rd edition and 11th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British organisations ===
A representative body for studio pottery in the [[United Kingdom]] is the [[Craft Potters Association]], which has a members’ showroom in Great Russell Street, London WC1, and publishes a journal, ''Ceramic Review''.

== US studio pottery ==
Pottery had been an integral part of the [[United States]] [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Charles Fergus Binns]], who was the first director of the [[New York State College of Ceramics|New York State School of Clay-Working and Ceramics]] at [[Alfred University]], was an important influence. Some potters in the United&amp;nbsp;States adopted the approach from emerging studio pottery movements in Britain and Japan. In addition, American folk pottery of the southeastern United States was seen as an American contribution to studio pottery. University programs at [[Ohio State University]], under the direction of [[Arthur Eugene Baggs]] in 1928 and under [[Glen Lukens]] in 1936 at the [[University of Southern California]], began training ceramic students in presenting clay ware as art. Baggs had been intimately involved in the Arts and Crafts movement at [[Marblehead Pottery]] and, during the 1930s, he revived interest in the [[Salt glaze pottery|salt glazing]] method for studio pottery.

European artists coming to the United States contributed to the public appreciation of pottery as art, and included [[Marguerite Wildenhain]], [[Maija Grotell]], [[Susi Singer]] and [[Otto Natzler|Gertrude and Otto Natzler]]. Significant [[studio potters]] in the United States include [[Otto and Vivika Heino]], [[Warren MacKenzie]], [[Paul Soldner]], [[Peter Voulkos]] and [[Beatrice Wood]].

[[Image:SurvivalUnderAtomicAttack.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Copy of ''Survival Under Atomic Attack'' issued by the [[Cleveland]] office of [[Civil Defense]].]]

'''''Survival Under Atomic Attack''''' was the title of an official [[United States]] government [[book]]let released by the [[Executive Office of the President]], the [[National Security Resources Board]] (document 130), and the [[United States Civil Defense|Civil Defense Office]].  Released at the onset of the [[Cold War]] era, the pamphlet was in line with rising fears that the [[Soviet Union]] would launch a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] against the [[United States]], and outlined what to do in the event of an atomic attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/survivalunderato00bost ''Survival under Atomic Attack''; Department of Civil Defense; 1951; archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Published in 1950 by the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]], one year after the [[Soviet Union]] detonated their first [[atomic bomb]], the booklet explains how to protect oneself, one's food and water supply, and one's home.  It also covered how to prevent burns and what to do if exposed to [[radiation]].  Because much of the book is arranged around calculations of the effects of the relatively small fission weapons of the time (ca. 20 [[kiloton]]s), much of the information could be viewed as out of date in terms of nuclear weapons,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} however the most numerous nuclear weapons in both the US &amp; [[USSR]]/Russian arsenal are and remain approximately 100 kiloton in yield(e.g. [[W76]] and [[Bulava]]) due to the flexibility that [[MIRV]]s offer.  It was also published before studies of the effects of nuclear weapons on civilian areas had taken place.{{dubious|date=August 2015}} The U.S [[Strategic bombing survey]] had assessed the civilian response in Hiroshima and Nagasaki beginning as early as August–September 1945 and its report was "Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved...". Secondly, the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]] was active from 1946 to 1975 studying the effects of the two bombs on survivors in both cities and thus represented four years of post-bombing study at the time of publication.

== Center Insert ==
[[Image:SurvivalUnderAtomicAttackOriginal.jpg|thumb|200px|Original release of ''Survival Under Atomic Attack'']]

The four pages in the center of the brochure (15, 16, 17, 18) were designed to be torn out.
"Remove this sheet and keep it with you until you've memorized it."

=== Kill the Myths (15) ===
;Atomic Weapons Will Not Destroy The Earth: Atomic bombs hold more death and destruction than man ever before has wrapped up in a single package, but their over-all power still has very definite limits. Not even [[hydrogen bombs]] will blow the earth apart or kill us all by [[radioactivity]].
;Doubling Bomb Power Does Not Double Destruction: Modern A-bombs can cause heavy damage 2 miles away, but doubling their power would extend that range only to 2.5 miles. To stretch the damage range from 2 to 4 miles would require a weapon more than 8 times the rated power of present models.
;Radioactivity Is Not The Bomb's Greatest Threat: In most atom raids, blast and heat are by far the greatest dangers that people must face. Radioactivity alone would account for only a small percentage of all human deaths and injuries, except in underground or [[underwater explosion]]s.
;[[radiation poisoning|Radiation Sickness]] Is Not Always Fatal: In small amounts, radioactivity seldom is harmful. Even when serious radiation sickness follows a heavy dosage, there is still a good chance for recovery.

=== Six Survival Secrets For Atomic Attacks (16, 17) ===

==== Always Put First Things First And (16) ====
;1. Try To Get Shielded: If you have time, get down in a basement or subway.  Should you unexpectedly be caught out-of-doors, seek shelter alongside a building, or jump in any handy ditch or gutter.
;2. Drop Flat On Ground Or Floor: To keep from being tossed about and to lessen the chances of being struck by falling and flying objects, flatten out at the base of a wall, or at the bottom of a bank.
;3. Bury Your Face In Your Arms: When you drop flat, hide your eyes in the crook of your elbow.  That will protect your face from [[Nuclear explosion|flash burns]], prevent temporary blindness and keep flying objects out of your eyes.

==== Never Lose Your Head And (17) ====
;4. Don't Rush Outside Right After A Bombing: After an air burst, wait a few minutes then go help to fight fires.  After other kinds of bursts wait at least 1 hour to give lingering radiation some chance to die down.
;5. Don't Take Chances With Food Or Water In Open Containers: To prevent radioactive poisoning or disease, select your food and water with care. When there is reason to believe they may be contaminated, stick to canned and bottled things if possible.
;6. Don't Start Rumors: In the confusion that follows a bombing, a single rumor might touch off a panic that could cost your life.

=== Five Keys To Household Safety (18) ===
;1. Strive For "[[Fireproofing|Fireproof Housekeeping]]": Don't let trash pile up, and keep waste paper in covered containers. When an alert sounds, do all you can to eliminate sparks by shutting off the [[oil burner]] and covering all open flames.
;2. Know Your Own Home: Know which is the safest part of your cellar, learn how to turn off your oil burner and what to do about utilities.
;3. Have Emergency Equipment And Supplies Handy: Always have a good [[flashlight]], a radio, first-aid equipment and a supply of [[canned goods]] in the house.
;4. Close All Windows And Doors And Draw The Blinds: If you have time when an alert sounds, close the house up tight in order to keep out fire sparks and radioactive dusts and to lessen the chances of being cut by flying glass. Keep the house closed until all danger is past.
;5. Use the Telephone Only For True Emergencies: Do not use the phone unless absolutely necessary. Leave the lines open for real emergency traffic.

==Biography==
[[File:Library Zaki-Validi.jpg|thumb|right|300px| The [[Zeki Velidi Togan National Library]] of the Republic of Bashkortostan in [[Ufa]]]]
He was born in [[Ishimbaysky District|Kuzyanovo]] ([[Bashkir language|Bashkir]]: Көҙән) village of [[Sterlitamak]] [[uyezd]], [[Ufa Governorate]] (in present-day [[Ishimbaysky District]], [[Bashkortostan]]).

From 1912&amp;ndash;1915 Velidi taught in the [[madrassa]] (school) in [[Kazan]] (Qasímiä), and from 1915 to 1917 he was a member of bureau, supporting [[Muslim]] deputies at the [[State Duma]]. In 1917 he was elected to Millät Mäclese, and with Şerif Manatov he organized the Bashkir [[Shura]] (Council). The Bashkir Congress at [[Orenburg]] in November&amp;ndash;December 1917, of which Velidi was chairman, declared [[Bashkortostan]]'s Independence. However, he was arrested 3 February 1918 by the Soviet forces.&lt;ref name="Schafer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schafer|first1=Daniel E.|title=Togan, Ahmed Zeki Validov|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404101382.html|website=Encyclopedia.com|publisher=The Gale Group|accessdate=15 July 2016|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 and 1919 Velidi's Bashkir troops first fought under Ataman [[Alexander Dutov]], then under Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Kolchak]] against [[Bolshevik]] forces. After the [[RSFSR]] promised autonomy to Bashkirs, Velidi switched allegiance, fighting with the Bolsheviks.

From February 1919 to June 1920, he was chairman of the ''Bashrevkom'' (Bashkir Revolutionary Committee). He attended the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]] held in [[Baku]] in September 1920, where he became involved in drawing up the statutes of [[Erk (historic party)|ERK]], a Muslim Socialist organisation. However, feeling the Bolsheviks had broken their promises, he became more critical of them when he moved to [[Central Asia]].

In [[Turkistan]], Velidi became a leader of the  [[Basmachi|Basmachi Movement]] {{Harvard citation|Paksoy|1992}}.  From 1920 to 1923 he was chairman of the "National Union of Turkistan". In 1923 Validi emigrated, after discovering original manuscripts of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] in [[Iran]].

From 1925 Velidi lived in [[Turkey]], becoming a teacher and professor at [[Istanbul University]]. However, his controversial critique of the Turkish history thesis forced him to seek refuge in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;''Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkish Historical Writing'', Cemal Kadafar and Hakan T. Karateke,'''The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 4: 1800-1945''', 574.&lt;/ref&gt; He later gained a [[PhD|doctor of philosophy]] in 1935 at the [[University of Vienna]]. Later he was a professor at [[Bonn University]] (1935–1937) and [[Göttingen University]] (1938–1939). In 1953 he became organizer of the İslam Tetkikleri Enstitüsü (Institute for Islamic Studies) at [[Istanbul University]].  In 1967, he was given an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Manchester]].

At the same time he contributed to the ''Encyclopedia of Turkic Peoples''. His articles about culture, language and history of Turkic peoples have been translated into many languages.
