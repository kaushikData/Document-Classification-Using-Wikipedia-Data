'''Proposition 56''' is a [[California ballot proposition]] that passed on the November 8, 2016 ballot.

The Gonorrhea bacterium [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]] has developed [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] to many antibiotics.

The bacteria was first identified in 1879,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ligon BL |title=Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser: discoverer of the cause of gonorrhea |journal=Semin Pediatr Infect Dis |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=336–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16210113 |doi=10.1053/j.spid.2005.07.001 |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1045-1870(05)00076-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some Biblical scholars believe that references to the disease can be found as early as Parshat Metzora of the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosner|first=Fred|title=Medicine in the Bible and the Talmud : selections from classical Jewish sources|year=1995|publisher=KTAV Pub. House|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0-88125-506-8|edition=Augm.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s effective treatment with [[penicillin]] became available, but by the 1970s resistant strains predominated. Resistance to penicillin has developed through two mechanisms: chromasomally mediated resistance (CMRNG) and penicillinase-mediated resistance (PPNG). CMRNG involves step wise mutation of penA, which codes for the [[Penicillin binding proteins|penicillin-binding protein]] (PBP-2); mtr, which encodes an [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux pump]] that removes penicillin from the cell; and penB, which encodes the bacterial cell wall [[Porin (protein)|porins]]. PPNG involves the acquisition of a [[Plasmid-mediated resistance|plasmid-borne]] [[beta-lactamase]].&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"&gt;Tapsall (2001) Antimicrobial resistance in ''Niesseria gonorrhoeae''. World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; ''N. gonorrheoea'' has a high affinity for [[horizontal gene transfer]], and as a result, the existence of any strain resistant to a given drug could spread easily across strains.

[[quinolone antibiotic|Fluoroquinolones]] were a useful next-line treatment until resistance was achieved through efflux pumps and mutations to the gyrA gene, which encodes [[DNA gyrase]].&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt; Third-generation [[cephalosporins]] have been used to treat gonorrhoea since 2007, but resistant strains have emerged. As of 2010, the recommended treatment is a single 250&amp;nbsp;mg intramuscular injection of [[ceftriaxone]], sometimes in combination with [[azithromycin]] or [[doxycycline]].&lt;ref name="Japan10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deguchi T, Nakane K, Yasuda M, Maeda S | title = Emergence and spread of drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae | journal = J.

These include: [[cefixime]] (an oral [[cephalosporin]]), [[ceftriaxone]] (an injectable cephalosporin), [[azithromycin]], [[aminoglycosides]], and [[tetracycline]].&lt;ref name="CDC2013"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|title=Biggest Threats - Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penicillins ==

[[File:Penicillin cures gonorrhea.jpg|thumb|Old advertisement for penicillin treatment]]

Beta-lactams like penicillin were widely used to treat gonorrhea in the 1940s.  There are three general mechanisms that may allow bacteria to become resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics:
# inability to access/target penicillin-binding protein (PBP) enzyme
# inhibition of binding to PBP via modification of the enzyme
# hydrolysis/inactivation of the antibiotic by beta-lactamases.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Patrick R., Ken S. Rosenthal, and Michael A. Pfaller. Medical Microbiology. 6th ed. Philadelphia: Mosby/Elsevier, 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;
Overuse of penicillin contributed to ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' developing high resistance to penicillin through two main mechanisms: chromosomally mediated resistance (CMRNG) and penicillinase-mediated resistance (PPNG).&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;

Chromosomally mediated resistance occurred through step-wise changes over many years.  Chromosomal mutations in the ''penA'', ''mtr'', and ''penB'' genes are the major mechanisms for CMRNG.  The ''penA'' gene encodes an alternative penicillin-binding protein, PBP-2.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;  This mechanism falls under the second general mechanism for beta-lactam resistance.  PBPs, also known as transpeptidases, are targets for beta-lactams.  These enzymes (PBPs) are involved in peptidoglycan synthesis which is a major component of the bacterial cell wall.  PBPs cross-link the amino acid strands of peptidoglycan during synthesis.  Normally, beta-lactams bind the PBPs and thereby inhibit the cross-linking of peptidoglycan.  When this occurs, the cell wall of the bacterium is compromised and often results in cell death.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;  When ''N. gonorrhoeae'' encodes ''penA'', the new PBP-2 that is synthesized is no longer recognized by the beta-lactams rendering the bacterium resistant.

The ''mtr'' (multiple transferable resistance) gene encodes for an efflux pump.&lt;ref name="Rouquette-Loughlin"&gt;Rouquette-Loughlin, Dunham, Kuhn, Balthazar, Shafer (2003) The NorM Efflux Pump of ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' and ''Neissera meningitidis'' Recognizes Antimicrobial Cationic Compounds. Journal of Bacteriology 185:1101–1106
&lt;/ref&gt;  Efflux pumps mediate resistance to a variety of compounds including antibiotics, detergents, and dyes.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;  This mechanism falls under the first general resistance mechanism to beta-lactams.  ''mtr'' encodes for the protein MtrD which is the efflux pump for ''N. gonorrhoeae''.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;  MtrD is among the Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) efflux pump superfamily.  These pumps are proton antiporters where the antibiotic is pumped out of the cell while a proton is pumped into the cell.&lt;ref name="Van Bambeke"&gt;Van Bambeke, Balzi, Tulkens (2000) Antibiotic Efflux Pumps. Biochemical Pharmacology 60:457–470&lt;/ref&gt;

The cell wall of ''N. gonorrhoeae'' contains porins which are holes within the cell wall in which some molecules are able to diffuse into or out of the cell membrane.  This mechanism falls under the first general mechanism for beta-lactam resistance.  The ''penB'' gene encodes the porins for ''N. gonorrhoeae'' and when this gene undergoes mutations, there is a decrease in permeability of the cell wall to hydrophilic antibiotics like penicillin.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;

Penicillinase-mediated resistance in ''N. gonorrhoeae'' is mediated by the plasmid borne TEM-1 type beta-lactamase which falls under the third general mechanism for beta-lactam resistance.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;  There have been over 200 beta-lactamases described and some of them are antibiotic specific.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;  TEM-1 is a penicillinase specific for penicillins.  This enzyme will bind to the beta-lactam ring which is a structural characteristic for beta-lactams and hydrolyze the ring.  This renders the antibiotic inactive.  The spread of the penicillinase resistance was much faster compared to the chromosomal-mediated resistance mechanisms.  The plasmids containing TEM-1 could be passed from bacterium to bacterium via conjugation &lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;

== Quinolones ==

Quinolones are a class of synthetic antibiotics that inhibit DNA replication, recombination, and repair by interacting with the bacterial DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;  Second generation quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin have been widely used to treat ''N. gonorrhoeae'' infections.  Resistance to these antibiotics has developed over the years with chromosomal resistance being the primary mechanism.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;

Low-level quinolone resistance has been linked to changes in cell permeability and efflux pumps.  The NorM efflux pump is encoded by the ''norM'' gene and provides resistance to fluoroquinolones.&lt;ref name="Rouquette-Loughlin" /&gt;  The NorM efflux pump is a member of the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) family and functions by a Na+ antiporter.  It is also known that a point mutation upstream of the ''norM'' gene will causes overexpression of NorM, and mediate elevated resistance.&lt;ref name="Rouquette-Loughlin" /&gt;

High-level resistance to quinolones has been seen through target modification acting on the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  Multiple amino acid substation mutations in the ''gyrA'' gene, which encodes for the DNA gyrase, have been seen extensively.  DNA gyrase is an enzyme that binds to DNA and introduces negative supercoiling.&lt;ref name="Drlica"&gt;Drlica, Zhao (1997) DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews 61:377–392
&lt;/ref&gt;  This helps unwind the DNA for replication.  If there is a mutation in the DNA gyrase, then the quinolone will not be able to bind to it resulting in the activity of DNA gyrase not being inhibited.  Multiple mutations have also been noted in the ''parC'' gene which encodes for the topoisomerase IV.  Topoisomerase IV acts similarly to DNA gyrase and is involved in unwinding DNA for replication.&lt;ref name="Drlica" /&gt;

== Cephalosporins ==

[[File:Beta-lactam antibiotics example 1.svg|thumb|Basic structures of penicillins(1) and cephalosporins(2) with beta-lactam ring highlighted in red]]

[[Ceftriaxone]] and [[cefixime]] are third generation cephalosporins and are often used as treatments for ''N. gonorrhoeae infections''.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;  The cephalosporins are part of a larger beta-lactam family of antibiotics.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, Brenda A., Abigail A. Salyers, Dixie D. Whitt, and Malcolm A. Winkler. Bacterial Pathogenesis: A Molecular Approach. 3rd ed. Washington DC: ASM Press, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The newly discovered H041 strain of ''N. gonorrhoeae'', originally isolated from a commercial sex worker in Japan, was shown to be resistant to this antibiotic.&lt;ref name="Golparian"&gt;Unemo, Golparian, Nicholas, Ohnishi, Gallay, Sednaoui (2011) High-Level Cefixime- and Ceftriaxone-Resistant ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' in France: Novel ''penA'' Mosaic Allele in a Successful International Clone Causes Treatment Failure. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 1273–1280
&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible mechanisms of resistance to this antibiotic are as follows:
# an alteration of more than four amino acids in the C-terminal end of the PBP-2,&lt;ref name="Unemo"&gt;Unemo (2008) Real-time PCR and subsequent pyrosequencing for screeing of ''penA'' mosaic alleles and prediction of reduced susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosorins in ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''. Acta Pathologica, Microbiologica et Immunologica Scandinavica 116:1001–1008
&lt;/ref&gt; which would result in the antibiotic being unable to bind to its target
# mutations in the promoter regions of ''mtr'', resulting in the overexpression of genes that code for efflux pumps
# mutations in the ''penB'' gene that encodes for the bacterial porin.  This form of resistance has only been observed with ceftriaxone which is administered through an intramuscular injection.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;

== Tetracyclines ==

Tetracyclines are a class of antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit of bacterial cells, keeping transcription of the bacterial genome from occurring.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;  Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic, which means that the growth of the bacterium will be slowed.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;  Tetracyclines are not often recommended for the treatment of ''N. gonorrhoeae'' because the treatment regimen requires many doses, which may affect compliance and contribute to resistance.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;  Tetracycline is still used as treatment for this infection in developing countries because the cost for the drug is low &lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;

As with the penicillin resistance, the ''penB'' (porin formation) and ''mtr'' (efflux pump formation) mutations mediate chromosomal resistance.  These adaptations will also affect the ability of the antibiotic to get into, or stay in the bacterial cell.  High level resistance of ''N. gonorrhoeae'' to tetracyclines was first reported in 1986 with the discovering of the ''tetM'' determinant.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;  The mechanism of resistance is still unknown.

== Aminoglycosides ==

''N. gonorrhoeae'' has also shown resistance to the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics. These antibiotics bind to the 16s rRNA of the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome,&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; thereby stopping transcription of the bacterial genome.  Resistance appears to be acquired through porin-related mechanisms, much like the cephalosporin resistance mechanism.  This mechanism would result in the access of the antibiotic to the bacterial cell being inhibited.  There is a possibility of future enzymes (made by the bacterium) that will be able to denature and inactivate the aminoglycosides.&lt;ref name="Tapsall 2001"/&gt;

A '''bloodborne disease''' is a disease that can be spread through contamination by blood and other [[body fluid]]s. Bloodborne pathogens are microorganisms such as viruses or bacteria. The most common examples are [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s.

Diseases that are not usually transmitted directly by blood contact, but rather by insect or other vector, are more usefully classified as ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne disease]]'', even though the causative agent can be found in blood. Vector-borne diseases include [[West Nile virus]], [[zika fever]] and [[malaria]].

Many bloodborne diseases can also be contracted by other means, including high-risk sexual behavior or intravenous [[Drug injection|drug use]]. These diseases have also been identified in [[sports medicine]].&lt;ref name="Clinics-Pirozzolo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmed.theclinics.com/article/S0278-5919(07)00020-8/abstract|title=Blood-Borne Infections|publisher=Clinics.com|date=July 2007|accessdate=February 23, 2014|author1=Jason J. Pirozzolo |author2=Donald C. LeMay |page=Volume 26, Issue 3 , 425–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it is difficult to determine what pathogens any given sample of blood contains, and some bloodborne diseases are lethal, standard medical practice regards all blood (and any body fluid) as potentially infectious. ''Blood and Body Fluid precautions'' are a type of [[infection control]] practice that seeks to minimize this sort of disease transmission.

== Occupational exposure ==
Blood poses the greatest threat to health in a laboratory or clinical setting due to [[needlestick injuries]] (''e.g.'', lack of proper [[hypodermic needle|needle]] disposal techniques and/or [[safety syringe]]s). These risks are greatest among healthcare workers, including: nurses, surgeons, laboratory assistants, doctors, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians. &lt;ref name= "Deuffic-Burbana2011"&gt;S.

[http://Journal%20of%20Clinical%20Virology Journal of Clinical Virology] 52(2011) 4–10&lt;/ref&gt;  These roles often require the use of syringes for blood draws or to administer medications.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) prescribes 5 rules that are required for a healthcare facility to follow in order to reduce the risk of employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens. They are:
* Written exposure control plan
* Engineering controls (Sharps containers, detachable and retractable needles, syringe caps, etc.)
* Safe Work Practices and Safety Devices
* [[Hepatitis B vaccine]] available to employees
* Education and post-exposure follow up
These controls, while general, serve to greatly reduce the incidence of bloodborne disease transmission in occupational settings of healthcare workers.

There are 26 different viruses that have been shown to present in healthcare workers as a result of occupational exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health Occupational Health Surveillance Program.

== Blood transfusions ==
Blood for [[blood transfusion]] is screened for many bloodborne diseases. Additionally, a technique that uses a combination of [[Pathogen reduction using riboflavin and UV light|riboflavin and UV light]] to inhibit the replication of these pathogens by altering their nucleic acids can be used to treat blood components prior to their transfusion, and can reduce the risk of disease transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich RP, et al., "Arkk Laboratory Comparison of Pathogen Reduction Technology Treatment and Culture of Platelet Products for Addressing Bacterial Contamination Concerns." Transfusion 2009;49 : 1205–1216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruane PH, et al., "Photochemical Inactivation of Selected Viruses and Bacteria in Platelet Concentrates Using Riboflavin and Light." Transfusion 2004; 44: 877–885.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich RP, et al. "The Mirasol PRT System for Pathogen Reduction of Platelets and Plasma: An Overview of Current Status and Future Trends." Transfusion and Apheresis Science 2006; 35 (1): 5–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

A technology using the synthetic [[psoralen]], amotosalen HCl, and [[ultraviolet|UVA]] light (320–400&amp;nbsp;nm) has been implemented in European blood centers for the treatment of platelet and plasma components to prevent transmission of bloodborne diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;Osselaer et al. "Universal adoption of pathogen inactivation of platelet components: impact on platelet and red blood cell component use". Transfusion 2009; 49:1412–1422.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cazenave et al. "An active hemovigilance program characterizing the safety profile of 7,483 transfusions with plasma components prepared with amotosalen and UVA photochemical treatment". Transfusion 2010;50:1210–1219.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Needle exchange programs ==
[[Needle exchange program]]s (NEPs) are an attempt to reduce the spread of bloodborne diseases between intravenous drug users. They often also provide addiction counseling services, infectious disease testing, and in some cases mental health care and/or other case management. NEPs acquired their name as they were initially places where intravenous (IV) illicit substance users were provided with clean, unused needles in exchange for their used needles. This allows for proper disposal of the needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Needle Exchange: A Primer|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/past/needle.html|website=PBS|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical studies confirm the benefits of NEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Peter|title=The Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States and Abroad|date=1993|publisher=UC Berkeley School of Public Health|location=San Francisco, CA|url=https://caps.ucsf.edu/uploads/pubs/reports/pdf/NEPReportSummary1993.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEPs can affect behaviors that result in the transmission of HIV. These behaviors include decreased sharing of used syringes, which reduces contaminated syringes from circulation and replaces them with sterile ones, among other risk reductions.

== Prevention ==
Follow standard precautions to help prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens and other diseases whenever there is a risk of exposure to blood or other bodily fluids. Standard precautions include maintaining personal hygiene and using personal protective equipment (PPE), engineering controls, and work practice controls among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fact Sheet|title=Preventing the Spread of Bloodborne Pathogens|url=http://www.in.gov/isdh/files/BBP_American_Red_Cross_Fact_Sheet_xps(1).pdf|website=Bloodborne Pathogens Training|publisher=The American National Red Cross|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Always avoid contact with blood and other bodily fluids. Wear disposable gloves when providing care, particularly if you may come into contact with blood or bodily fluids. Dispose properly of gloves and change gloves when providing care to a new patient. Use needles with safety devices to help prevent needlestick injury and exposure to bloodborne pathogens.

A hierarchy of controls can help to prevent environmental and occupational exposures and subsequent diseases. These include:

Elimination: Physically remove hazards, including needles that lack a safety device. Additionally, eliminate the use of needle devices  whenever safe and effective alternatives are available.

Substitution: Replace needles without safety devices with ones that have a safety feature built in. This has been shown to reduce bloodborne diseases transmitted via needlestick injuries.

Engineering controls: Isolate people from the hazard by providing sharps containers for workers to immediately place needles in after use.

Administrative controls: Change the way people work by creating a culture of safety such as avoiding recapping or bending needles that may be contaminated and promptly disposing of used needle devices and other sharps. 

[[Personal protective equipment]]: Protect workers with PPE such as gloves and masks to avoid transmission of blood and other bodily fluids.

[[File:Brian Abel-Smith , c1980s.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Abel-Smith]]
'''Brian Abel-Smith''' (6 November 1926 – 4 April 1996) was a British economist and expert adviser and one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century in shaping health and social welfare.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In Britain, his research for the Guillebaud committee in 1956 proved that the NHS provided extremely good value for money and deserved more investment. From the 1960s he was one of a new breed of special advisers to Labour government ministers – helping [[Richard Crossman]], [[Barbara Castle]] and [[David Ennals]] to reconfigure the NHS, set up [[Resource Allocation Working Party|RAWP]], and the Black Inquiry into Health Inequalities. Internationally, he steered the development of health services in over 50 countries. He was a key WHO and EEC adviser, intimately involved in setting the agenda for global campaigns such as Health for All by the year 2000.

==Biography==

Abel-Smith was born at 24 [[Kensington Court Gardens]], London, the younger son of Brigadier-General Lionel Abel-Smith (1870–1946), and his wife, Genevieve Lilac, née Walsh (1898–1980). His elder brother, Lionel Abel-Smith (1924–2011), inherited the title and estate of Lord of the Manor of [[Wendover]], in Buckinghamshire. They were distantly related to the royal family, and friends wickedly introduced him as twenty-seventh in line to the crown.

Abel-Smith was educated at Hordle House Preparatory School (1935–39) and [[Haileybury College]] (1940–1945), before entering the army for his National Service. He was commissioned in the Oxford and Buckinghamshire light infantry in 1946 and was ADC [aide-de-camp] to Sir [[John Winterton]], the military governor of the British zone in Austria during 1947–8. He entered [[Clare College, Cambridge]] in 1948, graduating with a II.i in Economics in 1951. He was an active member of the Cambridge Union and the University Labour Club.

Abel-Smith remained at Cambridge to study for a PhD under the supervision of the economist [[Joan Robinson]]. From 1953 he aligned his research to fit with his appointment as research assistant at the [[National Institute of Economic and Social Research]] (under the supervision of Professor [[Richard Titmuss]] of the Department of Social Administration at the London School of Economics) to assist with the Guillebaud Enquiry on the cost of the National Health Service (NHS). His investigation, which demonstrated that the NHS was actually very good value for money and needed further investment, has been described as 'a minor classic of modern social analysis' [C. Webster, The Health Services Since the War Vol.1, (London, HMSO, 1988) p.&amp;nbsp;207]. He was awarded a Cambridge PhD in 1955, and in the same year Titmuss appointed him as an Assistant Lecturer in his department at the LSE. He was promoted to lecturer in 1957, reader in social administration in 1961, and full professor in 1965. He retired in 1991, but returned to work part-time with Elias Mossialos to establish the LSE Health unit.

===Research===

Brian Abel-Smith's research interests in health and social welfare were underpinned by his commitment to socialism. He focused on the impact of the new post-war British welfare state, publishing regular articles and books in the academic and mainstream press to highlight persistent inequalities in health and social welfare that Beveridge's model had not adequately addressed.  His first publication was for the [[Fabian Society]] in 1953: The Reform of Social Security. He collaborated with the sociologist [[Peter Townsend (sociologist)|Peter Townsend]] – who also moved to work with Titmuss at the LSE in 1957 – on projects on poverty, pensions and social security. They conducted a major study using a new method of constructing a poverty line that demonstrated that poverty had increased in Britain in the 1950s. Their 1965 book, ''The Poor and the Poorest'', was used to launch the [[Child Poverty Action Group]], which Abel-Smith remained closely involved with for the rest of his life.

Another of Abel-Smith's key research interests was the financing and development of health services. Following on from his work on the [[Guillebaud Report]] on the cost of the NHS, he was invited in 1958 to lead a multi-agency project for the [[World Health Organization]] on the costs of health care in six countries. He produced the first comparative classifications, which became the standard for reporting health care expenditure. Although his background was in economics, he was increasingly interested in the finance and management of health services. He gained first-hand experience of the British NHS through his appointment as a governor to a number of regional boards and London hospital management committees in the 1960s, including St Thomas' hospital.

His ideas on health and social welfare financing reflected his engagement with leading international health economists and social policy theorists such as [[Wilbur Cohen]], Ida Merriam, Milton Roemer and Dorothy Rice, and he was regularly invited into expert advisory groups. He collaborated with [[Archie Cochrane]] in the early 1970s, resulting in his classic book Value for Money in the Health Services (1976), which explored strategies for cost containment, effectiveness and efficiency. As his experience through advising developing countries increased, he moved away from his ideological commitment to fully state-funded services, and embraced the concept of social insurance and, in the 1990s, the potential offered by user charges.

===Political adviser===

While at Cambridge, Abel-Smith had been identified by [[Hugh Dalton]] as a potential future Labour MP. He began political campaigning, but when he was offered the nomination for Dalton's safe seat in 1957 he turned it down, worried that if his homosexuality were revealed that it would cause embarrassment for his family. Instead he played a key role in modernising the [[Fabian Society]] and served it for 31 years as executive committee member, treasurer and vice-president. From the mid-1950s he served on various Labour Party working parties and committees, providing policy ideas on pensions and social security. The Fabian pamphlet he had co-authored with Townsend, New Pensions for the Old, was used by [[Richard Crossman]] as the basis for a radical revision of Labour's social welfare system. When Crossman was appointed as Secretary of State for Social Services in 1968 he invited Abel-Smith to become his part-time adviser, one of the first such posts in British government. Abel-Smith advised issues including the re-structuring of the NHS and helped to set up an enquiry into the [[Ely Hospital]] scandal in Cardiff. When Labour lost the 1970 general election Crossman wrote in his diary that Abel-Smith 'has been my closest personal friend and without him I could have done very little in the past two years'. [R. Crossman, Diaries of a Cabinet Minister: volume three: Secretary of State for Social Services 1968–70 (London, Hamish Hamilton and Jonathan Cape, 1977), p.&amp;nbsp;921. Entry for 14 May 1970.]

When Labour returned to government in 1974 Abel-Smith was re-appointed as a special adviser by the new Secretary of State for Social Services, [[Barbara Castle]]. He helped her, and her successor David Ennals, to introduce a new pensions scheme [SERPS]; set up the [[Resource Allocation Working Party]] [RAWP] to allocate NHS resources to regions according to health needs, and to set up the [[Black Report]] into inequalities in health. When he was working for Barbara Castle she appointed [[Jack Straw]] as political adviser. 'Let me be clear', she said to Straw, 'I have appointed Brian for his brilliance. I have appointed you for your low cunning.' At the end of her cabinet career she wrote that 'Brian's steady, informed and perceptive help is a tower of strength' [B. Castle, ''The Castle Diaries 1974–76'' (London, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1980), p.&amp;nbsp;721]. In 1978, frustrated with tensions between the government, NHS and the medical profession, he accepted an offer to work as special adviser to [[Peter Shore]], Secretary of State for the Environment, where he tackled housing and urban planning issues. After the defeat of Labour at the 1979 general election, Abel-Smith was asked by a number of health policy think thanks such as the [[Kings Fund]] and the [[Nuffield Trust]] to advise on reforming aspects of British healthcare.

Abel-Smith's wider command of social policy included legal institutions. His capacity for penetrating, indeed adventurous, analysis led to one of the most original contributions to the role of law of the twentieth century. His book with [[Robert Stevens (lawyer)|Robert Stevens]], Lawyers and the Courts (1967), was a sociological study of the English legal system from 1750 to 1965 which showed its social origins and mode of control and helped to make an unanswerable case for root-and-branch modernisation. The sequel, In Search of Justice (1968), demonstrated the failings of the legal system as a social service. He served on [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] committees and in 1973 he co-wrote (with [[Michael Zander]]) Legal Problems and the Citizen.

===International expert adviser===

Parallel to his academic post at LSE and his appointments as special adviser to Labour governments, Abel-Smith regularly worked as a freelance consultant for international organisations, including the World Health Organization, the [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[World Bank]]. One of the first of these missions (for the British government in collaboration with Richard Titmuss) was to [[Mauritius]] (1959–1961), where their controversial recommendation to introduce a family planning service was adopted. After his death the Mauritius government issued a set of commemorative stamps to mark his contribution to the establishment of the country's health service.

In 1976 he was invited to become a [[European Economic Community]] [EEC] adviser to the Directorate of Social Affairs. He worked closely with the Commissioner [[Henk Vredeling]] on establishing European standards for healthcare and social welfare, especially on controlling costs of pharmaceuticals. In the early 1980s he was appointed to lead the European response to the WHO global initiative Health for All by the Year 2000, and in 1984 he accepted an invitation from [[Halfdan Mahler]], Director General of WHO, to become his personal adviser. During the 1980s and 1990s, Abel-Smith travelled widely to advise on country-level and regional policies. He continued to advocate policies based on socialist and egalitarian principles, which increasingly brought him into conflict with staff at the World Bank, whose neo-liberal ideology seemed to threaten core values of risk sharing and social capital in health and social welfare systems.

==Personal life==

Abel-Smith met his partner, the actor and landscape gardener John Sarbutt, in 1960. They lived between London and Westwell in Kent, where they created a large garden together. Abel-Smith was a fine cook and raconteur, and enjoyed skiing and swimming. In 1965 he founded an exclusive menswear business in Tryon Street, London, called Just Men. It thrived for nearly twenty years, expanding to a number of branches, including one in Philadelphia, with Abel-Smith and Sarbutt travelling each year to Italy to buy the latest styles. Regular customers included film stars and musicians such as The [[Rolling Stones]], [[Joan Collins]] and [[Warren Beatty]].

He died of carcinoma of the pancreas at his home in London, 10 Denbigh Street, Westminster, on 4 April 1996.

Possession of most drugs for recreational use, including [[cannabis]], is illegal in [[Poland]]. It was classified as a narcotic in 1951 but it was not until 1999 that possession and use of the drug became a crime. Since 2011, prosecutors have the discretion to drop the charges if the quantity of drugs seized is only a small amount. The medical use of cannabis was legalized in 2017.

==History==
Like in most countries, cannabis spread to Poland naturally, several thousand years ago.

The [[Second Polish Republic]] was one of the signatories to the 1925 [[International Opium Convention]], which entered into force in 1928, which imposed some restrictions on the trade and production of cannabis and related goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://css.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1962-01-01_4_page005.html|title=The cannabis problem: A note on the problem and the history of international action|last=|first=|date=|website=css.unodc.org|publisher=UNODC - Bulletin on Narcotics - 1962 Issue 4 - 004|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannabis was first explicitly mentioned in Polish legislation of 1930, and classified as harmful to health.&lt;ref name=PB186&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repozytorium.uwb.edu.pl/jspui/bitstream/11320/2597/1/P.Bo%C5%82tryk%20-%20rozprawa%20doktorska.pdf|title=KRYMINOLOGICZNE I PRAWNE ASPEKTY POSIADANIA NARKOTYKÓW W POLSCE (NA PRZYKŁADZIE POCHODNYCH KONOPI INNYCH NIŻ WŁÓKNISTE)|last=Bołtryk|first=Piotr|publisher=UNIWERSYTET W BIAŁYMSTOKU|year= 2014|isbn=|location= |pages=186|language=Polish|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Republic of Poland]]'s legislation of 1951 classified cannabis as a [[narcotic]], and successive legislation made production and dealing in it illegal, however possession and use were not a crime until 1997.&lt;ref name=PB188&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repozytorium.uwb.edu.pl/jspui/bitstream/11320/2597/1/P.Bo%C5%82tryk%20-%20rozprawa%20doktorska.pdf|title=KRYMINOLOGICZNE I PRAWNE ASPEKTY POSIADANIA NARKOTYKÓW W POLSCE (NA PRZYKŁADZIE POCHODNYCH KONOPI INNYCH NIŻ WŁÓKNISTE)|last=Bołtryk |first=Piotr |publisher=UNIWERSYTET W BIAŁYMSTOKU |year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=188-195|language=Polish|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish legislation of 1997 was the first that criminalized possession of narcotics, including cannabis.&lt;ref name=PB196&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repozytorium.uwb.edu.pl/jspui/bitstream/11320/2597/1/P.Bo%C5%82tryk%20-%20rozprawa%20doktorska.pdf|title=KRYMINOLOGICZNE I PRAWNE ASPEKTY POSIADANIA NARKOTYKÓW W POLSCE (NA PRZYKŁADZIE POCHODNYCH KONOPI INNYCH NIŻ WŁÓKNISTE)|last=Bołtryk|first=Piotr|publisher=UNIWERSYTET W BIAŁYMSTOKU|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=196-197|language=Polish|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decriminalization===
Since 2011 prosecutors can elect to drop the charges if the amount of drugs seized is of a limited quantity (although no set limit is explicitly stated) and the drugs seized are believed to be for personal consumption only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20051791485|title=Internetowy System Aktów Prawnych|author=Kancelaria Sejmu RP|work=sejm.gov.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2011, Poland introduced legislation that would give prosecutors the option to not prosecute for possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use, if it is a first offence, or if the person is drug dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poland Approves Drug Decriminalization -- Sort Of|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2011/jun/08/poland_approves_drug_decriminali|website= stopthedrugwar.org|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation raised the maximum possible penalty for dealing a large quantity of drugs from 10 to 12 years in prison, and the penalty for possession of large quantities of drugs would result in up to 10 years in prison (previously up to 8 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://fakty.interia.pl/fakty_dnia/news/narkotyki-w-malych-ilosciach-i-na-wlasny-uzytek-odstapienie,1644751 |title = Drugs in small quantity and for personal use with no punishment – Poland |publisher = Interia.pl |date = 26 May 2011 |accessdate = 2011-05-29 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110529134753/http://fakty.interia.pl/fakty_dnia/news/narkotyki-w-malych-ilosciach-i-na-wlasny-uzytek-odstapienie,1644751 |archivedate = 29 May 2011 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s following a growing movement in support of legalizing cannabis for medical use, Poland has moved towards decriminalizing cannabis, with governments discussing several legislation variants, including one proposed by the [[Kukiz'15]] party, and other forms of support from parties such as [[Twój Ruch]].&lt;ref name=PB251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75398,18183668,Dorocie_kazano_pogodzic_sie_ze_smiercia_dziecka__Mateusz.html| title= Dorocie kazano pogodzić się ze śmiercią dziecka, Mateusz przez dwa lata nie wychodził z domu.

==Use==
According to 2013 data, 17.3% adults in Poland had used cannabis at least once in their lifetime, and 17.1% of young adults used it at least once in the past year. There were signs that cannabis use is becoming popular.&lt;ref name=PB251&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repozytorium.uwb.edu.pl/jspui/bitstream/11320/2597/1/P.Bo%C5%82tryk%20-%20rozprawa%20doktorska.pdf|title=KRYMINOLOGICZNE I PRAWNE ASPEKTY POSIADANIA NARKOTYKÓW W POLSCE (NA PRZYKŁADZIE POCHODNYCH KONOPI INNYCH NIŻ WŁÓKNISTE)|last=Bołtryk|first=Piotr|publisher=UNIWERSYTET W BIAŁYMSTOKU|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=251-252|language=Polish|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18347">The '''Certification Commission for Health Information Technology''' ('''CCHIT''') was an independent, [[501(c)3]] nonprofit organization with the public mission of accelerating the adoption of robust, interoperable health information technology. The Commission certified electronic health record technology from 2006 until 2014. It was approved by the [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]] (ONC) of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) as an Authorized Testing and Certification Body (ONC-ATCB). The '''CCHIT Certified''' program is an independently developed certification that includes a rigorous inspection of an EHR’s integrated functionality, interoperability and security using  criteria developed by CCHIT’s broadly representative, expert work groups. These products may also be certified in the ONC-ATCB certification program.

==History==
CCHIT was founded in 2004 with support from three leading industry associations in healthcare information management and technology: the [[American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA)]], the [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society|Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)]] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060105024710/http://www.nahit.org/ National Alliance for Health Information Technology] (the Alliance). In September 2005, CCHIT was awarded a 3-year contract by the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to develop and evaluate the certification criteria and inspection process for EHRs and the networks through which they interoperate. In October 2006, HHS officially designated CCHIT as a Recognized Certification Body (RCB).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (October 26, 2006): [https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2006pres/20061026a.html HHS Officially Recognizes Certification Body to Evaluate Electronic Health Records] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103211255/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2006pres/20061026a.html |date=January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, HHS published new rules for recognizing testing and certification bodies, scheduled to take effect when it named the new bodies. In September 2010, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) of HHS named CCHIT again under these new rules. CCHIT is an ONC Authorized Testing and Certification Body (ONC-ATCB).

==Goals==

* Reduce the risk of [[Healthcare Information Technology]] (HIT) [[investment]] by [[physician]]s and other providers
* Ensure [[interoperability]] (compatibility) of HIT products
* Assure payers and purchasers providing incentives for [[electronic health record]]s (EHR) adoption that the [[return on investment|ROI]] will be improved quality
* Protect the [[privacy]] of patients' [[Personal health record|personal health information]].

==Operations==
CCHIT focused its first efforts on [[Wiktionary:ambulatory|ambulatory]] [[Electronic health record|EHR]] products&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cchit.org/work/criteria.htm Public postings of CCHIT work products for the ambulatory domain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514070454/http://www.cchit.org/work/criteria.htm |date=May 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the office-based [[physician]] and provider and began commercial certification in May 2006.

CCHIT then developed a process of certification for [[inpatient]] EHR products&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cchit.org/work/inpatient+criteria.htm Public postings of CCHIT work products for the inpatient domain]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108072852/http://www.cchit.org/work/inpatient%2Bcriteria.htm |date=January 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched that program in 2007.

CCHIT then assessed the need for, and potential benefit of, certifying EHR for specialty medicine, special care settings, and special-needs populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cchit.org/media/press+releases/CCHIT+Expands+Electronic+Health+Record+Certification+to+Specialties.htm CCHIT to Expand Electronic Health Record Certification to Some Specialties]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208082716/http://www.cchit.org/media/press%2Breleases/CCHIT%2BExpands%2BElectronic%2BHealth%2BRecord%2BCertification%2Bto%2BSpecialties.htm |date=December 8, 2006 }} (November 28, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cchit.org/vendors/learn/Certifying+EHR+for+Specialty+Medicine+and+Special+Care+Settings.htm CCHIT: Certifying EHR for Specialty Medicine and Special Care Settings]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCHIT, in a collaboration with the [[MITRE Corporation]], also developed an open-source program called [[Laika (EHR testing framework)|Laika]] to test EHR software for compliance with federally named interoperability standards.

In January 2014, Information Week reported that CCHIT would exit the EHR certification business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCHIT Exits EHR Certification Business - InformationWeek|url = http://www.informationweek.com/healthcare/policy-and-regulation/cchit-exits-ehr-certification-business/d/d-id/1113632|website = InformationWeek|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 14, 2014, CCHIT ceased all operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cchit.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213144951/https://www.cchit.org/ |archivedate=2016-12-13 |df= }} Retrieved January 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioners==
The Commission, chaired by Karen Bell, M.D., M.M.S, was composed of 21 members each serving two-year terms.

==Stakeholders==
Certified [[Electronic health record|EHR]] products benefit many interested groups and individuals:
* [[Physician]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[health care system]]s, [[Social safety net|safety net provider]]s, [[public health]] agencies and other purchasers of [[Health informatics|HIT]] products, who seek [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[interoperability]], data [[:wikt:portability|portability]] and [[security]]
* Purchasers and payers – from government to the private sector – who are prepared to offer financial incentives for [[Health informatics|HIT]] adoption but need the assurance of having a mechanism in place to ensure that products deliver the expected benefits
* [[Quality improvement organizations]] that seek out an efficient means of measuring that criteria have been assessed and met
* [[Standardization|Standard]]s development and [[Information technology|informatics]] experts that gain consensus on [[Standardization|standard]]s
* [[Vendor]]s who benefit from having to meet a single set of criteria and from having a voice in the process
* [[Healthcare]] [[consumer]]s, ultimately the most important stakeholders, who will benefit from a reliable, [[accurate]] and [[Security|secure]] [[medical record|record]] of their [[health]]

CCHIT and its volunteer work groups strove to fairly represent the interests of each of these diverse groups in an open forum, communicating the progress of its work and seeking input from all quarters. CCHIT received the endorsements of a number of professional medical organizations, including the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[American College of Physicians]], the Physicians' Foundation for Health Systems Excellence and Physicians' Foundation for Health Systems Innovation.

&lt;!-- ==Controversies==
{{POV-section}}
===CCHIT as a "Recognized Certification Body"===

The collusion of government with the private sector under the umbrella of forming an official "recognized certification body" is worrisome. This collaboration will stifle innovation, markedly decrease competition by smaller vendors with less costly electronic medical record (EMR) products, and add a layer of fees and costs that is unnecessary. The growth of health information technology in the United States was already growing at an {{cite web
 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/electronic/electronic.htm
 | title = increasingly healthier rate
}}in the previous 5 years driven by decreasing EMR prices.

This involvement by government has set up an environment where physician consumers will now have to purchase much higher priced "certified" EMR systems. Abuse will be seen on both ends of this process- on the government side by the use of mechanisms such as {{cite web
 | url = http://www.heritage.org/Research/HealthCare/bg1882.cfm
 | title = pay-for-performance to further decrease physician reimbursement. 
}}In the private sector the large, powerful vendors which control CCHIT from within will profit from the fees paid for certification, and also will profit from the loss of competition from smaller vendors unable to pay for the high cost of certification. 

CCHIT blurs the truth of their goals as stated above. Mr. David Merritt, project director at the Center for Health Transformation states that CCHIT should strive "to make the process as easy as possible for people so as not to price out those smaller vendors." Unfortunately, Mr. Merritt’s advice was ignored.

The most important issue that CCHIT is supposed to address, but hasn’t (and doesn't plan to address fully through 2008), is interoperability. The Continuity of Care Record (CCR) interoperability standard from ASTM International, is a proven method for sharing a patient’s health information between care providers. The cost for vendors to implement the CCR standard is minimal and already vendors are being verified by entities such as the American Academy of Family Practice. CCHIT instead focuses more on “enterprise” type functionality that would never be used by an individual provider or small group practices. This is especially disturbing when you consider that individual providers and small group practices represent {{cite web
 | url = http://www.rwjf.org/files/publications/other/EHRReport0609.pdf
 | title = 88% 
}}of all practicing physicians.

CCHIT also does not certify an EMR system will be truly functional for the purchasing physician office. It only tests a set of preordained list of features some of which are inappropriate or simply unwanted by the vast majority of purchasing offices.
{{cite web
 | url = http://ihealthbeat.org/index.cfm?Action=dspItem&amp;itemID=125749
 | title = Cost is the main barrier 
}}to the growth of HIT. The only real way to increase the use of health information technology is to make EMR systems much less expensive, not by some esoteric certification-based "assurance" theory.

===Controversy Over Insider Stakeholders===

One of the 3 organizations that incorporated CCHIT, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), is a trade association which comprised 20 of the biggest EMR vendors in the United States when CCHIT was founded. In financial disclosure documents posted {{cite web
 | url =  http://www.cchit.org/ 
 | title = on their website 
}}it is noted that CCHIT is a not-for-profit LLC owned, operated, and managed by many of the same vendors and affiliated staff. Their own incorporation papers state that: "Any profits that are made by CCHIT are disbursed among the same CCHIT vendor-owners at year's end." An obvious conflict of interest arises for not only suppression of competition but by forcing small business vendors to lose profits by paying large fees that eventually flow to the competition who are the actual owner/operators of the CCHIT organization. For the fiscal year 2006 their own Commission meeting minutes has an income statement: "...we could end up with net income of one million dollars at the end of the fiscal year, which is December [2006]."

It also {{cite web
 | url =  http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/html/news/NewsStory.cfm?articleId=14285
 | title = has been noted 
}}that HIMSS has in the past made lavish payments to Congressional lawmakers as a powerful lobbyist for the nonprofit CCHIT organization.

===Controversy: Future Effect on Competition, EMR Adoption, and EMR Prices===
The CCHIT certification process flies against everything that living in the United States stands for- free enterprise, decreased taxes and user fees, increased innovation, increased heterogeneity of choice, and finally the growth of the American HIT industry into world leadership.

The typical CCHIT EMRs are almost twice as expensive as that of non-CCHIT EMRs using an {{cite web
 | url =  http://www.emrupdate.com/resources/pricecomparisons.aspx 
 | title = established price comparison matrix. 
}}This divide will worsen, as CCHIT will likely end competition from free, open source, and low cost EMR products and will affect the viability of not only small to many mid-level EMR vendors, but also physician offices alike by markedly increasing the cost of HIT. CCHIT has won the backing of big government, of the large insurance industry, and even of a small handful of medical societies. It has been able to collect a large sum of money to conduct its activities. Even with all of this, it's overall survivability still is tenuous. The second phase of certification saw 6 of 17 EMR vendors quit the process. CCHIT must also strive to win over the hearts, minds, and financial support of those physicians who work in small to medium sized offices in the United States.

Various factors involving the timing, the right players, market history, utility, governance play a key role in the overall enrichment of the standard and certification development. The standardization and certification even though seem to bring uniformity in the EMR development, do not guarantee their acceptability and sustainability in the long run. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nainil C. Chheda, MS | year = 2007 | month = January | title = Standardization &amp; Certification: The truth just sounds different | journal = Application of Healthcare Governance | url = http://www.nainil.com/research/whitepapers/Standardization_and_Certification.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upcoming year (2007) will determine whether vendors and physicians alike are willing to practice under this CCHIT cartel and pay the extra costs associated with certification. Even {{cite web
 | url = http://www.health-itworld.com/newsitems/2006/may/05-25-06-tepr
 | title = Mark Leavitt MD  
}}recently said that ''"certification will help business. If you don’t see an acceleration in the [EHR] market, then we’ve failed.”'' If this becomes a reality, then a smaller, less onerous to competition, less costly and a fairer system focusing on interoperability verification would most likely become the more accepted and  successful process to advance HIT for the healthcare system in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25204">'''Children with Special Healthcare Needs''' (CSHCN) are defined by the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] as: 
:"Those who have one or more chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions and who 
:also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally" &lt;ref name="McPherson"&gt;McPherson, M., P. Arango, H. Fox, C. Lauver, M. McManus, P. W. Newacheck, J. M. Perrin, J. P. Shonkoff, and B. Strickland. "A New Definition of Children With Special Health Care Needs." Pediatrics 102.1 (1998): 137-39. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of special healthcare needs==
There are a wide variety of physical, mental, and psychological health conditions considered to be special healthcare needs in the United States. They range from relatively mild to chronic and severe. The functional impairments of CSHCN include problems with one or more of the following criteria: breathing, swallowing/digestion/metabolism, blood circulation, chronic pain, hearing even with corrective devices, seeing even with corrective devices, taking care of self, coordination/moving around, learning/understanding/paying attention, speaking/communicating, making/keeping friends, and behavior.&lt;ref name="Data"&gt;National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. NS-CSHCN 2009/10. Data query from the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative, Data Resource Center for Child and Adolescent Health website. Retrieved [10/25/12] from www.childhealthdata.org&lt;/ref&gt; The list below states health conditions considered to be special healthcare needs.

==Population==
As of 2009, 15.1% of all children in the US are considered to have special healthcare needs,&lt;ref name="Context"&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Children with Special Health Care Needs in Context: A Portrait of States and the Nation 2007. Rockville, Maryland: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and one out of every five households in the United States has at least one child with special healthcare needs, representing a significant segment of the nation's population.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt;

===Epidemiology===
The prevalence of children with special healthcare needs in the population depends on several factors, including gender, age, socioeconomic level and family household education.&lt;ref name="Epidemiologic"&gt;Newacheck PW; Strickland B; Shonkoff JP; Perrin JM; McPherson M; McManus M; Lauver C; Fox H; Arango, P. "An Epidemiologic Profile Of Children With Special Health Care Needs." Pediatrics 102.1 Pt 1 (1998): 117-123. MEDLINE. Web. 29 Nov. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the National Survey of Children's Health Data in 2007, gender is the strongest predictor of special health care needs—about 60% of children with special health care needs are boys and 30% are girls.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; A study by Newacheck et al. found that age is also a strong predictor, as school-age children are found to be twice as likely as toddlers to require special needs care, and this prevalence continues to increase as children grow older.&lt;ref name="Epidemiologic"/&gt; Families with income below the [[Poverty in the United States|federal poverty level]] are 1/3 more likely to have children with special health care needs, and families with 12 or fewer years of education have increased prevalence of a child with SHCN as well.&lt;ref name="Epidemiologic"/&gt; Family structure also correlates with this prevalence—for [[Single parent|single-mother]] families are 40% more likely to have a CSHCN than two-parent households.&lt;ref name="Epidemiologic"/&gt;

===Challenges===
In a comprehensive study by the U.S. [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), using the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health data, it was found that children with SHCN when compared to those children without SHCN, face more inadequacies in healthcare, education, health of family, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; CSHCN face more difficulties with accessing mental health care &lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; as well as having a [[medical home]]. A medical home is one of the standards of administering healthcare recommended by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau.&lt;ref name="AAP"/&gt; In school, these children have an increased risk of missing class, being disengaged in the classroom, and repeating a grade.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; They also have more cases of inadequate sleep every night in comparison to their peers.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; CSHCN are more likely to not exercise the recommended four times a week, and they have higher chance of being overweight/obese.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; They also face increased challenges in making friends.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; The parents of CSHCN have challenges as well. The study by HRSA, found that the parents of special needs children experience more stress, decreased health, and more questioning of their parenting skills.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt;

Despite these challenges, children with SHCN fare better than non-affected children in preventative health care and preventative dental care.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; They have a higher rate of having health insurance then normal children.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; They more frequently complete the recommended annual primary care visit, and bi-annual dentist visit.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; They also have a tendency to use more Developmental Screening, especially those with public healthcare.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; Developmental screening is used by doctors to check and evaluate for proper child development over time on a physical and cognitive level. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends visits for developmental screening at ages 9,18 and at 24–30 months.&lt;ref name="Developmental"&gt;Developmental Monitoring and Screening." Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 12 July 2012. Web. 29 Nov. 2012. &lt;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/screening.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges for CSHCN with emotional and behavioral disorders===
[[Emotional and behavioral disorders]] (EBD) are disorders that include ADD/ADHD, anxiety, ASD, depression, OCD/conduct disorder, developmental delay and Tourette's Syndrome, and they increase the challenges CSHCN face.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; 40% of CSHCN have an EBD and 80% of these children also experience another health problem along with their EBD, according to the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; The Health Resources and Services Administration found that these disorders are associated with an even greater decrease in quality of family-life, education and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; Parent's health worsens and stress increases when they have children with an EBD.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; These EBD children miss more classes and are more disengaged in class than non-EBD CSHCN.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; EBD-CSHCN experience reduced family center-care and effective care-coordination.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; They also face greater difficulty in their ability to make friends than non-EBD CSHCN.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt;

===Effective Support for Families===
A systematic review of randomized controlled trials found evidence that

* Including parents in psychological therapies to help children manage painful conditions was effective;
* Cognitive behavioral therapy that includes parents reduces primary symptoms;
* Problem solving therapy for parents improves their skills and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eccleston, C |author2=Palermo, TM |author3=Fisher, E |title= Psychological interventions for parents of children and adolescents with chronic illness |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2012 |volume=8|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009660|display-authors=etal|pmc=3551454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United states government involvement==
The United States governments employs several different programs in order to provide insurance and care for CSHCN. These include Title V grants, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). These three programs vary in their definition and eligibility of care for CSHCN.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt;

===Medicaid===
[[Medicaid]] is the program implemented under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.&lt;ref name="Title XIX"&gt;United States. TITLE XIX—GRANTS TO STATES FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. Social Security Act §1900. Web. 29 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1900.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a public insurance program that provides mandatory services for patients such as: 
*Inpatient/outpatient hospital resources
*Transportation for non-emergency medical care 
*Home health services
*Laboratory procedures
*Physician services 
*[[Family planning]] 
*Nursing facilities 
*Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPDST) program 
*Tobacco cessation programs for pregnant women
Medicaid requires no co-payment or deductibles. To be eligible for the program one must be in one of four categories. The first is income level, the second is disability criteria, the third is eligibility for institutional level of care, and the fourth is out of home placement. Many CSHCN qualify for Medicaid based on low income level, but some children qualify independently of income level due to their disabilities. Medicaid has a more restrictive definition of disabilities and special healthcare needs than the Maternal and Children's Health Bureau (MCHB), and defines special needs as needs that must impede daily functioning. Medicaid accepts children who need to receive Supplemental Security Income program money, and children who are defined as medically needy.&lt;ref name="Title XIX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt; Medically needy children are those whose families have above the maximum income to receive Medicaid, but due to health expenditures their income is lowered to the level required. 40 states currently offer this program.&lt;ref name="Medically Needy"&gt;Crowley, Jeff. "Medicaid Medically Needy Programs: An Important Source of Medicaid Coverage." Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2003. Web. 29 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.kff.org/medicaid/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicaid programs in each state are administered differently, and federal dollars go to each state based on per capita income levels. As of 2010, the Medicaid program had 405 billion dollars for the entire program. With the new [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], by 2014 state Medicaid levels will rise to 138% of the Federal Poverty Line, increasing the number of CSHCN receiving Medicaid.&lt;ref name="Title XIX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt;

===Children's health insurance program===
This program, the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIP), was created with Title XXI of the Social Security Act,&lt;ref name="Title XXI"&gt;"TITLE XXI—STATE CHILDREN’S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM." Social Security Act Title XXI. USA Government, n.d. Web. 29 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title21/2100.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is meant to cover the gap between children who qualify for Medicaid and those who can afford private insurance.&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt; It covers children up to nineteen years of age and many states also choose to help insure pregnant women. 46 of the states and the District of Columbia insure up to 200% of the Federal Poverty Line. CHIP receives its funding from the federal government but it is capped, unlike Medicaid. CSHCN who use CHIP receive all of the same federally mandated programs that Medicaid must offer. The program also requires that mental health services be offered as equally as physical health services.&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Title XXI"/&gt;

===Title V===
This [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] Act, Title V, states that $850,000,000 in grant money is to be allotted starting in 2001 and every year after to the states in order to accomplish health goals of the Public Health Service Act as well as the goals of Title V. The Title V grant money is set out to specifically affect CSHCN in several ways. First, it requires states to provide rehabilitation services for blind or disabled individuals under the age of 16. It also allocates money to projects of both national and state importance that help maternal and child health as well as children with special healthcare needs. The act requires that there are community-based programs such as daycare that help provide for CSHCN. Another requirement is the creation of family-to-family health information centers that assist families with CSHCN to make informed decisions regarding healthcare and resources.&lt;ref name="Title V"&gt;Title V "Social Security Act 501." Social Security Online. USA Government, n.d. Web. 25 Oct. 2012. &lt;http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0501.htm.&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

This program works with the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]], and employs their definition of CSHCN as stated earlier. Title V does not provide as much money as CHIP or Medicaid, but is used to fill the gaps where these programs do not cover. The Title V money is used to help with the Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment Program (EPSDT) that is employed by Medicaid to test children. Title V shares the data collection responsibility of these three programs as well as develops educational materials. The Title V programs also have the goal to promote community-based services for all children as well as to promote coordinated care for families.&lt;ref name="Title V"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic"&gt;Rosenthal, Jill, Mary Hendersen, Catherine Hess, Carol Tobias, Sara Bachman, and Meg Comeau. "Public Insurance Programs and Children with Special Health Care Needs, A Tutorial on the Basics of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program." (2011): n. pag. Web. 25 Oct. 2012 &lt;http://www.nashp.org/sites/default/files/Medicaid_101_tutorial.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood Care==
Children with special healthcare needs require more healthcare for their various health conditions as well as more types of therapies and treatments.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; Therapies include [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], and [[speech-language pathology]] among others.

===Medical home===
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) medical home model is the suggested form of healthcare administration for children with special health care needs due to their increased healthcare needs.&lt;ref name="AAP"/&gt; In a study by Judith Palfrey et al. it was found to indicate improved health and increase patient satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Evaluation"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Palfrey Judith S., MD , Sofis Lisa A., Davidson Emily J., Liu Jihong, PhD , Freeman Linda, -1#PhD MS, Ganz Michael L. | year = 2004 | title = The Pediatric Alliance for Coordinated Care: Evaluation of a Medical Home Model | url = http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/113/Supplement_4/1507.short | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 1507–516 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model as defined by the AAP is a total coordination of care for infants, children and adolescents. It consists of a primary physician, preferably a pediatrician, that a child and their family know well and who is a medical advocate for the care of the child. All medical care in the medical home is accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, compassionate and coordinated.&lt;ref name="AAP"/&gt; This model requires several elements:  
*Provision of preventative care
*Assurance of ambulatory/inpatient care at any time
*Provision of care over a long period of time
*Ability to identify need for sub-specialists and to make these referrals
*Interaction with the school and community programs of a child to work with a child's special needs
*Central record keeping data base
The pediatrician assumes the ultimate responsibility for all care that is provided for the child even though other medical professionals are involved.&lt;ref name="AAP"&gt;"The Medical Home." Pediatrics 90.5 (1992): 774. The Medical Home. Pediatrics, 1992. Web. 25 Oct. 2012 &lt;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/90/5/774.abstract&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 48.9% of CSHCN have access to a medical home while 59.6% of non-affected children have access to a medical home. 
.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt;

===Therapy for CSHCN===
Therapies for children with special healthcare needs can be accessed via public schools or private therapists. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]]  (IDEA) includes occupational and physical therapy as well as other therapies, as part of the [[special education]] that should be offered in all public schools to CSHCN. This act states that all children with disabilities should have access to education that suits their SHCN, including needed therapies.&lt;ref name="OTPT"&gt;Bober, Patricia, MS, OT, and Sandra Corbett, PT. "Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy: A Resource and Planning Guide." Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, 2011. Web. 29 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://sped.dpi.wi.gov/files/sped/pdf/ot-pt-guide-2nd-edition.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IDEA"&gt;Assistance to States for the Education of Children With Disabilities and Preschool Grants for Children With Disabilities, 71 C.F.R. § 300 and 301 et seq. (2006). Web. 29 Nov 2012. &lt;http://idea.ed.gov/download/finalregulations.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Out of school therapies can also be used be employed by children with SHCN but 
only 3.2% of CSHCN qualify for uses of special therapy under their insurance programs.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt;

One type of therapy for children with SHCN is occupational therapy. Occupational therapists work with CSHCN by supporting them and their families to learn how to participate in everyday routines and daily activities. They encourage children with physical, cognitive, communication and behavior challenges to develop ways to live, play, learn and make friends despite their special needs.&lt;ref name="AOTA"&gt;
"Occupational Therapy for Young Children." The American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. AOTA, n.d. Web. 29 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.aota.org/Consumers/Professionals/WhatIsOT/CY/Fact-Sheets/Children.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational therapists can work with these children and their schools to create more accommodating learning environments. Another skill these professionals teach to  children with SHCN is how to use adaptive equipment such as wheelchairs, eating aids and braces in daily life. Some occupational therapists try to work with very young children at risk for SHCN in order to try and prevent future disability through occupational therapy.&lt;ref name="Labor"&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2012-13 Edition, Occupational Therapists, 
on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/occupational-therapists.htm (visited November 29, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance for CSHCN===
The types of insurance vary for children with special healthcare needs, 9.3% of CSHCN have no insurance at all, 52.4% have private insurance, 35.9% have public insurance and 8.2% have some combination of both public and private.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; Insurance gaps and other health costs affect 21.6% of families with CSHCN, who state that they face financial problems due to their CSHCN. In total, 34.3% of these families believe that their current insurance is not adequate in providing for all of their additional healthcare costs.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt;

==Adult care==
The Maternal and Child Health Bureau requires services to be available that are necessary for CSHCN to transition to all aspects of adult life.&lt;ref name="Evidence"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Homer Charles J., Klatka Kirsten, Romm Diane, Kulthau Karen, Bloom Sheila, Newacheck Paul, Jeanne , Cleave Van, Perrin James M. | year = 2008 | title = A Review of the Evidence for the Medical Home for Children With Special Health Care Needs | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/122/4/e922.full.html | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 122 | issue = | pages = 922–37 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  90% of Adolescents with SHCN (ASHCN) are expected to live into adulthood, and access to healthcare decreases as ASHCN grow older according to the Maternal and Child Health Bureau.&lt;ref name="Association"/&gt; Youth lose health coverage they received in the past from programs like CHIP as well as Supplemental Security Income once they reach the ages of 18-21. Adult healthcare providers are not as familiar with childhood onset conditions as pediatricians.&lt;ref name="Association"&gt;"Youth and Young Adult Transition- Children’s Medical Service." Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, May 2011. Web. 12 Nov. 2012 &lt;http://www.amchp.org/programsandtopics/BestPractices/InnovationStation/ISDocs/CMS-CSHCN%20transitions.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Jane Park et al. found that mental health conditions increase in prevalence as children get older and age into adulthood, and ASHCN who have mental health conditions (with or without physical conditions) fare worse on their transition to adult healthcare.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21296043 | doi=10.1016/j.acap.2010.11.010 | volume=11 | title=Health care services and the transition to young adulthood: challenges and opportunities | year=2011 | journal=Acad Pediatr | pages=115–22 |vauthors=Park MJ, Adams SH, Irwin CE }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCHB recommends that children should have their transition to adult healthcare be mediated and provided for by their doctors. The Bureau requires that doctors need to have discussed with the adolescents with SHCN and their families three points: how to transition to adult primary care doctors as opposed to pediatricians, how health needs will change as the youth become adults, and how to maintain health insurance as an adult. The doctor is also supposed to encourage youth to take responsibility for their own health needs.&lt;ref name="Association"/&gt; Currently 60% of doctors of adolescents with SHCN do not meet these criteria.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt;

===Healthcare transition plan===

Another recommendation for healthcare providers by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau is the creation of a written Healthcare Transition (HCT) plan.&lt;ref name="Association"/&gt; According to a study by Peter Scal and Marjorie Ireland, 30.08%  of ASHCN had discussed such a plan. It was also found that adolescents who were older and who had more complicated needs were more likely to have an HCT.&lt;ref name="Transition"&gt;Scal, Peter, MD. MPH, and Marjorie Ireland, PhD. "Addressing Transition to Adult Health Care for Adolescents With Special Health Care Needs." Pediatrics 115.6 (2005): 1607-612. Addressing Transition to Adult Health Care for Adolescents With Special Health Care Needs. Web. 12 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/115/6/1607.full&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient protection and affordable care act===
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by the Obama administration in 2010 sets forth new requirements for ability of adolescents with SHCN to transition healthcare services from pediatric services. The Act also expands their ability to pay for and access these services.&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;Pub.L. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119, to be codified as amended at scattered sections of the Internal Revenue Code and in 42 U.S.C.&lt;/ref&gt; It states three criteria that must be met for adolescents. First, adolescents need to have access to a comprehensive healthcare system that they can find a way to pay for, as well as be able to navigate the system. Second, preventable health problems need to be successfully prevented. Third, chronic conditions need to be managed and the transition to adult healthcare needs to be assured. Skills that ASHCN are recommended to possess to accomplish these goals include the ability to describe their own illness, know their own medication and dosages, know how to contact a clinician, and the ability to schedule appointments and call in for refills.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;

'''Choroideremia''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|ˌ|r|ɔɪ|d|ᵻ|ˈ|r|iː|m|i|ə}}; '''CHM''') is a rare, [[X-linked]] [[recessive]] form of hereditary [[retina]]l degeneration that affects roughly 1 in 50,000 males. The disease causes a gradual loss of vision, starting with childhood [[Nyctalopia|night blindness]], followed by peripheral vision loss, and progressing to loss of central vision later in life. Progression continues throughout the individual's life, but both the rate of change and the degree of visual loss are variable among those affected, even within the same family.&lt;ref name = "Karna"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kärnä|first1=J|title=Choroideremia. A clinical and genetic study of 84 Finnish patients and 126 female carriers.|journal=Acta Ophthalmologica Supplement|date=1986|volume=176|pages=1–68|pmid=3014804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choroideremia is caused by a [[null allele|loss-of-function]] mutation in the ''CHM'' [[gene]] which encodes [[Rab escort protein 1]] (REP1), a protein involved in lipid modification of [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab proteins]]. While the complete mechanism of disease is not fully understood, the lack of a functional protein in the retina results in cell death and the gradual deterioration of the  [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE), [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], and the [[choroid]].&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=MF|last2=Fishman|first2=GA|last3=Roberts|first3=DK|last4=Heckenlively|first4=JR|last5=Weleber|first5=RG|last6=Anderson|first6=RJ|last7=Grover|first7=S|title=Retrospective, longitudinal, and cross sectional study of visual acuity impairment in choroideraemia.|journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology|date=June 2002|volume=86|issue=6|pages=658–62|pmid=12034689|doi=10.1136/bjo.86.6.658|pmc=1771148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aleman|first1=TS|last2=Han|first2=G|last3=Serrano|first3=LW|last4=Fuerst|first4=NM|last5=Charlson|first5=ES|last6=Pearson|first6=DJ|last7=Chung|first7=DC|last8=Traband|first8=A|last9=Pan|first9=W|last10=Ying|first10=GS|last11=Bennett|first11=J|last12=Maguire|first12=AM|last13=Morgan|first13=JI|title=Natural History of the Central Structural Abnormalities in Choroideremia: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study.|journal=Ophthalmology|date=13 December 2016|doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2016.10.022|pmid=27986385|volume=124|issue=3|pmc=5319901|pages=359–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, there is no treatment for choroideremia; however, [[Gene therapy of the human retina|retinal]] [[gene therapy]] clinical trials have demonstrated a possible treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail Beall, 2014, "Gene therapy restores sight in people with eye disease," ''New Scientist'' (online), January 16, 2014, see [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24879-gene-therapy-restores-sight-in-people-with-eye-disease.html#.VTkaJTf_SOJ], accessed 21 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==

Since the ''CHM'' gene is located on the [[X chromosome]], symptoms are seen almost exclusively in men. While there are a few exceptions, female [[genetic carrier|carriers]] have a noticeable lack of pigmentation in the RPE but do not experience any symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dugel|first1=Pravin U.|last2=Zimmer|first2=Cheryl N.|last3=Shahidi|first3=Ayda M.|title=A case study of choroideremia carrier – Use of multi-spectral imaging in highlighting clinical features|journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology Case Reports|date=July 2016|volume=2|pages=18–22|doi=10.1016/j.ajoc.2016.04.003|pmid=29503891|pmc=5757363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female carriers have a 50% chance of having either an affected son or a carrier daughter, while a male with choroideremia will have all carrier daughters and unaffected sons.
Even though the disease progression can vary significantly,&lt;ref name = "Karna"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Strunnikova|first1=N|last2=Zein|first2=WM|last3=Silvin|first3=C|last4=MacDonald|first4=IM|title=Serum biomarkers and trafficking defects in peripheral tissues reflect the severity of retinopathy in three brothers affected by choroideremia.|journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|date=2012|volume=723|pages=381–7|pmid=22183356|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-0631-0_49|isbn=978-1-4614-0630-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are general trends. The first symptom many individuals with choroideremia notice is a significant loss of night vision, which begins in youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=Kamron N.|last2=Islam|first2=Farrah|last3=Moore|first3=Anthony T.|last4=Michaelides|first4=Michel|title=Clinical and Genetic Features of Choroideremia in Childhood|journal=Ophthalmology|date=October 2016|volume=123|issue=10|pages=2158–2165|doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2016.06.051|pmid=27506488|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1508714/|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peripheral vision]] loss occurs gradually, starting as a ring of vision loss, and continuing on to "tunnel vision" in adulthood.&lt;ref name = "GeneReviews"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=Ian M.|last2=Hume|first2=Stacey|last3=Chan|first3=Stephanie|last4=Seabra|first4=Miguel C.|title=Choroideremia|journal=GeneReviews(®)|date=February 26, 2015|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1337/|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with choroideremia tend to maintain good [[visual acuity]] into their 40s, but eventual lose all sight at some point in the 50-70 age range.&lt;ref name = "GeneReviews"/&gt; A study of 115 individuals with choroideremia found that 84% of patients under the age of 60 had a visual acuity of [[Snellen chart|20/40]] or better, while 33% of patients over 60 years old had a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. The most severe visual acuity impairment (only being able to count fingers or worse) did not occur until the seventh decade of life. The same study found the mean rate of visual acuity loss to be about 0.09 [[logMAR chart|logMAR]] per 5 years, which is roughly 1 row on a [[Snellen chart]].&lt;ref name = "Roberts"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

A diagnosis of choroideremia can be made based on family history, symptoms, and the characteristic appearance of the [[fundus (eye)|fundus]].&lt;ref name = "Barnard"/&gt; However, choroideremia shares several clinical features with [[retinitis pigmentosa]], a similar but broader group of retinal degenerative diseases, making a specific diagnosis difficult without genetic testing. Because of this choroideremia is often initially misdiagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Hui|last2=Li|first2=Jisheng|last3=Gao|first3=Fei|last4=Li|first4=Jiangxia|last5=Wu|first5=Xinyi|last6=Liu|first6=Qiji|title=Whole-exome sequencing reveals a novel CHM gene mutation in a family with choroideremia initially diagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa|journal=BMC Ophthalmology|date=28 July 2015|volume=15|issue=1|pages=85|doi=10.1186/s12886-015-0081-4|pmid=26216097|pmc=4517409}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of different [[genetic testing|genetic testing techniques]] can be used to make a differential diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanchez-Alcudia|first1=Rocio|last2=Garcia-Hoyos|first2=Maria|last3=Lopez-Martinez|first3=Miguel Angel|last4=Sanchez-Bolivar|first4=Noelia|last5=Zurita|first5=Olga|last6=Gimenez|first6=Ascension|last7=Villaverde|first7=Cristina|last8=Rodrigues-Jacy da Silva|first8=Luciana|last9=Corton|first9=Marta|last10=Perez-Carro|first10=Raquel|last11=Torriano|first11=Simona|last12=Kalatzis|first12=Vasiliki|last13=Rivolta|first13=Carlo|last14=Avila-Fernandez|first14=Almudena|last15=Lorda|first15=Isabel|last16=Trujillo-Tiebas|first16=Maria J.|last17=Garcia-Sandoval|first17=Blanca|last18=Lopez-Molina|first18=Maria Isabel|last19=Blanco-Kelly|first19=Fiona|last20=Riveiro-Alvarez|first20=Rosa|last21=Ayuso|first21=Carmen|last22=Janecke|first22=Andreas R.|title=A Comprehensive Analysis of Choroideremia: From Genetic Characterization to Clinical Practice|journal=PLOS ONE|date=12 April 2016|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0151943|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0151943|pmid=27070432|pmc=4829155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furgoch|first1=MJ|last2=Mewes-Arès|first2=J|last3=Radziwon|first3=A|last4=Macdonald|first4=IM|title=Molecular genetic diagnostic techniques in choroideremia.|journal=Molecular Vision|date=25 April 2014|volume=20|pages=535–44|pmid=24791138|pmc=4000712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

While nothing currently can be done to stop or reverse the retinal degeneration, there are steps that can be taken to slow the rate of vision loss. UV-blocking sunglasses for outdoors, appropriate dietary intake of fresh fruit and leafy green vegetables, antioxidant vitamin supplements, and regular intake of dietary omega-3 very-long-chain fatty acids are all recommended.&lt;ref name = "GeneReviews"/&gt; 
One study found that a dietary supplement of [[lutein]] increases [[Macula of retina|macular pigment]] levels in patients with choroideremia. Over a long period of time, these elevated levels of pigmentation could slow retinal degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duncan|first1=JL|last2=Aleman|first2=TS|last3=Gardner|first3=LM|last4=De Castro|first4=E|last5=Marks|first5=DA|last6=Emmons|first6=JM|last7=Bieber|first7=ML|last8=Steinberg|first8=JD|last9=Bennett|first9=J|last10=Stone|first10=EM|last11=MacDonald|first11=IM|last12=Cideciyan|first12=AV|last13=Maguire|first13=MG|last14=Jacobson|first14=SG|title=Macular pigment and lutein supplementation in choroideremia.|journal=Experimental Eye Research|date=March 2002|volume=74|issue=3|pages=371–81|doi=10.1006/exer.2001.1126|pmid=12014918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional interventions that may be needed include surgical correction of retinal detachment and cataracts, low vision services, and  counseling to help cope with depression, loss of independence, and anxiety over job loss.&lt;ref name = "GeneReviews"/&gt;

===Gene therapy===
{{See also|Gene therapy of the human retina}}
Gene therapy is currently not a treatment option, however human [[clinical trials]] for both choroideremia and [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]] (LCA) have produced somewhat promising results.&lt;ref name=GhoshBBC11&gt;Pallab Ghosh, 2011, "Health: Gene therapy used in a bid to save a man's sight," at ''BBC News'' (online), October 27, 2011, see [https://www.bbc.com/news/health-15446912], accessed 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the first gene therapy treatment for choroideremia was administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacLaren|first1=RE|last2=Groppe|first2=M|last3=Barnard|first3=AR|last4=Cottriall|first4=CL|last5=Tolmachova|first5=T|last6=Seymour|first6=L|last7=Clark|first7=KR|last8=During|first8=MJ|last9=Cremers|first9=FP|last10=Black|first10=GC|last11=Lotery|first11=AJ|last12=Downes|first12=SM|last13=Webster|first13=AR|last14=Seabra|first14=MC|title=Retinal gene therapy in patients with choroideremia: initial findings from a phase 1/2 clinical trial.|journal=Lancet|date=29 March 2014|volume=383|issue=9923|pages=1129–37|pmid=24439297|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62117-0|pmc=4171740}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery was performed by [[Robert MacLaren]], Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford and leader of the Clinical Ophthalmology Research Group at the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology (NLO).

In the study, 2 doses of the [[adeno associated virus|AAV]].REP1 vector were injected subretinally in 12 patients with choroideremia. 
There study had 2 objectives:
* to assess the safety and tolerability of the AAV.REP1 vector
* to observe the therapeutic benefit, or slowing of the retinal degeneration, of the gene therapy during the study and at a 24-month post-treatment time point &lt;ref&gt;CT.gov, 2014, "Gene Therapy for Blindness Caused by Choroideremia (Sponsor:University of Oxford): NCT01461213," at ''ClinicalTrials.gov,'' see [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01461213], accessed 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite retinal detachment caused by the injection, the study observed initial improved rod and cone function, warranting further study.

In 2016, researchers were optimistic that the positive results of 32 choroideremia patients treated over four and a half years with gene therapy in four countries could be long-lasting.&lt;ref name="BBC2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab|title=Gene therapy reverses sight loss and is long-lasting|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36101786|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=BBC News, Science &amp; Environment|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis===
For women who carry a mutation in the CHM gene, [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] can be used during the [[in-vitro fertilization]] process to select unaffected embryos to implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanpregnancy.org/infertility/preimplantation-genetic-diagnosis/|title=Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis: (PGD)|website=www.americanpregnancy.org|access-date=23 June 2018|date=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process call be applied to any [[genetic disorder|monogenic]] disease.

===Other potential therapies===

While choroideremia is an ideal candidate for gene therapy&lt;ref name = "Roberts"/&gt; there are other potential therapies that could restore vision after it has been lost later in life. Foremost of these is [[stem cell]] [[stem-cell therapy|therapy]]. A clinical trial published in 2014 found that a subretinal injection of [[human embryonic stem cells]] in patients with [[Macular degeneration|age-related macular degeneration]] and [[Stargardt disease]] was safe and improved vision in most patients. Out of 18 patients, vision improved in 10, improved or remained the same in 7, and decreased in 1 patient, while no improvement was seen in the untreated eyes. The study found "no evidence of adverse proliferation, rejection, or serious ocular or systemic safety issues related to the transplanted tissue."&lt;ref name = "Schwartz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=SD|last2=Regillo|first2=CD|last3=Lam|first3=BL|last4=Eliott|first4=D|last5=Rosenfeld|first5=PJ|last6=Gregori|first6=NZ|last7=Hubschman|first7=JP|last8=Davis|first8=JL|last9=Heilwell|first9=G|last10=Spirn|first10=M|last11=Maguire|first11=J|last12=Gay|first12=R|last13=Bateman|first13=J|last14=Ostrick|first14=RM|last15=Morris|first15=D|last16=Vincent|first16=M|last17=Anglade|first17=E|last18=Del Priore|first18=LV|last19=Lanza|first19=R|title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium in patients with age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt's macular dystrophy: follow-up of two open-label phase 1/2 studies.|journal=Lancet|date=7 February 2015|volume=385|issue=9967|pages=509–16|pmid=25458728|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61376-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Maureen|title=Updated Stem Cell Clinical Trial Results for Stargardt Disease and Dry Macular Degeneration - VisionAware Blog - VisionAware|url=http://www.visionaware.org/blog/visionaware-blog/positive-stem-cell-clinical-trial-results-for-stargardt-disease-and-dry-macular-degeneration-1588/12|website=www.visionaware.org|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study used [[CRISPR#Genome engineering|CRISPR/Cas9]] to repair mutations in patient-derived [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] that cause X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bassuk|first1=Alexander G.|last2=Zheng|first2=Andrew|last3=Li|first3=Yao|last4=Tsang|first4=Stephen H.|last5=Mahajan|first5=Vinit B.|title=Precision Medicine: Genetic Repair of Retinitis Pigmentosa in Patient-Derived Stem Cells|journal=Scientific Reports|date=27 January 2016|volume=6|pages=19969|doi=10.1038/srep19969|pmid=26814166|pmc=4728485}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study suggests that a patient's own repaired cells could be used for therapy, reducing the risk of immune rejection and [[Stem cell controversy|ethical issues]] that come with the use of embryonic stem cells.

===History===

Choroideremia was first described in 1872 by an Austrian ophthalmologist, [[Ludwig Mauthner]].&lt;ref name= "Barnard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnard|first1=A.

===Basic research===

In many inherited retinal diseases the protein affected by the mutation is directly involved in the light sensing function of the eye, however this is not the case in choroideremia.&lt;ref name = "Barnard" /&gt; REP1 assists the [[prenylation]] of Rab G-proteins by binding and presenting them to the [[Rab geranylgeranyltransferase|Rab geranylgeranyltransferase subunit]].&lt;ref name = "Pylypenko"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pylypenko|first1=O|last2=Rak|first2=A|last3=Reents|first3=R|last4=Niculae|first4=A|last5=Sidorovitch|first5=V|last6=Cioaca|first6=MD|last7=Bessolitsyna|first7=E|last8=Thomä|first8=NH|last9=Waldmann|first9=H|last10=Schlichting|first10=I|last11=Goody|first11=RS|last12=Alexandrov|first12=K|title=Structure of Rab escort protein-1 in complex with Rab geranylgeranyltransferase.|journal=Molecular Cell|date=February 2003|volume=11|issue=2|pages=483–94|pmid=12620235|doi=10.1016/s1097-2765(03)00044-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; REP1 also escorts prenylated Rabs through the cytoplasm by binding the [[hydrophobic]] [[prenyl]] groups and carrying them to a specific destination membrane.&lt;ref name = "Pylypenko" /&gt;

In healthy individuals, REP1 is found throughout all of the cells of the body, however patients with choroideremia only experience vision loss, and not broader, systemic symptoms (with the exception of a study that found crystals and [[fatty acid]] abnormalities in [[leukocytes]]).&lt;ref name=Zhang2015&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang AY, Mysore N, Vali H, Koenekoop J, Cao SN, Li S, Ren H, Keser V, Lopez-Solache I, Siddiqui SN, Khan A, Mui J, Sears K, Dixon J, Schwartzentruber J, Majewski J, Braverman N, Koenekoop RK | year = 2015 | title = Choroideremia is a systemic disease With lymphocyte crystals and plasma lipid and RBC membrane abnormalities | url = | journal = Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci | volume = 56 | issue = 13| pages = 8158–8165 | doi = 10.1167/iovs.14-15751 | pmid = 26720468 | pmc = 4699407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; REP2, a protein that is 75% identical and 90% [[similarity measure|similar]] to REP1, is able to significantly compensate for the loss of REP1 outside the eye.&lt;ref name = "Barnard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cremers|first1=FP|last2=Armstrong|first2=SA|last3=Seabra|first3=MC|last4=Brown|first4=MS|last5=Goldstein|first5=JL|title=REP-2, a Rab escort protein encoded by the choroideremia-like gene.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=21 January 1994|volume=269|issue=3|pages=2111–7|pmid=8294464}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that REP2 is not able to fully compensate for the loss of REP1 in the retina.&lt;ref name = "Barnard"/&gt; [[RAB27A]], a Rab that has essential functions in the retina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tolmachova|first1=T|last2=Ramalho|first2=JS|last3=Anant|first3=JS|last4=Schultz|first4=RA|last5=Huxley|first5=CM|last6=Seabra|first6=MC|title=Cloning, mapping and characterization of the human RAB27A gene.|journal=Gene|date=18 October 1999|volume=239|issue=1|pages=109–16|pmid=10571040|doi=10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00371-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to be preferentially prenylated by REP1.&lt;ref name = "Larijani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larijani|first1=B|last2=Hume|first2=AN|last3=Tarafder|first3=AK|last4=Seabra|first4=MC|title=Multiple factors contribute to inefficient prenylation of Rab27a in Rab prenylation diseases.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=21 November 2003|volume=278|issue=47|pages=46798–804|pmid=12941939|doi=10.1074/jbc.m307799200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Rab27a-REP1 and Rab27a-REP2 [[Multiprotein complex|complexes]] have different [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor.2Fligand binding affinity|affinities]] for the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase enzyme, possibly explaining REP2's inability to fully compensate for REP1 in the retina.&lt;ref name = "Larijani"/&gt;

==Celebrities afflicted==
A number of individuals in public roles are afflicted by choroidermia, and some have been involved in fundraising efforts for the disease. The former [[UK Labour Party|UK Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Siôn Simon]] is a known sufferer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2053428.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} Politics {{!}} Sion Simon|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-20|date=2002-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic and activist E.J. Scott, partner of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' actress [[Deborah Ann Woll]], also suffers from the disease and is involved in regular fundraising efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Dwyre, 2013, "Though going blind, E.J. Scott keeps looking ahead, moving forward," ''L.A. Times'' (online), January 11, 2013, see [http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/11/sports/la-sp-dwyre-20130112], accessed 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.J.

==Organizations==

There are a few organizations that provide support for individuals with choroideremia and raise money for research. They include:
* [[Foundation Fighting Blindness|The Foundation Fighting Blindness]], which supports choroideremia among many other eye diseases [http://www.blindness.org/eye-conditions/choroideremia FFB website]
* The Choroideremia Research Foundation [http://curechm.org/ (website)]

By vaccinating these individuals with a pertussis booster a pool of persons is established around the newborn who are themselves protected from getting pertussis and passing it on to the infant, thereby creating a "cocoon" of protection around the newborn. Young infants have the highest rate of pertussis; in 87-100% of all deaths caused by pertussis, the victim is an infant of less than 6 months of age.&lt;ref name=cocooning/&gt;  

==ACIP recommendations==
[[File:HumanNewborn.JPG|thumb|250px|left|An infant has very little [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to [[virus]]es]]
Cocooning is defined as the strategy of protecting infants from infectious diseases, especially pertussis, by vaccinating those in close contact with them. The [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) has recommended cocooning with [[Tdap vaccine]] since 2005 and has continued to recommend this strategy for all those with expected close contact with infants. ACIP states that cocooning provides maximum protection to the infant beyond what is provided by maternal vaccination. ACIP is recommending that all relatives and caregivers get vaccinated against pertussis at least two weeks before coming into contact with infants.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

'''Codex Alimentarius Austriacus''' is a collection of standards and product descriptions for a variety of foods, established by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in October 1891. &lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/codex/Publications/understanding/Understanding_EN.pdf Understanding The Codex Alimentarius (Third Edition)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Published by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Health Organization]], 2006. Accessed 4 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Codex Alimentarius Austriacus standards is primarily the product of a voluntary effort of experts in the food industry and universities. While the standards laid out in the codex were not legally enforceable, they were nonetheless used by the courts to determine the identity and quality of a variety of food products.&lt;ref name="codex"&gt;Randell, A.

Accessed 1 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{food safety}}
== History == 

Until the Mid 20th Century, the Codex Alimentarius Austriacus was not well-known beyond the German-speaking countries of Europe. It subsequently lent its name to the international [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission, the current international food codex collaboratively worked out by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="codex" /&gt; Consisting of three volumes, the [[Codex]] was finished sometime between 1910–1917 by [[O. Dafert]]. It lacked actual integration into Austrian law until 1975.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The idea of a Europe-wide Codex Alimentarius based on the Austrian model was actively pursued by Hans Frenzel of Austria between 1954 and 1958. Frenzel's work culminated in the creation of the Council of the [[Codex Alimentarius Europaeus]] in June 1958, under the joint sponsorship of the International Commission on Agricultural Industries and the International Bureau of [[Analytical Chemistry]].&lt;ref name="codex" /&gt; In 1975, the committee for the Codex Alimentarius Austriacus was reorganized to conform with [[Austria]]n food laws, which have a reputation of being some of the strictest food laws in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geneticallymodifiedfoods.co.uk/austria-gm-food-bans.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases''' is a workers compensation scheme administered by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]]. It was established in November 1982 by [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd|British Nuclear Fuels Limited]] and its [[Trade union|trade unions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=shCh5KzE7xEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ay7uRDDnnA&amp;sig=bHI_Fkk4rUc8nrJO_z454mgC10E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=The Redfern Inquiry into human tissue analysis in UK nuclear facilities|last=|first=|date=2010-11-16|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=|isbn=9780102966183|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following legal actions brought against the company by nuclear industry workers in the late 1970s. At the time of its establishment, BNFL and its trade unions agreed that the causation of cancer by radiation was sufficiently well understood that "it should be possible to construct a scheme which would evaluate the probability that a diagnosed cancer may have been caused by radiation exposure at work." Initially the scheme only accepted claims in which a worker had died from a radiation-linked disease. In 1987 this was expanded to allow [[Disease|morbidity]] claims.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_history.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme history|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of participating member employers and trade unions has grown through the 1990s and 2000s. As of December 2015, 1525 claims have been made out of which 156 have been successful.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/annual_statement.php|title=CSRLD: 2015 Compensation Scheme Annual Statement|last=|first=|date=2015-12-01|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
In order to be eligible for compensation, a worker must have been employed by a listed company, and have received an occupational radiation dose. Then the claimant must have developed [[cancer]] of the [[Bladder cancer|bladder]], [[Bone Cancer|bone]], [[Brain cancer|brain]] and central nervous system, [[Breast cancer|breast]] or [[Uterine cancer|uterus]] (for female workers), [[Colorectal cancer|colon]], [[Liver cancer|liver]], [[Esophageal cancer|oesophagus]], respiratory or [[Lung cancer|lung]], prostate, [[Ovarian cancer|ovary]], skin (non-Melanoma), [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]] or other tissues. Other compensable diseases include [[Cataract|cataracts]] and [[Leukemia|leukaemias]] (with two exceptions). Some diseases are excluded on the basis that there is no convincing epidemiological evidence to link them with ionising radiation exposure. Excluded diseases include: [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin’s disease]], [[Hairy cell leukemia|hairy cell leukaemia]], [[Chronic lymphatic leukemia|chronic lymphatic leukaemia]] (CLL), [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]] and [[mesothelioma]].

=== Member Trade Unions ===
In 1982, trade union members of the scheme included [[Transport and General Workers' Union|Transport and General Workers Union]], [[Institution of Professional Civil Servants]], [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]], [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and PCS. Other trades unions joined as the scheme expanded. Later members include the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union|EETPU]] and [[Manufacturing Science Finance|MSF]], [[Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians|UCATT]], [[Engineers and Managers Association]], [[UNISON|Unison]], the [[First Division Association]] of Civil Servants, the AEA Constabulary Federation (now the Civil Nuclear Police Federation) and the [[Defence Police Federation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_employers.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme employers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claiming compensation ==
Claims may be lodged by the worker, his or her wife, husband or partner (including same sex), the worker's "first line children" (those born to or legally adopted by the claimant). Once diagnosed with or deceased from an eligible disease, the worker or surviving family members have 30 years in which to make a claim. Claims can be made online, by post, by phone or through the worker's trade union. Once made, claims are assessed on consideration of medical, employment and dosimetry histories and data. These are used to calculate the probability that the cancer could have been caused by occupational exposure to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/qa.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Q &amp; A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payments ==
The payment received following a successful claim varies depending on the actual loss (in earnings and pension) suffered by the claimant and sums for pain and suffering, loss of amenity and number of dependents. The level of payment awarded to a claimant (or estate if deceased) is determined by the "causation probability". The greater the causation probability, the greater the payment. Top tier payments are awarded if the causation probability is 50% or more. The Scheme publishes an Annual statement which is approved by the Scheme Council. The report includes a paragraph updating the number of claims and payments awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/case_processing.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Case Processing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 February 2005, 1000 claims had been made, of which 97 had been awarded to varying degrees along a sliding scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oxqdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT152&amp;lpg=PT152&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCtN2E6adQ&amp;sig=0MUeAJ5xKrJx-EFVDn_13BMYhEI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=Assessment of the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=2005-10-01|publisher=National Academies Press|year=|isbn=9780309096102|location=|pages=137|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015, 1525 cases had been considered since the compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases was established. 156 of these claims were successful, and payments totaling £8.24 million had been dispatched.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Major]] '''Courage Emmanuel Kobla Quashigah''' (9 September 1947 &amp;ndash; 5 January 2010) was a [[Ghanaian]] [[soldier]] and [[politician]]. He held many prominent positions in the [[Ghana Armed Forces]] and was a [[Minister of State]] for Agriculture and later Health in the [[Kufuor government|NPP government]] of [[John Kufuor]] between 2001 and 2009.

==Early life and education==
Quashigah was born at Kedzi in the [[Volta Region]] of [[Ghana]]. He had his secondary and sixth form education at the [[Keta Secondary School]] also in the Volta Region. He gained his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] and [[GCE Advanced Level]] certificates there. He proceeded to the [[United Kingdom]] where he studied at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military Academy]] at [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]]. He qualified with a Diploma in [[Economics]], [[War studies]] and [[Communication studies]]. He was awarded the  Cane and Certificate of Honour as Best Overseas Cadet and Highest in the Order of Merit at Sandhurst.

==Military career==
Quashigah served as an Intelligence officer at the headquarters of the Second Infantry Brigade of the [[Ghana Army]] based at [[Kumasi]] in the [[Ashanti Region]] of Ghana. He then became the Chief Instructor at the Jungle Warfare School at Akyease, in the Eastern Region. Other positions later held by him include Commanding Officer of the Ghana Military Police and Commanding Officer of the Forces Reserve Battalion. He has also served as a Director at the Military Academy and Training School at [[Teshie]], a suburb of [[Accra]]. Quashigah distinguished himself in various fields in the army. After serving with the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]], he won a Commendation for Efficient and Effective Command.

==Politics==
During the military rule of the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] (PNDC), he was the Chief Operations Officer at the (PNDC) Headquarters, Gondar Barracks, Burma Camp, Accra. He has also served as a Member of the Police Council of Ghana. Quashigah was formerly a close ally of [[Jerry Rawlings]], [[Head of state of Ghana]] and chairman of the PNDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-studies.com/ghana/charting-the-political-transition.html |title=Country studies: Charting the Political Transition |accessdate=2010-01-06 |publisher=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 1989, Quashigah and four others were arrested for allegedly plotting to overthrow the PNDC government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/national_security/ghana_national_security_the_1981_coup_and_th~152.html |title=The 1981 Coup and the Second Rawlings Government  |accessdate=2010-01-06 |work=Ghana National Security profile |publisher=www.theodora.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/NWS11/013/1992/en |title=WEEKLY UPDATE SERVICE 13/92 (INCLUDES ADDITION) |accessdate=2010-01-06 |date=1 April 1992 |work= |publisher=[[Amnesty International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he became the national organiser of the [[New Patriotic Party]] (NPP).&lt;ref name=ghanaweb&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=174683 |title=Quashigah is dead |accessdate=2010-01-06 |work=General News of Tuesday, 5 January 2010 |publisher=Ghana Home Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the NPP formed a government in January 2001, Quashigah was appointed Minister of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=cabinet1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=13359 |title= Eleven Ministers Sworn-in |accessdate=2010-01-06 |work=General News of Friday, 2 February 2001 |publisher=Ghana Home Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Health Minister after a cabinet reshuffle in 2005 after President Kufuor had been reelected in the December 2000 presidential election.&lt;ref name=cabinet2005&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=74556 |title=Twenty-nine Ministers sworn into office |accessdate=2010-01-06 |work=General News of Wednesday, 2 February 2005 |publisher=Ghana Home Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst serving as minister of Health, Quashigah received notable recognition &lt;blockquote&gt;
for outstanding and exceptional contribution towards initiating a national health education on healthy lifestyle living and nutrition in Ghana and his efforts has grandly become extremely successful since the Africa Union has called on member states to declare the last Friday of each year as Africa's Healthy Lifestyles Day. Subsequently Ghana has named Ghana's Former Minister for Health, Major Quashigah, FGNAHAF as Africa's Best Health Minister in recent times and Ghanaians should be proud.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modernghana.com/news/210255/1/ghanas-former-minister-major-quashigah-named-for-a.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Quashigah traveled to Israel during a short illness for some public engagements and to seek medical attention but died during his trip.&lt;ref name=ghanaweb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.graphicghana.com/news/page.php?news=5918 |title=Courage Quashigah Is Dead

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25318">'''Dichotic listening''' or the '''Dichotic listening test''' is a psychological test commonly used to investigate [[selective attention]] within the [[auditory system]] and is a subtopic of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. Specifically, it is "used as a behavioral test for hemispheric lateralization of speech sound perception."&lt;ref name=Ingram2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=John C.L.|title=Neurolinguistics: an introduction to spoken language processing and its disorders|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-79640-8|edition=1. publ., 3. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381}}  During a standard dichotic listening test, a participant is presented with two different auditory stimuli simultaneously (usually [[Speech communication|speech]]). The different stimuli are directed into different ears over headphones.&lt;ref name=Ingram2007/&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} Participants are asked to pay attention to one or both of the stimuli. Later, they are asked about the content of either the message they were asked to attend to or the message that they were not told to listen to. As a result of focusing to repeat the words, participants noticed little of the message to the other ear, often not even realizing that at some point it changed from English to German. At the same time, participants did notice when the voice in the unattended ear changed from a male's to a female's, suggesting that the selectivity of consciousness can work to tune in some information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Schacter, GILBERT, WEGNER|first=Daniel|title=Psychology|year=2011|publisher=WorthPublishers|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-429-24107-6|pages=180|edition=1. publ., 3. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dichotic listening also relates to the third basic property of consciousness: [[Selective auditory attention|Selectivity]] which is the capacity to include some objects but not others.&lt;ref name="Schacter 2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schacter, Daniel L |title=Psychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=1-4292-3719-8 |oclc= 696604625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s Donald Shankweiler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/shankweiler.html |title=Donald P. Shankweiler}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Studdert-Kennedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/msk.html |title=Michael Studdert-Kennedy }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Haskins Laboratories]] used a dichotic listening technique (presenting different nonsense syllables) to demonstrate the dissociation of [[phonetic]] (speech) and [[sound|auditory]] (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning is an integral part of language and is typically processed in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(a)&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Studdert-Kennedy |first1=Michael |last2=Shankweiler |first2=Donald |date=19 August 1970 |title=Hemispheric specialization for speech perception |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=579–594 |doi=10.1121/1.1912174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(b)&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Studdert-Kennedy M. |author2=Shankweiler D. |author3=Schulman S. | year = 1970 | title = Opposed effects of a delayed channel on perception of dichotically and monotically presented CV syllables | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 599–602 | doi=10.1121/1.1912179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(c)&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Studdert-Kennedy M. |author2=Shankweiler D. |author3=Pisoni D. | year = 1972 | title = Auditory and phonetic processes in speech perception: Evidence from a dichotic study | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 455–466 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90017-5 |pmc=3523680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dichotic listening performance advantage for one ear is interpreted as indicating a processing advantage in the contralateral [[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]. In another example, Sidtis (1981)&lt;ref name=Sidtis&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sidtis J. J. | year = 1981 | title = The complex tone test: Implications for the assessment of auditory laterality effects | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 103–112 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(81)90050-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that healthy adults have a left-ear advantage on a dichotic pitch recognition experiment. He interpreted this result as indicating right-hemisphere dominance for pitch discrimination.

During the early 1970s, Tim Rand demonstrated dichotic perception at [[Haskins Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/publications/pub-r.html |title=Rand, T. C. (1974) |work=Haskins Laboratories Publications-R |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rand&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Timothy C. | year = 1974 | title = Dichotic release from masking for speech | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 678–680 | doi=10.1121/1.1914584 | pmid=4819869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study, the first stimuli: [[formant]] (F1), was presented to one ear while the second and third stimuli:(F2) and (F3) formants, were presented to the opposite ear. F2 and F3 varied in low and high intensity. Ultimately, in comparison to the binaural condition, "peripheral masking is avoided when speech is heard dichotically."&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; This demonstration was originally known as "the Rand effect" but was later renamed "dichotic release from masking". The name for this demonstration continued to evolve and was finally named "dichotic perception" or "dichotic listening." Around the same time,  Jim Cutting (1976),&lt;ref name=Cutting&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cutting J. E. | year = 1976 | title = Auditory and linguistic processes in speech perception: inferences from six fusions in dichotic listening | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 114–140 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.83.2.114}}&lt;/ref&gt; an investigator at [[Haskins Laboratories]], researched how listeners could correctly identify syllables when different components of the syllable were presented to different ears. The [[formant]]s of vowel sounds and their relation are crucial in differentiating vowel sounds. Even though the listeners heard two separate signals with neither ear receiving a 'complete' vowel sound, they could still identify the syllable sounds.

==Dichotic listening test designs==

===Dichotic fused words test (DFWT)===
The "dichotic fused words test" (DFWT) is a modified version of the basic dichotic listening test. It was originally explored by Johnson ''et al.'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|title=Dichotic ear preference in aphasia|journal=J. Speech Hear Res|year=1977|volume=20|pages=116–129|doi=10.1044/jshr.2001.116|pmid=846195|issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the early 80's Wexler and Hawles (1983)&lt;ref name="Wexler 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wexler|first=Bruce|author2=Terry Hawles|title=Increasing the power of dichotic methods: the fused rhymed words test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1983|volume=21|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(83)90100-8|pmid=6843817|issue=1|pages=59–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified this original test to ascertain more accurate data pertaining to hemispheric specialization of language function. In the DFWT, each participant listens to pairs of monosyllabic rhyming consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words. Each word varies in the initial consonant. The significant difference in this test is "the stimuli are constructed and aligned in such a way that partial interaural fusion occurs: subjects generally experience and report only one stimulus per trial."&lt;ref name="Zatorre 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zatorre|first=Robert|title=Perceptual asymmetry on the dichotic fused words test and cerebral speech lateralization determined by the caroid sodium amytal test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1989|volume=27|issue=10|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(89)90033-x|pages=1207–1219|pmid=2480551}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zatorre (1989), some major advantages of this method include "minimizing attentional factors, since the percept is unitary and localized to the midline" and "stimulus dominance effects may be explicitly calculated, and their influence on ear asymmetries assessed and eliminated."&lt;ref name="Zatorre 1989"/&gt; Wexler and Hawles study obtained a high test-retest reliability (r=0.85).&lt;ref name="Wexler 1983"/&gt; High test-retest reliability is good, because it proves that the data collected from the study is consistent.

===Testing with emotional factors===
An emotional version of the dichotic listening task was developed. In this version individuals listen to the same word in each ear but they hear it in either a surprised, happy, sad, angry, or neutral tone. Participants are then asked to press a button indicating what tone they heard. Usually dichotic listening tests show a right-ear advantage for speech sounds. Right-ear/left-hemisphere advantage is expected, because of evidence from [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], which are both located in the left hemisphere.  In contrast, the left ear (and therefore the right hemisphere) is often better at processing nonlinguistic material.&lt;ref  name="Grimshaw 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimshaw|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2003|volume=41|doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00315-9 |display-authors=etal|title=The dynamic nature of language lateralization: effects of lexical and prosodic factors|pages=1008–1019|pmid=12667536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data from the emotional dichotic listening task is consistent with the other studies, because participants tend to have more correct responses to their left ear than to the right.&lt;ref  name="Hahn 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hahn|first=Constanze|title=Smoking reduces language lateralization: A dichotic listening study with control participants and schizophrenia patients|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262611000625|work=Journal|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.03.015|volume=76|pages=300–309|pmid=21524559|date=Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the emotional dichotic listening task is seemingly harder for the participants than the phonemic dichotic listening task. Meaning more incorrect responses were submitted by individuals.

===Manipulation of voice onset time (VOT)===
The manipulation of voice onset time (VOT) during dichotic listening tests have given many insights regarding brain function.&lt;ref name="Arciuli 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arciuli J |title=Manipulation of voice onset time during dichotic listening |journal=Brain Cogn |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=233–8 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21320740 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.01.007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the most common design is the utilisation of four VOT conditions: short-long pairs (SL), where a Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllable with a short VOT is presented to the left ear and a CV syllable with a long VOT is presented to the right ear, as well as long-short (LS), short-short (SS) and long-long (LL) pairs. In 2006, Rimol, Eichele, and Hugdahl&lt;ref name="Rimol 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rimol, L.M. |author2=Eichele, T. |author3=Hugdahl, K. |title=The effect of voice-onset-time on dichotic listening with consonant-vowel syllables|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2006|volume=44 | issue = 2|pages=191–196|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.05.006|pmid=16023155}}&lt;/ref&gt; first reported that in healthy adults SL pairs elicit the largest REA while, in fact, LS pairs elicit a significant left ear advantage (LEA). A study of children 5–8 years old has shown a developmental trajectory whereby long VOTs gradually start to dominate over short VOTs when LS pairs are being presented under dichotic conditions.&lt;ref name="Westerhausen 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Westerhausen, R. |author2=Helland, T. |author3=Ofte, S. |author4=Hugdahl, K. |title=A longitudinal study of the effect of voicing on the dichotic listening ear advantage in boys and girls at age 5 to 8.|journal=Dev Neuropsychol.|year=2010|volume=35 | issue = 6|pages=):752–761|doi=10.1080/87565641.2010.508551|pmid=21038164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Converging evidence from studies of attentional modulation of the VOT effect shows that around age 9 children lack the adult-like cognitive flexibility required to exert top-down control over stimulus-driven bottom-up processes.&lt;ref name="Andersson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andersson, M. |author2=Llera, J.E. |author3=Rimol, L.M. |author4=Hugdahl, K. |title=Using dichotic listening to study bottom-up and top-down processing in children and adults.|journal=Child Neuropsychol.|year=2008|volume=14 | issue = 5|pages=470–479|doi=10.1080/09297040701756925|pmid=18608228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arciuli, J. |author2=Rankine, T. |author3=Monaghan, P. |title=Auditory discrimination of voice-onset time and its relationship with reading ability.|journal=Laterality.|year=2010|volume=15 | issue = 3|pages=343–360|doi=10.1080/13576500902799671|pmid=19343572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arciuli et al.(2010) further demonstrated that this kind of cognitive flexibility is a predictor of proficiency with complex tasks such as reading.&lt;ref name="Arciuli 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arciuli J |title=Manipulation of voice onset time during dichotic listening |journal=Brain Cogn |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=233–8 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21320740 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.01.007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arciuli 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arciuli J, Rankine T, Monaghan P |title=Auditory discrimination of voice-onset time and its relationship with reading ability |journal=Laterality |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=343–60 |date=May 2010 |pmid=19343572 |doi=10.1080/13576500902799671 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
Dichotic listening tests can also be used as lateralized speech assessment task. Neuropsychologists have used this test to explore the role of singular neuroanatomical structures in speech perception and language asymmetry. For example, Hugdahl ''et al.'' (2003), investigated dichotic listening performance and [[frontal lobe]] function&lt;ref name="Hugdahl 2003 58–65"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hugdahl|first=Kenneth|title=Dichotic Listening Performance and Frontal Lobe Function|journal=Thomas Bodner, Elisabeth Weiss, Thomas Benke|year=2003|volume=16|pages=58–65|doi=10.1016/s0926-6410(02)00210-0|pmid=12589889|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in left and right lesioned frontal lobe nonaphasiac patients compared to healthy controls. In the study, all groups were exposed to 36 dichotic trials with pairs of CV syllables and each patient was asked to state which syllable he or she heard best. As expected, the right lesioned patients showed a right ear advantage like the healthy control group but the left hemisphere lesioned patients displayed impairment when compared to both the right lesioned patients and control group. From this study, researchers concluded "dichotic listening as into a neuronal circuitry which also involves the frontal lobes, and that this may be a critical aspect of speech perception."&lt;ref name="Hugdahl 2003 58–65"/&gt; Similarly, Westerhausen and Hugdahl (2008)&lt;ref name="Westerhausen 2008 1044–1054"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westerhausen|first=Rene|author2=Kenneth Hugdahl|title=The corpus callosum in dichotic listening studies of hemispheric asymmetry: A review of clinical and experimental evidence|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|year=2008|volume=32|pages=1044–1054|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.04.005|pmid=18499255|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the role of the [[corpus callosum]] in dichotic listening and speech perception. After reviewing many studies, it was concluded that "...dichotic listening should be considered a test of functional inter-hemispheric interaction and connectivity, besides being a test of lateralized temporal lobe language function" and "the corpus callosum is critically involved in the top-down attentional control of dichotic listening performance, thus having a critical role in auditory laterality."&lt;ref name="Westerhausen 2008 1044–1054"/&gt;

==Language processing==

Dichotic listening can also be used to test the [[lateralization of brain function|hemispheric asymmetry]] of [[language processing]]. In the early 60s, Doreen Kimura reported that dichotic verbal stimuli (specifically spoken numerals) presented to a participant produced a right ear advantage (REA).&lt;ref name="Kimura 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kimura D | year = 1961 | title = Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 166–171 | doi=10.1037/h0083219}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attributed the right-ear advantage "to the localization of speech and language processing in the so-called dominant left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex."&lt;ref name=Ingram2007/&gt;{{rp|115}}  According to her study, this phenomenon was related to the structure of the auditory nerves and the left-sided dominance for language processing.&lt;ref name="Kimura 1967"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kimura D | year = 1967 | title = Functional asymmetry of the brain in dichotic listening | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 163–178 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(67)80010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that REA doesn't apply to non-speech sounds. In "Hemispheric Specialization for Speech Perception," by Studdert-Kennedy and Shankweiler (1970)&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(a)/&gt; examine dichotic listening of CVC syllable pairs. The six stop consonants (b, d, g, p, t, k) are paired with the six vowels and a variation in the initial and final consonants are analyzed. REA is the strongest when the sound of the initial and final consonants differ and it is the weakest when solely the vowel is changed. Asbjornsen and Bryden (1996) state that "many researchers have chosen to use CV syllable pairs, usually consisting of the six stop consonants paired with the vowel \a\. Over the years, a large amount of data has been generated using such material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asbjornsen|first=Arve|author2=M.P. Bryden|title=Biased attention and the fused dichotic words test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1996|volume=34|issue=5|pages=407–11|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(95)00127-1|pmid=9148197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective attention==
In selective attention experiments, the participants may be asked to repeat aloud the content of the message they are listening to. This task is known as [[Speech shadowing|shadowing]]. As [[Colin Cherry]] (1953)&lt;ref name=Cherry&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cherry E. C. | year = 1953 | title = Some experiments on the recognition of speech, with one and two ears | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 975–979 | doi=10.1121/1.1907229}}&lt;/ref&gt; found, people do not recall the shadowed message well, suggesting that most of the processing necessary to shadow the attended to message occurs in [[working memory]] and is not preserved in the [[long-term memory|long-term store]]. Performance on the unattended message is worse. Participants are generally able to report almost nothing about the content of the unattended message. In fact, a change from [[English language|English]] to [[German language|German]] in the unattended channel frequently goes unnoticed. However, participants are able to report that the unattended message is speech rather than non-verbal content. In addition to this, if the content of the unattended message contains certain information, such as the listener's name, then the unattended message is more likely to be noticed and remembered.&lt;ref name="Moray 1959"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moray N | year = 1959 | title = Attention in dichotic listening: Affective cues and the influence of instructions | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | doi=10.1080/17470215908416289}}&lt;/ref&gt; A demonstration of this was done by Conway, Cowen, and Bunting (2001) in which they had subjects shadow words in one ear while ignoring words in the other ear.  At some point, the subject's name was spoken in the ignored ear, and the question was whether the subject would report hearing their name.  Subjects with a high working memory (WM) span were more capable of blocking out the distracting information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engle Randall W | year = 2002 | title = Working Memory Capacity as Executive Attention | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.00160 | volume=11 | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also if the message contains sexual words then people usually notice them immediately.&lt;ref name="Nielsen Sarason 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nielson L. L. |author2=Sarason I. G. | year = 1981 | title = Emotion, personality, and selective attention | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 945–960 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.41.5.945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the unattended information is also undergoing analysis and keywords can divert attention to it.

==Sex differences==
Some data gathered from dichotic listening test experiments suggests that there is possibly a small-population sex difference in perceptual and auditory asymmetries and language laterality. According to Voyer (2011),&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245–255"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voyer|first=Daniel|title=Sex differences in dichotic listening|journal=Brain and Cognition|year=2011|volume=76|pages=245–255|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.02.001|pmid=21354684|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dichotic listening tasks produced homogenous effect sizes regardless of task type (verbal, non-verbal), reflecting a significant sex difference in the magnitude of laterality effects, with men obtaining larger laterality effects than women."&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245–255"/&gt;{{rp|245–246}} However, the authors discuss numerous limiting factors ranging from publication bias to small effect size. Furthermore, as discussed in "Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic words test,"&lt;ref name="Voyer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voyer|first=Daniel|author2=Jennifer Ingram|title=Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic word test|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain, and Cognition|year=2005|volume=6|pages=545–561|doi=10.1080/13576500442000292}}&lt;/ref&gt; women reported more "intrusions" or words presented to the uncued ear than men when presented with exogenous cues in the Fused Dichotic Word Task which suggests two possibilities: 1) Women experience more difficulty paying attention to the cued word than men and/or 2) regardless of the cue, women spread their attention evenly as opposed to men who may possibly focus in more intently on exogenous cues.&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245–255"/&gt;

==Effect of schizophrenia==
A study conducted involving the dichotic listening test, with emphasis on subtypes of schizophrenia (particularly paranoid and undifferentiated), demonstrated that [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenics]] have the largest left hemisphere advantage – with undifferentiated schizophrenics (where psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met) having the smallest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Michelle S. |last1=Friedman |first2=Gerard E. |last2=Bruder |first3=Paul G. |last3=Nestor |first4=Barbara K. |last4=Stuart |first5=Xavier F. |last5=Amador |first6=Jack M. |last6=Gorman |date=September 2001 |title=Perceptual Asymmetries in Schizophrenia: Subtype Differences in Left Hemisphere Dominance for Dichotic Fused Words |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=9 |pages=1437–1440 |url=http://psychophysiology.cpmc.columbia.edu/pdf/friedman2001a.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=11532728 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.9.1437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the dichotic listening test helped to further the beliefs that preserved left hemisphere processing is a product of paranoid schizophrenia, and in contrast, that the left hemisphere's lack of activity is a symptom of undifferentiated schizophrenia. In 1994, M.F. Green and colleagues tried to relate "the functional integration of the left hemisphere in hallucinating and nonhallucinating psychotic patients" using a dichotic listening study. The study showed that auditory hallucinations are connected to a malfunction in the left hemisphere of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=MF |last2=Hugdahl |first2=K |last3=Mitchell |first3=S |date=March 1994 |title=Dichotic listening during auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=357–362 |pmid=8109643 |doi=10.1176/ajp.151.3.357 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.151.3.357 |subscription=yes |via=PsychiatryOnline }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doula with family.jpg|thumb|325px|A doula (left) with mother during labor]]

A '''doula''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː|l|ə}}), also known as a '''birth companion, birth coach''' or '''post-birth supporter''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is a doula? | work = Doula UK |url=http://doula.org.uk/content/what-doula |access-date=2014-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207092328/http://doula.org.uk/content/what-doula |archive-date=2014-12-07  }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a non-medical person who assists a woman before, during, or after [[childbirth]], to provide emotional support and physical help if needed. They also may provide support to the mother's partner and family. Unlike a midwife, doulas are not medical professionals and therefore cannot administer medication. Doulas are typically certified with some courses taking over a year to complete. 
Practical training is involved to become certified.&lt;ref name= Balas&gt;

Major doula organizations that offer certification programs include Doula UK, DONA International, Childbirth International (CBI), Birth Arts International, International Doula Institute, Birthing From Within, The Doula Training Academy, CAPPA and the Australian Doula College. The Australian Doula College also trains end-of-life doulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Simon | last = Little | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://globalnews.ca/news/3898905/b-c-college-trains-death-doulas-to-guide-canadians-through-their-final-days/ | title = B.C. college trains ‘death doulas’ to guide Canadians through their final days | work = CKNW Radio |access-date=2018-01-23 | date = 5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a movement to encourage certification, and provide documentation of it on consumer websites such as Doulas and DoulaMatch where mothers can find certified doulas, childbirth educators, yoga instructors, and other birth-related professionals.&lt;ref name="Ballen"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ballen LE, Fulcher AJ | title = Nurses and doulas: complementary roles to provide optimal maternity care | journal = Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 304–11 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16620259 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.2006.00041.x }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Doulas not trained by a formal organization can be controversial within medical settings due to a lack of formal medical education when a discussion regarding [[medical interventions in labor]] versus pursuing [[natural childbirth]] without an [[epidural]] or [[caesarean section]] arises; however, the role of the doula is not to offer medical advice.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Hwang S | title= As 'Doulas' Enter Delivery Rooms, Conflicts Arise: Hired to Help in Childbirth, They Sometimes Clash With Doctors and Nurses | work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date= 2004-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term ''doula'' can also refer to a non-medical person who assists critically ill elderly people.&lt;ref name=Balas/&gt;

== History and etymology ==

The term ''doula'' was first used in a 1969 [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] conducted by Dana Raphael, a protégée of [[Margaret Mead]], with whom she cofounded the Human Lactation Center in [[Westport, Conn.]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Dana Raphael"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/nyregion/dana-raphael-proponent-of-breast-feeding-and-the-use-of-doulas-dies-at-90.html?_r=0 | title=Dana Raphael, Proponent of Breast-Feeding and Use of Doulas, Dies at 90 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 19, 2016 | access-date=January 17, 2017 | last = Roberts | first = Sam | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Sam Roberts (newspaper journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael suggested it was a widespread practice that a female of the same species be part of childbirth, and in human societies this was traditionally a role occupied by a family member or friend whose presence contributed to successful long-term breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Dana Raphael"/&gt; Raphael derived the term from [[modern Greek]] ({{lang|grc|δούλα}}, [[:wikt:doúla|doúla]], "servant-woman"), as told to her by an elderly Greek woman,&lt;ref name="Raphael-NYT Magazine"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/21/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-dana-raphael.html | title = Dana Raphael Opened Up the Mysteries of Nursing | work=[[NYT Magazine]] | date=December 21, 2016 | access-date=January 17, 2017 | last = Jones | first = Maggie | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael also describing it as coming from "[[Aristotle]]'s time", an [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|δούλη}} meaning "female slave".&lt;ref name= Mander&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Mander R | title= Supportive care and midwifery
 | publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year= 2001 | isbn= 0632054255 | pages= 113–33 | chapter= The doula | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWvQy8rtyqgC&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Klaus and John Kennell, who conducted [[clinical trial]]s on the medical outcomes of doula-attended births, adopted the term to refer to a person providing labor support.&lt;ref name= Kennel&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Klaus MH, Kennell JH, Klaus PH | title= The Doula Book: How A Trained Labor Companion Can Help You Have A Shorter, Easier, And Healthier Birth | publisher= [[Da Capo Press]] | year= 2002 | isbn= 0738206091 | page= 4 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=43ebxn4cK6gC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of support ==

The overall goal of a doula is for the mother to feel safe, be informed and feel comfortable, enhancing the role of doctors and nurses which is to ensure a safe delivery for mother and child. Doulas have no [[Clinical practice|clinical role]], duties or decision-making.&lt;ref name=Ballen/&gt;

=== Birth ===

A birth doula is also called a labor doula. The kinds of support provided during [[childbirth]] may include physical assistance and comfort (massage, maintaining a supporting posture or providing water), emotional support (providing company, encouragement or simply talking in a soothing tone of voice), and acting as an advocate for the woman undergoing childbirth (suggesting options or supporting the woman's decisions to a medical team). Doulas may also be involved during pregnancy and [[postnatal|after birth]] (postnatal care).&lt;ref name=Balas/&gt;

Most doula-client relationships begin a few months before the baby is due. Before the labor, the doula and the family can develop a relationship where the mother and her partner feel free to ask questions and express fears and concerns, and where the mother can take an active role in creating a birth plan. Continuity of support by the same person is thought to be an important aspect of the relationship between doula and mother.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; Doulas may be found in hospital, community-based programs as well as private practice, doula agencies and may be reimbursed by insurance companies or out-of-pocket by clients.&lt;ref name=Ballen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Career Choices for Becoming a Doula | website= Become a Doula with ProDoula | language= en-US | url= https://www.prodoula.com/career-choices-for-becoming-a-doula/ | access-date= 2016-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because insurance companies typically do not cover the cost of hiring a doula, they are more popular among middle- and upper-class parents.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://missionlocal.org/2010/02/doulas-a-moms-best-friend-during-labor-grow-in-popularity/ | title= Doulas, a Mom’s Best Friend During Labor, Grow in Popularity | publisher = Missionlocal.org | date = 2010-02-22 | access-date= 2014-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postpartum ===
{{See also|Postpartum confinement}}
Postpartum doulas provide educational support and practical support in the home in the first weeks and months after childbirth or after adding an infant to the family. The same doula often provides both birth and postpartum services. They provide emotional support and companionship by encouraging a mother when she might be feeling overwhelmed.&lt;ref name=DONA&gt;{{cite web | title= DONA International – What is a doula? | publisher= Dona.org | url= http://www.dona.org/mothers/index.php | access-date= 2014-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other workers providing similar services are maternity nurses, newborn care specialists, and, historically, [[monthly nurse]]s.

=== Antepartum ===

An antepartum doula provides help and support to a mother who has been put on bed rest or is experiencing a high risk-pregnancy. Emotional, physical and practical support can be provided by an antepartum doula in these circumstances.

=== Other ===

The term "[[death doula]]" has also been used for practitioners caring for critically ill adults in [[geriatric nursing|geriatric care]],&lt;ref name=Balas/&gt; and during death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Debbie | last = Slevin | name-list-format = vanc | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debbie-slevin/doulas-for-the-dying_b_9601780.html | title= Doulas For The Dying | work =Huffington Post| date= 2016-04-10 | access-date= 2016-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical aspects ==

Continuous support during labor provided by doulas (along with variety of groups such as [[nurse]]s, [[Midwifery|midwives]], other hospital staff, partners, family or friends) have been associated with improved outcomes for both mothers and children. There is research to support the beneficial effects of doulas on both maternal and newborn or infant health, including shorter delivery, fewer [[caesarean section]]s and complications, the use of fewer [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] and fetal extraction tools, less time in [[neonatal intensive care unit]]s, positive psychological benefits for mothers, more satisfying birth experiences, and increased [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name=Balas/&gt; Cross-country research on the effects of doulas on child birth and postnatal care is complicated by the variety of settings, cultures and medical systems of individual countries and characteristics of patients.&lt;ref name=Balas/&gt; These benefits appear to be contingent on the doula's providing continuous rather than intermittent assistance, have some medical training and on the specific social and cultural setting within which their services are provided. Women with less education, lower incomes, less preparation for childbirth and those lacking social support may experience greater benefits from doula care than other groups.&lt;ref name=Balas/&gt;

Until recently, the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] has no official position on trained labor support (of which a doula is considered to be),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanpregnancy.org/labor-and-birth/having-a-doula/|title=Having a Doula: Is a Doula for Me | work = American Pregnancy Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; during an interview the ACOG's chairwoman of the academy’s committee on obstetric practice Sarah Kilpatrick, stated while doulas may be helpful, there are some who try to "interfere with the medical aspect of delivery."  In March 2014, the ACOG put out a Consensus Statement titled "Safe Prevention of Primary Cesarean Delivery" in which it said, "Increasing women’s access to non-medical interventions during labor, such as continuous labor support, also has been shown to reduce cesarean birth rates."&lt;ref name="pmid24553167"&gt;{{cite journal | author = American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine | title = Obstetric care consensus no. 1: safe prevention of the primary cesarean delivery | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 693–711 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24553167 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000444441.04111.1d | url = http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Obstetric_Care_Consensus_Series/Safe_Prevention_of_the_Primary_Cesarean_Delivery }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more research has become available on the positive benefits of trained labor support provided by someone not employed by the hospital, in 2017, ACOG officially announced the need for all women to have access to continuous labor support outside hospital staff, and said, "Evidence suggests that, in addition to regular nursing care, continuous one-to-one emotional support provided by support personnel, such as a doula, is associated with improved outcomes for women in labor.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kozhimannil KB, Hardeman RR, Attanasio LB, Blauer-Peterson C, O'Brien M | title = Doula care, birth outcomes, and costs among Medicaid beneficiaries | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 103 | issue = 4 | pages = e113-21 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23409910 | pmc = 3617571 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2012.301201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28121831"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Committee on Obstetric Practice; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists | title = Committee Opinion No. 687: Approaches to Limit Intervention During Labor and Birth | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 129 | issue = 2 | pages = e20–e28 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28121831 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001905 | url = https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Approaches-to-Limit-Intervention-During-Labor-and-Birth }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The official committee opinion put out by ACOG also offers other recommendations that will allow women more choice and access to more supportive care.  Doulas could be utilized to help achieve many of these recommendations as they move towards better collaboration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Rachel | last = Leavitt | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.trainingdoulas.com/general/women-access-doula-care/|title=All women should have access to doula care |date = 2017-06-05|work=New Beginnings Doula Training|access-date=2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doulas provide information about medications or medical interventions during childbirth and help the family decide if her practice fits the family's birth wishes such as those who decide to have an [[epidural]] or otherwise do not undertake [[natural childbirth]].&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Paul P | title= And the Doula Makes Four | work= [[The New York Times]] | date= 2008-03-02 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/fashion/02doula.html | access-date= 2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Doulas acting beyond the role of social support and advocacy by providing medical advice, practicing outside their scope of practice may be acting as a traditional birth attendant.&lt;ref name="Ballen" /&gt;

In 2017 the United Kingdom's Royal College of Midwives published a position statement on doulas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rcm.org.uk/sites/default/files/Doulas%20V.2_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and certification ==

There is a lack of standardization and oversight of doulas, with multiple organizations providing different courses with varying requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= What You Should Know Before You Become A Doula | website= ProDoula | language= en-US | url= https://www.prodoula.com/what-you-should-know-before-you-become-a-doula/ | access-date= 2016-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no formal or universally recognized certification process or training requirements, and anyone can refer to themselves as a doula.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; No academic credentials such as a college or university diploma, or high school equivalency are required.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; . Doulamatch.net, an online referral page for doulas, has offered a list of items that students should look for as they begin looking for training.  Amy Gilliland, a researcher on doula care and culture, also lists some qualities a training program should have.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Rachel | last = Leavitt | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.trainingdoulas.com/doula-training/best-doula-training/|title=What Makes the Best Doula Training Program? | date=2017-06-13|work=New Beginnings Doula Training|access-date=2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists have stated that it may take college level work or more in depth online eduction in order to provide some of the communication skills that may be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meadow SL | title = Defining the doula's role: fostering relational autonomy | journal = Health Expectations | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 3057–68 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 25327532 | pmc = 5810740 | doi = 10.1111/hex.12290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a doula does not specifically require any medical training, although it is not uncommon for doulas to have received certification or medical training of some kind.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; In [[North America]], training generally takes the form of a two- to three-day seminar, and some experience with childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Doula Training Become A Doula | website= ProDoula | language= en-US | url= https://www.prodoula.com/ | access-date= 2016-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trainees may have hands-on practice with various techniques used during childbirth, including maternal positions and movements, relaxation and breathing exercises and other measures that could be used for comfort. Certification can occur through organizations at various levels (local, national or international) and some require positive evaluations from medical professionals. Certification may also require, in addition to attending a training course, time spent working or learning about maternity care and childbirth classes and possibly a written exam.&lt;ref name=Balas/&gt; Some doulas train through distance education.&lt;ref name=Ballen/&gt; Research also supports the effectiveness of female friends or relatives, after minimal training, as a low-cost alternative to professional doulas.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell D, Scott KD, Klaus MH, Falk M | title = Female relatives or friends trained as labor doulas: outcomes at 6 to 8 weeks postpartum | journal = Birth | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 220–7 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17718872 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-536X.2007.00174.x }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes between doctors, nurses and doulas have been described as a "turf battle",&lt;ref name =WSJ/&gt; though it is also recognized that doulas and nurses can occupy complementary roles that provide opportunities for mutual learning and assistance.&lt;ref name=Ballen/&gt; Some hospitals have created internal doula training programs to reduce conflict between doulas and medical staff.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Hospital "Credentialing" For Doulas?

[[File:E. H. Hedrick (West Virginia Congressman).jpg|thumb|E. H. Hedrick, West Virginia Congressman.]]

'''Erland Harold Hedrick''', better known as '''E. H. Hedrick''' (August 9, 1894 – September 20, 1954) was an [[United States|American]] [[US Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[politician]] from [[West Virginia]].

Born in [[Beckley, West Virginia]] he was graduated from the medical school of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] in 1917. During [[World War I]] he served in the [[United States Army Medical Corps]] as a [[first lieutenant]] (1917–1919). After the war he returned to Beckley where he started his own medical practice (1919–1944).

Hedrick also served as a medical examiner for the [[Veteran Administration]] from 1919 to 1944, city and country health officer (1927–1932) and superintendent of Pinecrest Tuberculosis Sanitarium in Beckley (1943–1944).

His political career began when he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1944 from the now extinct 6th district. He served four consecutive two-year terms from January 3, 1945 to January 3, 1953.

Hedrick did not run for a fifth term in 1952, but instead sought the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]]. However, he lost to [[William C. Marland]], State Attorney General, who went on to win the general election. A fellow Democrat, State Senator [[Robert Byrd]], who eventually became Dean and President pro tem of the United States Senate and a Senate Majority Leader, replaced him as congressman from the 6th district.

After his defeat for the gubernatorial nomination, Hedrick left politics and resumed his business and professional interests. He died in Beckley and is buried in Sunset Memorial Park.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="820">The term "'''encounter'''", in the context of existential-humanism (like [[existential therapy]]), has the specific meaning of an authentic, [[wikt:congruent|congruent]] meeting between individuals.

==Examples==
Some uses of the concept of encountering:

* [[Jacob L. Moreno]] ''Invitations to an Encounter'', 1914
* [[Martin Buber]] frequently uses this term and associated ideas.
* [[Irvin Yalom]] in his book "Existential Psychotherapy".
* [[Carl Rogers]], in [[encounter group]]s and [[person-centered psychotherapy]].
* [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s notion of a "poor theatre" – "The core of the theatre is an encounter".
* [[R D Laing]] contrasts encounter with [[collusion]] in much of his work, especially ''[[Self and Others]]''.

'''Food Standards Australia New Zealand'''  ('''FSANZ''') ([[Maori language|Māori]]: ''Te Mana Kounga Kai - Ahitereiria me Aotearoa''), formerly '''Australia New Zealand Food Authority''' ('''ANZFA'''), is the governmental body responsible for developing [[food standards]] for [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Food Standards Australia New Zealand |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/ |publisher=Food Standards Australia New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FSANZ develops food standards after consulting with other government agencies and stakeholders. The recommendations made by the body are open and accountable, and based upon a rigorous scientific assessment of risk to public health and safety.

All decisions made by FSANZ must be approved by the [[Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council]], which is composed of the Health Minister from each of the Australian states and territories, and the [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Health Minister]] from New Zealand, as well as other participating Ministers nominated by each jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Board Meeting Outcomes |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/aboutfsanz/boardmeetingoutcomes/ |publisher=Food Standards Australia New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to political interference in the decision: for example the decision made over [[hemp]] seed, when the Food Standards scientists recommended that hemp seed be allowed for sale, the ministers vetoed this because they did not want to appear soft on drugs.

Publications from FSANZ include the ''[[Australian Total Diet Survey]]'' and ''[[Shoppers' Guide to Food Additives and labels]]''.

This authority is sometimes cited variously as Australia and New Zealand Food Standards/Safety Authority (ANZFSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia | url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2007-06-20%2F0225%22 | house=House of Representatives | day=20 |month=Jun |year=2007 |speaker=[[Nicola Roxon|ROXON, the Hon.

'''Fritz Kasparek''' (3 July 1910 – 6 June 1954) was an Austrian mountaineer who was on the team that made the first ascent of the [[Eiger]] north face.

Kasparek gained his first alpine experiences on the ''Peilstein'' in the [[Vienna Woods|Wienerwald]] and in the [[Ennstaler Alps]]. After [[Emilio Comici]] had been the first to climb the north face of the Cima Grande of the [[Tre Cime di Lavaredo]] in 1933, in February 1938 Kasparek and Sepp Brunnhuber made the first winter ascent.

On 24 July 1938, with [[Anderl Heckmair]], [[Ludwig Vörg]] and [[Heinrich Harrer]], he made the first ascent of the [[Great north faces of the Alps|north face]] of the [[Eiger]]. This climb, previously deemed impossible and described by [[Reinhold Messner]] as "a glorious moment in the history of mountaineering and a great sensation, since several climbers had previously perished on the face",&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Messner, ''The Big Walls: From the North Face of the Eiger to the South Face of Dhaulagiri'', p. 105, Crowood 2001. {{ISBN|1-86126-467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; made headlines around the world&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B15F73B5C1B7A93C4AB178CD85F4C8385F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=eiger%201938&amp;st=cse "Climbers conquer dread Eiger peak"], ''The New York Times'', July 26, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; and is recounted in Heinrich Harrer's 1958  book, ''[[The White Spider]]''.

Kasparek died in 1954, falling to his death through a broken [[snow cornice]] near the peak of the [[Salcantay]] in [[Peru]].

[[Image:Avis au public Marseille 1720.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Public notice on the disposal of corpses during the Great Plague, 1720]]
The '''Great Plague of Marseille''' was the last of the significant European outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]]. Arriving in [[Marseille]], [[France]] in 1720, the disease killed a total of 100,000 people: 50,000 in the city during the next two years and another 50,000 to the north in surrounding provinces and towns.&lt;ref&gt; Duchêne &amp; Contrucci (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the large number of deaths, Marseille recovered quickly from the plague outbreak. Economic activity took only a few years to recover, as trade expanded to the West Indies and Latin America. By 1765, the growing population was back at its pre-1720 level.

==Pre-plague city==

===Sanitation board===
At the end of the plague of 1580, the people at Marseilles took dramatic measures to attempt to control the future spread of disease. The city council of Marseilles established a sanitation board, whose members were to be drawn from the city council as well as the doctors of the city. The exact founding date of the board is unknown, but its existence is first mentioned in a 1622 text of the [[Parlement|Parlement of Aix]]. The newly established sanitation board made a series of recommendations to maintain the health of the city.&lt;ref&gt;p. 17 Françoise Hildesheimer&lt;/ref&gt;

They established a bureaucracy to maintain the health of Marseilles. In addition to protecting the city from exterior vulnerabilities, the sanitation board sought to build a public infrastructure. The first public hospital of Marseilles was also built during this time period, and was given a full-sized staff of doctors and nurses. Additionally, the sanitation board was responsible for the accreditation of local doctors. Citing the vast amount of misinformation that propagates during a plague, the sanitation board sought to at a minimum provide citizens with a list of doctors who were believed to be credible.&lt;ref&gt;p. 53, Françoise Hildesheimer&lt;/ref&gt;

The sanitation board was one of the first executive bodies formed by the city of Marseilles. It was staffed to support the board's increasing responsibilities.

===Quarantine system=== 

The Sanitation Board established a three-tiered control and quarantine system. Members of the board inspected all incoming ships and gave them one of three "bills of health". The “bill of health” then determined the level of access to the city by the ship and its cargo. 

A delegation of members of the sanitation board was to greet every incoming ship. They reviewed the captain’s log, which recorded every city the ship had landed in, and checked it against the sanitation board's master list of cities throughout the Mediterranean that had rumors of recent plague incidents. The delegation also inspected all the cargo, crew and passengers, looking for signs of possible disease. If the team saw signs of disease, the ship was not allowed to land at a Marseilles dock. 

If the ship passed that first test and there were no signs of disease, but the ship’s itinerary included a city with documented plague activity, the ship was sent to the second tier of quarantine, at islands outside of Marseilles harbor. The criteria for the ''[[lazarettos|lazarets]]'' were ventilation (to drive off what was thought to be the miasma of disease), be near the sea to facilitate communication and pumping of water to clean, and to be isolated yet easily accessible.&lt;ref&gt;p. 361, Roger Duchêne et Jean Contrucci&lt;/ref&gt;

even a clean bill of health for a ship required a minimum of 18 days' quarantine at the off island. During such time, the crew would be held in one of the lazarettos/lazarets that were constructed around the city. The lazarettos were also classified in relation to bills of health given to the ship and individuals. With a clean bill, a crewman went to the largest quarantine site, which was equipped with stores and was large enough to accommodate many ships and crews at a time. If crew were believed subject to a possibility of plague, they were sent to the more isolated quarantine site, which was built on an island off the coast of the Marseille harbor. The crew and passengers were required to wait there for 50 to 60 days to see if they developed any sign of plague.&lt;ref&gt;p. 366, Roger Duchêne et Jean Contrucci&lt;/ref&gt;

Once crews served their time, they were allowed into the city in order to sell their goods and enjoy themselves prior to departure.

==Outbreak and fatalities==
This great outburst of plague was the last recurrence of a [[Second plague pandemic|pandemic of bubonic plague]], following the devastating episodes which began in the early-fourteenth century with the 1331 [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;Duchene and Contrucci (2004), Chronology. Marseille suffered from epidemics of the European Black Death in 1348 (recurring intermittently until 1361), in 1580 and 1582, and in 1649-1650.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' arrived at the port of Marseille from the [[Levant]] upon the merchant ship ''Grand-Saint-Antoine.'' The vessel had departed from [[Sidon]] in [[Lebanon]], having previously called at [[Smyrna]], [[Tripoli]], and plague-ridden [[Cyprus]]. A Turkish passenger was the first to be infected and soon died, followed by several crew members and the ship's surgeon. The ship was refused entry to the port of [[Livorno]].

When it arrived at Marseille, it was promptly placed under [[quarantine]] in the ''[[Lazaretto|lazaret]]'' by the port authorities.&lt;ref&gt; Duchêne &amp; Contrucci (2004), pages 361-362.&lt;/ref&gt; Due largely to Marseille's monopoly on French trade with the Levant, this important port had a large stock of imported goods in warehouses. It was also expanding its trade with other areas of the Middle East and emerging markets in the New World. Powerful city merchants needed the [[silk]] and [[cotton]] cargo of the ship for the great medieval fair at [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]] and pressured authorities to lift the quarantine. 

[[Image:Mur de la peste.jpg|thumb|left|The 16th-century ''"mur de la peste"'' (plague wall), Provence]]

A few days later, the disease broke out in the city. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, and residents panicked, driving the sick from their homes and out of the city. Mass graves were dug but were quickly filled. Eventually the number of dead overcame city public health efforts, until thousands of corpses lay scattered and in piles around the city.

Attempts to stop the spread of plague included an Act of the [[Parlement|Parlement of Aix]] that levied the death penalty for any communication between Marseille and the rest of Provence. To enforce this separation, a plague wall, the ''Mur de la Peste'', was erected across the countryside. The wall was built of dry stone, 2 m high and 70 cm thick, with guard posts set back from the wall. Remains of the wall can still be seen in different parts of the Plateau de Vaucluse.

During a two-year period, 50,000 of Marseille's total population of 90,000 died. An additional 50,000 people in other areas succumbed as the plague spread north, eventually reaching [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Arles]], [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]] and [[Toulon]]. Estimates indicate an overall death rate of between 25%-50% for the population in the larger area, with the city of Marseille at 40%, the area of Toulon at above 50%, and the area of Aix and Arles at 25%.

After the plague subsided, the royal government strengthened the plague defenses of the port, building the waterside [[:fr:Lazaret d'Arenc|''Lazaret d'Arenc'']]. A double line of fifteen-foot walls ringed the whitewashed compound, pierced on the waterside to permit the offloading of cargo from lighters. Merchantmen were required to pass inspection at an island further out in the harbour, where crews and cargoes were examined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mistraletnoroit.free.fr/spip.php?article1 "La peste et les lazarets de Marseille"]; briefly noted in [[Simon Schama]], ''Landscape and Memory'' (1995): 245f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent research==
[[File:Bubonic plague victims-mass grave in Martigues, France 1720-1721.jpg|thumb|Bubonic plague victims in a mass grave from 1720 to 1721 in [[Martigues, France]]]]
In 1998, an excavation of a mass grave of victims of the bubonic plague outbreak was conducted by scholars from the [[Université de la Méditerranée]].&lt;ref&gt;Signoli, Seguy, Biraben, Dutour &amp; Belle (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation provided an opportunity to study more than 200 skeletons from an area in the second [[Municipal arrondissements of France|arrondissement]] in Marseille, known as the Monastery of the Observance. In addition to modern laboratory testing, archival records were studied to determine the conditions and dates surrounding the use of this mass grave. This multidisciplinary approach revealed previously unknown facts and insights concerning the epidemic of 1722. The reconstruction of the skull of one body, a 15-year-old boy, revealed the first historical evidence of an [[autopsy]] dated to the spring of 1722. The anatomic techniques used appear to be identical to those described in a surgical book dating from 1708.

The '''health effects of salt''' are the conditions associated with the consumption of either too much or too little [[salt]]. Salt is a [[mineral]] composed primarily of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) and is used in food for both [[food preservation|preservation]] and [[flavor]]. [[Sodium]] ions are [[sodium in biology|needed in small quantities by most living things]], as are [[chloride]] ions. Salt is involved in regulating the [[water]] content ([[fluid balance]]) of the body. The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.090034797|title=Sodium channel Nav1.6 is localized at nodes of Ranvier, dendrites, and synapses|year=2000|last1=Caldwell|first1=J.

==Long-term effects==
{{See|Salt and cardiovascular disease}}

About 95% of the world's populations have a mean intake of salt that is between 6 g and 12 g daily. Widespread advice that salt intake be restricted below this range is not supported by evidence from [[randomized controlled trial]]s nor is it supported by evidence from prospective observational studies. In fact, intake of less than 5.8 g of salt per day typically results in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which leads to an increase in plasma lipids and increased mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Graudal |first1=N |last2=Jürgens |first2=G |title=Conflicting Evidence on Health Effects Associated with Salt Reduction Calls for a Redesign of the Salt Dietary Guidelines. |journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases |date=2 May 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2018.04.008 |pmid=29727609}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One report stated that people excreting less salt (thus, presumably ingesting less) were at increased risk of dying from heart disease. However, a recent [[meta-analysis]] conducted by the Cochrane Hypertension group found this article was subject to methodological flaws, and urges great caution when interpreting their results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=He FJ, Li J, MacGregor GA | year = 2013| title = Effect of longer-term modest salt reduction on blood pressure | url = | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2013 | issue = 4| page = CD004937 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004937.pub2 | pmid=23633321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible effects of microplastic contamination===
Studies have found some [[microplastic]] contamination in sea salt from the US, Europe and China. The health effects of this contamination are unknown because, as of 2017, no studies on the question had been performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Dietary recommendations==
Recommended intakes of salt are usually expressed in terms of sodium intake as an [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) and a [[Tolerable upper intake level]] (Upper Limit or UL). Salt (as sodium chloride) contains 39.3&amp;nbsp;percent of sodium by weight.

As of 2009 the average sodium consumption in 33 countries was in the range of 2,700 to 4,900&amp;nbsp;mg/day. This ranged across many cultures, and together with animal studies, this suggests that sodium intake is tightly controlled by feedback loops in the body. This makes recommendations to reduce sodium consumption below 2,700&amp;nbsp;mg/day potentially futile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2215/CJN.04660709|title=Can Dietary Sodium Intake Be Modified by Public Policy?|year=2009|last1=McCarron|first1=D.

==Labeling==
UK: The [[Food Standards Agency]] defines the level of salt in foods as follows: "High is more than 1.5 g salt per 100 g (or 0.6 g sodium). Low is 0.3 g salt or less per 100 g (or 0.1 g sodium). If the amount of salt per 100 g is in between these figures, then that is a medium level of salt." In the UK, foods produced by some supermarkets and manufacturers have 'traffic light' colors on the front of the packet: red (high), amber (medium), or green (low).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salt.gov.uk/understanding_labels.html Understanding labels]. Salt.gov.uk (6 November 2009). Retrieved 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

USA: The FDA ''Food Labeling Guide'' stipulates whether a food can be labeled as "free" "low," or "reduced/less" in respect of sodium. When other health claims are made about a food (e.g., low in fat, calories, etc.), a disclosure statement is required if the food exceeds 480&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium per 'serving'.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Drug Administration [https://web.archive.org/web/20060321031336/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/flg-6a.html A Food Labeling Guide—Appendix A]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, New York City launched the National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI).&lt;ref name=nsri/&gt; It is the only coordinated, voluntary effort to reduce sodium in the United States, an effort supported by the Institute of Medicine as an interim goal in advance of federal action on sodium reduction.

As of 2013, over 90 state and local health authorities and health organizations have signed on as partners of the NSRI. Together, the NSRI partnership encourages food manufacturers and chain restaurants to voluntarily commit to NSRI sodium reduction targets for 2012 and 2014. The NSRI aims to reduce sodium in the food supply by 25 percent in five years and reduce population sodium intake by 20 percent in the same time, thereby reducing risk for heart attacks and strokes.&lt;ref name="nsri"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/national-salt-reduction-initiative.page|title=Sodium initiatives|publisher=National Salt Reduction Initiative, City of New York|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-one companies met their 2012 NSRI commitment. Notable reductions include: 15 percent reduction of sodium in Heinz ketchup; 32 percent reduction of sodium in the Subway’s Subway Club sandwich; 33 percent reduction of sodium in Nabisco’s Honey Teddy Grahams; 18 percent reduction of sodium in Kraft Single American Slices; and 20 percent reduction of Ragu Old World Style Traditional Tomato Sauce.&lt;ref name=nsri/&gt;

Separate from the NSRI, a number of major food producers have pledged to reduce the sodium content of their food. [[Pepsi]] is developing a "designer salt" that's slightly more powdery than the salt it regularly uses. The company hopes this new form of salt will cut sodium levels by 25&amp;nbsp;percent in its Lay's potato chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = McKay, Betsy | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 | title = PepsiCo Develops 'Designer Salt' to Chip Away at Sodium Intake | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 22 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nestlé|Nestlé's]] prepared foods company, which produces frozen meals, announced that it will reduce sodium in its foods by 10&amp;nbsp;percent by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101023180822/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nestle-prepared-foods-company-to-decrease-sodium-by-another-10-by-2015-105520828.html Nestle Prepared Foods Company to Decrease Sodium by Another 10% by 2015"], Prnewswire&lt;/ref&gt;
[[General Mills]] announced that it will reduce the sodium content of 40&amp;nbsp;percent of its foods by about 20&amp;nbsp;percent by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Thomas, Caroline, [http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Financial-Industry/General-Mills-announces-sodium-reduction-strategy/ "General Mills announces sodium reduction strategy,"] Food Navigator, 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of chain restaurants have made pledges to lower sodium over time. MenuStat, a free online database of past and current nutrition data from chain restaurants developed by the NYC Health Department, is available to monitor and evaluate these pledges.

In the United States, taxation of sodium has been proposed as a method of decreasing sodium intake and thereby improving health in countries where typical salt consumption is high.&lt;ref name="pmid15485985"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = N | title = Salt tax could reduce population's salt intake | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 329 | issue = 7471 | pages = 918 |date=October 2004 | pmid = 15485985 | pmc = 523164 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.329.7471.918-c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incirculation.net/hypertension/NewsItem/Salt-tax-could-massively-reduce-US-mortality-rates.aspx |title=Salt tax could massively reduce US mortality rates, healthcare costs|date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an alternative view, the Salt Institute, a salt industry body based in North America, is active in promoting the use of salt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/About-Us|title=About the Salt Institute|year=2009 |publisher=Salt Institute |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and questioning or opposing the recommended restrictions on salt intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Issues-in-focus/Food-salt-health|title=Food salt &amp; health|year=2009 |publisher=Salt Institute |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary reduction==

A [[low sodium diet]] reduces the intake of sodium by the careful selection of food. The use of a [[salt substitute]] can provide a taste offsetting the perceived blandness of low-salt food; [[potassium chloride]] is widely used for this purpose. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends daily potassium intake of not less than 3,510&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name=who2013/&gt; Excessive potassium intake may be detrimental to health, and it is advised that potassium chloride not be used by those taking certain prescription drugs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The use of [[seaweed]] granules in the manufacture of processed foods is being researched as an alternative to salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seaweed granules may replace salt in foods |author=Daniells, Stephen |url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/Seaweed-granules-may-replace-salt-in-foods |newspaper=FoodNavigator.com |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled trials reported that lowered dietary salt intake lowered blood pressure in people with hypertension by about 3.5%, indicating that it might be a useful supplementary treatment for hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graudal|first1=NA|last2=Hubeck-Graudal|first2=T|last3=Jurgens|first3=G|title=Effects of low sodium diet versus high sodium diet on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, and triglyceride.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=9 April 2017|volume=4|pages=CD004022|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004022.pub4|pmid=28391629}}&lt;/ref&gt; In people with normal blood pressure, the decrease after lowering dietary salt intake was less than 1%. The effects in Asians and blacks with hypertension were greater than in whites, but more studies are needed to confirm conclusions. Effects of lowered salt intake on hormones and lipids were similar in normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

Studies found that excessively low sodium intake, below about three grams of salt per day, is associated with increased mortality and higher risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="mente_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="graudal_2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13828">{{see also|Mental capacity in England and Wales}}

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Lasting power of attorney}}'''Lasting powers of attorney''' (LPAs) in [[English law]] were created under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]], and came into effect on 1 October 2007. The '''LPA''' replaced the former [[enduring power of attorney|enduring powers of attorney]] (EPA) which were narrower in scope. Their purpose is to meet the needs of those who can see a time when they will not be able – in the words of the Act, will lack [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] – to look after their own personal, financial or business affairs. The LPA allows them to make appropriate arrangements for family members or trusted friends to be authorised to make decisions on their behalf. The LPA is created and registered with the [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]] (OPG), an executive agency of the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] of the [[United Kingdom]].

==Purpose==

The LPA is a specific form of the more general [[power of attorney]] which is widely used in countries which have a [[common law]] system. The word [[Lawyer|attorney]] in this context is someone (or in some circumstances an organisation such as a company) legally appointed or empowered to act for another person. The person giving the power is known as the '''donor'''. The word 'lasting' in the context of an LPA means that the power may continue even if the person (though still alive) no longer has [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to exercise the power. The Lasting Power of Attorney can be applied for online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney/make-lasting-power&lt;/ref&gt; The gov.uk tool offers guidance throughout the process, and prevents the user from making mistakes that may invalidate their LPA application.

The former [[enduring power of attorney|EPA]] was simple to administer, but failed to provide for some decisions which may have to be made in circumstances that preclude their being made by the person principally affected. In particular, the attorney's powers under the EPA were largely defined in terms of money and property, and were not related to decisions on medical matters such as the continuation or otherwise of life-sustaining treatment, or welfare matters such as a move to a different kind of accommodation. The primary purpose of the changes under [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]] (MCA 2005) was to rectify this omission, by creating two LPAs: one for property and financial affairs (the LPA(PFA)) and one for Health and Welfare (the LPA(H&amp;W)).

== Business Lasting Power of Attorney ==
While the LPA is primarily designed to deal with personal affairs and finances, business owners or directors are faced with more complex considerations. While a close friend or family member may be suitable for managing personal affairs in times of incapacity, businesses may require subject matter experts and depending on the business structure, there are certain governance requirements. Therefore, the Business Lasting Power of Attorney (BLPA) is a separate arrangement that is similar in function to the LPA. Business owners arranging a LPA and BLPA can therefore split between personal and business affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/all-notices/content/101043|title=Business lasting power of attorney|website=www.thegazette.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lasting Powers of Attorney: A Practical Guide|last=Ward|first=Craig|publisher=The Law Society|year=2011|isbn=978-1853286025|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative and legal background==

The LPA system is administered by the [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]] (OPG), an agency of the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Its contact details are explained in section 2.2 below headed 'The role of the OPG in relation to Lasting Powers of Attorney'. The [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|OPG]] was set up in 2007 under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005|MCA 2005]], replacing the similarly-named Public Guardianship Office which had a more limited range of responsibilities. It is headed by the Public Guardian, whose main role is the protection of people who lack mental [[Capacity (law)|capacity]].

The MCA 2005 provides a statutory framework to empower and protect vulnerable people who are not able to make their own decisions. It makes clear who can take decisions on their behalf, in which situations, and how they should do so. Through the LPA, the Act enables people to plan ahead for a time when they may lose capacity. Detailed guidance is provided by a Code of Practice to the MCA 2005&lt;ref&gt;Code of Practice to MCA 2005, published by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]:[http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/guidance/protecting-the-vulnerable/mca/mca-code-practice-0509.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; to the Act, which people working as professionals in this field are required to 'have regard to': that is, to observe, unless (having decided in specific circumstances not to do so) they are prepared to explain afterwards – most probably in a post-incident inquiry – why not.

Where there are suspicions that an attorney might not be acting in the best interests of the donor, the [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|OPG]] will arrange an investigation. If the OPG decides that formal action is required, and more generally if any disputes arise on subjects covered by the MCA, the matter is referred to the [[Court of Protection]] (CoP), which is part of the Family Division of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] and was set up under the MCA for this purpose. The role of the CoP in decision-making is complementary to that of the OPG in relation to matters of regulation and supervision.

===The 'five principles'===

The guiding principles of the MCA 2005&lt;ref&gt;Mental Capacity Act 2005 section 1: The guiding principles&lt;/ref&gt; are set out in [[Mental Capacity Act 2005#The five statutory principles|five principles]] which indicate how the term [[Capacity (law)|'capacity']] (implying in this context mental capacity) is to be interpreted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity.
#A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success.
#A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.
#An act done, or decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in his best interests.
#Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The test so defined is 'decision-specific'. It can indicate an answer to the question 'Can he any longer use a gas ring safely when unsupervised?', but does not allow for wider questions to be given a firm yes/no answer when the real answer is that he has restricted capacity and so can deal with some aspects but not others. As stated in an official summary of the Act,&lt;ref&gt;Mental Capacity Act 2005: summary by the Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt; it is 'a single clear test for assessing whether a person lacks capacity to take a particular decision at a particular time'.

===The role of the OPG in relation to lasting powers of attorney===

From the point of view of someone who needs (or may potentially need) one or both LPAs, the [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]] is one of the first points of contact.

To apply for a Lasting Power of Attorney, the donor has to fill in the application forms giving details for themselves, the attorneys and another person known as the certificate provider to witness that the decision has been made with the donor's understanding and agreement. An LPA cannot be created once the donor has lost capacity.
 
There are two ways to create a Lasting Power of Attorney.
 
* The person wishing to apply for an LPA can use the online LPA tool.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney/make-lasting-power&lt;/ref&gt;
:* This asks the user straightforward questions and then automatically produces a completed LPA form. This is then printed and signed in the correct order. The LPA tool also offers detailed instructions, describes the roles and responsibilities of each person involved, and offers assistance with signing and registration of the LPA. 
 
* The forms can also be downloaded, printed out and filled in by hand.
:* They must then be signed in the correct order. No instructions are included with the forms, so it is recommended that you read the information available online before filling them in.
 
The two key booklets available to give information on the LPA are entitled 'Guidance for people who want to make a lasting power of attorney for…', respectively, 'Property and Financial Affairs' and 'Health and Welfare'. These booklets provide all the information required about the legal aspects of the LPA application procedure, and many but not all of the practical aspects as well; they are the source for the great majority of the material which follows here.

The booklets can be obtained in several ways:

* on line in pdf format&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov.uk/forms/opg/lasting-power-of-attorney&lt;/ref&gt; or
* in printed form and free of charge, by request either

:* on line&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov.uk/forms/opg/request-lasting-power-of-attorney-forms&lt;/ref&gt; or

:* by post from The Office of the Public Guardian

Most users, particularly when completing an application form without previous experience of LPAs, will find the printed format an advantage.

As well as obtaining copies of the forms in these ways, copies may be downloaded or requested of other booklets and the corresponding application forms, such as those relating to registration and the payment of fees. Full information is on the appropriate website; first-time users will find it most convenient either to download or request by post a full set, covering everything needed for each LPA.

The OPG does not have its own website, but uses part of the main UK Government information site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/opg.htm Government website for OPG information]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A fee is payable at the time of registration: it is currently £82, or £164 from April 2017 for both LPAs, but exemption or reduction is allowed in defined cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/ Gov.uk: Make a lasting power of attorney]&lt;/ref&gt;

An LPA is not only a legal document: it is a plan of action, to be put into effect in an ordinary family situation which may have its share of stresses and problems. Any such matters will affect the outcome, and so need to be taken into account in the drafting of the application. The primary source of help and advice for this process is the appropriate OPG booklet.

===Using the lasting power of attorney===
Once the donor has created a lasting power of attorney and it has been registered with the Office of the Public Guardian, the attorneys specified can in theory act on behalf of the donor, for example, paying the donor's bills, managing investments, and so on. However, in practice, this can prove much harder than it may sound.

The powers granted by the property and financial affairs LPA require the relevant institution (for example, the bank or insurance company) to accept the power of attorney and allow the attorney to act. Many institutions, whilst in theory accepting the power, make it extremely difficult to put in practice. Many claim that this is to protect the donor or to comply with money laundering regulations, but whatever the reasons, it can make the whole process very challenging and stressful, especially if the donor themselves is by this time unable to support the process, for example, from failing mental capacity.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Ways in which institutions can obstruct the process include:

* requiring identity verification of the donor (which is not required in law and may in practice be very difficult if utility bills have already been redirected to the attorney's address and the donor is now mentally or physically frail)
* by insisting on seeing the sole original copy of the power of attorney, rather than accepting a certified copy 
* questioning the identity of the attorney and requiring substantial proofs via certified copies of documents such as passports, even where the address of the attorney remains as stated on the LPA

Even once the authority of the attorney is accepted by the institution, they may choose to limit what the donor can do, for example by:

* not supporting a full range of services, such as internet banking and telephone banking, or refusing to issue cheque books or debit cards to attorneys
* continuing to send correspondence to the donor's address instead of the attorney's
* refusing to accept the attorney's instructions without the confirmation of the donor

The only recourse in these cases is to complain first to the institution in question, and if this fails to the [[Financial Ombudsman Service]].

Both the ''Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/09/carers-lasting-power-attorney&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Telegraph''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/8305337/Power-of-attorney-chaos-hits-elderly.html&lt;/ref&gt; have reported on these challenges.

'''Louis Charles Trabut''' (July 12, 1853 – April 25, 1929) was a [[France|French]] [[botanist]] and physician who was a native of [[Chambéry]], department of [[Savoie]]. He is remembered for his work involving the flora of [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]].

Trabut was a professor of [[natural history]] at the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of [[Algiers]], and also a consultant physician to the [[Mustapha Pacha hospital]]. With botanist [[Jules Aimé Battandier]] (1848–1922), he published several works on Algerian flora, that included the following:
* ''Flore de l'Algérie'' (Flora of Algeria) (1888–90).
* ''L'Algérie, le sol et les habitants, flore, faune, geologie, anthropologie, ressources agricoles et économiques'' (Algeria, the land and its people, Flora, fauna, [[geology]], [[anthropology]], agricultural resources and economics) (1898).
* ''Flore analytique et synoptique de l'Algérie et de la Tunisie'' (Flora analytic and synoptic of Algeria and Tunisia) (1905).

He has several plant species named after him, such as the [[eucalyptus]] species ''Eucalyptus trabutii''.

{{Politics of Russia}}
{{Psychiatry in Russia and the USSR}}
'''Mental health in Russia''' is covered by a law, known under its official name—the Law of the Russian Federation "On Psychiatric Care and Guarantees of Citizens' Rights during Its Provision" ({{lang-rus|Зако́н Росси́йской Федера́ции «О психиатри́ческой по́мощи и гара́нтиях прав гра́ждан при её оказа́нии»}}, ''Zakon Possiyskoy Federatsii "O psikhiatricheskoy pomoshchi i garantyakh prav grazhdan pri yeyo okazanii"''), which is the basic legal act that regulates psychiatric care in the [[Russian Federation]] and applies not only to persons with mental disorders but all citizens.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} A notable exception of this rule is those vested with [[parliamentary immunity|parliamentary]] or [[judicial immunity]].{{sfn|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}} Providing psychiatric care is regulated by a special law regarding guarantees of citizens' rights.{{sfn|Romek|2002}}

Due to this fact, it is acknowledged that functions of psychiatry are not limited to identifying and removing biological anomalies that cause "mental illnesses", caring for patients and alleviating their sufferings, but they also apply to the scope of their civil rights.{{sfn|Romek|2002}} The passage of the law was one of the five conditions for the membership of the All-Union Society of Psychiatrists and Neuropathologists in the [[World Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Savenko|2012a}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law passed on 2 July 1992 and received the number 3185-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kovalyov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Duma|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Revolutionary period===
There was an increasingly decentralised approach to psychiatric care before 1917, with  smaller hospitals (10 to 20 beds), more out-patient clinics, and some collaboration with private practice.  Psychiatrists were expected to deal with general medical issues and problems relating to epidemic and infectious diseases, witness corporal punishment and attend executions. After the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] there was an influx of political prisoners into asylums.  Local zemstovs provided two-thirds of the funding for psychiatric services and the central government one third.

The [[Commissariat of Public Health]] established the Psychiatry Commission in October 1917. Psychiatrists were given greater control over hospitals. The head of the hospital was elected.  Psychiatric services were funded by central government. Support services for mentally ill soldiers were provided by the [[Russian Red Cross Society]] until they were taken over by the Commissariat of Public Health in 1919.  They appointed a psychiatrist/neurologist consultant for the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khwaja|first1=Barbara|title=Health Reform in Revolutionary Russia|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/2017/05/26/health-reform-revolutionary-russia/|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=Socialist Health Association|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
During the period of the [[Soviet Union]], it was not considered reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting the material and legal part of the patients' mental health, thus leaving mental health services mainly inconsistent and unregulated.{{sfn|Koryagin|1990}} It was only guidelines of the legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling the mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them.{{sfn|Koryagin|1990}} Two guidelines on the management of mentally ill persons were published in 1961 and 1971, respectively. These were prepared by lawyer Alexander Rudyakov, who was the legal adviser to the chief psychiatrist of the [[Moscow Oblast]], and read that the grounds for urgent hospitalization was when an ill person was of social danger.{{sfn|RIANovosti|2012}} Up until 1988, psychiatry in the USSR was not regulated by laws, there were only departmental guidelines, especially those of the [[USSR Ministry of Health]], and one article in the ''Fundamentals of Health Legislation of the USSR''.{{sfn|Polubinskaya|2000}} Vague wordings in the guidelines led to their wide and arbitrary application, which was fully in the hands of psychiatrists.{{sfn|Polubinskaya|2000}} In the absence of legal control over the actions of doctors, departmental regulation of mental health care has contributed to psychiatric abuse.{{sfn|Polubinskaya|2000}} Only in the beginning of 1988, the USSR adopted the ''Statute on Conditions and Procedures for the Provision of Psychiatric Assistance'', which has been the first legal act in this field and has certainly played a positive role for Soviet psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Polubinskaya|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1988 ''Statute'' did not fully protect the rights of citizens falling into the field of activity of psychiatry, did not fully protect the mentally ill, did not contain developed mechanisms for legal control over the actions of psychiatrists and did not conform to the [[USSR Constitution]] and international standards.{{sfn|Polubinskaya|2000}}

===1992===
In Russia, the enactment of the law took place under dramatic circumstances, even with the consideration that there was an 80-year delay for any mental health legislation and given the fact that [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|political abuse of psychiatry]] was unprecedentedly widespread and denied for two decades from 1968 to 1988.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} When Soviet rule was coming to an end, the decision to develop a law on mental health was made by senior officials and under the threat of economic sanctions from the [[United States]].{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} An initiator of creating a serious, detailed mental health law in the USSR was a deputy of the last convocation of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]], a young engineer from a Uralian town.&lt;ref name=Gluzman&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2012a|year2=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he as an engineer needs it, he replied to [[Semyon Gluzman]], "All this democracy will soon run out, guys who will come to power, will start repression, and you, Dr. Gluzman, and I will have a hard time. So let's at least get these guys blocked from this possibility and adopt a civilized law eliminating the possibility of psychiatric repression!"&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; The Law was developed with the participation of psychiatrists involved in political abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Gluzman|2012a}} At a meeting held by the Health Committee of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in the autumn of 1991, the Law was approved, particularly in the speeches by the four members of the commission of the [[World Psychiatric Association]], but this event was followed by the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} As its result, the work on the draft of the Mental Health Law automatically ceased.{{sfn|Gluzman|2012b}}

In 1992, a new commission was created under the [[Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation]] and used a new concept of developing the Law; a quarter of the commission members were the representatives of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] (IPA).{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} The main developer of the Law was Svetlana Polubinskaya of the [[Institute of State and Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences]].{{sfn|Gluzman|2012b}} Polubinskaya was the sole lawyer in the commission of psychiatrists for developing the Law and lodged a categorical protest against including other lawyers in the commission.{{sfn|Savenko|2012a}}

The [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] passed the Law on 2 July 1992.{{sfn|RIANovosti|2012}} The Law has been in force since 1 January 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|RIANovosti|2012}}; {{harvnb|Savenko|2007a}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first few years, the Law was defied, seen by the doctors as an undue burden and was not let known to the patients.{{sfn|Savenko|2009}} In 1993, when the IPA printed the Law in 50 thousand copies for the general reader, quite a number of heads of the Moscow psychoneurologic dispensaries refused to circulate the Law.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} Over time, these difficulties were overcome.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} It became obligatory to know the Law to pass the certification exam.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}}

== Overview ==
The Law contains 6 sections and 50 articles. Section I of the law describes general provisions of psychiatric care in Russia, covering items such as the right of persons with mental disorders, the voluntariness of seeking care/refusal of treatment, diagnostic and treatment procedures and ensuring that medical confidentiality is maintained in dealing with mentally ill patients. Section II covers the state provision of psychiatric care, including financial provision. Section III describes the rights and duties of [[mental health worker]]s in Russia, as well as the authorised institutions that provide mental health services. Section IV details further into the types of psychiatric care and procedure of care, including the 'internment' process. Section V describes the role of law enforcement, while Section VI covers appeals against psychiatric care.{{sfn|Duma|2013}}

== Practical significance ==
Adoption of the Law ''On Psychiatric Care and Guarantees of Citizens' Rights during Its Provision'' is regarded as an epoch-making event in the history of domestic psychiatry, as establishing the legal basis for psychiatric care, and, first of all, mediating all involuntary measures through judicial procedure.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} That is a major post-Soviet achievement of Russian psychiatry and the foundation for a basically new attitude to the mentally ill as persons reserving all their civil and political rights and freedoms.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}}

The main new democratic innovations for Russian psychiatry were the two ones of the Law:
# The mandatory judicial procedure during all involuntary measures (examination, hospitalization, treatment).{{sfn|Savenko|2004}} However, during many involuntary hospitalizations in recent years, the staff of psychiatric hospitals did not follow the mandatory judicial procedure provided for by the Law.{{sfn|Chernova|2014}} Moreover, in 2012, the Independent Psychiatric Association published a paper by its former legal consultant, who in the paper proposed amendments to the Law on Fundamentals of Protection of Public Health in the Russian Federation to legalize involuntary dispensary supervision over persons with mental disorders without their informed consent and court judgment having been taken.{{sfn|Ustinov|2012a}} Establishing the dispensary supervision over persons specified in part 1 of Article 27 of the Law on Psychiatric Care always leads to legally meaningful consequences for them, such as restrictions on their right to performing specific types of professional occupation and that related to a source of an increased danger.{{sfn|Ustinov|2012a}} 
# The highly publicized claim of the full equality of rights and freedoms for the mentally disordered and those for all remaining citizens; the clear reference that it is impermissible to restrict the rights and freedoms on the basis alone of having a psychiatric diagnosis, being under dispensary supervision, in an inpatient psychiatric ward or in a psychoneurological institution.{{sfn|Savenko|2004}} The claim does not correspond to the law enforcement practice, under which the rights to be in correspondence without censorship, send and receive parcels, printed matters and remittances, use the telephone, receive visitors can be restricted by the attending doctor, the head of the unit or the head doctor in the interests of health or safety of the patients and others.{{sfn|Abramyan|2013}} In addition, the IPA former legal consultant in his paper insisted that the right to daily walks should be added to the list of patients' rights that may be restricted on the recommendation of the attending doctor or the head doctor in the interests of health or safety of patients and others.{{sfn|Ustinov|2012b}}

According to the Russian psychiatrists Valery Krasnov and Isaac Gurovisch, the Law minimizes and prevents the institutionalization of the mentally ill if their behavior does not pose a danger to others.{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|2012}} However, article 38, which was once included in the Law as a guarantee of keeping the whole Law for patients of psychiatric hospitals, is still not working, and, as a result, the service independent of health authorities to defend rights of patients in psychiatric hospitals is still not created.{{sfn|NPZ|2009}}

== Involuntary mental hospitalization ==
In 1989, the [[World Psychiatric Association]] issued a statement that includes the following phrase: "Involuntary intervention is a great infringement of the human rights and the fundamental freedom of a patient. Therefore, specific and carefully defined criteria and safeguards are needed for such intervention."{{sfn|WPA|1990}} The Law establishes substantive and procedural criteria for legitimacy of involuntary hospitalization.{{sfn|Burkov|2006}} Russia is among such countries and their parts as [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Taiwan]], and the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] that emulated the [[United States]] in adopting hospitalization criteria based on the presumed danger of the mentally ill.{{sfn|Appelbaum|1997}} The same was true of the [[Soviet Union]] where the two guidelines of 1961 and 1971 read that the ground for urgent hospitalization was social danger of an ill person.{{sfn|RIANovosti|2012}} There is such a thing carefully cultivated by authorities as the prejudice that the mentally ill allegedly pose a danger to society, though it is not so: the percentage of criminals among the mentally ill is less than that among the so-called "healthy" population.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}} Statistics show those who are ill with schizophrenia commit fewer illegal acts (less than 1%) than those considered mentally healthy.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=25}} Involuntary hospitalization in a psychiatric hospital under article 29 of the Law is to meet the following three grounds:
{{quote|A mentally disturbed individual may be hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital against his will or the will of his legal representative and without a court decision having been taken, if the individual's examination or treatment can only be carried out by in-patient care, and the mental disorder is severe enough to give rise to: 
:a) a direct danger to the person or to others, or 
:b) the individual's helplessness, i.e. an inability to take care of himself, or 
:c) a significant impairment in health as a result of a deteriorating mental condition, if the affected person were to be left without psychiatric care.{{sfn|Sakharova|Gurovich|Wahlbeck|2007|p=116}}}}

Neither direct danger{{sfn|Nasinnik|2009}} nor severe mental disorder is defined in the Law.{{sfn|Suatbaev|2006}} According to the IPA president [[Yuri Savenko]], loud claims, importunate molestations, shocking texts in a personal computer, participation in protests, hunger strikes, protest reaction against sudden and rude involuntary measures started to be called a direct danger.{{sfn|Savenko|Mursalieva|2007}} According to American psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], the psychiatric formula of "dangerousness to self and others" is very susceptible to changes of medical, political and social fashion.&lt;ref name=Szasz&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=2002|loc1=p. 56|year2=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1973, [[homosexuality]] was such a dangerousness, and since then has no longer been.&lt;ref name=Szasz/&gt; Psychologist-criminalist Nataliya Varskaya says that [[neuroleptics]] that are applied to serious patients make them "vegetables", but the ill stop posing a danger to citizens; alas, but there are no other ways to secure surrounding people against them.{{sfn|Vechernyaya Moskva|2013}} She adds, dangerous patients are not cured even in psychiatric hospitals, they were previously kept in the wards for life, doctors examined them every six months and prolonged, prolonged, prolonged their custody; the doctors were aware that these patients are very dangerous, it is inadmissible to let them go to the streets.{{sfn|Vechernyaya Moskva|2013}}

The citizen may voluntarily come to a psychiatrist who would find a severe mental disorder that requires the mandatory admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit. If the patient refuses the hospitalization offered to him, the doctor gets the right to start the procedure of involuntary hospitalization.{{sfn|Dmitrieva|Krasnov|Neznanov|2011|p=83}} As a psychiatrist says, it is only a psychiatrist who is able to inquire into a patient's condition and to decide whether his refusal to be treated is a free man's conscious choice or a symptom of a mental disorder.{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}} In psychiatrist's opinion, the mentally ill often do not feel and do not deem they are ill.{{sfn|Savenko|2012b}} They actively avoid therapy and resist all efforts to subject them to it.{{sfn|Savenko|2012b}} The more the person resists the inpatient psychiatric ward's demands for his hospitalization, the greater are his chances to find himself indoors or, more precisely, to be left there, because his resistance can be presented by the ward representatives as the lack of his due insight into mental status, as an indication of the severity of his disease.{{sfn|Khalikov|2012}} In the same vein, the practice was justified by American psychiatrist [[Benjamin Rush]] as early as the eighteenth century: "The more they resist our efforts to serve them, the more they have need of our services."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=1977|year2=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reluctance of patients to undergo neuroleptic treatment, their "spontaneous irritation", protests, etc. are considered as either unremoved symptoms of mental illness (such as depressive neurosis) or, along with tremor, anxiety, dysphoric mood disorder, as "transitory complications".{{sfn|Romek|2002}} It is profitable for doctors to hospitalize the person in any cases, then bedspace fills up.{{sfn|Minnikhanov|2010}} Remuneration of the labour of physicians in psychiatric hospitals and funding of the entire industry in Russia are carried out on the basis of the number of beds run by the doctor.{{sfn|Minnikhanov|2010}} Russian human rights activist Valery Abramkin says it should be clear for a Russian patient that each medic legally and illegally snatches his large sum from each bed.{{sfn|Abramkin|2005}} However, psychiatrists in their usual way counter the remarks that their funding depends on the number of psychiatric beds by ascribing them to antipsychiatrists and stating that the main motto of antipsychiatrists is the idea that psychiatrists are villains who dream of placing as many people as possible to madhouses.{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}}

Data obtained as results of analysing the work of the psychiatric inpatient facilities show that two thirds of patients placed in a hospital without their consent actively refuse hospitalization.{{sfn|Usov|Fyodorova|2006}} In the rest of cases, they are unable to express their attitude to the events because of their mental condition.{{sfn|Usov|Fyodorova|2006}}

== Duration and rate of hospitalization ==
Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period.{{sfn|Bonnie|2002}} In Russia, mental health care is meant to be provided by inpatient psychiatric facilities rather than by outpatient services.{{sfn|Felthous|Sass|2012|p=43}} In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.{{sfn|Mundt|Frančišković|Gurovich|2012}} In 2005, the Russian Federation had one of the highest levels of psychiatric beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} An average patient's stay in a day-and-night inpatient psychiatric facility is extremely long, 75.5 days.{{sfn|Felthous|Sass|2012|p=43}} Nevertheless, the average rehospitalization rate in the Russian Federation amounts to 21.5%, and the portion of people kept in inpatient facilities longer than one year was 21.7% in 2012{{sfn|Felthous|Sass|2012|p=43}} and 22.2% in 2013.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=169}} Psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya says she saw former convicts who have been living in a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home.{{sfn|Dorinskaya|2014|p=37}} The total number of the mentally ill registered disabled has increased by 20% over a few years, from 826,036 in 1999 to 1,020,002 in 2008 for the population of 141.9 million in the country (2010 figure).{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|Bobrov|2010}}

Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013.{{sfn|Reiter|2013}} The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation]].{{sfn|Reiter|2013}} It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|NPZ|2008a}}

Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=170}} Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need to increase the number of places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=170}} As [[Robert van Voren]], the chief executive of the [[Federation Global Initiative on Psychiatry]], supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community.{{sfn|Clark|2014}} Persons in internats are brought to sleepy condition by psychotropic drugs and have to pass through the very long and complex procedure to be discharged from an internat, as shown in the film ''See Me, Hear Me'' produced by [[Russia Today]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Watch from 07.26 {{harvnb|RT|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to law, the staff does not have the right to treat inmates in psychoneurologic internats.{{sfn|Ilina|2014}}

Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}} Until Russian society, Russian psychiatrist Emmanuil Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}}

== Involvement of law enforcement ==
According to Yuri Savenko, the IPA president, law enforcement practice is very far from the letter of the Law. Forensic psychiatric expert examination has deteriorated because of the lack of competition, and courts implicitly fulfill wishes of the hierarchy of executive authority affected by corruption.{{sfn|Savenko|2012b}}

Discrediting the citizens by instituting farfetched proceedings to obtain a ground for examination is a favorite tactic of officials whose interests are hurt by the active members of public.{{sfn|Soloviyova|2008}} The police deliver "the ill" to a psychiatric facility, and the doctor can be sure that his facility will not be reduced, and, in general, the more "patients", the more funding.{{sfn|Soloviyova|2008}} Even if the criminal case is closed due to its complete failure, it does not regard the dispensary, the person is all the same "ill".{{sfn|Soloviyova|2008}} There is nowhere to refute one's misdiagnosis in Russia.{{sfn|Soloviyova|2008}}

According to Yuliya Argunova, the IPA lawyer, police officers are obliged under part 3 of article 30 of the Law to assist medical workers in implementing involuntary hospitalization and to ensure safe conditions for the access to the hospitalized person and for his examination.{{sfn|Argunova|2011}} While assisting hospital attendants to enter into the homes of citizens whose names are written by psychoneurological dispensaries on their referrals to hospitalization, police officers have little care about the absence of a court order (which can't even be issued at such a stage), the security of the hospitalized persons, the protection of their personality and preservation of their property.{{sfn|Argunova|2011}}

According to psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the situation always develops in the same way: either in the evening or at night, or in the early morning, when a person sleeps, the police break the door down in his apartment or room, handcuff and escort them directly or through a police office to a mental hospital, where the door is closed behind the person.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} The suspected person sits face to face with a psychiatrist, then everything written by the psychiatrist will be a proof of the person's mental illness for the judge in court.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} However, there is no system that verifies the psychiatrist's statements, so the activities of the accused are often falsified, even when the patient says or performs nothing abnormal.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} One case, described by lawyers Yuri Ershov and Nataliya Kozlova, depicts an ambulance arriving with a rescue service brigade, in order for the person's front door to be broken down after the person refused to open the door. The doctor involved considered that the indignant reaction of the person to such situation was abnormal and sufficient to justify his hospitalization.{{sfn|Ershov|Kozlova|2008}} In her book ''The Psychiatrist's Notes'', Dorinskaya depicts how a person well [[orientation (mental)|oriented]] in place and time was hospitalized because of a 'fit of schizophrenia', as described in the referral to his hospitalization. In addition, the referral reported that "he beat his wife and used bad language".{{sfn|Dorinskaya|2014|p=33–35}} Dorinskaya writes how she and her colleagues forged many signatures of their patients on the forms of consent to hospitalization in medical histories before a prosecutor's investigation.{{sfn|Dorinskaya|2014|p=27}} She cites the dialog: "And what if a signature does not match?"—"And who will investigate?"{{sfn|Dorinskaya|2014|p=27}}

Although Ershov and Kozlova describe that it is easy for the lawyer to come to places of confinement and meet with his client and the administration of the penal colony after going through the formalities stipulated in law, the lawyers have to litigate for the right to get into a psychiatric hospital.{{sfn|Ershov|Kozlova|2008}}

As St. Petersburg lawyer Fanis Khalikov notes, the information about the time and place of the court session may simply be hidden from the hospitalized person and his representative. The hospitalized person may learn that he is in court at the time when the court session is underway or ready to start presently, when nothing can be done to ensure self-defence. It also happens that the person is not given an opportunity to contact his representative (lawyer), who could defend his interests in court, or with relatives (confidential agents, acquaintances, human rights organizations) so that they find and get a defence attorney to court. Or the defence attorney is not given an opportunity to meet with the hospitalized person; all possible obstacles are placed to prevent it. The hospitalized person is subjected to psychiatric treatment without his consent (and without the consent of the court) as soon as he finds himself in a psychiatric inpatient ward. [[Psychotropic drugs]] with effects varying in intensity are compulsorily administered into his body. As a result of having been drugged, the patient sometimes appears before the court in such a state that his look and behavior, caused by the influence of these drugs, can convince the judge that he sees a really inadequate person who is in need of psychiatric care. The patient is often in such an intoxication-induced condition that he is unable to put two words together, not to mention any real defence of his rights.{{sfn|Khalikov|2012}}

According to the statement made by the IPA executive director Lyubov Vinogradova in 2005, a court comes to a hospital where it must make a number of judgments as to whether rightly or wrongly the hospital applies for the involuntary treatment of a person. The court makes its judgments for 20 cases within 20 minutes. In practice it means that the judge automatically signs judgments offered to him ready-made by the staff to allow for the involuntary treatments to continue.{{sfn|Gorelik|2005}}

According to Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Ovchinsky, regional differences in forensic psychiatric expert reports are striking.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}} For example, in some regions of Russia, 8 or 9 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane; in other regions up to 75 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}} In some regions less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}}

The Russian legislation did not implement Principle 18 of the [[Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care]], approved by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1991, with respect to a patient's right to an independent psychiatric report.{{sfn|Argunova|2007}} According to a report by the European [[European Committee for the Prevention of Torture|Committee Against Torture]], the Law does not reflect a patient's right to obtain the judgment for involuntary hospitalization.{{sfn|NPZ|2008b}} In a hospital courtroom, the judge announces the judgment, but the patient does not obtain any motivated judgment.{{sfn|NPZ|2008b}} There are sometimes cases where the patient is not informed by the court at all and hears about the judgment from his or her treating doctor or head of the unit.{{sfn|NPZ|2008b}}  Since the judgment for involuntary hospitalization, as a rule, is not delivered to the hospitalized person, he cannot appeal against the judgment in appeal hearing.{{sfn|Khalikov|2012}} In other cases, the documents sent by him are censored and left in his medical record if not erased.{{sfn|Khalikov|2012}} The hospitalized person also does not have opportunities to attend the court to obtain a copy of the judgment or come to the post office to send a complaint against the judgment.{{sfn|Khalikov|2012}}

=== Exceptions of the use of law enforcement ===
Article 29 of the Law concerning involuntary hospitalization in a mental hospital shall not apply to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with [[parliamentary immunity|parliamentary]] or [[judicial immunity]].{{sfn|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}} A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his or her diploma and sentenced to imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}}; {{harvnb|NPZ|2007a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passport data of persons vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity shall be included in the computer database, which is available to every psychiatric institution and shall be used by every psychiatrist before addressing the issue of involuntary hospitalization of a person in a psychiatric hospital.{{sfn|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}} Psychiatrists commented on how to treat the judge vested with judicial immunity as follows: "While knowing that the person in twilight state is dangerous and may kill or maim people nearby, the psychiatrist should provide this information to the regional court so that three judges of the court within 10 days can send to the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court of the country]] a petition for the removal of immunity from the judge. It is only a possible victim who should be worried about the fact that aggressive actions are likely to happen now because twilight state is usually short-lived. The victim may suffer or die, but it would happen in strict accordance with the Law on the Status of Judges!"{{sfn|Evtushenko|2009|p=199–200}} According to the next item of the commentary, the psychiatrist has no right to subject the incumbent [[President of the Russian Federation]] to the procedure of involuntary psychiatric examination or involuntary hospitalization.{{sfn|Evtushenko|2009|p=201}}

== Amendments and changes ==
Amendments and changes were included in the Law several times: on 21 July 1998, 25 July 2002, 10 January 2003, 29 June and 22 August 2004, 27 July 2010, 7 February, 6 April, 21 November 2011.{{sfn|RIANovosti|2012}}

Over five years, from 1998 to 2003, the [[Serbsky Center]] made three attempts to submit for the [[Duma]] readings of amendments and additions to the Law, but the IPA and general public managed to successfully challenge these amendments, and they were finally tabled.{{sfn|Savenko|2007b}} According to the IPA, these amendments to the Law, if adopted, would have impaired patients' rights.{{sfn|Vinogradova|Savenko|2006}} In 2004, for instance, proponents of mental health reform could hardly prevent the effort by the doctors of the Serbsky Center to roll back some reforms in the Law.{{sfn|Murphy|2006}}

In November 2012, Mikhail Vinogradov, an expert of the Serbsky Center, said: "We must restore the legal act that was in the Soviet Union;" he noted that the request by a large group of Petersburg and Moscow psychiatrists to restore the old mental health act was submitted to the State Duma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakanune.RU|2012}}; {{harvnb|Goble|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Vinogradov expressed the opinion that the Soviet mental health act "has never been used for political persecution." Human rights activists who claim it did, in Vinogradov's words, "are not very mentally healthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|RSN|2012}}; {{harvnb|NG|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Valeriya Novodvorskaya]] is widely known to have been arrested "for insulting President" in September 1990 and kept in a psychiatric hospital until August 1991.{{sfn|Wilson|Bachkatov|1992|p=156}} In December 2012, Mikhail Vinogradov repeated his point, "My opinion: we should completely cancel the current Mental Health Law. One cannot give patients the right to decide their fate."{{sfn|Mishina|2012}} He added, "Do you talk about human rights activists? Most of them are just unhealthy people, I talked with them. As for the dissident General [[Pyotr Grigorenko|Grigorenko]], I too saw him, kept him under observation, and noted oddities of his thinking. But he was eventually allowed to go abroad, as you know… Who? [[Vladimir Bukovsky|Bukovsky]]? I talked with him, and he is a completely crazy character. But he too was allowed to go abroad! You see, human rights activists are people who, due to their mental pathology, are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society, and the West encourages their inability to do so."{{sfn|Mishina|2012}}

On the other hand, Leonid Kitaev-Smyk, a doctor and psychologist who specialized in extreme conditions, believes that unscrupulous people may use certain provisions of the Soviet mental health act, if restored, as a tool to settle scores, as was in Soviet times.&lt;ref name=KostDobr&gt;{{harvnb|Kostyukevich|2012}}; {{harvnb|Dobrynina|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "In some particular cases, people will simply write complaints against a person, will subject him to involuntary psychiatric examination. And he can be declared crazy after some bribe money have been paid. Creative, nonordinary, talented people have labile (as scientists say) nervous system, movable psychics. And they can be declared not quite normal mentally and, perhaps, even dangerous."&lt;ref name=KostDobr/&gt; Sergei Shishkov, the key lawyer of the Serbsky Center, also disagreed with Vinogradov, "We are unlikely to return to the Soviet mental health act. It would be contrary to the international norms, which Russia has joined, as well as to the Russian Constitution. Article 29 of the Mental Health Law allows placing dangerous patients in a hospital. But when following necessary judicial procedures. If a patient is too socially dangerous, he is placed in a hospital, and a judgment is made through the court post factum. If a patient cannot be left without treatment, but he does not give his consent to the examination, there is such a concept as "deferred examination", or examination postscriptum."{{sfn|Mishina|2012}}

== Criticism ==

=== Problems with enforcement ===
According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, the current Law is a boon and works out when having the informal human attitude to the patient.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} However, as Pshizov notes, a disastrous factor for domestic psychiatry is that those involved in [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union]] were allowed to stay on their positions until they decide to retire.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public has been reduced to making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} This view is repeated by [[Alexander Danilin]], who says that the Mental Health Law is certainly a progressive thing but, in reality, nothing changes because real change will only happen when specialists change their viewpoints and methods.{{sfn|Danilin|2008}}

According to Russian psychiatrist Emmanuil Gushansky, the Law "On Psychiatric Care and Guarantees of Citizens' Rights during Its Provision" that has been in force since 1993 is declaratory in nature and does not guarantee any rights.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p = 35}} Not only the general and reference items of the Law but also its articles of direct application, which apply to the procedure of involuntary psychiatric examination, involuntary hospitalization, to the procedure of interning and keeping the mentally ill in long-term psychiatric care institutions ("internats" in Russian), are violated in the grossest way.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p = 35}}

Legal control over observing the Mental Health Law is not exercised.&lt;ref name="Gushansky"&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gushansky|year1=1999|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatry is the only medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence for the benefit of the patient.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security.&lt;ref name="Gushansky" /&gt; Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc.&lt;ref name="Gushansky" /&gt;

In Russia, the psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization and, according to Gushansky, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor.&lt;ref name="Gushansky" /&gt; The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Gushansky" /&gt; After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions.&lt;ref name="Gushansky" /&gt; Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Gushansky" /&gt; The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.&lt;ref name="Gushansky" /&gt;

=== Problems with legislation ===
According to psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the law is in conflict with the [[Constitution of the Russian Federation]].{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} In judicial system, there is procedure for collecting evidence.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} If a person does not sign a transcript of interrogation or if he signed it, he in court can say that he was forced to sign, and the judge will investigate this.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} Anyway, it is stipulated.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} In psychiatry, a person's opinion is not considered to be something more or less reasonable at all.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}}

Psychotherapist [[Elena Romek]], after making an analysis of the Law, came to the same conclusion that provisions of the Law are in conflict with civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized norms of [[international law]], professional and ethical norms of medicine, and [[presumption of innocence]].{{sfn|Romek|2002}} If violence (involuntary examination, isolation, etc.), she says, is, in fact, used by doctors in accordance with the [[Hippocratic Oath]] to do everything to save the patient's life, the listed criteria should be generally valid, i.e. applied also to somatic diseases.{{sfn|Romek|2002}}

The 1993 law is outdated, according to lawyer Vladislav Lapinsky, who took part in its passage.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} The law has been foremost for the Russian Federation within those times but now is already outdated and does not have many issues written in.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} Lapinsky says a very big issue is that the judges are not experts in psychiatry and cannot evaluate the patient's condition objectively.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} On this ground, the judges in courts openly declare that if the doctors in a mental hospital said that the person is sick, they will not check whether healthy or not he is, whether he needs to be hospitalized or not.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} They just do what they are told by psychiatrists, and psychiatrists for various reasons{{Clarify|date = August 2015}} are very often motivated to place the person in a psychiatric hospital.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}}

According to Romek, the restriction of civil rights of a person to the extent of his forced isolation based on the possibility alone of his committing illegal acts, which is defined through the notions about it in psychiatry—a discipline very far not only from jurisprudence but from socio-humanitarian knowledge in general, clearly violates the fundamental principle of the democratic justice—presumption of innocence.{{sfn|Romek|2002}} Since, on the one hand, psychiatry considers a great number of organic anomalies (any brain damages, hormonal imbalances, infectious diseases, etc.) as potential causes of criminal insanity and, on the other hand, the diagnostics of mental disorders is based on very vague descriptions of abnormal behavior, almost anyone can be subjected to involuntary hospitalization by the criterion of social danger and in strict accordance with the Law.{{sfn|Romek|2002}}

In addition to the constitution and general international law, the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] (MHG) asserts that current legislation does not comply with the European practice of mental health care.  MHG legal programs head, Natalia Kravchuk, commented on the case of Rakevich v. Russia considered in the [[European Court of Human Rights]]: {{quote|… Russian legislation in this area is featureless and vague. It is for this reason  that it is so hard for people to assert their rights, and they have to reach the European Court of Human Rights.{{sfn|Afanasyev|Vaganov|2003}}}}St. Petersburg lawyer Fanis Khalikov believes that the mental health legislation is subject to fundamental and in-depth reforming, because it is the current editions of the Law No. 3185-1 and other regulations (for example, Chapter 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation) that do not hold strength.{{sfn|Khalikov|2012}}

=== Direct misuse ===
Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of [[Snezhnevsky]]'s school, states, if the relatives of a "not dangerous" patient with psychosis promise to "reward" the ambulance drivers, then the patient will be hospitalized.{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}} The ambulance drivers will ensure that the patient sign a "consent".{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}} As well as legislation being unobserved (the patient was hospitalized, though he tried to refuse) there are also more direct abuses of power.{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}} Rotstein says, "As for preventing abuses on the part of the state so that [[Pyotr Chaadaev|Chaadaev]] and suchlike are not declared mad, it would be at least naive to hope that the Law is able to prevent them."{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}} Rotstein sums up his opinion by quoting [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s aphorism, "In Russia there is no law—There is only a pillar; and on that pillar—a crown."{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}}

Nikolay Suatbaev expressed a similar opinion, stating that unlawful behavior should be dealt with by police, a public prosecutor's office, a court, even if an offender is mentally ill; after all, only if he is not deprived of his legal capacity, he has rights and obligations equal to those of the healthy.{{sfn|Suatbaev|2006}} The refusal to institute criminal proceedings is Illegal if based on the fact alone that the offender is on the psychiatrist's registry and all the more so if accompanied by the delivery of the materials "for taking measures" to the dispensary, which by definition is not a punitive organ.{{sfn|Suatbaev|2006}} It corrupts the ill and undermines the reputation of psychiatrists, Suatbaev says.{{sfn|Suatbaev|2006}} [[New York City]], for example, has no dispensaries at all, and if a person broke the law, it is a problem of the police; only later psychiatrists investigate if there is concern of a mental health issue, Vladimir Pshizov writes.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}}

There have been many cases where orphans have been indicted to be sent to psychiatric hospitals, often when the accused are perfectly healthy. In 2010, 20 out of 72 orphans from an orphanage in [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] were placed in a psychiatric hospital and exposed to neuroleptic medication.{{sfn|Chernova|2014}} The city prosecutor found that all the children were placed in the hospital to be treated for "emotional disorders" without having been examined by a commission of psychiatrists or provided for by a court judgment.{{sfn|Chernova|2014}} The children told they had been warned that they would be sent to a madhouse because of their bad behavior. Infant orphans who came of age and received a diagnosis in a psychiatric hospital are sent to psychoneurological internats without asking their consent.{{sfn|Voltskaya|2014}} There a new problem arises: quite legally capable people cannot get out of there, work, start their family and live a normal life.{{sfn|Voltskaya|2014}}

In 2003, lawyer Mikhail Fomin noted that psychiatrists were given preference in order to encroach upon the homes of the elderly and single people.{{sfn|Fomin|2003|p = 9}} It would seem that the law must counteract such manipulations in psychiatry but, in reality, the law leads to numerous abuses following which single pensioners are sent to internats to live the rest of their life there.{{sfn|Fomin|2003|p = 9}} In Fomin's words, no one disputes that only a specialist can make a diagnosis but vesting a psychiatrist with the unlimited power to decide the fate of a person is an extreme legislative innovation peculiar at present only to Russia.{{sfn|Fomin|2003|p = 9}} The very strict control over involuntary interment in a psychiatric institution is exercised in other countries, specifically on the part of the Church, but Russian public organizations are almost powerless.{{sfn|Fomin|2003|p = 9}}

In 2008, during a scientific and practical conference held by the Advocacy Chamber of the [[Moscow Oblast]], 200 leading legal scholars and human rights defenders noted the same trend when a tool for "relatively honest" encroachment upon property more and more often became the Mental Health Law.{{sfn|Ershov|Kozlova|2008}} In 2014, legal proceedings started against a criminal group that took away apartments from patients of a town narcology dispensary in [[Novocherkassk]].{{sfn|Larina|2014}} According to the data of law-enforcement agencies alone, the doctors sold seven apartments of patients and tried to do so in six cases more.{{sfn|Larina|2014}} An ill person who has lost his home often becomes a tramp, and citizens with no fixed abode, as a rule, do not appeal to the police.{{sfn|Larina|2014}}

According to the 2013 interview of the representatives of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] to [[Radio Free Europe]], because of the Russian Mental Health Law, sending people away for a month in a mental hospital is easy for prosecutors—with the help of pliable judges—and becomes an increasingly common tactic in the country's campaigns against political dissidence, extremism, and corruption.{{sfn|Coalson|2013}}

Robert van Voren says, "The law itself is OK but the abuse of it exists."{{sfn|Clark|2014}} The same occasionally happens in many countries monitored by the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]].{{sfn|Voren|2009}} Psychiatry is regarded as a handy tool to solve disputes, and one can easily buy a diagnosis from a psychiatrist.{{sfn|Voren|2009}} In most of the countries, forensic psychiatry has changed only slightly, the strong resistance to introducing the modern practices of forensic psychiatry is due to not disparities in schools or views but the fact that the reform of the system would mean the end of corruption.{{sfn|Voren|2009}} Criminals pay off their imprisonment of many years by having themselves declared insane.{{sfn|Voren|2009}} Wealthy husbands declare about the mental illnesses in their wives to get rid of them and yet keep control over their children.{{sfn|Voren|2009}} Children declare their parents and grandparents legally incapable to sell their apartments.{{sfn|Voren|2009}} Even medical institutions recognize their patients as insane to take their property.{{sfn|Voren|2009}}

=== Civil rights concerns ===
Russian psychiatrists Valery Krasnov, Isaak Gurovich and Alexey Bobrov suppose the Law works successfully enough,{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|Bobrov|2010}} though the results of monitorings show that the violations of the rights of patients in psychiatric hospitals are massive.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} Most psychiatric institutions deny patients the right to receive information about the condition of their mental health, copies of medical documents.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} The grounds of placing in a hospital are not only undisclosed and unexplained to patients, but even are concealed from them, their consent to hospitalization and treatment are forged.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} The patient's right to send uncensored complaints and petitions to authorities, the prosecutor's office, court is ignored.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} Such correspondence is opened and inspected and, instead of being sent to the recipient, is filed to the medical history.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} Some hospitals censor not only outgoing correspondence (as doctors say, "not to send claptrap") but also ingoing one ("not to injure the patient").{{sfn|Argunova|2012}}

Because of omissions of the administration of hospitals, patients are, as a rule, deprived of daily walks, the right to use the telephone.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} They are forbidden to see lawyers and other representatives chosen by them, to receive representatives of human rights organizations.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} In many hospitals, telephone calls and appointments with relatives are allowed only in the presence of attendant staff (a nurse, social worker or hospital attendant), that violates the privacy of such meetings.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} Receiving an appointment requires beforehand permission of the administration.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} The patient's natural right to privacy is not implemented.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}} In all psychiatric hospitals, there are patients who are there not for medical but exclusively for social indications, including conflict relationships with family members who live with them.{{sfn|Argunova|2012}}

According to former [[Radio Liberty]] commentator Eugene Novozhilov, who was persecuted by psychiatrists, human rights of a person registered in a psychiatric dispensary in Russia exist only on paper.{{sfn|Novozhilov|2013}} In the eyes of so-called "law-enforcement agencies", such a person in any situation is always guilty even if attacked and beaten by hooligans.{{sfn|Novozhilov|2013}} Such a person under any hollow pretext can be deprived of his liberty by being placed in a mental hospital for an indefinite period of time.{{sfn|Novozhilov|2013}} Then he can easily be declared legally incapable and stripped of property and all his "paper" rights, when being turned into a silent animal that spends the rest of his days.{{sfn|Novozhilov|2013}} With the help of psychotropic drugs in a psychiatric hospital, a vegetable can be made out of a person within a week.{{sfn|Novozhilov|2013}} To a person trapped in psychiatric torture chambers, the rest of his life can be turned into a long, painful and humiliating agony.{{sfn|Novozhilov|2013}}

Lyubov Vinogradova believes the law is good in theory, but in reality there has been a continuous reduction in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.{{sfn|Clark|2014}}

== Related international documents ==
In the countries of the former Soviet Union, there is very limited knowledge and understanding of declarations and international documents that guarantee the rights of the mentally ill and include the ethical codes, adopted by the [[World Psychiatric Association]], and the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] with far-reaching implications for the mental health profession.{{sfn|Voren|2013|p=24}} Individual cases can be solved by litigation at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]], however it does not change the attitudes of both mental health professionals and government officials.{{sfn|Voren|2013|p=24}}

== Reports on failures ==
In December 2013, the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] wrote to the [[World Psychiatric Association]] the open letter "On the failure of the Mental Health Law and alarming trends in domestic forensic psychiatry."{{sfn|IPA|2013}} The letter reports on the failure of article 38 of the Law and requests to dispatch the audit commission to investigate a number of cases published in the ''[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]''—the herald of the IPA, and at first to express formal concern about the contents of its letter.{{sfn|IPA|2013}}

'''Microsatellite instability''' ('''MSI''') is the condition of [[genetics|genetic]] hypermutability (predisposition to [[mutation]]) that results from impaired [[DNA mismatch repair]] (MMR). The presence of MSI represents [[phenotype|phenotypic]] evidence that MMR is not functioning normally.

MMR corrects errors that spontaneously occur during [[DNA replication]], such as single base mismatches or short [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]]. The proteins involved in MMR correct [[polymerase]] errors by forming a complex that binds to the mismatched section of DNA, excises the error, and inserts the correct sequence in its place.&lt;ref name=Ehrlich&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Ehrlich | editor-first1 = Melanie | name-list-format = vanc |title=DNA alterations in cancer: genetic and epigenetic changes | date = 2000 | publisher = Eaton Publ. | location = Natick, MA | isbn = 978-1-881299-19-6 | page = 178 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1881299198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells with abnormally functioning MMR are unable to correct errors that occur during DNA replication and consequently accumulate errors. This causes the creation of novel [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] fragments. [[Polymerase chain reaction]]-based assays can reveal these novel [[microsatellite]]s and provide evidence for the presence of MSI.

Microsatellites are repeated sequences of DNA. These sequences can be made of repeating units of one to six [[base pair]]s in length. Although the length of these microsatellites is highly variable from person to person and contributes to the individual DNA "fingerprint", each individual has microsatellites of a set length. The most common microsatellite in humans is a dinucleotide repeat of the [[nucleotide]]s [[cytosine|C]] and [[adenine|A]], which occurs tens of thousands of times across the genome. Microsatellites are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs).

== Structure ==

Microsatellite instability structure consists of repeated nucleotides, most often seen as GT/CA repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Schlötterer | first1 = Christian | last2 = Harr | first2 = Bettina | name-list-format = vanc | title = Microsatellite Instability | journal = eLS | date = March 2004 | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0000840 | url = http://web.udl.es/usuaris/e4650869/docencia/segoncicle/genclin98/recursos_classe_(pdf)/revisionsPDF/MicrosatInstab.pdf | isbn = 978-0470016176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have yet to confirm the precise definition of the MSI structure. While all researchers agree that microsatellites are repeat sequences, the lengths of the sequences remain in question.  Some research suggest that MSIs are short tandem DNA repeat sequences of one to six base pairs throughout the genome, while other research suggests that the range may be two to five.&lt;ref name="Role of microsatellite instability in the management of colorectal cancers."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buecher B, Cacheux W, Rouleau E, Dieumegard B, Mitry E, Lièvre A | title = Role of microsatellite instability in the management of colorectal cancers | journal = Digestive and Liver Disease | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 441–9 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23195666 | doi = 10.1016/j.dld.2012.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although researchers do not agree on a specific threshold for the number of tandem repeats that constitute a microsatellite, there is a consensus around their relative size. Longer sequences are called [[minisatellite]], and even longer sequences are called [[satellite DNA]] sites. Some scientists distinguish among the three categories by a minimum number of base pairs, and others use a minimum number of repeated units. The majority of repeats occur in untranslated regions, specifically [[intron]]s. However, microsatellites that occur in coding regions often inhibit the expansion of most downstream events. Microsatellites make up approximately three percent of the human genome, or more than one million fragments of DNA. Microsatellite density increases with genome size and is seen twice as much at the ends of chromosome arms than in the chromosome bodies.&lt;ref name="Microsatellites: simple sequences with complex evolution."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellegren H | title = Microsatellites: simple sequences with complex evolution | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 435–45 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15153996 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form and function==
MSI was discovered in the 1970s and 1980s. The first human disease attributed to MSI was [[xeroderma pigmentosum]]. This disease resulted from two alleles activating mutations on nucleotide excision repair.

In a broad sense, MSI results from the inability of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins to fix a DNA replication error. DNA replication occurs in the "S" phase of the [[cell cycle]]; the faulty event creating an MSI region occurs during the second replication event. The original strand is unharmed, but the daughter strand experiences a frame-shift mutation due to DNA polymerase slippage. Specifically, DNA polymerase slips, creating a temporary insertion-deletion loop, which is usually recognized by MMR proteins. However, when the MMR proteins do not function normally, as in the case of MSI, this loop results in frame-shift mutations, either through insertions or deletions, yielding non-functioning proteins.&lt;ref name="Microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boland CR, Goel A | title = Microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 138 | issue = 6 | pages = 2073–2087.e3 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20420947 | pmc = 3037515 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.12.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSI is unique to DNA polymorphisms in that the replication errors vary in length instead of sequence. The rate and direction of the mutations yielding MSIs are the major components in determining genetic differences. To date, scientists agree that the mutation rates differ in loci position. The greater the length of the MSI, the greater the mutation rate.&lt;ref name="Microsatellites: simple sequences with complex evolution."/&gt;

Although most mutations of MSI are the result of frame-shift mutations, occasionally the mutation events leading to MSI are derived from the hypermethylation of the hMLH1 (MMR protein) promoter. Hypermethylation occurs when a methyl group is added to a DNA nucleotide, resulting in gene silencing, thus yielding MSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li YC, Korol AB, Fahima T, Nevo E | title = Microsatellites within genes: structure, function, and evolution | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 991–1007 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 14963101 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have shown that oxidative damage yields frame-shift mutations, thus yielding MSI, but they have yet to agree on a precise mechanism. It has been shown that the more oxidative stress is placed on the system, the more likely it is that mutations will occur. Additionally, catalase reduces mutations, whereas copper and nickel increase mutations by increasing reduction of peroxides. Some researchers believe that the oxidative stress on specific loci results in DNA polymerase pausing at those sites, creating an environment for DNA slippage to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jackson AL, Chen R, Loeb LA | title = Induction of microsatellite instability by oxidative DNA damage | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 21 | pages = 12468–73 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9770509 | pmc = 22854 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.21.12468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers first believed that MSI was random, but there is evidence suggesting that MSI targets include a growing list of genes. Examples include the [[TGF beta receptors|transforming growth factor Beta receptor]] gene and the [[BAX (gene)|BAX]] gene. Each target leads to different phenotypes and pathologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Imai K, Yamamoto H | title = Carcinogenesis and microsatellite instability: the interrelationship between genetics and epigenetics | journal = Carcinogenesis | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 673–80 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 17942460 | doi = 10.1093/carcin/bgm228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==

Microsatellite instability is associated with colon cancer, gastric cancer, endometrium cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatobiliary tract cancer, urinary tract cancer, brain cancer, and skin cancers. MSI is most prevalent in associations with colon cancers. Each year, there are over 500,000 colon cancer cases worldwide. Based on findings from over 7,000 patients stratified for MSI-High (MSI-H), MSI-Low (MSI-L), or Microsatellite Stable (MSS) colon cancers, those with MSI-H had a more positive prognosis by 15% compared to MSI-L or MSS tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popat S, Hubner R, Houlston RS | title = Systematic review of microsatellite instability and colorectal cancer prognosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 609–18 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15659508 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.01.086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorectal tumors with MSI are found in the right colon, associated with poor differentiated tissue, high mucinogens, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and a presence of a Crohn's-like host response. MSI-H tumors contributing to colorectal cancer exhibit less metastasis than other derived colorectal cancer. This is demonstrated by previous research showing that MSI-H tumors are more representative in Stage II rather than Stage III cancers.&lt;ref name="Role of microsatellite instability in the management of colorectal cancers." /&gt;

Scientists have explored the connection of [[vacuolar protein sorting]] (VPS) proteins to MSI. Like MSI, VPS is linked to gastric and colon cancers. One study reports that VPS proteins were linked to MSI-H cancers, but not MSI-L cancers, thus restricting VPS to MSI-H-specific cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = An CH, Kim YR, Kim HS, Kim SS, Yoo NJ, Lee SH | title = Frameshift mutations of vacuolar protein sorting genes in gastric and colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability | journal = Human Pathology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–7 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21733561 | doi = 10.1016/j.humpath.2010.03.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, researchers agree that MSI-H status indicates the diagnosis of [[Lynch syndrome]], non-metastatic prognosis, and less aggressive treatment regimens. Lynch syndrome is associated with MSI and increases the risk for colon, endometrium, ovary, stomach, small intestine, hepatobiliary tract, urinary tract, brain, and skin cancers.&lt;ref name="Role of microsatellite instability in the management of colorectal cancers." /&gt;

One study conducted over 120 Lynch syndrome patients attributing Crohn's like reaction (CLR) associated with MSI to "tumor specific neopeptides generated during MSI-H carcinogenesis." This study further corroborated that the "presence of antimetastatic immune protection in MSI-H CRC patients may explain recent findings that adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy has no beneficial or even adverse effects in this collective." The researchers assume that there is a protective role of lymphocytes against the MSI-H CRC that prevents tumor metastasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buckowitz A, Knaebel HP, Benner A, Bläker H, Gebert J, Kienle P, von Knebel Doeberitz M, Kloor M | title = Microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer is associated with local lymphocyte infiltration and low frequency of distant metastases | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 92 | issue = 9 | pages = 1746–53 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15856045 | pmc = 2362037 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSI tumors in 15% of sporadic colorectal cancer result from the hypermethylation of the MLH 1 gene promoter, whereas MSI tumors in Lynch syndrome are caused by germline mutations in MLH 1, MSH 2, MSH 6, and PMS2.&lt;ref name="Role of microsatellite instability in the management of colorectal cancers." /&gt;

MSI has been evident in the cause of sebaceous carcinomas. Sebaceous carcinomas are a subset of a larger pathology, [[Muir-Torre syndrome]]. MSI is variably expressed in Muir-Torre syndrome, most often expressed with shared pathologies in patients with colon cancer. Furthermore, MMR proteins MLH 1, MSH 2, MSH6, and PMS2 are instrumental in periocular sebaceous carcinoma, which is seen on the eyelid in 40% of sebaceous carcinomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajan Kd A, Burris C, Iliff N, Grant M, Eshleman JR, Eberhart CG | title = DNA mismatch repair defects and microsatellite instability status in periocular sebaceous carcinoma | journal = American Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 157 | issue = 3 | pages = 640–7.e1–2 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24321472 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajo.2013.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 the FDA made a historic announcement regarding an immunotherapeutic manufactured by Merck with the brand name called Keytruda® ([[pembrolizumab]]) ([[PD-1 inhibitor]]) was approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment. This indication is independent of [[PD-L1]] expression assessment, tissue type and tumor location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm560040.htm|title=Approved Drugs - FDA grants accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for first tissue/site agnostic indication|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsatellite instability diagnostics===
MSI is a good marker for determining Lynch syndrome and determining a prognosis for cancer treatments. In 1996, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) hosted an international workshop on Lynch Syndrome, which led to the development of the “Bethesda Guidelines” and loci for MSI testing.  During this first workshop the NCI has agreed on five microsatellite markers necessary to determine MSI presence: two mononucelotides, BAT25 and BAT26, and three dinucelotide repeats, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250. MSI-H tumors result from MSI of greater than 30% of unstable MSI loci (&gt;2 or more of the 5 loci). MSI-L tumors result from less than 30% of unstable MSI biomarkers. MSI-L tumors are classified as tumors of alternative etiologies. Several studies demonstrate that MSI-H patients respond best to surgery alone, rather than chemotherapy and surgery, thus preventing patients from needlessly experiencing chemotherapy.&lt;ref name="Role of microsatellite instability in the management of colorectal cancers." /&gt; [[File:MSI detection by real time PCR.jpg|thumb|Detection of microsatellite instability by real-time PCR]]

Six years later, during the second NCI hosted workshop to revisit Lynch Syndrome in 2002, the Bethesda Guidelines were revised (later published in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Umar A, Boland CR, Terdiman JP, Syngal S, de la Chapelle A, Rüschoff J, Fishel R, Lindor NM, Burgart LJ, Hamelin R, Hamilton SR, Hiatt RA, Jass J, Lindblom A, Lynch HT, Peltomaki P, Ramsey SD, Rodriguez-Bigas MA, Vasen HF, Hawk ET, Barrett JC, Freedman AN, Srivastava S | display-authors = 6 | title = Revised Bethesda Guidelines for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) and microsatellite instability | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 96 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–8 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14970275 | pmc = 2933058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) which recommended new criteria for MSI testing.  Specifically, they identified the five mononucleotide loci as being superior, over the mixture of mono and dinucleotide loci because the dinucleotide loci could appear shifted, when in fact they were not, thus increasing the possibility of a false positive MSI-H result.  The first commercially available kit was provided by Promega Corporation, Madison, Wisconsin called the [https://www.promega.com/products/molecular-diagnostics/amplification/microsatellite-instability-msi-analysis/?catNum=MD1641 Microsatellite Instability 1.2 Analysis System] (RUO).  Since then, the Promega MSI RUO has been widely adopted since 2004, with over 120 peer-reviewed publications citing it's global standing as the gold standard in determining the MSI status of cancer tissue. 

Recently, real-time PCR based MSI detection kits [http://www.seasunbio.com/english/products2.html] have been introduced in the market successfully. Single step closed-tube format, high accuracy and sensitivity of the real-time PCR based products without any additional analysis after the PCR amplification comparing to the traditional (PCR followed with fragment analysis) methods has been considered as critical advantages.

Direct and indirect mechanisms contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Direct mechanisms include pathways that metabolize the drug, while indirect mechanisms include pathways that respond to the chemotherapy treatment.  The NER DNA repair pathway plays a substantial role in reversing cell damage caused by chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duldulao MP, Lee W, Le M, Chen Z, Li W, Wang J, Gao H, Li H, Kim J, Garcia-Aguilar J | title = Gene expression variations in microsatellite stable and unstable colon cancer cells | journal = The Journal of Surgical Research | volume = 174 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21816436 | doi = 10.1016/j.jss.2011.06.016 | pmc = 3210903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries since 2010==

Researchers have found another MSI, called elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST). However, EMAST is unique in that it is not derived from MMR, and it is commonly associated with [[TP53]] mutations.&lt;ref name="Microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer."/&gt;

EMAST is seen in a variety of cancers including those of the lung, head and neck, colorectal, skin, urinary tract, and the reproductive organs. External organ sites have more potential for EMAST. Some researchers believe that EMAST maybe a consequence of mutagenesis. EMAST positive margins in otherwise negative cancer margins suggest disease relapse for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merritt MA, Cramer DW, Missmer SA, Vitonis AF, Titus LJ, Terry KL | title = Dietary fat intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by tumour histology | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 110 | issue = 5 | pages = 1392–401 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24473401 | doi = 10.1038/bjc.2014.16 | pmc = 3950866 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''midwakh''''', also spelled ''medwakh'', is a small [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]] of [[Arabian]] origin, in which [[dokha]], a sifted [[Iran]]ian [[tobacco]] product mixed with aromatic leaf and bark herbs, is smoked. The bowl of a midwakh pipe is typically smaller than that of a traditional western tobacco pipe. It is usually loaded by dipping the bowl into a container of [[dokha]] flakes.

Midwakh are primarily produced in the [[United Arab Emirates]], and are especially popular in [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Al Ain]].

==Construction==
The pipes may be custom made, allowing the smoker to specify the dimensions and design. Midwakh are crafted from a variety of materials including wood, bone, base metal, marble, steel, gold, silver, plastic (with a metal bowl), or glass. They may incorporate precious items such as diamonds, gemstones and rings of precious metal inscribed with symbols, such as a falcon similar to the one shown in the UAE coat of arms. The pipe may be crafted to resemble a dromedary camel, a highly revered animal in the UAE; the opening of the bowl shaped as the camel's mouth, with a small hole connected to a metal shaft inside the body of the pipe to conduct the smoke to the user. Among many modern variations of the midwakh, some are covertly disguised as pens, some can be split apart for cleaning, and some can have double bowls or double stems. Most midwakhs crafted today have a mouthpiece sized to fit a plastic filter.

'''Mirko Beljanski''' (1923 – 27 October 1998) was a French-Serbian molecular biologist, notable in the latter part of his career for devising and promoting a number of ineffective cancer treatments, and for treating French president [[François Mitterrand]] with them.&lt;ref name=hos/&gt;

Beljanski was found guilty of medical malpractice in 1994. Both he and Mitterrand subsequently died of cancer.

==Career==
Beljanski was born in 1923 in [[Yugoslavia]]. He came to [[France]] to study, and lived there for the rest of his life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12377">'''Multiple sex partners''' ('''MSP''') is the measure and incidence of engaging in [[sexual activities]] with two or more people within a specific time period. Sexual activity with MSP can happen simultaneously or serially. MSP includes sexual activity between people of a different [[gender]] or the same gender. MSP can also mean that one person may have a long-term relationship or relationships, and when the second relationship begins, the person can be said to have multiple sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promiscuous&amp;nbsp;— definition of promiscuous by the Free Online dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/promiscuous|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another term, ''[[polyamoruous]]'', is a behavior and not a measure describing multiple romantically sexually or romantically committed relationships at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sheff | first = Elisabeth | title = When Someone You Love Is Polyamorous: Understanding Poly People and Relationships | publisher = Thorntree Press | location = Portland, Oregon | year = 2016 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0996460195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people having MSP in the last year is an indicator used by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to evaluate [[risky sexual behavior]] in [[adolescent]]s and  monitoring changes in the worldwide HIV/AIDS infection rates and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Tsala Dimbuene, Z., Emina, J., &amp; Sankoh, O. (2014). UNAIDS ‘multiple sexual partners’ core indicator: promoting sexual networks to reduce potential biases.Global Health Action, 7. doi:https://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.23103  http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/23103#Abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and quantification==
Epidemiologists and clinicians who quantify risks associated with MSP do so to identify those who have had sexual intercourse with more than one partner in the past 12 months. For the purposes of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)'s effort to eliminate [[HIV]] infection, quantifying measures progress in reducing the percentage of those with [[AIDS]]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described their rationale by assuming that the spread of HIV in most locales depends upon the number of  MSP. Those who have MSP possess a higher risk of HIV transmission than individuals that do not have multiple sex partners.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

WHO uses indicators, such as MSP, age, mortality, morbidity, geographical location and signs and [[symptom]]s of disease. This is done so that change can be measured and so that the effect of indicators can be assessed.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

Following the initial quantification of the number of MSP, the respondent is again surveyed three and then five years later. In addition to the survey, respondents' sexual histories are obtained. Analysis assists those conducting the study to verify and help define the term MSP.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

For the indicator MSP, WHO has defined a summary of what it measures, rationale for the indicator, numerator, denominator and calculation, recommended measurement tools,  measurement, frequency, and the strengths and weaknesses of the indicator.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

WHO's definition of MSP has some strengths and weaknesses The quantification is an indicator and a picture of the levels of higher-risk sex in a locale. If those surveyed changed their activity to one sexual partner, the change will be quantified by changes in the indicator. This disadvantage is that though a respondent may reduce the number of MSP in a 12 month period, the indicator will not reflect this change in sexual activity. Even so, decreasing the number of MSP may not indicate a change. Potentially this definition and quantification may have a significant impact on the pandemic of HIV and used as a measure of program success. WHO recommends that additional indicators that quantify MSP more precisely to capture the reduction in multiple sexual partners in general.&lt;ref name=WHO2015&gt;{{cite book|publisher=World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)|title=Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting 2015|date=2015|isbn=9789241509343|page=33|access-date= 12 January 2016  |url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/JC2702_GARPR2015guidelines_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sexually transmitted infections at record high |publisher= The Brown and White  (university newsletter) | url = http://thebrownandwhite.com/2016/12/04/sti-record-high/# | accessdate = 2016-12-20 |first= Amber |last= Cardona |date= 2016-12-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, having multiple sex partners has been quantified to mean that   those greater than or equal to age 25 had four or more sexual partners in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Schools Teaching Prevention | publisher = National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 9 December 2015| url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2015/nhpc-press-release-schools-teaching-prevention.html | accessdate = 2017-02-19  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==
Epidemiologists in Tanzania used the indicator MSP in their study of AIDS incidence among 15-19-year-olds by documenting the respondent as being sexually active and having MSP in the last 12 months.&lt;ref name="ExaveryLutambi2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Exavery|first1=Amon|last2=Lutambi|first2=Angelina M|last3=Mubyazi|first3=Godfrey M|last4=Kweka|first4=Khadija|last5=Mbaruku|first5=Godfrey|last6=Masanja|first6=Honorati|title=Multiple sexual partners and condom use among 10 - 19 year-olds in four districts in Tanzania: What do we learn?|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=11|issue=1|year=2011|pages=490|issn=1471-2458|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-490|pmid=21696581|pmc=3141458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history (medicine)==

A complete medical history includes an assessment of the number sexual partners with which a person has had within a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data from Tufts University Provide New Insights into Medical Students (Assessment of Medical Student and Resident/Fellow Knowledge, Comfort, and Training With Sexual History Taking in LGBTQ Patients) | publisher = Health &amp; Medicine Week| date= 2015-06-12 | accessdate = 2016-01-11 | url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA416887528&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=upitt_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=1122a69cd4aa9d732c76b3670b01432a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A social history (abbreviated "SocHx") that part of a medical exam addressing familial, occupational, and recreational aspects of the patient's personal life that have the potential to be clinically important.&lt;ref name = cdc2015/&gt; MSP is only the description of the behavior described in clinical terms. Promiscuity can mean that a moral judgement is made because some parts of societies promote sexual activity to occur only within exclusive, single-partner, committed relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK’s most promiscuous city in ‘one night stand’ poll  revealed|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/08/liverpool-named-uks-most-promiscuous-city-in-one-night-stand-poll-4254176/|website=Metro.co.uk|publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often the way researchers define a society's promiscuity levels at any given time.  MSP increases the risk of many diseases and other conditions.

The CDC in the past has quantified  MSP for adolescents with the following descriptions:
*Never having had sexual intercourse (no MSP)
*Having multiple sex partners, defined as having had four or more sex partners during one's lifetime
*Sexual activity was defined as having had sexual intercourse during the past 3 months&lt;ref&gt;

Some clinicians define MSP by also taking into account concurrent sexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 11% of Men Have Multiple Sex Partners | publisher=WebMD | url = http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/news/20071031/11-percent-of-men-have-multiple-sex-partners

==Research==
The likelihood of developing substance abuse or dependence increases linearly with the number of sex partners, an effect more pronounced for women. People who have a higher number of sex partners do not have higher rates of anxiety or depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Lingering Psychological Effects of Multiple Sex Partners |publisher= Psychology Today |last=Krauss  |first=Susan  |date = 20 April 2013 | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/the-lingering-psychological-effects-multiple-sex-partners | accessdate = 2016-01-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teachman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teachman|first1=Jay|title=Premarital Sex, Premarital Cohabitation, and the Risk of Subsequent Marital Dissolution Among Women|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=65|issue=2|year=2003|pages=444–455|issn=0022-2445|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00444.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==

Prevention of disease strategies include intensive counseling of those who have met the definition of multiple sex partners.&lt;ref name = cdc2015&gt;{{cite web | title = Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6403a1.htm?s_cid=rr6403a1_w# | accessdate = 2017-02-20  }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jamaica one of the primary contributing associations to the AIDS/HIV epidemic is the risky behavior of having multiple sex partners. A 2004 Behavioral Surveillance Survey demonstrated that 89 percent of males and 78 percent of females aged 15 to 24 had sex with a nonmarital or noncohabitating partner in the preceding 12 months. Fifty-six percent of males and 16 percent of females had multiple sex partners in the preceding 12 months.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/jamaica_profile.pdf "Health Profile: Jamaica"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913115359/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/jamaica_profile.pdf |date=2008-09-13 }}. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sub-sahara Africa, travel and wealth is a risk factor in engaging in sexual activities with multiple sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Household Wealth, Travel Associated with Having Multiple Partners among Sub-Saharan African Men - International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | publisher=HighBeam Research | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-239918277.html | accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">The '''National Birth Control League''' was a [[United States]] organization founded in the early 20th century to promote the education and use of [[birth control]].

It was founded in 1915 by [[Mary Dennett]], Jesse Ashley and Clara Gruening Stillman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance M.

Its activities were published in the ''[[Birth Control Review]]''.&lt;ref name="Sanger pp. 16, 24" /&gt; 

A committee was formed of 100 women to support the birth control activism work of [[Margaret Sanger]].&lt;ref name="Sanger pp. 16, 24"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Sanger|title=The Birth Control Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k0IsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24|year=1917|publisher=M. Sanger|pages=16, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, though, the organization was subtler than Sanger in approach. It targeted much of its activities towards conservative and wealthy individuals. It eschewed membership of extremists, like [[Emma Goldman]], and it particularly sought to spotlight the "scientific" aspects of birth control in an era when the topic was considered obscene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David M. Kennedy|title=Birth Control in America: The Career of Margaret Sanger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CojUQpSS6wC&amp;pg=PA76|date=1 January 1970|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-01495-2|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents in 24 states were not allowed to discuss contraception with their married children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth C.

In 1919, Mary Dennett pushed for a birth control bill in the New York legislature, which failed. As a result, the National Birth Control League was dismantled. Dennett immediately formed a new organization, the Voluntary Parenthood League. Her sole purpose was to revise federal obscenity-focused legislation to exclude birth control, rather than tackle the issue on a state-by-state basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David M.

'''Natural growth promoters''' (NGPs) are [[feed additives]] for farm animals.

==Definition==
Different categories of feed additives for farm animals are referred to as natural growth promoters (NGPs) or non-[[antibiotic]] growth promoters. They are commonly regarded as favorable alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in livestock production.

==Categories ==
NGPs include predominantly organic acids, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, phytogenics, tannins, feed enzymes and immune stimulants., an ongoing search for alternatives has created a large variety of NGPs for pigs, poultry, ruminants and aquatic species.

==General benefits ==
The main advantage of NGPs over AGPs is that they do usually not bear any risk regarding bacterial resistance or undesired residues in animal products such as meat, milk or eggs. Addition of NGPs to feeds of farm animals may have a number of beneficial effects, including:

==Mode of action ==
===Acidifiers===
Acidifiers, such as organic acids or their salts, are used to prevent microbial degradation of raw materials or finished feeds, especially under poor storage conditions (e.g. high moisture content, high levels of contamination with molds). Moreover, acidifiers may improve growth performance through establishment of low gastrointestinal pH conditions which support endogenous digestive enzymes and reduce undesired gut [[microorganism]]s. Many dietary acidifiers are based on propionic acid, formic acid, lactic acid and others, either as single components or in combination. Some acidifiers also contain inorganic acids (e.g. phosphoric acid).

===Probiotics===
Probiotics are live microorganisms or viable spores which support the development of a beneficial gut [[microflora]]. Probiotic bacteria (e.g. from the [[genus|genera]] ''Lactobacillus'', ''Bifidobacterium'', ''Enterococcus'') counteract undesired microorganisms such as ''Salmonella'' or ''E. coli'' by blocking receptors on the gut wall, production of antimicrobial substances or activation of the immune system.

===Prebiotics===
Prebiotics are carbohydrates which are indigestible for the host animal. On the other hand, they are selectively fermented by beneficial gut bacteria and, therefore, support a healthy gut microflora. These include [[fructose oligosaccharide]]s (FOS) including [[inulin]], [[transgalactose oligosaccharide]]s (GOS), [[xylooligosaccharide]]s (XOS) and soy oligosaccharides such as [[stachyose]], [[verbose]] and [[raffinose]].  [[Mannan oligosaccharide]]s are sometimes included as prebiotics but are not fermentable.  This was confirmed by Smiricky-Tjardes ''et al.'' at the University of Illinois&lt;ref&gt;http://jas.fass.org/cgi/content/full/81/10/2505&lt;/ref&gt; and so might be more appropriately termed immunosaccharides since they act as decoys for pathogen attachment (''Salmonella'' and ''E. Coli'') and result in increased immunoglobulins (IgAs) at intestinal level.

===Synbiotics===
Combined administration of probiotics and prebiotics, referred to as synbiotics, is supposed to cause synergistic effects in terms of gut health and performance.

===Phytogenics===
{{merge from|Phytogenics|date=July 2018|section=TRUE}}

Phytogenics are derived from herbs, spices or aromatic plants and have shown antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant or sedative properties. They are known for their appetizing effects, since they increase the palatability of the feed and stimulate endogenous digestive enzymes. Moreover, phytogenics have a pronounced impact on the gut microflora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Männer | first1 = K | date = Dec 2011 | title = Effects of a phytogenic feed additive on growth performance and ileal nutrient digestibility in broiler chickens | url = | journal = Poult Sci. | volume = 90 | issue = 12| pages = 2811–6 | doi = 10.3382/ps.2011-01515 | pmid = 22080020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tannins===
Tannins are polyphenolic compounds produced by plants, ranging in concentrations from &lt;2% to more than 20% of dry weight and may protect plants from herbivore, increase resistance against pathogens, or protect tissues such as wood against decay.&lt;ref&gt;Scalbert, Augustin. "Antimicrobial properties of tannins." Phytochemistry 30.12 (1991): 3875-3883.&lt;/ref&gt; In-vitro and in-vivo results suggest that two of the most abundant and common source of tannins, chestnut (''Castanea sativa''; hydrolyzable tannins) and quebracho (''Schinopsis lorentzii'', condensed tannins) extracts, are effective to reduce and control infection.&lt;ref&gt;Elizondo, Ana M., et al. "Effect of tannins on the in vitro growth of Clostridium perfringens." Veterinary microbiology 145.3 (2010): 308-314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tosi, Giovanni, et al. "Efficacy test of a hydrolysable tannin extract against necrotic enteritis in challenged broiler chickens." Italian Journal of Animal Science 12.3 (2013): e62.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover are considered a natural alternative to AGPs due to the difficulty of bacteria to develop resistance against the diverse range of molecules that contain these plant compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Redondo, L. M., et al. "Hydrolyzable and condensed tannins resistance in Clostridium perfringens." Anaerobe 34 (2015): 139-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feed enzymes===
Animal feeds contain varying levels of indigestible nutrients and undesired components such as fiber, phytate or proteins with antigenic effects. Different feed enzymes such as, carbohydrases, phytases or proteases, can be included in feeds to improve the utilization of energy and nutrients or to degrade several undesired components. Moreover, some enzymes (e.g. amylases, lipases) can be added to the feed of young animals in order to support the endogenous enzyme secretions.

===Immune stimulants===
Different feed additives may function as stimulator or modulator of immunity processes. Specific cell wall fragments from bacteria or yeasts or sea algae may induce activation of immune cells (e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes).

==History of human nutrition==

===Antiquity===
[[File:Hippocrates pushkin02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Stone sculpture of a man's head|[[Hippocrates]] lived about 400 BC, and Galen and the understanding of nutrition followed him for centuries.]]
The first recorded dietary advice, carved into a [[Babylon]]ian stone tablet in about 2500 BC, cautioned those with pain inside to avoid eating [[onion]]s for three days. [[Scurvy]], later found to be a [[vitamin C deficiency]], was first described in 1500 BC in the [[Ebers Papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Profession of Dietetics|author1=Payne-Palacio, June R.  |author2=Canter, Deborah D.|year=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-02608-5|pages=3, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Walter Gratzer]], the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of ''[[qi]]'' developed, a spirit or "wind" similar to what Western Europeans later called ''[[pneuma]]''.&lt;ref name=Gratzer40&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Food was classified into "hot" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and "cold" (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41 /&gt; ''[[Humorism|Humours]]'' developed perhaps first in China alongside ''qi''.&lt;ref name=Gratzer40 /&gt; Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements ([[Wu Xing]]: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time in Italy, [[Alcmaeon of Croton]] (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result in disease marked by [[obesity]] or [[emaciation]].&lt;ref name=Gratzer36&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded nutritional experiment with human subjects is found in the Bible's [[Book of Daniel]]. Daniel and his friends were captured by the king of [[Babylon]] during an invasion of Israel. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables ([[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]) and water in accordance with their [[Jewish]] dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial. Daniel and his friends received their diet for ten days and were then compared to the king's men. Appearing healthier, they were allowed to continue with their diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=dan#en-NIV-21743 Daniel 1:5–16]. Biblegateway.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCollum, Elmer V.|title=A History of Nutrition|publisher=The Riverside Press (Houghton Mifflin)|location=Cambridge, Mass.|year=1957|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and, therefore, contains "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060824032910/http://rcw.raiuniversity.edu/biotechnology/MScBioinformatics/generalnutrition/lecture-notes/lecture-01.pdf ''History of the Study of Nutrition in Western Culture''] (Rai University lecture notes for General Nutrition course, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]], who recognized and was concerned with obesity, which may have been common in southern Europe at the time,&lt;ref name=Gratzer36 /&gt; said, "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Let food by thy medicine… | author=Smith, Richard | journal=BMJ |date=24 January 2004| volume=328 | doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g | pages=0–g | issue=7433| pmc=318470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The works that are still attributed to him, ''[[Hippocratic Corpus|Corpus Hippocraticum]]'', called for [[moderation]] and emphasized [[Physical exercise|exercise]].&lt;ref name=Gratzer36 /&gt;

[[File:Galen detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Shoulder high portrait of a man with beard and mustache wearing a cap|Followed for a millennium and a half, [[Galen]] (1st century) created the first coherent (although mistaken) theory of nutrition.&lt;ref name=Gratzer37&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Salt]], [[Black pepper|pepper]] and other spices were prescribed for various ailments in various preparations for example mixed with vinegar. In the 2nd century BC, [[Cato the Elder]] believed that [[cabbage]] (or the urine of cabbage-eaters) could cure digestive diseases, ulcers, warts, and intoxication. Living about the turn of the millennium, [[Celsus|Aulus Celsus]], an ancient Roman doctor, believed in "strong" and "weak" foods (bread for example was strong, as were older animals and vegetables).&lt;ref name=Gratzer37 /&gt;

One mustn't overlook the doctrines of [[Galen]]: In use from his life in the 1st century AD until the 17th century, it was [[heresy]] to disagree with him for 1500 years.&lt;ref name=Gratzer&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 38, 39, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen was physician to gladiators in [[Pergamon]], and in [[Rome]], physician to [[Marcus Aurelius]] and the three emperors who succeeded him.&lt;ref name=Gratzer38&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Galen's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monks]] at the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|School of Salerno]] in ''[[Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum]]'', which still had users in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Gratzer39&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen believed in the bodily ''humours'' of Hippocrates, and he taught that ''pneuma'' is the source of life. [[Classical element|Four elements]] (earth, air, fire and water) combine into "complexion", which combines into states (the [[four temperaments]]: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic). The states are made up of pairs of attributes (hot and moist, cold and moist, hot and dry, and cold and dry), which are made of [[humorism|four humours]]: blood, phlegm, green (or yellow) bile, and black bile (the bodily form of the elements). Galen thought that for a person to have [[gout]], [[kidney stones]], or [[arthritis]] was scandalous, which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butler's ''[[Erehwon]]'' (1872) where sickness is a crime.&lt;ref name=Gratzer /&gt;
[[File:James lind.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Waist high portrait drawn in pen and ink of a man balancing three books|[[James Lind]] conducted in 1747 the first controlled [[clinical trial]] in modern times, and in 1753 published ''Treatise on Scurvy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Perspectives in Clinical Research|date=January–March 2010|pages=6–10|author=Bhatt, Arun|title=Evolution of Clinical Research: A History Before and Beyond James Lind|pmc=3149409|pmid=21829774|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 1500s, [[Paracelsus]] was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly.&lt;ref name=Gratzer /&gt; Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41 /&gt; Ultimately, 16th century works of [[Andreas Vesalius]], sometimes called the father of modern [[Outline of human anatomy|human anatomy]], overturned Galen's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the [[mechanics]] of Newton and Galileo. [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], who discovered several [[gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]], performed the first [[quantitative research|quantitative experiment]]. [[Robert Boyle]] advanced [[chemistry]]. [[Sanctorius]] measured [[body weight]]. Physician [[Herman Boerhaave]] modeled the [[digestion|digestive process]]. Physiologist [[Albrecht von Haller]] worked out the difference between [[nerve]]s and [[muscle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes forgotten during his life, [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment in 1747. Lind discovered that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. Between 1500 and 1800, an estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy.&lt;ref name=Willett-scurvy&gt;{{cite book|author=Willett, Walter C. with Skerrett, Patrick J.|title=Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide To Healthy Eating|year=2005|origyear=2001|isbn=978-0-684-86337-5|publisher=Free Press (Simon &amp; Schuster)|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was ignored for forty years, after which British sailors became known as "limeys."&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 21–24, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The essential [[vitamin C]] within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists until 1932.&lt;ref name=Willett-scurvy /&gt;

===Lavoisier and modern science===
[[File:Lavoisier humanexp.jpg|alt=Black and white engraving of Lavoisier's laboratory, man seated at left with a tube attached to his mouth, man at center conducting experiment, woman seated at right drawing, other people visible|thumb|left|By containing his assistant, [[Armand Seguin]], inside a rubber suit fitted with a tube sealed to his mouth with putty, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] first measured [[basal metabolic rate]].&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing by [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze|Madame Lavoisier]] (seated at right).]]
Around 1770, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat. Called the most fundamental chemical discovery of the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silberberg, Martin S.|year=2009|title=Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-304859-8|edition=5|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavoisier discovered the principle of [[conservation of mass]]. His ideas made the [[phlogiston theory]] of [[combustion]] obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for the survival of fowl. In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] were recognized as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.&lt;ref name="Paul Muljadi"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dpNGTccTTbEC&amp;pg=PA42 | title=Health | publisher=Paul Muljadi | author=Muljadi, Paul | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrate]]s (sugar), [[fat]] (olive oil), and [[water]] died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying [[protein]] as an essential dietary component.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Prout]] in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|title=William Prout (1785–1850):  A Biographical Sketch|author=Ahrens, Richard|date=January 1, 1977|volume=107|issue=1|page=15|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/107/1/15.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|doi=10.1093/jn/107.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] and [[Justus von Liebig]] quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds).&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; With a reputation as the leading [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]] of his day but with no credentials in [[Physiology|animal physiology]],&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter 1994, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig grew rich making food [[extract]]s like beef [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company|bouillon]] and [[infant formula]] that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 86, 92, 95, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Takaki_Kanehiro.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Neck high portrait of middle aged man wearing a military uniform|[[Takaki Kanehiro]] surmised that [[beriberi]] was a nutritional deficiency not an infectious disease.]]
In the early 1880s, [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease, (not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of [[thiamine]] to the diet, later understood as a cure&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter 1994, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 1896, [[Eugen Baumann]] observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands. In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. His assistant, [[Gerrit Grijns]] correctly identified and described the anti-beriberi substance in rice. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as [[thiamine]].

===From 1900 to the present===
[[File:Carl_von_Voit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Shoulder high portrait of white haired man with a mustache and beard wearing a suit and bow tie|[[Carl von Voit]] has been called the father of modern dietetics.]]
In the early 20th century, [[Carl von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition.  In 1906, Edith G. Willcock and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Frederick Hopkins]] showed that the amino acid [[tryptophan]] aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Willcock, Edith G. |author2=F.

&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:1em;width:15em;"&gt;[[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] closed down its nutrition department after World War II because the subject seemed to have been completed between 1912 and 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carpenter, Kenneth J.|title=A Short History of Nutritional Science: Part 4 (1945–1985)|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/133/11/3331.long|date=November 1, 2003|volume=133|issue=11|pages=3331–3342|pmid=14608041|doi=10.1093/jn/133.11.3331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In 1912, [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]], a vital factor in the diet, from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to be derived from ammonia.  The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century.

In 1913, [[Elmer McCollum]] and [[Marguerite Davis]] discovered the first vitamin, fat-soluble [[vitamin A]], then water-soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] and [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Osborne]] also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919, Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil.&lt;ref name=NAS-D&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/beyond-discovery/vitamin-d.pdf|title=Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D|author1=Conlan, Roberta|author2=Elizabeth Sherman|year=October 2000|accessdate=June 13, 2016|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil, but found that it still cured rickets.&lt;ref name=NAS-D /&gt;  Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discover [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, originally calling it "food factor X" until 1925.

In 1925, Hart discovered that trace amounts of [[copper]] are necessary for [[iron]] absorption.  In 1927, [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935, he synthesized it, and in 1937, he won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]].

In the 1930s, [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components that the body cannot synthesize.  In 1935, Underwood and Marston independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]].  In 1936, [[Eugene Floyd DuBois]] showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake. In 1938, [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E and then he tragically disappeared.&lt;ref name=NAS&gt;{{cite web|author=Subcommittee on Vitamin Tolerance, Committee on Animal Nutrition, National Research Council|title=Vitamin E, in Vitamin Tolerance of Animals|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=949&amp;page=23|year=1987|publisher= National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=F.B.I.

In 1940, [[rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II]] took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941, the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs) were established by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]].

In 1992, The U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/MyPyramid/OriginalFoodGuidePyramids/FGP/FGPPamphlet.pdf |publisher=United States Department Of Agriculture |title=USDA's Food Guide Pyramid Booklet, 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824061938/http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/MyPyramid/OriginalFoodGuidePyramids/FGP/FGPPamphlet.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced the [[Four Food Groups]] (1956-1992) and was superseded by the concept of [[MyPlate]] (2011–present).

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Nutrient}}
The list of nutrients that people are known to require is, in the words of [[Marion Nestle]], "almost certainly incomplete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|authorlink=Marion Nestle|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|publisher=University of California Press|page=413|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|year=2013|origyear=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, nutrients are thought to be of two types: [[macro-nutrient]]s which are needed in relatively large amounts, and [[micronutrient]]s which are needed in smaller quantities.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman /&gt; A type of carbohydrate, [[dietary fiber]], i.e. non-digestible material such as cellulose, is required,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/get-the-facts-on-fiber|title=Get the Facts on Fiber|website=webmd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, although the exact reasons remain unclear. Some nutrients can be stored - the fat-soluble vitamins - while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients, or for some vitamins and minerals, too much of a required nutrient.

===Macronutrients===
The macronutrients are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[fat]]s, [[protein]], and [[water]].&lt;ref name=Fuhrman /&gt;
The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and [[lipid]]s from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital ''C'' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&amp;nbsp;kJ approximately (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal) per gram,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7167-4684-3 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharide]]s (glucose, fructose and galactose) to complex [[polysaccharide]]s (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomer]]s bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[Essential fatty acid|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acid]]s, some of which are [[Essential amino acid|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production, just as ordinary glucose, in a process known as [[gluconeogenesis]]. By breaking down existing protein, the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to intermediates in cellular respiration; the remaining ammonia is discarded primarily as urea in urine.

====Carbohydrates====
{{Main|Carbohydrate}}
Carbohydrates may be classified as [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s, or [[polysaccharide]]s depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They constitute a large part of foods such as [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[bread]], and other [[grain]]-based products, also [[potatoes]] , yams, beans, fruits, fruit juices and vegetables.
Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides contain one, two, and three or more sugar units, respectively. Polysaccharides are often referred to as ''complex'' carbohydrates because they are typically long, multiple branched chains of sugar units.

Traditionally, simple carbohydrates are believed to be absorbed quickly, and therefore to raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates. This, however, is not accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Otto|first=H|title=Diabetik Bei Diabetus Mellitus|year=1973|publisher=Verlag Hans Huber|location=Bern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crapo|first=P|author2=Reaven, Olefsky |journal=Diabetes|year=1977|volume=26|pages=1178–1183|doi=10.2337/diabetes.26.12.1178|pmid=590639|title=Postprandial plasma-glucose and -insulin responses to different complex carbohydrates|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crapo|first=P |author2=Kolterman, Waldeck |author3=Reaven, Olefsky|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=1980|volume=33|pages=1723–1728|pmid=6996472|title=Postprandial hormonal responses to different types of complex carbohydrate in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance|issue=8|doi=10.1093/ajcn/33.8.1723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=David|author2=Jenkins, Alexandra L. |author3=Wolever, Thomas M.S. |author4= Thompson, Lilian H.  and Rao, A.

=====Fiber=====
{{Main|Dietary fiber}}
Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|figs]]), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]] by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in [[whole wheat flour]], nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates [[peristalsis]];– the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of [[type 2 diabetes]]. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.

====Fat====
{{Main|Fat}}
A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[Double bond|double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fat]]s are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].  There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as [[conjugated linoleic acid]], catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and [[punicic acid]], in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.

Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia. Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klonoff|first=David C.|date=2016-06-24|year=|title=Replacements for Trans Fats—Will There Be an Oil Shortage?|pmc=2769584|journal=Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=415–422|doi=10.1177/193229680700100316|pmid=19885099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Essential fatty acids ====
{{Main|Essential fatty acids}}
Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acid|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—[[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoid]]s known as [[prostaglandin]]s, which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.

The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme [[desaturase|delta-5-desaturase]], which in turn is controlled by hormones such as [[insulin]] (up-regulation) and [[glucagon]] (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and [[inflammation]], and [[mitosis]] (i.e., cell division).

====Protein====
[[File:Myoglobin.png|thumb|right|Proteins are chains of amino acids found in most nutritional foods.]]

{{Main|Protein (nutrient)}}

Proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of [[amino acid]]s, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the [[keratin]] in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are ''[[essential amino acid|essential]]'' (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are ''[[non-essential amino acid|non-essential]]'' (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A ''complete'' protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an ''incomplete'' protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.

It is possible with [[protein combination]]s of two incomplete protein sources (e.g., rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Dietetic Association|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets|journal= JADA|year= 2003|volume= 103|issue=6|pages= 748–765|pmid=12778049|doi=10.1053/jada.2003.50142|last2=Dietitians Of|first2=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]].

====Water====
{{Main|Drinking water}}
[[Image:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|left|A manual [[water]] [[pump]] in [[China]]]]
Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including [[urine]] and [[feces]], [[sweating]], and by [[water vapour]] in the exhaled breath. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids.

Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6–8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper [[Tissue hydration|hydration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml |title=Healthy Water Living|publisher=BBC.

Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences. Recommended Dietary Allowances, revised 1945. National Research Council, Reprint and Circular Series, No. 122, 1945 (Aug), pp. 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health.&lt;ref name="Le Bellego"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Le Bellego L, Jean C, Jiménez L, Magnani C, Tang W, Boutrolle I |title= Understanding fluid consumption patterns to improve healthy hydration|journal= Nutr Today|year= 2010|volume=45|issue=6|pages=S22–S26|doi=10.1097/NT.0b013e3181fe4314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI).&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water"&gt;{{cite journal|author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA)|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1459|title=Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for Water|journal=EFSA Journal |year=2010|volume=8|issue=3|page=1459|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/6350877/5.Scientific.pdf}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with “desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.”&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt;

For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Armstrong LE, Pumerantz AC, Roti MW, Judelson DA, Watson G, Dias JC, Sokmen B, Casa DJ, Maresh CM | year = 2005 | title = Fluid, electrolyte, and renal indices of hydration during 11 days of controlled caffeine consumption | journal = Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 252–65 |pmid=16131696 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x9892e/x9892e00.htm "FAO Corporate Document Repository. Food Balance Sheets- A Handbook."] Retrieved 2011-03-07&lt;/ref&gt; These values are estimated using country-specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;

The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt; [[Pregnant]] and [[breastfeeding]] women require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300 mL/day.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt; To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration - too little and too much water, respectively - can have harmful consequences. Drinking too much water is one of the possible causes of [[hyponatremia]], i.e., low serum sodium.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1770067|title=Fatal water intoxication |journal= Journal of Clinical Pathology | date=October 2003|pmid=14514793|volume=56|issue=10|vauthors=Farrell DJ, Bower L |pages=803–4|doi=10.1136/jcp.56.10.803-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcohol (ethanol)====
Pure ethanol provides 7 calories per gram. For [[distilled spirit]]s, a standard serving in the United States is 1.5 fluid ounces, which at 40% ethanol (80 proof), would be 14 grams and 98 calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-9/#footnote2|title=Appendix 9. Alcohol|last=|first=|date=|website=health.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine and beer contain a similar range of ethanol for servings of 5 ounces and 12 ounces, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5 ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12 ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deanofstudents.cua.edu/alcohol/alcohol-facts/nutrition.cfm|title=Alcohol and Nutrition: The Calorie and Carb Breakdown!|last=|first=|date=|website=The Catholic University of America|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [[NHANES]] 2013-2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8 grams/day and men consume on average 15.5 grams/day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day. Alcoholic beverages are considered [[empty calorie]] foods because other than calories, these contribute no essential nutrients.

===Micronutrients===
The micronutrients are [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[vitamin]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuhrman, Joel|title=The End of Dieting|publisher=Harper One (Harper Collins)|year=2014|isbn=978-0-06-224932-6|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minerals====
{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)|Composition of the human body}}

Dietary minerals are [[inorganic compounds|inorganic]] [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms,&lt;ref name="Mitchell, Dakota and Haroun, Lee 2012 279"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mitchell, Dakota  |author2=Haroun, Lee|title=Introduction to Health Care|year=2012|edition=3|publisher=Delmar Cengage|isbn=978-1-435-48755-0|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned, including several [[metal]]s, which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].

=====Macrominerals=====
Many elements are essential nutrients called [[dietary minerals]]. Some have roles as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]], while others are [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nelson, D. L. |author2=Cox, M. M. | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition=3rd | publisher=Worth Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 |  isbn=978-1-57259-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements with recommended dietary allowance ([[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]]) greater than 150 &amp;nbsp;mg/day are, in alphabetical order:
* [[Calcium]], a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally (for muscle and digestive system health, bone strength, some forms neutralize acidity, provides signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions)
* [[Chloride]]; electrolyte; see sodium, below
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, facilitates [[peristalsis]])
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Corbridge, D. E. C. | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-444-89307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Potassium]], an electrolyte (heart and nerve functions)
* [[Sodium]], an electrolyte; common in food and manufactured beverages, typically as [[sodium chloride]]. Excessive sodium consumption can deplete [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y2809E/y2809e0k.htm|title=Chapter 14.

=====Trace minerals=====

Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994|isbn=978-0935702729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:
* [[Cobalt]] required for biosynthesis of [[vitamin B12]] family of [[coenzyme]]s.  Animals cannot biosynthesize B12, and must obtain this cobalt-containing vitamin in their diet.
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]] {{main|Copper in health}}
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxine]] but also&amp;nbsp;— it is presumed&amp;nbsp;— for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus, etc. (see Extrathyroidal [[iodine]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes, and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], and [[carbonic anhydrase]]

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}

Vitamins are essential nutrients,&lt;ref name="Mitchell, Dakota and Haroun, Lee 2012 279"/&gt; necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is an exception, as it can be synthesized in the skin in the presence of [[UVB radiation]], and many animal species can synthesize vitamin C.) Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions, including [[goitre]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired immune system, disorders of cell metabolism, certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature aging, and poor [[psychology|psychological health]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Shils, M. S.| year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=978-0-7817-4133-0|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess levels of some vitamins are also dangerous to health. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has established Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for seven vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs): Tolerable Upper Intake Levels, Vitamins | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t7/?report=objectonly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phytochemicals==
{{Main|Phytochemical}}
{{See also|List of antioxidants in food}}

Phytochemicals such as [[polyphenol]]s are compounds produced naturally in plants (phyto means "plant" in Greek). In general, the term identifies compounds that are prevalent in plant foods, but are not proven to be essential for human nutrition, as of 2018. There is no conclusive evidence in humans that polyphenols or other non-nutrient compounds from plants confer health benefits, mainly because these compounds have poor [[bioavailability]], i,e., following ingestion, they are digested into smaller [[metabolite]]s with unknown functions, then are rapidly eliminated from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2871118|year=2010|last1=d'Archivio|first1=M.|title=Bioavailability of the polyphenols: status and controversies|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1321–1342|last2=Filesi|first2=C.|last3=Varì|first3=R.|last4=Scazzocchio|first4=B.|last5=Masella|first5=R.|pmid=20480022|doi=10.3390/ijms11041321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/common-questions.html?_ga=2.57358826.1597423548.1542983382-1390869997.1542983382|title=Common questions about diet and cancer|date=5 February 2016|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While initial studies sought to reveal if [[dietary supplement]]s might promote health, one [[meta-analysis]] concluded that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins A and E and beta-carotene did not convey any benefits, and may increase risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin C and selenium supplements did not impact mortality rate.

==Intestinal bacterial flora==
{{Main|Gut flora}}
Animal intestines contain a large population of [[gut flora]]. In humans, the four dominant [[phylum|phyla]] are [[Firmicutes]], [[Bacteroidetes]], [[Actinobacteria]], and [[Proteobacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid24388028"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khanna S, Tosh PK |title=A clinician's primer on the role of the microbiome in human health and disease |journal=Mayo Clin.

Bacteria in the large intestine perform many important functions for humans, including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of fermentable fiber, stimulating cell growth, repressing the growth of harmful bacteria, training the immune system to respond only to pathogens, producing [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], and defending against some infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12489-0 |title=Gut flora in health and disease |year=2003 |last1=Guarner |first1=F |last2=Malagelada |first2=J |journal=The Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9356 |pages=512–9 |pmid=12583961}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Probiotic]]s" refers to the idea of deliberately consuming live bacteria in an attempt to change the bacterial population in the large intestine, to the health benefit of the host human or animal. "[[Prebiotic (nutrition)]]" refers to the idea that consuming a bacterial energy source such as soluble fiber could support the population of health-beneficial bacteria in the large intestine. There is not yet a scientific consensus as to health benefits accruing from probiotics or prebiotics.

==Animal nutrition==
{{main|Animal nutrition|Human nutrition}}

[[Carnivore]] and [[herbivore]] diets are contrasting, with basic [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Geographic Society|title=herbivore|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/herbivore/|website=National Geographic Society|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant nutrition==

{{Main|Plant nutrition}}
Plant nutrition is the study of the [[chemical element]]s that are necessary for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Plant Nutrition|author1=Allen V. Barker |author2=David J. Pilbeam | page=Preface| publisher=CRC Press, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.

A nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and [[hydrogen]], which is obtained from water.

Plants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace [[cation]]s attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel [[oxygen]]. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

Although [[nitrogen]] is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a [[nitrogen fixation]] process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, W.C. and Glover C.R. (2003) [http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/welcome.html Nitrogen Fixation by Legumes]. New Mexico State University/&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given [[cloning|clone]]. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa.

==Advice and guidance==

===Government policies===
[[Canada's Food Guide]] is an example of a government-run nutrition program. Produced by [[Health Canada]], the guide advises food quantities, provides education on balanced nutrition, and promotes physical activity in accordance with government-mandated nutrient needs. Like other nutrition programs around the world, Canada's Food Guide divides nutrition into four main food groups: vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170612160554/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php Canada's Food Guide]. Health Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its American counterpart, the Canadian guide references and provides alternative to meat and dairy, which can be attributed to the growing [[vegan]] and [[vegetarian]] movements.

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]] and these recommendations are published as the [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of [[MyPlate]], which superseded the [[MyPyramid|food pyramid]], which replaced the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]]. The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu that fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080308032337/http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf Sample Menus for a 2000 Calorie Food Pattern]. mypyramid.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government programs===
Governmental organisations have been working on nutrition literacy interventions in non-primary health care settings to address the nutrition information problem in the U.S. Some programs include:

The Family Nutrition Program (FNP) is a free nutrition education program serving low-income adults around the U.S. This program is funded by the Food Nutrition Service’s (FNS) branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) usually through a local state academic institution that runs the program.  The FNP has developed a series of tools to help families participating in the Food Stamp Program stretch their food dollar and form healthful eating habits including nutrition education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guthrie|first=Joanne F.|last2=Stommes|first2=Eileen|last3=Voichick|first3=Jane|date=January–February 2006|title=Evaluating Food Stamp Nutrition Education: Issues and Opportunities|url=https://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046(05)00003-5/fulltext|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–11|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2005.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://web.archive.org/web/20111118025724/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/food/efnep/efnep.html Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program] (ENFEP) is a unique program that currently operates in all 50 states and in American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It is designed to assist limited-resource audiences in acquiring the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and changed behavior necessary for nutritionally sound diets, and to contribute to their personal development and the improvement of the total family diet and nutritional well-being.

An example of a state initiative to promote nutrition literacy is [https://web.archive.org/web/20120221061109/http://www.smartbodies.org/smart-bodies Smart Bodies], a public-private partnership between the state’s largest university system and largest health insurer, Louisiana State Agricultural Center and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation.  Launched in 2005, this program promotes lifelong healthful eating patterns and physically active lifestyles for children and their families.  It is an interactive educational program designed to help prevent childhood obesity through classroom activities that teach children healthful eating habits and physical exercise.

===Education===
Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools, a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and, if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthful food choices, portion sizes, and how to live a healthy life.

A 1985, US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report entitled ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'' concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Life Sciences. (1985). ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'', [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=597&amp;page=4 p. 4]. National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams KM, Lindell KC, Kohlmeier M, Zeisel SH |title=Status of nutrition education in medical schools |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=941S–4S |year=2006 |pmid=16600952 |pmc=2430660 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/83.4.941S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership by physicians in leading professional nutrition societies such as the [[American Society for Nutrition]] has generally declined from the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClave|first=Stephen A.|last2=Mechanick|first2=Jeffrey I.|last3=Bistrian|first3=Bruce|last4=Graham|first4=Toby|last5=Hegazi|first5=Refaat|last6=Jensen|first6=Gordon L.|last7=Kushner|first7=Robert F.|last8=Merritt|first8=Russell|date=2016-12-01|title=What is the significance of a physician shortage in nutrition medicine?|journal=JPEN.

===Professional organizations===
In the US, [[Dietitian|Registered dietitian nutritionists]] (RDs or RDNs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an RDN and DTR?|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/resources/about-us/what-is-an-rdn-and-dtr|publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[health professionals]] qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health, and a personalized nutritional treatment plan. They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Certified Clinical [[Nutritionist]]s or CCNs, are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaacn.org/ The International &amp; American Associations of Clinical Nutritionist, 2014, Retrieved 2014-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulation especially in terms of licensing, is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN. Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in [[obesity]] and [[chronic disease]]. In order to become board certified, potential CNS candidate must pass an examination, much like Registered Dieticians. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including; Clinical Intervention and Human Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAQs about CNS Certification – Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists|url = http://cbns.org/faqs-cns-certification/|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition literacy==
The findings of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U.S. NAAL introduced the first ever measure of "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions"&amp;nbsp;– an objective of Healthy People 2010&lt;ref&gt;Baldi, S. (ED.) et al. (2009). [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009476 Technical Report and Data File User’s Manual for the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NCES 2009–47)]. U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset. On a scale of below basic, basic, intermediate and proficient, NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health literacy, 44% have intermediate literacy, 29 percent have basic literacy and 14 percent have below basic health literacy. The study found that health literacy increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower health literacy than those above it.

Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zoellner, J., Connell, C., Bounds, W., Crook, L., Yadrick, K. |year=2009|title= Nutrition Literacy Status and Preferred Nutrition Communications Channels Among Adults in the Lower Mississippi Delta|journal= Preventing Chronic Disease|volume= 6|issue=4|pages=A128|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2009/oct/08_0016.htm|pmid=19755004|pmc=2774642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult, primarily because of methodological differences, Zoellner et al. suggest that health literacy rates in the Mississippi Delta region are different from the U.S. general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the Delta region. For example, only 12 percent of study participants identified the My Pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the USDA. The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; further delineating priorities for the region.

These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.

The links between low health literacy and poor health outcomes has been widely documented&lt;ref&gt;Berkman N. D., Sheridan, S.L., Donahue, K. E., Halpern, D.J., Viera, A., Crotty, K., … Viswanathan, M. (2011). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK82434/ Health and Literacy Intervention Outcomes: an Updated Systematic Review. Evidence Report/Technology Assessment no. 199]. Prepared by RTI International – University of North Carolina Evidence-based Practice Center. Publication Number 11-E006. Rockville, MD. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence that some interventions to improve health literacy have produced successful results in the primary care setting. More must be done to further our understanding of nutrition literacy specific interventions in non-primary care settings&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; in order to achieve better health outcomes.

==Malnutrition==
{{Main|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients by an organism. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption. In developing countries, malnutrition is more likely to be caused by poor access to a range of nutritious foods or inadequate knowledge. In [[Mali]], the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) and the [[Aga Khan Foundation]] trained women's groups to make ''equinut'', a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe ''di-dèguè'' (comprising peanut paste, honey and millet or rice flour). The aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell, and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2013/04/Nourishing-Communities-Through-Holistic-Farming ''Nourishing communities through holistic farming''], Impatient optimists, [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]. April 30th 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insufficient===
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals. EARs and RDAs are part of [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref name="ods.od.nih.gov"&gt;[https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx]
Nutrient recommendations: Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).&lt;/ref&gt; The DRI documents describe nutrient deficiency signs and symptoms.

===Excessive===
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. ULs are set a safe fraction below amounts shown to cause health problems. ULs are part of [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref name="ods.od.nih.gov"/&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] also reviews the same safety questions and set its own ULs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unbalanced===
When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion of the proper amount of other nutrients, the diet is said to be unbalanced. High calorie food ingredients such as vegetable oils, sugar and alcohol are referred to as [[Empty calorie|"empty calories"]] because they displace from the diet foods that also contain protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are empty calories? |website=USDA MyPlate 2011 |url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/weight-management-calories/calories/empty-calories.html |accessdate=2017-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130125320/http://www.choosemyplate.gov/weight-management-calories/calories/empty-calories.html |archivedate=2014-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processed foods==

{{Main|Food processing}}

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]] some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many [[technology|technologies]] that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include [[pasteurisation]], [[autoclavation]], [[drying]], [[salting (food)|salting]], and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.

Modern separation techniques such as [[Gristmill|milling]], [[centrifugation]], and [[Expeller pressing|pressing]] have enabled concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils, juices, and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Audrey |author2=Audia Barnett |author3=Olive-Jean Burrows|title=Effect of Processing on Nutrient Content of Foods|journal=Cajanus|volume=37|issue=3|pages=160–164|year=2004|url=http://www.paho.org/English/CFNI/cfni-caj37No304-art-3.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-26|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, [[potassium]]/[[sodium]], vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In addition,
processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.

A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population's health is the history of epidemics of [[beri-beri]] in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin [[thiamine]], causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of [[scurvy]] among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]]) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.

As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14171">'''Nutritional rating systems''' are methods of ranking or rating food products or food categories to communicate the nutritional value of food in a simplified manner to a target audience. Rating systems are developed by governments, nonprofit organizations, or private institutions and companies.

The methods may use point systems to rank or rate foods for general nutritional value or they may rate specific food attributes such as [[cholesterol]] content. Graphics or other symbols may be used to communicate the ratings to the target audience.

Nutritional rating systems differ from [[Nutrition facts label|nutritional labeling]] in that they attempt to simplify food choices, rather than listing specific amounts of nutrients or ingredients. [[Dietary guidelines]] are similar to nutritional rating systems in that they attempt to simplify the communication of nutritional information, however, they do not rate individual food products.

== Systems in use today ==

===Glycemic index===
[[Glycemic index]] is a ranking of how quickly [[food]] is metabolized into [[glucose]] when digested. It compares available [[carbohydrate]]s gram for gram in individual foods, providing a numerical, evidence-based index of postprandial (post-meal) [[Blood sugar|glycemia]]. The concept was invented by Dr. [[David J. Jenkins]] and colleagues in 1981 at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Brouns ''et al.'' (2005). "Glycaemic index methodology." ''Nutrition Research Reviews'' '''18'''; 145-171&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycemic load]] (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's [[blood glucose level]] after eating it.

===Guiding Stars===
Guiding Stars is patented food rating system that rates food based on [[nutrient density]] using a scientific [[algorithm]]. Foods are credited for [[vitamins]], minerals, [[dietary fibre]], whole grains, and [[Omega-3 fatty acids]], and debited for [[saturated fats]], [[trans fats]], added sodium ([[salt]]) and [[added sugar]]. Rated foods are marked with tags indicating one, two or three stars. The  program first launched a Hannaford Supermarkets in 2006, and is currently found in about 1,900 supermarkets in the US and Canada. Guiding Stars has also expanded into public schools, colleges and hospitals.&lt;ref name="guidingstars"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://guidingstars.ca/about/ | title=About | publisher=Guiding Stars Licensing Company | accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence-based proprietary algorithm is based on the dietary guidelines and recommendations of regulatory and health organizations including the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[US Department of Agriculture]], and the [[World Health Organization]]. It was developed by a scientific advisory panel composed of experts in nutrition and health from [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of North Carolina]] and other colleges.&lt;ref name="guidingstars" /&gt;

===Nutripoints===
Nutripoints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutripoints.com/ |title=nutripoints.com |publisher=nutripoints.com |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a system for rating foods on a numerical scale for their overall nutritional value. The method is based on an analysis of 26 positive (such as vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber) and negative factors (such as cholesterol, saturated fat, sugar, sodium) compared to the calories in the food. The overall Nutripoint score of the food is the result. The higher the value, the more nutrition per calorie (nutrient density) and the least negative factors in the food. Thus, the higher the Nutripoint score, the better the food for overall health. The system rates 3600+ foods including basic foods like apples and oranges, fast-foods, and brand-name foods.

Nutripoints was developed by Dr. Roy E. Vartabedian (a Doctor of Public Health) in the 1980s and was released to the general public in 1990 with his book, "Nutripoints," published in 13 countries and 10 languages worldwide. The food rating system is part of an overall program designed to help people measure, balance, and upgrade their diet's nutritional quality for overall health improvement and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutripoints: Healthy Eating Made Simple! (1990&amp;ndash;2010) |url= http://www.nutripoints.com/  |publisher= Nutripoints.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition iQ===
The Nutrition iQ program is a joint venture of the Joslin Clinic and multi-banner supermarket operator [[SuperValu (United States)|Supervalu]].  The labeling system consists of color-coded tags denoting a food product's superior status with respect to attributes such as vitamin and mineral content, fiber content, 100% juice content, Omega-3 or low saturated fat content, whole grain content, calcium content, protein content, low or reduced sodium content and low or reduced caloric content.  The first phase of the program launched in 2009 covering center store food products, with coverage of fresh food departments rolling out in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110113005149/en/Fresh-Ideas-Healthy-Eating-SUPERVALU%C2%AE-Expands-%E2%80%9Cnutrition |title=Fresh Ideas for Healthy Eating: SUPERVALU Expands "nutrition iQ" Program, SUPERVALU, January 13, 2011 |publisher=Businesswire.com |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===POINTS Food System===
[[Weight Watchers]] developed the POINTS Food System for use with their Flex Plan. Healthy weight control is the primary objective of the system. The system is designed to allow customers to eat any food while tracking the number of points for each food consumed. Members try to keep to their POINTS Target, a number of points for a given time frame. The daily POINTS Target is personalized based on members' height, weight and other factors, such as gender. A weekly allowance for points is also established to provide for special occasions, mistakes, etc.&lt;ref name=WeightWatchers&gt;{{cite journal |author=WeightWatchers website. |title=The Flex plan and the Core Plan: Food plans tailored to fit your life. |journal=weightwatchers.com |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturally Nutrient Rich (NNR) ===
Developed by [[Adam Drewnowski]], University of Washington, NNR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drewnowski|first=Adam|title=Concept of a nutritious food: toward a nutrient density score|url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/82/4/721.abstract|publisher=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|accessdate=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "is based on mean percentage daily values (DVs) for 14 nutrients in 2000 kcal food, can be used to assign nutrient density values to foods within and across food groups. Use of the NNR score allows consumers to identify and select nutrient-dense foods while permitting some flexibility where the discretionary calories are concerned."

===ReViVer Score===
Developed by ReViVer, a nutritionally-oriented restaurant in New York City,&lt;ref name="Walt Street Journal"&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/articles/reviver-serves-healthy-food-backed-by-science-1407203647/ "ReViVer Serves Healthy Food Backed By Science"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', August 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  the ReViVer Score expresses the nutrient density of menu items from a variety of fast food and casual restaurants, based on the amount of 10 nutrients (Vitamins A, C, and E, folate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, fiber, and omega-3 fats) per calorie. A score of 100 indicates that the meal provides at least 100% of the recommended daily intake for all ten nutrients, proportionate to the energy (calorie) content of the meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ReViVer Score|url=http://revivernyc.com#TheReviverScore |accessdate=Aug 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various restaurant offerings with similar calorie content.

===Nutrient Per Calorie===
Developed by Efficiency Is Everything, a Data Science website.&lt;ref name="Efficiency Is Everything"&gt;[http://efficiencyiseverything.com/nutrient-per-calorie/ "Nutrients Per Calorie – Math Proves The Healthiest Lowest Calorie Foods"] ''[[Efficiency Is Everything]]'', October 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This expresses the amount of micronutrients in produce per the caloric value based on 40+ vitamins and minerals. Based off a sum of each nutrient vs that nutrients maximum value per calorie, Spinach, Parsely, Romaine Lettuce, and turnip greens top the list. This allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various produce.

==Systems used in the past==

===Smart Choices Program===
Launched late in 2009, the Smart Choices Program (SCP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Choices Program|url=http://www.smartchoicesprogram.com/|accessdate=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a rating system developed by a coalition of companies from the food industry. The criteria for rating food products used 18 different attributes, however, the system had varying levels of acceptability based on 16 types of food which allowed for wide discretion in the selection of foods to include in the program. The program was discontinued in October 2009 after sharp criticism for including products such as "Froot Loops", "Lucky Charms" and "Frosted Flakes" as Smart Choices.&lt;ref name"smart choice"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = MacVean| first = Mary| title = 'Smart Choice' food label: a sign of nutrition or marketing?| work = Los Angeles Times| date = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Neuman| first = William| title = ‘Smart Choices’ Food Labeling Loses Support| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-24| date = 2009-10-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/24food.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the backlash from the program, [[General Mills]] announced on December 10, 2009 that it would reduce the amount of sugar in many of its cereal brands.

====Announcement of Closure====
On August 19, 2009, the FDA wrote a letter to SCP manager, saying: "FDA and FSIS would be concerned if any FOP labeling systems used criteria that were not stringent enough to protect consumers against misleading claims; were inconsistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; or had the effect of encouraging consumers to choose highly processed foods and refined grains instead of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Michael R.|author2=Jerold R. Mande |title=Label Claims - Letter to the Smart Choces Program|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/LabelClaims/ucm180146.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCP was suspended in 2009 after the FDA's announcement that they will be addressing both on front-of- package and on-shelf systems. SCP Chair Mike Hughes said: "It is more appropriate to postpone active operations and channel our information and learnings to the agency to support their initiative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Mike|title=Smart Choices Program Postpones Active Operations|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smart-choices-program-postpones-active-operations-65809752.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=Jan 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Claimed Rigor====
Smart Choices Program "was developed by a coalition of scientists and nutrition educators, experts with experience with dietary guidelines, public health organizations, and food manufacturers in response to consumer confusion over multiple front-of-the-package systems based on different criteria. Representatives from different government organizations acted as observers. The process of developing the program was facilitated by the nonprofit Keystone Center, an organization that develops consensus solutions to complex health and social policy changes. The nutrition criteria for receiving the SCP icon are specific for product category by indicating "smarter" products within that category. A calorie indicator noting calories per serving and servings per package accompanies the SCP icon to remind consumers that calories do count, even for smarter food choices. For a product to qualify, it first has to be below the threshold for "nutrients to limit" and then (in most cases) it must be above the threshold for one or more nutrients or food groups to encourage. The criteria are based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and other consensus science and are transparent and available on the SCP website."

The '''Portman Group''' is a [[trade group]] composed of [[alcoholic beverage]] producers and [[brewing industry|brewers]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

==History==
It was set up in 1989 as part of a campaign to raise awareness of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]-related issues, and its members account for the majority of alcohol products sold in the UK. It takes its name from the Portman Square, [[London]], head office of [[Guinness]], one of its co-founders.

===Drinkaware Trust===
The Portman Group established the Drinkaware website in 2004 and went on to establish the '''Drinkaware Trust''' in 2006. The Drinkaware Trust is now an independent trust which runs all alcohol education campaigns, that had been previously the responsibility of the Portman Group.

==Aims==
There are four stated main aims of group:
* Promote responsible drinking (and thus lessen [[binge drinking]])
* Help prevent [[alcoholism|misuse of alcohol]]
* Encourage [[alcohol advertising|alcohol marketing and advertising]]
* Put forward the industry angle on the understanding of alcohol-related issues.

==''Code of Practice on the Responsible Naming, Packaging and Promotion of Alcoholic Drinks''==
The Portman Group operates a ''Code of Practice on the Naming, Packaging and Promotion of Alcoholic Drinks'' which was first introduced in 1996.  The code, which is supported throughout the industry, seeks to ensure that drinks are marketed in a socially responsible way and to an adult audience only.
 
The code applies to all pre-packaged alcoholic drinks and covers the drink's naming, packaging, point-of-sale advertising, brand websites, sponsorship, branded merchandise, advertorials, press releases and sampling.  
 
The code has an open and accessible complaints system.  Complaints under the Code are ruled on by an independent complaints panel.

==Campaigns==
There have been several full campaigns run by the group.  These include:
* "I'll be Des" ([[designated driver]]s)
* "If you do do drink, don't do drunk" and Drinkaware.co.uk (excessive drinking, particularly in the under 24s)
* Proof of Age Card (aka Prove It) (a [[Proof of Age Standards Scheme|PASS]]-accredited [[identity document|identity card]], discontinued in 2007)

These campaigns have been strongly criticised by, amongst others, Professor [[Ian Gilmore]] of [[Royal College of Physicians]] and Professor [[Martin Plant]] of the [[University of the West of England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsc.uwe.ac.uk/net/research/Default.aspx?pageid=140|title=Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences - UWE Bristol: Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences|website=hsc.uwe.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; both noted alcohol harm experts, as not only ineffective but even favourable to the alcohol industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=3934|title=Parliamentlive.tv|website=parliamentlive.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public Health England]] was attacked by [[Martin McKee]] and others for giving unwarranted credibility to the drinks industry by involving Drinkaware in their Drink Free Days campaign in 2018.  Professor [[Ian Gilmore]] resigned from his position with the agency when they refused to break the connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PHE urged to rethink campaign linked to alcohol industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/13/public-health-england-urged-to-end-tie-up-with-alcohol-industry |accessdate=20 October 2018 |publisher=Guardian |date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raksi''' ([[Limbu language|Limbu]]:Sijongwaa aara)&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic Fermented Foods and Alcoholic Beverages of Asia, Front Cover By Jyoti Prakash Tamang, Springer, 5 Aug 2016 - Technology &amp; Engineering - 409 pages, P.107&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ne|रक्सी}}) or '''Rakshi''' is a traditional distilled [[alcoholic beverage]] in [[Nepal]], [[India]] ([[Darjeeling]], [[Sikkim]])  and [[Tibet]].  It is often made at home. 

It is also the traditional beverage of newari people and of course mongol people.&lt;ref&gt;P.67 Land and Social Change in East Nepal: A Study of Hindu-Tribal Relations
By Professor Lionel Caplan, Lionel Caplan&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Limbu people|Limbus]] especially, drink an enormous amount of [[Tongba]] and raksi served with pieces of Pork, Water buffalo or Goat meat [[Sekuwa]].&lt;ref&gt;p.34 Kinship and Marriage Among the Limbu of Eastern Nepal: A Study By Rex Lee Jones - 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
Raksi is usually made from kodo [[millet]] (kodo) or rice; different grains produce different flavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/nepal/nepalliq.html|title=Nepal: Liquor|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a strong drink, clear like vodka or gin, tasting somewhat like Japanese [[sake]].

In the CNN's list of World's 50 most delicious drinks, it was ranked 41st and was described as "Made from millet or rice, Raksi is strong on the nose and sends a burning sensation straight down your throat that resolves itself into a surprisingly smooth, velvety sensation. Nepalese drink this home brew to celebrate festivals, though some think that the prized drink itself is the reason to celebrate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/drink/worlds-50-most-delicious-drinks-883542|title=World's 50 most delicious drinks|date=12 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its popularity, various [[temperance movements]] exist in Nepal, including various women's groups.  Raksi, however, remains an important requirement of various religious rituals and social events, due in part perhaps to its antiseptic properties.

==Serving==
Raksi is often served in a [[bhatti glass]] and during special occasions, the drink is poured from a great height via a pitcher with a small spout, making an entertaining spectacle.

==Production==
Raksi is produced, sold and mostly consumed at rustic distilleries scattered around the countryside.  Usually it is not aged before consumption.  A large amount of wood is used in the distillation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureinterface.com/e/ni03/P070-073/|title=Terraced Fields and Natural Disasters in Nepal -- An Fuyusawa|website=www.natureinterface.com|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sexual orientation}}

'''Sexual maturation disorder''' is a disorder of [[anxiety]] or [[Depression (mood)|depression]] related to an uncertainty about one's [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]]. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) lists sexual maturation disorder in the [[ICD-10]], under "Psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation".&lt;ref name=ICD&gt;{{ICD10|F|66|0|f|60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual orientation]], by itself, is not a disorder and is not classified under this heading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf60.htm+f661 ICD-10]: See part F66.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] where the sexual orientation or gender identity is repressed or denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aerzteblatt.lnsdata.de/pdf/DI/105/48/m834.pdf Gender Identity Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence]  {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20091008003518/http://aerzteblatt.lnsdata.de/pdf/DI/105/48/m834.pdf |date=2009-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2697020 | pmid=19578420 | doi=10.3238/arztebl.2008.0834 | volume=105 | title=Gender identity disorders in childhood and adolescence: currently debated concepts and treatment strategies | year=2008 | journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int | pages=834–41 |vauthors=Korte A, Lehmkuhl U, Goecker D, Beier KM, Krude H, Grüters-Kieslich A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (APA) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. 4th edn.

==Puberty and reaching sexual maturation in adolescence==

Puberty usually occurs from the ages of 10 to 16 years of age and varies between boys and girls with girls normally starting earlier than boys (Shiel, Stoppler 2012). During the time of puberty is when sexual maturation starts to occur. Numerous physical changes happen during the period of puberty. Girls start to develop breasts, have growth of pubic hair and eventually begin having menstrual cycles. Boys have an enlargement of testicles and penis, growth of pubic hair, deepened voices and muscular development. Along with physical changes during puberty there are many mental changes happening. During the adolescence stage of life, boys and girls start developing thoughts related to sexual identity and start to explore and experiment with sexual behaviors. This stage of life is when sexual maturation starts to develop and one’s gender identity and sexual orientation is being developed. This is a timeframe that can possibly become confusing for the youth going through this stage of adolescence. Feelings of frustration, anxiety or depression may occur. This could be the first signs of disorder during sexual maturation.
Sexual maturity is a natural progression during the pubertal stages of adolescence. It is the timeframe where youth explore and experience sexual thoughts, situations and behaviors which ultimately lead to the identification of their gender and sexual orientation. During this timeframe abnormal feelings and thoughts can affect the progression of maturity. These abnormal occurrences would be identified as sexual maturation disorder.

==Gender identity disorder and sexual orientation==

Gender identity on the surface would appear easily explained. Most of society is born with either male or female genitalia which make it easy to identify a person as male or female physically. Where confusion comes into play is when a person has the genitalia of either a male or female, but emotionally and mentally feel that they are of the opposite gender. “A child whose biological sex is that of a typical female can have a gender identity and role of a boy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/scholarship/2011/06/16/childhood-gender-identity-disorder-developmental-cultural-and-diagnostic-concerns/ | title=Childhood gender identity … disorder? Developmental, cultural, and diagnostic concerns |author1=Dragowski, Eliza A. |author2=Scharron-del Rio, Maria R. |author3=Sandigorsky, Amy L. | journal=Journal of Counseling and Development |date=June 2011 | volume=89 | issue=3 | pages=360–367 | doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2011.tb00100.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can create stressful situations for those who are experiencing these feelings. Society refers to someone who experiences this internal contradiction as a transgender.
“Gender identity disorders can manifest themselves in varying degrees of severity from early childhood onward” (Korte, 2008). Children and adolescents who develop this often show behavioral characteristics attributed to the opposite sex, and in some cases claim to belong to that gender. Each person with gender identity disorder is different, and it has various levels of severity. Some can exhibit little gender identity confusion, while others’ behaviors can be more obvious and apparent. They may prefer to associate with peers of the opposite sex, can cross-dress, and may prefer games and activities that are typically accredited to the opposite sex.
“Transgender is the umbrella term for the feeling that one’s interior, mind/body experience of gender does not readily conform to the cultural assumptions assigned to their biological sex.” (McKenzie 2010) During the period of sexual maturation, a person who experiences questionable feelings dealing with their gender identity may find it hard to mature at the same rate of another who adheres to the acceptable “societal view” of gender identity. These questionable feelings could be viewed as abnormal and/or signs of disorder related to sexual maturation. A person dealing with gender identity confusion may or may not have confused emotions about sexual orientation.
Sexual orientation is normally developed after a person has an understanding of their gendered self. (McKenzie 2010) It is described as “an erotic inclination toward people of one or more genders, most often described as sexual or erotic attractions” (Ream, Savin-Williams). A person can experience abnormal feelings with both sexual orientation and gender identity or only one of the two. Sexual maturity can be stunted if gender identity is not fully recognized prior to developing one’s sexual orientation. It is possible for someone to have abnormal gender identity, but have normal sexual orientation based on society’s view of what is normal. This means that a biological male who is experiencing gender identity issues (feels like a female internally) can still be attracted to a female, which would be considered normal sexual orientation for a male. If that same male was attracted to a male, he would be considered abnormal with both his gender identity and sexual orientation. This can be applied to either gender or their sexual orientation. Sexual maturity can be affected by both gender identity and sexual orientation and can ultimately lead to disorder causing heightened anxiety or depression.

==Gender identity issues with late adolescents and in adulthood==

As the disorder progresses in life, it can increase in severity, and cause other behaviors or actions in late adolescence and adulthood. “A strong and persistent cross-gender identification in adolescents and adults [can cause a] disturbance manifested by symptoms such as a stated desire to be the other sex, frequent passing as the other sex, desire to live or be treated as the other sex, or the conviction that he or she has the typical feelings and reactions of the other sex” (APA, 2000). This can cause severe conflict for the individual living in a society which endorses and enforces adherence to strict gender roles. In a more persistent disassociation with one’s own body or gender, someone can go to more extreme lengths to feel as though they are fulfilled or satisfied with themselves. This can lead these individuals to engage in behavior that displaces their emotions. These individuals may also seek to undergo sex reassignment surgery. “Persistent discomfort with his or her sex or sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex in adolescents and adults [can cause a] disturbance manifested by symptoms such as preoccupation with getting rid of primary and secondary sex characteristics (e.g., request for hormones, surgery, or other procedures to physically alter sexual characteristics to simulate the other sex) or belief that he or she was born the wrong sex” (APA, 2000).

==History==
In 1923, the [[Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word]] answered the call from Rev. J.M. Hegarty, pastor at St. Anthony’s, to care for the sick and poor in Long Beach, by purchasing what is now St. Mary Medical Center from Dr. T.O. Boyd.  

The building was damaged so significantly in the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] that the entire building had to be razed and a new, 100-bed facility built on the site. The new hospital opened in 1937 and was financed by a [[Public Works Administration]] loan. It was designed by architect I.E. Loveless in the [[Art Deco]] style.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Suzanne Tarbell|last2=Thomas|first2=John W.|last3=Launi|first3=J. Christopher|title=Long Beach Art Deco|date=2006|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=978-0-7385-4670-4|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years the hospital has been a pioneering institution in many areas including cardiology, radiology, cancer care, kidney transplantation, trauma services and rehabilitation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  The mission of the hospital is no different from what it was 87 years ago when the Sisters of Charity first came to Long Beach.  St. Mary is no longer a small 70-bed hospital with a handful of doctors and nurses.  Today, St. Mary Medical Center is a 389 bed, non-profit medical center offering award winning, quality medical services.  With its 1,462 staff, over 500 physicians and commitment to the Long Beach area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmarymedicalcenter.org/intradoc-cgi/idc_cgi_isapi.dll?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=5002539 History Primary Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221082739/http://www.stmarymedicalcenter.org/intradoc-cgi/idc_cgi_isapi.dll?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=5002539 |date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic Healthcare West (now [[Dignity Health]]) acquired St. Mary Medical Center from the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Olmos|first=David R.|title=Catholic Chain to Buy 2 Southland Hospitals|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-22/business/fi-38706_1_catholic-hospital|accessdate=April 23, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 22, 1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412050640/http://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-22/business/fi-38706_1_catholic-hospital|archivedate=April 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''T-1000''', also known as a '''Prototype Series 1000 Terminator''', is a fictional character in the [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator franchise]]. A [[shapeshifter|shapeshifting]] [[Android (robot)|android]] assassin, the T-1000 is the main [[antagonist]] of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', as well as a minor antagonist in ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' and a theme park attraction in ''[[Terminator 2 3-D: Battle Across Time]]''. A similar Terminator, referred to as a T-1001 appears in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series, ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox.com/blogs/terminator/2008/09/09/feedback/ Fox.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527014245/http://www.fox.com/blogs/terminator/2008/09/09/feedback/ |date=May 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Created by the franchise's main antagonist, [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], a machine artificial intelligence that directs its robotic creations against the [[Resistance (Terminator)|Human Resistance]] in an all-out war, the T-1000 is described in ''Terminator 2'' as being composed of liquid metal, or a [[mimetic]] polyalloy ([[nanorobotics]]) that it can manipulate to assume various forms. Aside from being able to camouflage itself by assuming the appearance of a nondescript object or take on the likeness of other humans that it terminates in pursuit of its goals, the T-1000's shapeshifting abilities enable it to form its hands into stabbing blades, slip through physical openings by oozing its liquid form, and instantly reform itself from any physical damage.&lt;ref name="scifiscripts.com"&gt;[http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/t2.txt Scifiscripts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It is further explained in the prologue of the film's [[novelization]], that the T-1000 was created through [[nanotechnology]], and is a '[[Nanomorph]]', able to scan the molecular structure of whatever it is touching and visually mimic it.&lt;ref name="Nano"&gt;''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' by Randall Frakes, James Cameron and William Wisher (June 1, 1991)({{ISBN|0-553-29169-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Terminator 2'', the T-1000's default form is portrayed by [[Robert Patrick]], and in ''Terminator Genisys'', by [[Lee Byung-hun]], while other actors portray the T-1000 in the disguise of specific characters.&lt;ref name="Reddit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Terminator/comments/244eep/so_i_found_this_today_date_was_for_yesterday/|title=So I found this today. Date was for yesterday. : Terminator|work=reddit|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Terminator 2'' and ''Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time'', the T-1000 is presented as a technological leap over the [[Terminator (character)|"800 Series" Terminator]] ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]).&lt;ref&gt;Trailer of ''Terminator 2'' has the Schwarzenegger character identified as 800 Series Model 101"&lt;/ref&gt; Described by [[Allmovie]] as "one of the most memorable roles in one of the most memorable films of the decade",&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/person/105784/Robert-Patrick/biography Robert Patrick, All Movie Guide biography at The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick's portrayal of the T-1000 earned him nominations for [[MTV Movie Award for Best Villain|Best Villain]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the 1992 [[1992 MTV Movie Awards|MTV]] and [[Saturn Award]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1598|section=awards|Robert Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked #39 in the [[Online Film Critics Society]]'s "Top 100 Villains of All Time" in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120229081933/http://www.ofcs.org/2010/09/ofcs-top-100-top-100-villains-of-all.html "Top 100 Villains of All Time"]. [[Online Film Critics Society]]. Archived at [[Wayback Machine]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==
[[Teaser trailer]]s for ''Terminator 2'' deliberately withheld the notion that the T-1000 character was the villain. A tagline for the film was ''"This time there are ''two''. Terminator 2."'' Prior to the film's release, Robert Patrick was promoted as portraying "Austin", the name on the T-1000's police uniform's ID tag.

Writer/director [[James Cameron]] stated that his original intention for the sequel was that both Terminators sent to the past would be [[Terminator (character)|T-800s]] like the one played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], with one being stripped down to a metal endoskeleton like the one from the original film. Once Cameron actually started working on the script, in 1990, he figured a better way was to turn the evil Terminator into a more advanced model.&lt;ref name=bd&gt;"Interactive Modes", ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' Blu-Ray&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron's original pick to play the T-1000 was rock musician [[Billy Idol]], and [[storyboard]]s had the robot resembling him, but a serious motorcycle accident prevented Idol from accepting the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/09/15/how-billy-idol-and-lance-henriksen-were-nearly-james-camerons-terminators/|title=How Billy Idol And Lance Henriksen Were Nearly James Cameron’s Terminators|author=Jennifer Vineyard|work=[[MTV]] Movies Blog|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=September 15, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916120355/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/09/15/how-billy-idol-and-lance-henriksen-were-nearly-james-camerons-terminators/|archivedate=September 16, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, he thought of casting actor [[Michael Biehn]], who played [[Kyle Reese]] in ''The Terminator'', in the role with the explanation that Skynet managed to acquire Reese's DNA and use it for a new Terminator. Cameron ultimately dropped this idea after deciding the audience would find it too confusing: eventually casting came down to Robert Patrick, as a deliberate contrast to the original Terminator - Cameron stated "I wanted to find someone who would be a good contrast to Arnold. If the 800 series is a kind of human [[Panzer]] tank, then the 1000 series had to be a [[Porsche]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

==Appearance and abilities==
[[File:T-1000 002.png|thumb|200px|The T-1000 in its default liquid metal form]]

In the ''Terminator 2'' storyline, the T-1000 is made of liquid metal. The T-800 explains that the T-1000 is a more advanced [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]], composed entirely of a "mimetic polyalloy", rendering it capable of rapid shape shifting, near-perfect [[mimicry]] and rapid recovery from damage. Furthermore, it can use its ability to quickly [[liquify]] and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing its arms into solid metal tools or [[Edged and bladed weapons|bladed weapons]], walking through prison bars, flattening itself and imitating the pattern and texture of the ground to hide or [[ambush]] targets.&lt;ref name="scifiscripts.com"/&gt;

The T-1000 also has the ability to extrude small, simple items from itself.  For example, it creates a motorcycle helmet and sunglasses when these items were necessary for its disguise (the [[motorcycle cop]] disguise is used for the T-1000 [[action figure]]).  The T-1000 can also change its surface color and texture to convincingly simulate flesh, clothing, and other nonmetallic materials. It is capable of accurately mimicking voices as well, including the ability to extrapolate a relatively small voice sample to generate a wider array of words or inflections as required. However, its morphing abilities are limited by complexity, mass, and volume: it cannot transform into complex machines with mechanical moving parts or chemical fuels (like guns or bombs), limiting it to stabbing weapons unless it acquires external hardware, and its volume prevents it from taking the form of a small object like a pack of cigarettes, although it is capable of impersonating larger people (Most likely by simply making its interior somewhat hollow rather than remaining a solid mass).

Like all Terminators, the T-1000 possesses superhuman strength. While relatively equal in strength to the T-800, thanks to its morphing abilities and immunity to mechanical damage, it is shown to be capable of overpowering the T-800 in hand-to-hand combat, despite its more slender frame and lack of mass compared to its predecessor. It can also run fast enough to catch up to a police car accelerating away from it, although at times it can acquire and drive vehicles if it requires increased speed. Since the slender, smaller frame is its default appearance, when assuming a person that is physically taller and bulkier than it, the T-1000's density decreases and becomes slightly hollow, also causing it to lose the center of gravity, forcing it to take harder steps and slower pace to make an appearance of a bulkier person.

The T-1000 is effectively impervious to physical injury and any damage to its body will only momentarily stagger it for as long as it takes to repair any wound or deformation. Bullet wounds are a minor inconvenience; the T-1000 can shrug off and repair injuries from small arms fire but a high-kinetic impacts from shotgun blasts or a large explosion will knock it out for a few moments before it can recover. If a part of its body is detached, it will liquefy and flow back into the T-1000's body, with its detached nano parts being able to track the core of the body from a far range, up to 9 miles(14.5 km).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It is explained in the prologue to the novel adaptation of the film, that the T-1000 is able to completely reform and reshape itself at will, due to its "cells" having been programmed by Skynet with on-board [[nanotechnology]]. This technology can be programmed with commands from Skynet, and can help the T-1000 scan the cellular makeup of whatever it is touching (including the DNA of living animals), and can magnetically attract broken off pieces of itself back to the main body.&lt;ref name="Nano"/&gt;

The T-1000's weaknesses are extreme temperatures and it's overall lack of knowledge concerning other Terminators. When it was frozen solid from a coating of liquid nitrogen, it could not move; it was then shot by the Terminator and split into several pieces. However, the heat from a nearby crucible thawed out the individual pieces and they liquefied and flowed back together, reforming the T-1000's body. After the Terminator shot it with a grenade launcher, it was so distorted and off balance from the gap in its torso that it slipped and fell into a molten steel vat and after it shapeshifted uncontrollably into its previous human disguises/victims and it turned itself inside-out to try to shield itself from the molten steel. It was permanently destroyed when the searing heat disassembled its nanotechnological "cells" on a microscopic level. The T1000 is also not specifically designed to encounter other Terminators and has little knowledge of their diagnostics. This allows the T-800 to take it by surprise. The T1000 had previously shut the T-800 down, but did not know of the older model's emergency reboot power mode. It is stated in Terminator 3, the T-X was designed with the knowledge necessary to destroy other Terminators and thus diagnostic files of other Terminators was in its internal database. 

The Special Edition DVD release of ''T:2'' contains additional scenes in the steel foundry showing that the damaging effects of being frozen, shattered and thawed caused the T-1000 to glitch, causing it to uncontrollably morph and match its surface with objects it touches against the T-1000's will (such as its hand sticking to, and taking on the metallic texture and yellow/black caution striping of a guardrail). In the Special Edition, this glitch is what enabled [[John Connor]] to see through its ruse when it impersonates his mother, as its feet took on the color and texture of the grated metal floor on which it stood. The DVD also contains a Deleted Scene where the T-1000 uses its hands to "scan" John Connor's bedroom for genetic and psychological information, including DNA, an ability it may have in common with the T-X. As stated above, the film's novelization explained this feature by expanding on the origins of the T-1000 in its prologue, where it is explained that the T-1000 is controlled through nanotechnology, that allows it to "scan" the basic molecular structure of objects, both living and inanimate, it is in contact with.

The T-1000 series are apparently capable of espionage and detective skills, as they often attempt to accomplish their goals by [[Deception|subterfuge and deception]] instead of brute force and extreme violence as the original T-800 resorted to. For example, in ''Terminator 2,'' it disguises itself as a police officer to gain trust, access information, and provide a benign, friendly appearance. It also imitates family members of its human target to gain that person's confidence. In fact, the T-1000 is able to pass as human, possessing a larger repertoire of emotional expression and interpersonal skills than earlier Terminator models. Despite the fact that the original T-800 also had some non-violent interactions and used a phone book to track Sarah Connor, T-1000 used a variety of deceptions and was much more human-like.
&lt;ref&gt;In Terminator 2, examples of the T-1000's emotional expression include the following; it spares a brief moment of bemusement after seeing a clothing store mannequin that resembles its liquid metal form, it looks shocked when its arm breaks off due to being frozen with liquid nitrogen, displays frustration and anger towards the Model 101 when it thwarts its attempt to force [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah]] to call John out of hiding, wags its finger in a "tsk-tsk" gesture at Sarah after she fails to destroy it in the steel mill, exhibits a stunned expression after being significantly disrupted by a grenade, and shows genuine agony when it is freezing and when it is dropped into the molten steel.&lt;/ref&gt; In one scene in ''Terminator 2'', disguised as a police officer, it holds a conversation with John Connor's foster parents in an attempt to learn Connor's location.&lt;ref name="scifiscripts.com"/&gt;

It is also capable of exploiting the emotions of its targets, as in the steel foundry when it tortured Sarah Connor to call out for her son, anticipating that she would respond accordingly.&lt;ref name="scifiscripts.com"/&gt; A T-1000 demonstrates annoyance when dealing with the T-800, in ''T:2'' and another T-1000 demonstrates annoyance with Kyle Reese, in ''Terminator: Genisys'', and tilts its head in salute to Sarah Connor when she devised a method to distinguish it from the person it mimics. Additionally, it is able to express fear and pain, demonstrated when the T-1000 gives a brief look of shock after the T-800 shoots a grenade into its stomach, and when it writhes in agony after falling into a vat of molten metal. The same is shown in ''Genisys'', when the Guardian holds it under an hydrochloric acid shower and it frantically struggles to get free before it is destroyed.

In ''Genisys'', it is also shown that the T-1000 has the ability to repair damaged machines and use its own body as independent weapons and gadgets, such as a spear or a tracking device. It severs its own arm and hurls it as a javelin to impale the Guardian to a wall, it reactivates a broken T-101 by infusing the 101 with some polyalloy and it latches a piece of itself onto a lock in order to track the Guardian's truck.

===''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''===
[[File:T-1000 (Robert Patrick).jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Robert Patrick]] as the T-1000/Austin in ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'']]
[[File:Terminator.ogg|thumb|Video of T-1000 [[shapeshifting]]]]
In ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', the T-1000 (Patrick) is sent by [[Skynet (fictional)|Skynet]] back in time to kill a young [[John Connor]] ([[Edward Furlong]]), the future leader of the Human Resistance against Skynet. The T-1000 ambushes a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] police officer, Austin, on arrival and [[Doppelgänger|takes on his identity]], tracking down John Connor through the police cruiser's on-board computer and eventually confronting him in a shopping mall, where it meets a T-800 Model 101 similar to the one from the first ''Terminator'' film. It is at this point in the film where it is revealed that the T-800 ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) is now the protector, and "Austin" is in fact a new, advanced prototype T-1000 sent to assassinate John. Following a brief scuffle and a lengthy car chase, the T-800 and John escape from the T-1000.  The T-1000 is thwarted again at a psychiatric institution, where John and the T-800 rescue John's mother, [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] ([[Linda Hamilton]]), and again escape from him.

The T-1000 uses its morphing capabilities to track down John Connor, eliminating any who stand in its way, including John's foster parents ([[Jenette Goldstein]] and [[Xander Berkeley]]).  After tracking the Connors and the T-800 to [[Cyberdyne Systems Corporation]] headquarters, it gives chase and crashes a truck carrying liquid nitrogen into a [[steel mill]].

The T-1000 is frozen solid by leaking liquid nitrogen, allowing the T-800 to shatter it with a single pistol round. After the T-1000 reforms (but its shapeshifting capability malfunctions) the T-800 engages it in hand-to-hand combat, to buy time for Sarah and John, but is defeated and shut down in the process. The T-1000 then continues the hunt for John, unaware that the T-800 has rerouted power and reactivated itself.

The T-1000 copies John's mother's form and confronts John but is stopped by John's real mother.  It survives Sarah's shotgun blasts but is finally done in by the T-800 who fires his last grenade, which detonates inside the T-1000.  While attempting to reform, it stumbles and falls backwards into a vat of molten steel.  Unable to stand the high temperature it is melted and consumed.

===''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines''===
Despite failing to eliminate John Connor ([[Nick Stahl]]), it is later revealed in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' that the T-1000 "inadvertently interfered" with the development of his relationships with Kate Brewster ([[Claire Danes]]), with whom he attended junior high school, and her father, Robert ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]), who was the primary creator of Skynet by using Cyberdyne Systems' research.

The T-1000's successor is the [[T-X]], designed to not only terminate humans but also rogue Terminators reprogrammed by the Resistance, an "anti-terminator terminator" as stated by John Connor. The T-X is a composite of the T-800 and T-1000, combining the former's solid endoskeleton covered with the latter's liquid metal "[[nano technology|mimetic]] polyalloy", allowing it to take the shape of any humanoid it touches. Because it is only coated in this material, it is possible to remove it from the endoskeleton using immensely strong [[magnetic force]], such as that from a [[Particle accelerator#Circular or cyclic accelerators|cyclic particle accelerator]]. Having a solid endoskeleton did solve some of the T-1000's problems, namely being deformed by temperature extremes and explosives while also lacking built-in ranged weaponry. However, the endoskeleton makes the T-X less flexible than its T-1000 predecessor, in that the T-X does not have the ability to liquefy and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing its arms into solid metal tools or bladed weapons, walking through prison bars and narrow openings, or flattening itself.

===''Terminator Genisys''===

It kills her parents but she escaped, and is subsequently found by a reprogrammed T-800 (Brett Azar with Schwarzenegger's digitally de-aged head superimposed on top), sent by an unknown party to be her guardian. The subsequent arrivals of the two androids effectively alters the course of Sarah's life. Eleven years later, in the form of an [[Asian American]] LAPD police officer, the T-1000 intercepts [[Kyle Reese]] ([[Jai Courtney]]) after Kyle arrives from 2029.  As Kyle has no experience battling a T-1000, he is unable to defeat it and is only saved by the arrival of Sarah Connor ([[Emilia Clarke]]) and the Guardian (Schwarzenegger). By latching a piece of itself onto the Guardian's truck, the T-1000 tails the three to the Guardian's warehouse base and attacks them again. It uses pieces of itself to pin the Guardian to a wall and to reactivate Skynet's T-800 to chase Kyle Reese while pursuing Sarah. It masquerades as Reese in an attempt to fool Sarah, but Sarah sees through the ruse and lures the T-1000 into a shower of hydrochloric acid, severely destabilizing its molecular structure and weakening it. Despite this, it tries to kill Sarah, but the Guardian grabs it and holds it under the acid shower until it disintegrates completely, destroying it.

In the film's climactic battle, the damaged Guardian is thrown into a vat of liquid metal to be used for the creation of T-1000s, which restores it and gives it shapeshifting abilities similar to a T-1000.

====Original draft====

[[McG]], the director of ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', has previously mentioned that the T-1000 would be reintroduced in what was to be his concept of the fifth film: "I like the idea and the perspective for the next picture that you meet [[Robert Patrick]] the way he looks today, and he's a scientist that's working on, you know, improving cell replication so we can stay healthier and we can cure diabetes and do all these things that sound like good ideas, and to once again live as idealized expressions as ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jake Rico|title=Terminator Salvation - First Review|work=[[ShowBizCafe.com]]|date=January 12, 2009|url=http://www.showbizcafe.com/en/news/terminator-salvation-first-review/1423|accessdate=January 13, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131073308/http://showbizcafe.com/en/news/terminator-salvation-first-review/1423|archivedate=January 31, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Randy Jennings|title=Wonder Con T4 Exclusive: CG Arnold Approved!

===Non-''Terminator'' films===
* Robert Patrick parodied his T-1000 character in the 1992 film ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. In the scene where Wayne is pulled over for speeding, Patrick - dressed in a police uniform - pulls out a picture of Edward Furlong (the actor who played John Connor) and asks Wayne if he has seen him. This results in Wayne screaming in terror and driving away.

* Robert Patrick as the T-1000 also briefly appeared in the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' as it was seen walking out the same building that Danny and Jack Slater (played by Schwarzenegger) were entering. Danny tries to tell Jack about the T-1000 he just saw, but Jack ignores him completely.

A T-1001 Terminator, a second liquid metal prototype, is introduced in the 2008 television series, ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' at the start of the show's second season (though sometimes misidentified as a T-1000 by reviewers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=feedback. |work=Fox.com official blog |date=September 9, 2008 |url=http://fox.com/blogs/terminator/2008/09/09/feedback/ |accessdate=September 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911124811/http://fox.com/blogs/terminator/2008/09/09/feedback/ |archivedate=September 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It masquerades as [[Catherine Weaver]] ([[Shirley Manson]]), the co-founder and current CEO of [[ZeiraCorp]]. "Weaver" often has mixed results when socially interacting both with subordinates at ZeiraCorp and Weaver's daughter [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Savannah Weaver|Savannah]] (portrayed by [[Mackenzie Smith]]), but was written with an improved ability to adapt to and sustain itself in changing situations more adeptly than prior Terminators. It was unable to make convincing smiles or relate to people, despite being more advanced than the T-1000, which seemed to be better at social interaction. However, the T-1001 was able to successfully lead a company and use literary allegories.

The T-1001's mission remains unclear throughout the television series, but diverts from the single-minded attempts to assassinate the Connors, as seen in the prior films. Through most of the TV series, the T-1001, as well as Sarah Connor and her allies, did not appear to be aware of each other's existence. As the head of ZeiraCorp, the T-1001 diverts that company's resources into developing an artificial intelligence, titled "Project Babylon", which appeared sufficient to combat Skynet's development. Catherine Weaver is first seen in the second season opener when she purchases the late Andy Goode's Turk computer system for $300,000 from an associate and then introduces this new computer system to her department heads to reveal her plans to create a new artificial intelligence computer system. Towards this end, Catherine Weaver recruits FBI Special Agent [[James Ellison (Terminator)|James Ellison]] to find and capture a Terminator in order to [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] it using a variety of deceptions. Until the end of the series, Ellison is never aware of Weaver's true nature. Ellison delivers a [[Cromartie (Terminator)|T-888 Terminator]]'s body to Weaver after it was critically damaged by Connor's [[Cameron (Terminator)|Terminator bodyguard]]. The T-1001 advocates learning more about the 'robots' ironically in order to ''prevent'' [[Judgment Day]]. With Ellison's initial mission complete, it assigns him to act as tutor/mentor to the nascent AI now connected to the T-888's body, which Weaver nicknames "John Henry".

John Henry quickly identifies Weaver as a machine, albeit different from itself, but obeys Weaver's instruction not to share that information with anyone, assuring him that everything done at ZeiraCorp is for John Henry's benefit. At one point, Weaver reveals a clue to the nature of its mission when it tells Ellison that Savannah's future safety is dependent upon John Henry, but that the reverse is not the case. This appears to be in contradiction to the assumption that Weaver was coordinating the efforts to develop Skynet to eradicate humanity.

In the television series, the true nature of the T-1001's entire mission is never revealed, and much of what Weaver does in furtherance of it seems contradictory. In one of the episodes that shifts between the present day and post-Judgment Day, it is learned that leader of the resistance, John Connor, asked a liquid metal Terminator to join him, and the Terminator refused. In the series finale, by way of introduction, the T-1001 asks (using the same phrase) the same of Connor (and his bodyguard Cameron, who was privy to the aforementioned events in the future) through Ellison, sent as intermediary.

Also in the season/series finale, when Sarah Connor and John Connor finally meet Catherine Weaver face-to-face at her office, Ellison, Sarah, and John all discover Weaver's true nature when she uses her Terminator liquid metal abilities to form a shield to protect them from a flying Kaliba Corp drone which crash-dives into the ZeiraCorp building. When Sarah Connor discovers that ZeiraCorp possesses Andy Goode's Turk, she assumes that Weaver is constructing Skynet but Weaver corrects her by stating that she is "building something to fight it." Upon entering the basement, the four discover that John Henry has transported himself to the future with Cameron's chip, leaving Cameron's empty body. When Ellison and Sarah Connor decline to jump forward in time with Weaver and John Connor, Weaver instructs Ellison to pick up Savannah from gymnastics.

Weaver then transports itself and John Connor to a post-Judgment Day future in which John Connor is not known to the human resistance. Though Connor and the T-1001 arrived naked, the T-1001 forms "clothing" a moment later. After briefly talking to John, the Terminator slips away when the human resistance encounters John, thus leaving its whereabouts unknown.

===''Terminator 2: Judgment Day &amp;ndash; Nuclear Twilight''===
In the ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day &amp;ndash; Nuclear Twilight'' comic published by [[Malibu Comics]] in 1996, an injured Tech-Com soldier named "Griffith" is abducted by a troop of T-800 Terminators and brought back to Skynet. He is drugged and, while in a delirious state (believing he has died and gone to Heaven), questioned by Skynet about Tech-Com's acquisition of a T-800 unit. After he has supplied all the information he is aware of, two T-1000 Terminators enter the room and assume his appearance before killing him. One is sent to infiltrate the human resistance, the other sent through time to kill John Connor as outlined in the ''Terminator 2'' movie. In the simultaneously published ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day &amp;ndash; Cybernetic Dawn'', set just after the film, a female T-1000 and two T-800s come to the present to make sure the creation of Skynet happens as planned.

===''Terminator/Robocop: Kill Human''===
In the second crossover between Terminator and Robocop, the T-1000 plays a fairly significant role. It's the same model as from ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''. His role is not changed, he still intends to kill John Connor, but this time he must confront Robocop as well to get to John Connor. Robocop manages to save John and Sarah because he came from the future to stop the downfall of humanity, which even with the resistance fighting back, the war was lost for humanity. Robocop shows no interest in keeping John and Sarah safe however, all he wants to do is prevent the future from happening. The T-1000 finds his targets on a naval base, set up by Robocop. He gets in, but the vessel they are on begins to sink, but even with some help from the re-activated T-800 unit, John Connor is dead and the vessel sinks to the bottom of the sea, with everyone on board possibly drowning in the fight. Even the two Terminators and Robocop who are destroyed by a chemical compound designed to destroy metals, which has seeped into the waters.

'''Varenicline''' (trade name '''Chantix''' and '''Champix'''), is a prescription medication used to treat [[nicotine]] addiction. It reduces both craving for and decreases the pleasurable effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products.

It is a high-affinity partial agonist for the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype (nACH) that leads to the release of dopamine in the [[nucleus accumbens]] when activated, and therefore, has the capacity to reduce the feelings of craving and withdrawal caused by smoking cessation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tashkin DP | title = Smoking Cessation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease | journal = Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–507 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26238637 | doi = 10.1055/s-0035-1555610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect it is similar to [[cytisine]] and different from the [[nicotinic antagonist]] [[bupropion]] and [[nicotine replacement therapy|nicotine replacement therapies]] (NRTs) like [[nicotine patch]]es and [[nicotine gum]].

==Medical uses==
Varenicline is used for [[smoking cessation]]. In a 2009 [[meta-analysis]] varenicline was found to be more effective than bupropion ([[odds ratio]] 1.40) and NRTs (odds ratio 1.56).&lt;ref name="Mills2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mills EJ, Wu P, Spurden D, Ebbert JO, Wilson K | title = Efficacy of pharmacotherapies for short-term smoking abstinance: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Harm Reduction Journal | volume = 6 | pages = 25 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19761618 | pmc = 2760513 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7517-6-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 Cochrane overview and network [[meta-analysis]] concluded that varenicline is the most effective medication for tobacco cessation and that smokers were nearly three times more likely to quit on varenicline than with placebo treatment. Varenicline was more efficacious than bupropion or NRT and as effective as combination NRT for tobacco smoking cessation.&lt;ref name="Cochrane2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cahill K, Stevens S, Perera R, Lancaster T | title = Pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation: an overview and network meta-analysis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = CD009329 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23728690 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2 | type = Systematic Review &amp; Meta-Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elrashidi2014/&gt;

The United States' [[Food and Drug Administration]] (US FDA) has approved the use of varenicline for up to twelve weeks. If smoking cessation has been achieved it may be continued for another twelve weeks.&lt;ref name=FDA2006/&gt;

Varenicline has not been tested in those under 18 years old or pregnant women and therefore is not recommended for use by these groups.&lt;ref name="ColemanChamberlain2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coleman T, Chamberlain C, Davey MA, Cooper SE, Leonardi-Bee J | title = Pharmacological interventions for promoting smoking cessation during pregnancy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD010078 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26690977 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010078.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Varenicline is considered a [[Pregnancy category|class C]] pregnancy drug, as animal studies have shown no increased risk of congenital anomalies, however, no data from human studies is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cressman AM, Pupco A, Kim E, Koren G, Bozzo P | title = Smoking cessation therapy during pregnancy | journal = Canadian Family Physician Medecin De Famille Canadien | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 525–7 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22586193 | pmc = 3352787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An observational study is currently being conducted assessing for malformations related to varenicline exposure, but has no results yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01290445|Varenicline Pregnancy Cohort Study}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate drug is preferred for smoking cessation during breastfeeding due to lack of information and based on the animal studies on nicotine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/htmlgen?LACT|title=LactMed|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Mild [[nausea]] is the most common side effect and is seen in approximately 30% of people taking varenicline though this rarely (&lt;3%) results in discontinuation of the medication.&lt;ref name=Elrashidi2014/&gt; Other less common side effects include [[headache]], [[insomnia|difficulty sleeping]], and [[nightmare]]s. Rare side effects reported by people taking varenicline compared to placebo include [[dysgeusia|change in taste]], [[vomiting]], [[abdominal pain]], [[flatulence]], and [[constipation]]. It has been estimated that for every five subjects taking varenicline at maintenance doses, there will be an event of nausea, and for every 24 and 35 treated subjects, there will be an event of constipation and flatulence respectively. Gastrointestinal side-effects lead to discontinuation of the drug in 2% to 8% of people using varenicline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung LK, Patafio FM, Rosser WW | title = Gastrointestinal adverse effects of varenicline at maintenance dose: a meta-analysis | journal = BMC Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 15 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21955317 | pmc = 3192741 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6904-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CDG/content/CDG_Varenicline.asp |author=American Cancer Society |title=Cancer Drug Guide: Varenicline |access-date=2008-01-19 |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidence of nausea is dose-dependent: incidence of nausea was higher in people taking a larger dose (30%) versus placebo (10%) as compared to people taking a smaller dose (16%) versus placebo (11%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=d52bc40b-db7b-4243-888c-9ee95bbc6545|title=DailyMed - CHANTIX- varenicline tartrate|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression and suicide===
In 2007, the US FDA had announced it had received post-marketing reports of [[suicidal ideation|thoughts of suicide]] and occasional [[Suicide#Suicidal gestures and attempts|suicidal behavior]], erratic behavior, and drowsiness among people using varenicline for smoking cessation. In 2009, the US FDA required varenicline to carry a [[black box warning|boxed warning]] that the drug should be stopped if any of these symptoms are experienced.&lt;ref name="aikenstandard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm169988.htm|author=FDA|title=Public Health Advisory: FDA Requires New Boxed Warnings for the Smoking Cessation Drugs Chantix and Zyban|access-date=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[systematic review]] did not find evidence of an increased [[suicide]] risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes JR | title = Varenicline as a Cause of Suicidal Outcomes | journal = Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–9 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 25572451 | doi = 10.1093/ntr/ntu275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other analyses have reached the same conclusion and found no increased risk of neuropsychiatric side effects with varenicline.&lt;ref name="Cochrane2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elrashidi2014/&gt; No evidence for increased risks of cardiovascular events, depression, or self-harm with varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy has been found in one post-marketing surveillance study.&lt;ref name="Kotz2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kotz D, Viechtbauer W, Simpson C, van Schayck OC, West R, Sheikh A | title = Cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric risks of varenicline: a retrospective cohort study | journal = The Lancet. Respiratory Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 761–8 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26355008 | pmc = 4593936 | doi = 10.1016/S2213-2600(15)00320-3 | type = retrospective cohort }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning.&lt;ref name=Com2016&gt;{{cite web|last1=Commissioner|first1=Office of the|title=Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products - Chantix (varenicline) and Zyban (bupropion): Drug Safety Communication - Mental Health Side Effects Revised|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm533517.htm|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=20 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are still advised to stop the medication if they "notice any side effects on mood, behavior, or thinking."&lt;ref name=Com2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer G, Massey V | title = Electron paramagnetic resonance and circular dichroism studies on milk xanthine oxidase | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 244 | issue = 10 | pages = 2614–20 | date = May 1969 | pmc = 4306032 | doi = 10.1186/1753-6561-9-S1-A31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Yeung E, Bachi B, Long B, Lee J, Chao Y | date = 2015 | title = Varenicline and Depression: a Literature Review | url = http://wjmer.co.uk/library/downloads/pdf/vol_9_1.pdf | journal = World Journal of Medical Education and Research |volume=9 | issue = 1 |pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular disease===
In June 2011, the US FDA issued a safety announcement that varenicline may be associated with "a small, increased risk of certain cardiovascular adverse events in people who have cardiovascular disease."&lt;ref name="FDA.org"&gt;{{cite news | title =FDA Drug Safety Communication: Chantix (varenicline) may increase the risk of certain cardiovascular adverse events in patients with cardiovascular disease| date =2011-06-16| url =http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm259161.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prior 2011 review had found increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh S, Loke YK, Spangler JG, Furberg CD | title = Risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events associated with varenicline: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = CMAJ | volume = 183 | issue = 12 | pages = 1359–66 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21727225 | pmc = 3168618 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.110218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert commentary in the same journal raised doubts about the methodology of the review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takagi H, Umemoto T | title = Varenicline: quantifying the risk | journal = CMAJ | volume = 183 | issue = 12 | pages = 1404; author reply 1405, 1407 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21896705 | pmc = 3168634 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.111-2063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Samuels L | title = Varenicline: cardiovascular safety | journal = CMAJ | volume = 183 | issue = 12 | pages = 1407–8; author reply 1408 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21896709 | pmc = 3168639 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.111-2073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concerns which were echoed by the [[European Medicines Agency]] and subsequent reviews.&lt;ref name="EMA.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite news | title =European Medicine Agency confirms positive benefit-risk balance for Champix | date =2011-07-21| url =http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2011/07/news_detail_001314.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1&amp;murl=menus/news_and_events/news_and_events.jsp&amp;jsenabled=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prochaska2012"/&gt; Of specific concern were "the low number of events seen, the types of events counted, the higher drop-out rate in people receiving placebo, the lack of information on the timing of events, and the exclusion of studies in which no-one had an event."

In contrast, multiple recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found no increase in overall or serious adverse cardiovascular events (including for individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular disease) associated with varenicline use.&lt;ref name="Prochaska2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prochaska JJ, Hilton JF | title = Risk of cardiovascular serious adverse events associated with varenicline use for tobacco cessation: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 344 | issue =  | pages = e2856 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22563098 | pmc = 3344735 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e2856 | type = Systematic Review &amp; Meta-Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mills EJ, Thorlund K, Eapen S, Wu P, Prochaska JJ | title = Cardiovascular events associated with smoking cessation pharmacotherapies: a network meta-analysis | journal = Circulation | volume = 129 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–41 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24323793 | pmc = 4258065 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003961 | type = Network Meta-Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pipe2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pipe AL | title = Network meta-analysis demonstrates the safety of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in cardiovascular patients | journal = Evidence-Based Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 193 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 24917603 | doi = 10.1136/eb-2014-110030 | type = Review &amp; Commentary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowland2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowland K | title = ACP Journal Club.

Varenicline displays full [[agonist|agonism]] on [[Α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor| ]][[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s and is a [[partial agonist]] on the [[Α4β2 nicotinic|α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]],&lt;nowiki/&gt; [[Α3β4-nAChR|α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[α6β2|α&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] subtypes.&lt;ref name="pmid16766716"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mihalak KB, Carroll FI, Luetje CW | title = Varenicline is a partial agonist at alpha4beta2 and a full agonist at alpha7 neuronal nicotinic receptors | journal = Molecular Pharmacology | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 801–5 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16766716 | doi = 10.1124/mol.106.025130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20965579"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mineur YS, Picciotto MR | title = Nicotine receptors and depression: revisiting and revising the cholinergic hypothesis | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 580–6 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20965579 | pmc = 2991594 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2010.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bordia T, Hrachova M, Chin M, McIntosh JM, Quik M | title = Varenicline is a potent partial agonist at α6β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in rat and monkey striatum | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 342 | issue = 2 | pages = 327–34 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22550286 | pmc = 3400806 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.112.194852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is a weak agonist on the [[α3β2|α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] containing receptors.

Varenicline's partial agonism on the [[Α4β2-nicotinic|α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptors rather than nicotine's full agonism produces less effect of [[dopamine]] release than nicotine's. This α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; competitive binding reduces the ability of nicotine to bind and stimulate the mesolimbic dopamine system - similar to the method of action of [[buprenorphine]] in the treatment of opioid addiction.&lt;ref name=Elrashidi2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elrashidi MY, Ebbert JO | title = Emerging drugs for the treatment of tobacco dependence: 2014 update | journal = Expert Opinion on Emerging Drugs | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 243–60 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24654737 | doi = 10.1517/14728214.2014.899580 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacokinetics==
Most of the active compound is excreted by the [[kidney]]s (92–93%). A small proportion is [[glucuronidation|glucuronidated]], oxidised, ''N''-formylated or conjugated to a [[hexose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Obach RS, Reed-Hagen AE, Krueger SS, Obach BJ, O'Connell TN, Zandi KS, Miller S, Coe JW | title = Metabolism and disposition of varenicline, a selective alpha4beta2 acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, in vivo and in vitro | journal = Drug Metabolism and Disposition | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–30 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16221753 | doi = 10.1124/dmd.105.006767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elimination half-life is about 24 hours.

'''Šance Dam''' ({{lang-cs|Vodní nádrž Šance}}) is a water [[reservoir]] and dam in the [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]] mountain range, [[Moravian-Silesian Region]], [[Czech Republic]]. The dam is built on upper course of the [[Ostravice River]] and has a surface of 3.37&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cs icon}} [http://www.povodiodry.cz/sance.html Entry at Odra Basin website]&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed in 1964-1969 and began operating in 1974. Part of the village of [[Staré Hamry]] was demolished and subsequently flooded during the construction. The name of the dam comes from the hill that overlooks the dam.

The dam is used mainly to supply [[drinking water]] to nearby towns and villages and to subdue floods on the [[Ostravice River]].
