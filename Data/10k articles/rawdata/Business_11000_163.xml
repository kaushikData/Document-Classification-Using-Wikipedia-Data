'''345 California Center''' is a 48-[[Storey|story]] office tower in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|financial district]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Completed in 1986, the {{convert|211.8|m|abbr=on}} tower is the fifth tallest in the city after the [[Salesforce Tower]], [[Transamerica Pyramid]], [[181 Fremont]], and [[555 California Street]] if the spires are included. It was originally proposed to be {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} taller. The building was developed by Norland Properties, a private real estate investment firm led by Hany Ben-Halim. 

345 California is in the middle of a block with historic buildings on each of the four corners. Initially planned as condominiums, the top 11 floors of the building are the [[Loews Regency San Francisco]] hotel, located in twin towers set at 45-degree angles to the rest of the building. Several glass [[skybridge]]s offer views of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The Loews Regency has the street address '''222 Sansome''', with a different entrance.

==Floors==

The floors of the building are used as follows:

* 38F - 48F: [[Loews Regency San Francisco]]
* 4F - 36F: Offices
* 2F - 3F: Retail and Restaurants
* 1F: Lobby Entrance to the Office and Hotel
* B2F-B1F: Parking Space

In [[negotiation theory]], the '''best alternative to a negotiated agreement''' or '''BATNA''' is the most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. This could include diverse situation, such as suspension of negotiations, transition to another negotiating partner, appeal to the court's ruling, the execution of strikes, and the formation of other forms of alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mk.co.kr/cp/pop/desc.php?from=B&amp;to=C&amp;page=0&amp;so=all|title=::증권용어사전::|website=dic.mk.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator.  A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA.  Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, [[time value of money]] and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value, since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations, rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors.

==Overview==
The BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.negotiations.com/articles/best-alternative/ Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | Negotiation Experts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2013}} however without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yarooms.com/blog/batnaman-wins Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | YArooms]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options.{{Third-party-inline|date=February 2015}} This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating. Negotiators also need to be aware of the other negotiator's BATNA and to identify how it compares to what they are offering.&lt;ref&gt;Negotiation, Readings, Exercises and Cases, Roy J. Lewicki{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;&lt;ref name="Nolan-Haley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan-Haley|first=Jaqueline M|title=Alternative Dispute Resolution in a Nutshell|year=2001|publisher=Thomson West|isbn=978-0-314-18014-8 |pages=39–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theoretical example of this is ''adversarial approach style negotiation''.&lt;ref name="Nolan-Haley" /&gt; Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury" /&gt; According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.

Attractive alternatives are needed to develop a strong BATNA. In the best-selling book ''Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In'', the authors give 3 suggestions of how to accomplish this:

# Inventing a list of actions one might take if no agreement is reached
# Converting some of the more promising ideas and transforming them into tangible and partial alternatives
# Selecting the alternative that sounds best

In negotiations involving different cultures, all parties need to account for cultural cognitive behaviors and should not let judgments and biases affect the negotiation. The individual should be separate from the objective.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

The purpose here, as [[Philip Gulliver]] mentions, is for negotiation parties to be aware.&lt;ref name=Gulliver&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulliver|first=P.H|authorlink=Philip Gulliver|title=Disputes and Negotiation: A Cross Culture Perspective|year=1979|publisher=Academic Press|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation at all levels, including prejudice-free thoughts, emotion-free behavior, bias-free behavior are helpful according to Morris and Gelfand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Morris|first1=Michael W.|last2=Gelfand|first2=Michele J.|title=Cultural Differences and Cognitive Dynamics: Expanding the Cognitive Perspective on Negotiation|editor1-last=Gelfand|editor1-first=Michele J.|editor2-last=Brett|editor2-first=Jeanne M.|work=The Handbook of Negotiation and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsOfOIzoZigC&amp;pg=PA45|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4586-4|pages=45–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

BATNA was developed by negotiation researchers [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury]] of the Harvard Program on Negotiation (PON), in their series of books on [[Principled negotiation]] that started with ''[[Getting to YES]]'', unwittingly duplicating the [[game theory]] concept of a disagreement point from [[bargaining problem]]s pioneered by [[Nobel Laureate]] [[John Forbes Nash]] decades earlier.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher and Ury|first=Roger and William|title=Getting to YES|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-311875-6|pages=1–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myerson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|title=Nash Equilibrium and the History of Economic Theory|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/rmyerson/research/jelnash.pdf|publisher=Journal of Economic Literature|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nash Equilibrium]] is reached among a group of players when no player can benefit from changing strategies if every other player sticks to their current strategy.&lt;ref name="Hawkins and Steiner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawkins and Steiner |first=Jeff and Neil |title=The Nash Equilibrium Meets Batna |url=http://www.hnlr.org/print/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/257-264.pdf |work=Gamed Therory Varied Uses in ADR |publisher=Harvard University Press |accessdate=1 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228140045/http://www.hnlr.org/print/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/257-264.pdf |archivedate=February 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amy and Phil are in Nash Equilibrium if Amy is making the best decision she can, taking into account Phil's decision, and Phil is making the best decision he can, taking into account Amy's decision. Likewise, a group of players are in Nash Equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can, taking into account the decisions of the others.

Delaware's Court of Chancery, the nation's pre-eminent court addressing intra-business disputes, has functioned as a business court of limited jurisdiction for a century.  However, its traditional equity jurisdiction has evolved and expanded since 2003 to include technology disputes (10 Del. C. § 346), some purely monetary commercial disputes (10 Del. C. § 347), and to expand its role in the alternative dispute resolution of business and commercial disputes. This includes the use of mediation (10 Del. C. § 347), arbitration (10 Del. C. § 349), Masters in Chancery to adjudicate matters (10 Del. C. § 350), and agreements to make decisions non-appealable (10 Del. C. § 351).&lt;ref&gt;[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c003/sc03/ Title 10, Delaware Code, Courts and Judicial Procedures]&lt;/ref&gt;

The significant relationship between business courts and ADR is well recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin F.

==Business Court Jurisdiction, Technology Disputes &amp; Cyber Courts, and Complex Litigation Courts==
Business Courts are trial courts that hear business disputes primarily or exclusively.  In the United States, these courts have been established in approximately twenty states.  In some cases, a state legislature may choose to create a business court by statute.  In other cases, business courts have been established by judicial rule or order, at the Supreme Court or trial court level.  In all cases, the jurisdiction of the court to hear certain cases is limited to disputes that are in some way related to "business" disputes, and generally fall into two categories:  (1) those courts which require that cases have an additional complexity component; and (2) those courts which establish jurisdictional parameters (i) through a defined list of case types (ii) combined with a specified minimum amount of damages in controversy, irrespective of complexity.  There are courts with mixed models as well.&lt;ref&gt;* Mitchell L. Bach &amp; Lee Applebaum, [http://v028u02dxf.maximumasp.com/uploads/publications/historybusinesscourts2.pdf ''A History of the Creation and Jurisdiction of Business Courts in the Last Decade''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904050912/http://v028u02dxf.maximumasp.com/uploads/publications/historybusinesscourts2.pdf |date=September 4, 2012 }}, 60 Business Lawyer 147 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, for example, the Commercial Division may hear cases (1) alleging breach of contract, (2) arising under the state's business corporation law, (3) arising under the state's partnership law, (4) relating to commercial loans, negotiable instruments, letters of credit, and bank transactions, or (5) involving business torts.  The Commercial Division may not, by comparison, hear cases involving (1) landlord/tenant disputes, (2) commercial foreclosures, (3) products liability claims, or (4) claims alleging discrimination except when part of or under the terms of a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Section 202.70, Rules of the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New York [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/trialcourts/202.shtml#70 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states have established specialized courts that include technology disputes as part of their express jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob A. Sommer, Business Litigation and Cyberspace: Will Cyber Courts Prove and Effective Tool for Luring High-Tech Business Into Forum States, 56 Vanderbilt Law Review 561 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Through legislative effort and court rule, Maryland established a Business and Technology Case Management Program.  In May 2003, [[Delaware]] expanded the Court of Chancery’s jurisdiction to include technology disputes, and the mediation of other kinds of business disputes (10 Del. C. §§ 346, 347).&lt;ref&gt;[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c003/sc03/ Title 10, Delaware Code, Courts and Judicial Procedures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states are in various stages of moving toward or away from business or complex courts, with Colorado having conducted extensive studies over a decade ago into the merits and potential parameters of creating a business court on a broad basis, which was not pursued; and New Jersey considering state wide business court legislation over a period of years.

==History==
[[File:Landner Hall 3.jpg|thumb|right|Lindner College of Business classrooms and courtyard]]
Lindner College traces its roots to 1906 when the Cincinnati College of Finance, Commerce and Accounts was established. In 1912, the University of Cincinnati Board of Trustees took over the college. In 1919, the College of Commerce was merged with the College of Engineering to form the College of Engineering Commerce. In 1946, the college resumed operation as a separate entity. Over the years several programs were added, such as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program, a PhD program in 1966, and a Master of Science (MS) program in 1978.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.business.uc.edu/about/history] College of Business website, Retrieved 06/19/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cash break even ratio''' is used in evaluating the [[financial]] performance of an income property to determine what rate of occupancy is required to meet both operating expense and mortgage payments (debt service).

== Formula ==
'''Cash Break Even Ratio''' = (Operating Expenses + Mortgage Payment - Reserves for Replacement) / Potential [[Gross Income]]

It allows both [[lender|lenders]] and [[investor|investors]] to assess a particular income properties ability to meet its operating expenses and provide a measurable level of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. The ratio does not include reserves for replacement, because it is not an actual cash expense. Additionally, it includes mortgage payment (debt service) which applies to most income properties that use leverage to enhance [[return on investment]] and equity dividend rate ([[cash on cash return]]).

A '''city manager''' is an official appointed as the [[Administration (government)|administrative]] [[Management|manager]] of a city, in a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of city government. Local officials serving in this position are sometimes referred to as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) or [[chief administrative officer]] (CAO) in some municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naperville.il.us/community_relations_government.aspx City of Naperville&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Dayton, Ohio]] suffered a great flood in 1913, and responded with the innovation of a paid, non-political city manager, hired by the commissioners to run the bureaucracy; civil engineers were especially preferred. Other small or middle sized American cities, especially in the West, adopted the idea.

In Europe, smaller cities in the Netherlands were specially attracted by the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Couperus, "The managerial revolution in local government: municipal management and the city manager in the USA and the Netherlands 1900–1940." ''Management &amp; Organizational History'' (2014) 9#4 pp: 336-352.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1940 there were small cities with city managers that grew enormously by the end of the century: Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; Rochester, New York; and San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;Harold A. Stone et al., ''City Manager Government in Nine Cities'' (1940); Frederick C. Mosher et al., ''City Manager Government in Seven Cities'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a technical sense, the term "city manager," as opposed to CAO, implies more discretion and independent authority that is set forth in a charter or some other body of [[codified law]], as opposed to duties being assigned on a varying basis by a single superior such as a mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Svara, James H. and Kimberly L. Nelson. (2008, August). Taking Stock of the Council-Manager Form at 100. ''Public Management'' Magazine, pp 6-14, at: {{cite web |url=http://icma.org/pm/9007/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831195247/http://www.icma.org/pm/9007/ |archivedate=2008-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Municipal government diagram.png|thumb|500px|Municipal government diagram.]]
Most sources trace the first city manager to [[Staunton, Virginia]] in 1908. Some of the other cities that were among the first to employ a manager were [[Sumter, South Carolina]] (1912) and [[Dayton, Ohio]] (1914); Dayton was featured in the national media, and became a national standard. The first "City Manager's Association" meeting of eight city managers was in December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City managing, a new profession |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/433/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Dec 14, 1914 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city manager, operating under the [[council-manager government]] form, was created in part to remove city government from the power of the political parties, and place management of the city into the hands of an outside expert who was usually a business manager or engineer, with the expectation that the city manager would remain neutral to city politics.  By 1930 200 American cities used a city manager form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Bruce Fairbanks|author2=Patricia Mooney-Melvin|author3=Zane L. Miller|title=Making Sense of the City: Local Government, Civic Culture, and Community Life in Urban America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jT_3aZGDE4C&amp;pg=PA85|year=2001|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
As the top appointed official in the city, the city manager is typically responsible for most if not all of the day-to-day administrative operations of the municipality, in addition to other expectations.&lt;ref name=duties&gt;[http://bookstore.icma.org/FreeDocs/Council-Manager%20FAQ%20Brochure.pdf Council Manager Form of Government, ICMA publication]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duties#2"&gt;[http://icma.org/upload/library/2009-06/%7B660CAD64-A62D-4486-B22B-BDD53952F8AA%7D.pdf Sample Ordinance, ICMA.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the basic roles, responsibilities, and powers of a city manager include:
* Supervision of day-to-day operations of all city departments and staff through department heads;
* Oversight of all recruitment, dismissal, disciplining and suspensions;
* Preparation, monitoring, and execution of the city budget, which includes submitting each year to the council a proposed budget package with options and recommendations for its consideration and possible approval;
* Main technical advisor to the council on overall governmental operations;
* Public relations, such as meeting with citizens, citizen groups, businesses, and other stakeholders (the presence of a mayor may alter this function somewhat);
* Operating the city with a professional understanding of how all city functions operate together to their best effect;
*Attends all council meetings, but does not have any voting rights&lt;ref name="Nelson 49–61"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Roles of Local Government Managers in Theory and Practice: A Centennial Perspective|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12296/abstract|journal = Public Administration Review|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1540-6210|pages = 49–61|volume = 75|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/puar.12296|first = Kimberly L.|last = Nelson|first2 = James H.|last2 = Svara}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Additional duties that may be assigned by the council&lt;ref name="duties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="duties#2"/&gt;

The responsibilities may vary depending upon charter provisions and other local or state laws, rules, and regulations. In addition, many states, such as the states of New Hampshire and Missouri, have codified in law the minimum functions a local "manager" must perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C000-099/0780000610.HTM MRS] [http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/III/37/37-6.htm NH RSA]&lt;/ref&gt; The City Manager position focuses on efficiency and providing a certain level of service for the lowest possible cost.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Lynn. "The Impact Of Government Structure On Local Public Expenditures." Public Choice 136.3/4 (2008): 457-473. Political Science Complete. Web. 25 Sept. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; The competence of a city manager can be assessed using composite indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manager members of the ICMA are bound by a rather rigid and strongly enforced code of ethics that was originally established in 1924. Since that time the code had been up-dated/revised on seven occasions, the latest taking place in 1998. The updates have taken into account the evolving duties, responsibilities, and expectations of the profession; however the core dictate of the body of the code--“to integrity; public service; seek no favor; exemplary conduct in both personal and professional matters; respect the role and contributions of elected officials; exercise the independence to do what is right; political neutrality; serve the public equitably and governing body members equally; keep the community informed about local government matters; and support and lead our employ-ees”—have not changed since the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?bcid=72&amp;hsid=1&amp;ssid1=2514&amp;ssid2=2570&amp;ssid3=2571 |title=ICMA Code of Ethics page |access-date=2009-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106171929/http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?bcid=72&amp;hsid=1&amp;ssid1=2514&amp;ssid2=2570&amp;ssid3=2571 |archive-date=2007-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile==
In the early years of the profession, most managers came from the ranks of the engineering professions.&lt;ref name=stillman&gt;Stillman, Richard J. (1974). ''The Rise of the City Manager: A Public Professional in Local Government.'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the typical and preferred background and education for the beginning municipal manager is a master's degree in Public Administration (MPA) and at least several years’ experience as a department head in local government or as an assistant city manager. As of 2005 more than 60% of those in the profession had a MPA, MBA, or other related higher-level degree.&lt;ref name="ICMA#1"&gt;[http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?ssid1=2868&amp;ssid3=2868&amp;from=search&amp;hsid=9&amp;bcid=812 ICMA statistics]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average tenure of a manager is now 7–8 years and has risen gradually over the years. Tenures tend to be less in smaller communities and higher in larger ones, and they tend to vary as well depending on the region of the country.&lt;ref name="ICMA#1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ammons, David M and Matthew J. Bosse. (2005). “Tenure of City Managers: Examining the Dual Meanings of ‘Average Tenure’.” ''State &amp; Local Government Review'', Vol. 37, No. 1, pp. 61-71. at: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4355387]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dalal Street''' ({{lang-hi|दलाल पथ}}, {{lang-gu|દલાલ સ્ટ્રીટ}}) in downtown [[Mumbai]], [[India]], is the address of the [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (in the [[Phiroze Jeejeebhoy Towers]]) and several related financial firms and institutions. When Bombay Stock Exchange was moved to this new location at the intersection of [[Bombay Samachar|Bombay Samāchār]] Marg and Hammam Street, the street next to the building was renamed as ''Dalal Street''{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. The [[Marathi language|Marathi]] word ''{{transl|mr|dalāl}}'' means "a [[broker]]", "a go-between".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-864317-3| last = McGregor| first = R.

At the age of 19, Dolores Zohrab Liebmann witnessed the arrest and deportation of her father from her family's residence in Constantinople as part of the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref name="Zohrab Center" /&gt; This event would deeply impact her life, for her father would be eventually killed.&lt;ref name="Zohrab Center" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Summer Interns Begin Projects at Zohrab Center|url=http://www.armenianweekly.com/2011/07/08/summer-interns-begin-projects-at-zohrab-center/|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=The Armenian Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolores, her mother and sister Herminé subsequently fled to [[Europe]] via [[Austria]] and [[Romania]] and arriving in [[Paris]], [[France]] in order to reunite with her two brothers Aram and Leon.&lt;ref name=Herbert&gt;{{cite web|last=Klitzner|first=Herbert|title=The Liebmann Family and the New York Society for Ethical Culture|url=http://www.klitzner.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Liebmann-Family-and-the-New-York-Society-for-Ethical-Culture-_V25_1.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Romanian" /&gt; After the death of her mother, Zohrab moved to [[Romania]], where in 1932 she married an American businessman, Henry L. Liebmann, grandson of [[Samuel Liebmann]] of the Jewish American Liebmann family famously associated with the Brooklyn-based [[Rheingold Beer]] company. They moved to the United States, and in 1934 Dolores Zohrab Liebmann became a naturalized American citizen.&lt;ref name="Zohrab Center"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 1950, Henry Liebmann died, and Dolores Zohrab Liebmann devoted the remainder of her life to charitable work, in particular education and research.&lt;ref name=Herbert /&gt; She made an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] to support academic programs in Armenian studies, and also established The Krikor and Clara Zohrab Fellowship at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="Zohrab Center" /&gt; She also supported research at the [[Rockefeller University]] and the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref name="Zohrab Center" /&gt; On November&amp;nbsp;8, 1987 the Krikor and Clara Zohrab Information Center was established at the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America in New York City. Through its comprehensive library holdings and educational programs, the Center supports research and learning in all areas of Armenian Studies. The inauguration of the Center was attended by [[Vazgen I]], Catholicos of All Armenians, and Archbishop [[Torkom Manoogian]], then the Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church in America and later [[List of Armenian Patriarchs of Jerusalem|Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem]].

Dolores Zohrab Liebmann died in 1991, and the Dolores Zohrab Liebmann Fund was established posthumously.&lt;ref name="Zohrab Center"/&gt;

==Legacy==
She was granted the [[Saint Nerses Shnorhali Medal]] from the former [[Catholicos of All Armenians]], [[Vazgen I]].&lt;ref name=Romanian&gt;{{cite web|title=Eduard Jeamgocian aduce noi marturii despre eroii "Cartii soaptelor"|url=http://carteasoaptelor.ro/?p=690|accessdate=15 March 2013|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown El Paso''' is the [[central business district]] of [[El Paso, Texas]], United States.

==History==
[[File:Downtown El Paso at sunset.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Downtown El Paso today]]
Dr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Street and San Francisco Street. At a later point the main business area was centered on Stanton Street and Santa Fe. In the late 1800s most of the [[White American]] residents lived to the north of the non-White areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio streets. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] residents lived in an area called [[Chihuahuita]] ("little [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]"), which was located south of Santa Fe and west of Second. Several [[African American]]s and around 300 [[Chinese American]]s also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans built railroads in the El Paso area.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Leon. "[http://www.elpasotimes.com/sunbowl/ci_4749639 Downtown El Paso has colorful history] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731023721/http://www.elpasotimes.com/sunbowl/ci_4749639 |date=2012-07-31 }}."

== History ==
[[Image:SyracuseSalinaHistoric.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Syracuse during its golden years. This photo is of South Salina Street around 1915.]]
Downtown Syracuse, as the rest of the city, grew as a result of the city's [[Salt industry in Syracuse, New York|salt industry]] and its location on the [[Erie Canal]].

For over a century, it was also the retail and entertainment center of [[Central New York]], with large department stores such as [[Chappell's]], The Addis Co., Flah's, E.W. Edwards, [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s, Grant's, Lincoln Stores, The Mohican, David's, Kresge's, Clark Music Co., Dey Brothers, and Sibley's. This attribute began to fade with development of large [[suburb]]an malls, with the final blow in 1992 when the combined Addis &amp; Dey's department store became the last major store to leave downtown.

===South Salina Street===
South Salina Street between Erie Boulevard and West Onondaga Street was the main north-south artery of Downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and was among the busiest streets in the city.&lt;ref name="chartered"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yestercuse.com/salina.htm |title=Salina Street |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |first= |last= |publisher=Yestercuse, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718141213/http://www.yestercuse.com/salina.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area has seen a great deal of revitalization in recent years with projects such as the conversion of the historic Syracuse Trust Building into luxury condos, a project engineered by local developer [[Peter Muserlian]]. More development projects are planned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/centro_receives_millions_from.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cobblestone streets===
In 1835, the "nature of the soil and the flat surface of the ground" in the village rendered the construction of stone pavements necessary. An ordinance was passed authorizing the paving with [[cobblestone]] of Salina Street from Fayette to Church Streets and Genesee Street from the west line of [[Clinton Square]] to ''[[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]]''. Additionally, sections of Water, Warren and Franklin Streets were paved.&lt;ref name="cobblestone"&gt;{{cite news |title=Street Paving |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]] |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]] January 16, 1881| accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paving of these streets also made it necessary to pave the public squares, or the work would be "incomplete." A sum of $4,500 was raised with general tax. During the same year, sidewalks of brick were ordered to be constructed along all paved streets and squares where they had not already been laid including Salina Street from Washington Street to Onondaga Avenue.&lt;ref name="cobblestone"/&gt;

===Armory Square===
{{Main|Armory Square}}

''Armory Square'' is a small neighborhood on the west side of Downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. It began life as a busy commercial and industrial area just to the west of the central city. Named after the historic armory building that still inhabits the district's center, Armory Square is now home to luxury condos, restaurants, cafes, and high-end office space.

===Forman Park===
{{Main|Forman Park}}

''Forman Park'' was first established on June 16, 1839, and was known as ''Forman Square''. The main attraction is a bronze memorial of early civic leaders Joshua Forman and Lewis H. Redfield. The park is 1.3 acres and is located at East Genesee and Almond Streets.&lt;ref name="square"&gt;{{cite news |title=Forman Square |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first= |last=|date=February 6, 1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinton Square===

{{Main|Clinton Square}}

''Clinton Square'' first came into existence in the early 19th century when roadways from north and south joined in downtown Syracuse. By the mid-19th century, the construction of [[Erie Canal]] further transformed the busy intersection into the center of commerce and trade in [[Central New York]].&lt;ref name="today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonsquare.com/ |title=Clinton Square |accessdate=November 25, 2010 |first=Steve |last=Johnson |publisher=ClintonSquare.com, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hanover-square 1900 veterans-park.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Veteran's Park in Syracuse, New York about 1900 - Later renamed Hanover Square]]

===Hanover Square===
{{Main|Hanover Square, Syracuse}}

''Hanover Square'' is actually a triangle at the intersection of Warren, Water, and East Genesee Streets. The name may also refer to the larger ''Hanover Square Historic District'', which includes seventeen historic buildings in the area that was the first commercial district in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="nrhptext"&gt;{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Dennis|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Hanover Square Historic District|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=6313 |date=December 1975 |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public square was originally named ''Veteran's Park''. It was renamed to [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]] after the ''Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument'' in [[Clinton Square]] was dedicated in 1910 and the function of commemorating [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse's]] war dead was shifted there. The larger [[Clinton Square]] had already developed as the city's center to the west, but following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, commercial and retail activity spread along Genesee Street to [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]].&lt;ref name="then"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syracusethenandnow.org/Dwntwn/HanoverSq/HanoverSquare.htm |title=Hanover Square |accessdate=December 5, 2010 |first= |last= |publisher=Syracuse Then and Now, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, downtown Syracuse is an economic center, with many insurance companies, banks, and law firms having a large presence there.

Since the late 1980s, downtown Syracuse has also increasingly become a [[nightlife (activity)|nightlife]] center, with many bars, clubs, restaurants, and pubs located in the ''[[Armory Square]]'' area.

Most of Syracuse's cultural festivals, such as [[Oktoberfest celebrations|Oktoberfest]] and Festa Italiana, also take place downtown.

The ''Downtown Committee of Syracuse'' has taken a great deal of effort to revitalize the area. Most sidewalks and streetlights have been restored since 1995, with maps and other information posted on many street corners.

All of downtown is lively on weekdays, but on nights and weekends most activity centers around the ''[[Armory Square]]'', ''[[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]]'', and ''[[Clinton Square, Syracuse|Clinton Square]]'' areas. With the reopening of the historic ''[[Marriott Syracuse Downtown]]'' in 2016, there are currently three hotels downtown.

===National Register of Historic Places===
The following are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and located in Downtown Syracuse: [[Amos Block]], [[Armory Square Historic District]], [[Central New York Telephone and Telegraph Building]], [[Central Technical High School]], [[Gere Bank Building]], [[Gridley Building]], [[Hanover Square (Syracuse)|Hanover Square Historic District]], [[Hotel Syracuse]], [[Landmark Theatre (Syracuse, New York)|Loew's State Theater]], [[Montgomery Street-Columbus Circle Historic District]], [[New York Central Railroad Passenger and Freight Station]], [[Niagara Hudson Building]], [[Onondaga County Savings Bank Building]], [[Onondaga County War Memorial]], [[Plymouth Congregational Church (Syracuse, New York)|Plymouth Congregational Church]], [[Saint Paul's Episcopal Cathedral (Syracuse, New York)|St. Paul's Cathedral and Parish House]], [[C.W.

== Recent years ==
In December 2005, [[Syracuse University]] announced it had purchased eleven buildings downtown, and leased another. Hundreds of faculty, staff, and students began using the buildings in the spring of 2006. Former [[Syracuse University]] chancellor [[Nancy Cantor]]'s motto for the venture was "Exploring the Soul of Syracuse." At the same time, the university and the city were working on a project called the "Connective Corridor," a special path from the university area to [[Armory Square]]. The main building of [[Syracuse University]] downtown is [[The Warehouse (Syracuse)|The Warehouse]].

==Responsibilities==
The New York Fed publishes a [http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/capital_markets/ycfaq.html monthly recession probability prediction] derived from the [[yield curve]] and based on the work by Dr. Arturo Estrella &amp; Dr. Tobias Adrian.

Their models show that, when the difference between short-term interest rates (using three-month [[T-bills]]) and long-term interest rates (using ten-year Treasury bonds) at the end of a Federal Reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive, a rise in unemployment usually occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Estrella &amp; Tobias Adrian, ''[http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr397.pdf FRB of New York Staff Report No. 397]'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest regional Federal Reserve Bank==

[[Image:Federal Reserve Districts Map.svg|400px|thumb|Map of Federal Reserve districts]]

Since the founding of the Federal Reserve banking system, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in [[Manhattan]]'s Financial District has been the place where monetary policy in the United States is implemented, although policy is decided in Washington, D.C. by the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]. The New York Fed is the largest in terms of assets of the twelve regional banks. Operating in the financial capital of the U.S., the New York Fed is responsible for conducting [[open market operations]], the buying and selling of outstanding [[Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]].  The '''Trading Desk''' is the office at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that manages the FOMC Directive to sell or buy bonds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the responsibility for ''issuing'' new U.S. Treasury securities lies with the [[Bureau of the Public Debt]]. In 2003, [[Fedwire]], the Federal Reserve's system for transferring balances between it and other banks, transferred $1.8 trillion a day in funds, of which about $1.1 trillion originated in the Second District. It transferred an additional $1.3 trillion a day in securities, of which $1.2 trillion originated in the Second District. The New York Fed is also responsible for carrying out [[exchange rate]] policy by buying and selling dollars at the discretion of the United States Treasury Department. The New York Federal Reserve is the only regional bank with a permanent vote on the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] and its president is traditionally selected as the Committee's vice chairman.

==History==

===Benjamin Strong, 1914-1928===
The New York Fed opened for business on November 16, 1914, under the leadership of [[Benjamin Strong Jr.]], who had previously been president of the Bankers Trust Company. He led the Bank until his death in 1928.  Strong became the executive officer (then called the "governor"—today, the term would be "president").  As the leader of the Federal Reserve's largest and most powerful district bank, Strong became a dominant force in U.S. monetary and banking affairs.  One biographer has termed him the "de facto leader of the entire Federal Reserve System."&lt;ref&gt;Lester Vernon Chandler, ''Benjamin Strong:  Central Banker'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;  This was not only because of Strong's abilities, but also because the central board's powers were ambiguous and, for the most part, limited to supervisory and regulatory functions under the 1913 [[Federal Reserve Act]] because many Americans were antagonistic to centralized control.

When the United States entered [[World War I]], Strong was a major force behind the campaigns to fund the war effort via bonds owned primarily by U.S. citizens.  This enabled the United States to avoid many of the post-war financial problems of the European belligerents.  Strong gradually recognized the importance of [[open market operation]], or purchases and sales of government [[Security (finance)|securities]], as a means of managing the quantity of money in the U.S. economy and thus affecting interest rates.  This was particularly important at the time because gold had flooded into the United States during and after World War I.  Thus, its gold-backed currency was well-protected, but prices had been pushed up substantially by the currency expansion due to the [[gold standard]]-imposed expansion of currency.  In 1922, Strong unofficially scrapped the gold standard and instead began aggressively pursuing open market operations as a means of stabilizing domestic prices and thus internal economic stability.  Thus, he began the Federal Reserve's practice of buying and selling government securities as monetary policy.  [[John Maynard Keynes]], a prominent British economist who had previously not questioned the gold standard, used Strong's activities as an example of how a central bank could manage a nation's economy without the gold standard in his book "A Tract on Monetary Reform" (1923).  To quote one authority:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was Strong more than anyone else who invented the modern central banker.  When we watch... [central bankers of today] describe how they are seeking to strike the right balance between economic growth and price stability, it is the ghost of Benjamin Strong who hovers above him.  It all sounds quite prosaically obvious now, but in 1922 it was a radical departure from more than two hundred years of central banking history.&lt;ref&gt;Liaquat Ahamed, ''Lords of Finance:  The Bankers Who Broke the World'' (2009), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strong's policy of maintaining price levels during the 1920s through open market operation and his willingness to maintain the [[liquidity]] of banks during panics have been praised by [[monetarist]]s and harshly criticized by [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]]&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray, ''America's Great Depression'' (2000), page xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

With the European economic turmoil of the 1920s, Strong's influence became worldwide.  He was a strong supporter of European efforts to return to the gold standard and economic stability.  Strong's new monetary policies not only stabilized U.S. prices, they encouraged both U.S. and world trade by helping to stabilize European currencies and finances.  However, with virtually no inflation, interest rates were low and the U.S. economy and corporate profits surged, fueling the stock market increases of the late 1920s.  This worried him, but he also felt he had no choice because the low interest rates were helping Europeans (particularly Great Britain) in their effort to return to the gold standard.

Economic historian [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] states that Strong was one of the few U.S. policymakers interested in the troubled financial affairs of Europe in the 1920s, and that had he not died in 1928, just a year before the [[Great Depression]], he might have been able to maintain stability in the international financial system;&lt;ref&gt;Kindleberger, Charles, ''[[The World in Depression, 1929-1939]],''(1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Strong died in 1928, the New York Bank lost its energetic leadership.  In the 1930s some of its power was transferred to the Federal Reserve System headquarters in Washington.

==Criticisms==
In 2009, the New York Federal Reserve Bank commissioned a probe into its own practices. David Beim, finance professor at Columbia Business School submitted a report in 2009, released by the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] in 2011, saying "that a number of people he interviewed at the reserve bank believe that supervisors paid excessive deference to banks and, as a result, they were less aggressive in finding issues or in following up on them in a forceful way." &lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|author1=Matthew Boesler and Kathleen Hunter|title=Warren Calls for Hearings on New York Fed Allegations|work=Bloomberg News|date=27 September 2014|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-26/new-york-fed-denies-allegations-of-bank-supervision-lapse.html|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Stephen Friedman (PFIAB)|Stephen Friedman]]'s resignation on 7 May 2009, Denis Hughes, formerly Deputy Chair, was designated as Interim Chair. The current Chair (for 2013) is Emily Rafferty, President of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

In 2012, [[Carmen Segarra]], then New York Fed bank examiner, told her superiors that [[Goldman Sachs]] had no policy governing conflicts of interest. She was "fired in May 2012 after refusing to change her findings on the conflict-of-interest policy and sued the New York Fed October 2013".

In April 2014 the U.S. District court in Manhattan dismissed the case, "ruling that Segarra failed to make a legally sufficient claim under the [[whistle-blower]] protections of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]]".&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

In September 2014, Segarra´s secretly recorded conversations were aired by ''[[This American Life]]'' and the New York Fed was accused of political corruption by being a "captured agency", ''i.e.'', subject to [[regulatory capture]], of the banks which it supervises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Secret Recordings of Carmen Segarra|work=[[This American Life]]|date=26 September 2014|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/536/the-secret-recordings-of-carmen-segarra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside the New York Fed: Secret Recordings and a Culture Clash|first=Jake|last=Bernstein|date=26 September 2014|work=ProPublica.org|publisher=[[ProPublica]]|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/carmen-segarras-secret-recordings-from-inside-new-york-fed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the first ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' movie, the "meeting of the Dons" scene uses the Federal Reserve building exterior, even though the interior of another New York building (the Penn Central railway boardroom) was also used for filming.

In the 1974 film ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]'' hijackers take over a subway train car and demand $1 million for release of the car and 19 passengers, and the city must deliver it to the train car within one hour or the hijackers will start executing passengers at the rate of one per minute until it's delivered. The money for the ransom, to be provided in bundles of used $50 and $100 bills, is frantically assembled by workers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York while a police cruiser waits at the front entrance for it to be assembled for delivery.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York plays a prominent role in the 1995 film ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', starring [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Jeremy Irons]]. The Federal Reserve Bank is the setting for a major heist of the gold by Jeremy Irons' character, Simon Gruber. The vault is penetrated under the pretense of construction work and the gold bullion transported via dump trucks to a location outside the city.

== Early life ==
Tiu was born in [[Iloilo City]], [[Iloilo]], [[Philippines]] to Luz Tiu (née Hupan) and Fernando Tiu, a wealthy family of Chinese descent, who were successful, self-made traders who operated a candy store in Iloilo, throughout the 1950s'''.''' Felix's grandparents were Chinese immigrants, with ancestral ties from the Fujian province, who migrated to the Philippines due to business opportunities in the 1900s.

Tiu's father's business shut down because of mismanagement due to [[overexpansion]], resulting in Felix, the eldest of four, to drop out of private school in 1974 to assist in the re-enterprising of his father's business.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/business-life/592238/eon-groups-felix-tiu-dont-work-money-let-money-work-you|title=Eon Group's Felix Tiu: 'Don't work for money, let money work for you'|last=|first=|date=|work=philstar.com|access-date=2017-03-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, at 23, he married Bernadette Tiu, (née Chavez) and a fast growing family did not come far after: by 1987, Felix and Bernadette already had 4 children. During the early years of assistance in the restoration of his father's business, Felix and his wife, Bernadette, having to provide for their young family, sold homemade [[Tamarind|tamarind balls]], [[Halo-halo|halo halo]] and other local sweets on the streets of Iloilo City&lt;!-- cite needed --&gt;, to cope with financial struggles after the disperse of his father's fortune.

== Career ==

=== 1980s-2000s: Early Career ===
Upon the aftermath of the failed reestablishment of his father's confectionery business, Tiu and his wife founded their own trading company, in 1985, [http://www.yellow-pages.ph/business/goldstar-phil-traders-bakery-supplies Goldstar Philippine Traders], selling oil, flour, [[margarine]], and other baking goods using his savings of 10,000₱ from previous business ventures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Felix opened [https://www.emis.com/php/company-profile/PH/Eon_Philippines_Industries_Corp__2341988.html Eon Philippines Industries Corporation], in 1995, which manufactured various local staples like [[bihon]] and [[sotanghon]] as well as flavoured juices, with [[lollipop]]s being the main product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This venture was established as a reminiscent to Felix's father's business&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, then in 1998, Felix opened a travel and tourism agency called [http://eontraveltours.com/ Eon Travel and Tours] in SM City Iloilo.

In 1991, with a vision to provide "market vendors a chance at their businesses"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and to support other local businesses, Tiu ventured into low interest lending and in 5 years has created a "very modest lending portfolio".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 2000s-2010s: ''Eon Group of Companies'' and Local Ventures ===
At the turn of the millennium, in 2000, Tiu purchased a property and constructed the [https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-s1-g298466-d1603495-Reviews-Eon_Centennial_Plaza_Hotel-Iloilo_City_Iloilo_Province_Panay_Island_Visayas.html Eon Centennial Plaza Hotel], which is now known as "one of the leading business hotels in the heart of Iloilo"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, accommodating restaurants such as Frances.

Eon Realty Development Corporation started in 2001 and has built over 3,000 homes to date, with families in the low-medium income bracket as their target market. As of 2017, they encompass over 12 housing and [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] projects and became the first company to build on [[townhouses]] in Iloilo&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

In 2004, Eon Group of Companies branched out into developing neighboring islands, launching Guimaras Memorial Park in [[Guimaras]], Philippines.

In 2006, Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center was erected in [[Jaro, Iloilo City]], which housed a convention center to hold up to 3,000 people&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.exploreiloilo.com/stay/info/centennial-resort-hotel-and-convention-center/|title=Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center|work=Explore Iloilo|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [http://www.exploreiloilo.com/ Exploreiloilo.com] has named Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center "a first class year-round family destination"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The announcement of Waterworld Iloilo resulted in the revision of the convention center, leading the enterprise to change its name to Centennial Resort Hotel and Waterpark. 

=== 2010s-present: ''Waterworld'' Franchise and Nation-wide Ventures ===
In 2013, Felix opened the first ''paninda and paluto'' style restaurant in Iloilo, Merkado Seafood Restaurant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iloilometropolitantimes.com/merkado-the-dampa-of-iloilo/|title=Merkado, the dampa of Iloilo {{!}} Iloilo Metropolitan Times|last=Khariza|first=Sofia Joy|date=November 10, 2013|website=www.iloilometropolitantimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' where an inclusive wet market allows fresh seafood, meat and vegetables to be purchased, with the customer deciding how it is to be cooked. Due to [[Typhoon Yolanda]]'s impact on [[Panay|Panay']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s fresh seafood supply, infection led to the restaurant closing its doors on November that year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iloilometropolitantimes.com/frances-tiu-and-waterworld-keeping-the-family-business-on-track/|title=Frances Tiu and Waterworld: Keeping the family business on track {{!}} Iloilo Metropolitan Times|website=www.iloilometropolitantimes.com|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Waterworld Iloilo was announced in 2015, to replace the convention center constructed under the then-named, Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center in [[Jaro, Iloilo City]]. It opened on December 16, 2017 and became Philippines' first solar-powered waterpark&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; . It comprises over 20 different slides and rides, 2 pools, 8 luxury cabanas, 3 restaurants, a [[Gift shop|souvenir and novelty shop]], and a [[lazy river]] which surrounds the perimeter of the park. Waterworld Iloilo has been featured in various media outlets such as Panay News, The Guardian, The Iloilo Metropolitan Times, Island Living and Hugging Horizons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hugginghorizons.com/travel-2/waterworld-iloilo-grown-ups-playground-rates-virtual-tour/|title=WATERWORLD ILOILO: a Grown ups Playground (Rates + Virtual Tour)|date=2016-12-04|work=Hugging Horizons|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Due to the overwhelming success of Waterworld Iloilo&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, Felix Tiu announced that the Eon Group of Companies will expand the Waterworld franchise into Mandaue, Cebu. The project, known as Waterworld Cebu, will be valued at over 350 million pesos, making it one of the most expensive waterparks in the Philippines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripzilla.ph/waterworld-cebu-complex/3839|title=A New Exciting Waterworld Complex Set to Open in Cebu Soon|website=www.tripzilla.ph|language=en-PH|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Not only will it be one of the largest waterparks in the Philippines, the 3-hectare project will boast as a major entertainment complex, housing a large amusement park, and resort. It is set to open late 2019.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Financial mismanagement''' is management that, deliberately or not, is handled in a way that can be characterized as "wrong, bad, careless, inefficient or incompetent" and that will reflect negatively upon the financial standing of a business or individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/mismanagement|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways of how financial mismanagement is carried out. For example, the wrong distribution of responsibility, to be remiss with payments, [[Invoice|bills]] and taxes and neglecting responsibility, financial problems and economical standing can cause great financial mismanagement and further on devastate your [[economy]]. By looking to various cases where the financial management has gone wrong we will be able to comprehend the effect financial mismanagement can have and how crucial it is for an economy´s success to carry out well working financial management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dealing With Personal Financial Mismanagement|url=http://moneystartinfo.com/2013/01/22/dealing-with-personal-financial-mismanagement/|publisher=MoneyStartInfo|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Financial management has always been key to a [[Goal|successful]] [[business]], and is crucial for an economy to function. There are not only companies and [[individuals]] that have economies that rely on financial management but also entire [[societies]] and [[countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Management|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/21926|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* From 2007 till 2015 the Feyenoord company "list en bedrog" was responsible  for the financial mismanagement inside the top of the direction. Eric Gudde also called the "self employed dictator of the republic Feyenoord-Korea" ([[portmanteau]] of "Feyenoord" and "Noord-Korea", [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "[[North Korea]]"). Together with Martin van Geel he was responsible  for destroying the total club. During this period there were no consequences for the two self-employed dictators of the republic Feyenoord-Korea. 
Throughout the years there have been infinite companies, persons and also countries that have been declared bankrupt, caused by financial mismanagement. By taking a look at some of the worlds largest economies we can find cases where the [[financial management]] has somehow gone wrong and will depict how severe the effect of financial mismanagement can actually lead out to be. 
* [[Argentina]], with its many natural resources, well-educated workforce and export-oriented agricultural sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina- Country Profile|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/1192478.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is today Latin America´s third largest [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina|url=http://icma.org/en/international/regions/Country/1013/Argentina|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Argentine economy has been through quite a few ups and downs. In 2001 this led to a severe [[recession]] and ever-increasing poverty.

* By the end of 2009 Greece experienced one of the most severe economical collapses in today's society. The crisis had severe results and for instance resulted in great public poverty.

There are numerous examples of where [[finance]]s are not managed right and where companies, individuals and even countries are liquidated, and even more examples where there has been episodes of financial mismanagement but the situation was still able to be escaped.

==Prevention==
Financial mismanagement will always be a possible [[problem]], for businesses, individuals and also entire countries. To prevent personal financial mismanagement it is important to have financial education from an early age. For a [[business]] to succeed in their [[finances]] it is crucial to [[employ]] people with the right qualifications and experiences and to continuously appraise the financial state within the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waters|first1=Maxine|title=How to Prevent Another Financial Crisis|url=http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/how-to-prevent-another-financial-crisis-1062243-1.html|publisher=American Banker|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation''' ('''FIBAA''') is recognised accreditation body in all [[German speaking countries]] (Germany-Switzerland-Austria), FIBAA was founded in 2002 to accredit schools of [[business administration|business]]. Since the launch of the European [[Bologna Process]], along with the transition to bachelor's and master's programs and the growing independence available to [[higher education]] institutions (HEIs) in designing their degree programs, the call for the HEIs to establish and advance sound and transparent quality assurance systems has grown continuously.

When the accreditation system was established in [[Germany]], FIBAA was founded in 1994 and hence became one of the first agencies to be accredited by the German Accreditation Council. Since 2002, it has been entitled to award the Seal of the Accreditation Council for degree programs in Germany. The FIBAA is organized as a non-profit organization and is headquartered in [[Bonn]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]] as well FIBAA is registered in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]

The FIBAA Foundation Council is the leading board of the foundation. It defines and represents the common interests of the founders and decides on the economic and strategic baselines of FIBAA's work. The FIBAA Foundation Council assures that FIBAA's mission is well established in society and its institutions and promotes FIBAA's overall values of transparency, quality and internationality in the field of higher education.

== International activities ==

==History==
Even before the Bologna Declaration announced by the European ministers responsible for higher education in 1999 and the resulting introduction of today's quality assurance systems, it became necessary to develop a suitable form of quality testing due to the confusing range of [[MBA]] programs that had developed in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Hence, the leading organisations of Swiss, Austrian and German industry established the Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation (FIBAA) in autumn 1994 as an international non-profit foundation. Right from day one, the intention was to develop a strict assessment guide for quality assurance in the field of management training.

Since its founding, FIBAA has established itself as a quality assurance agency which assesses degree programs, HEIs and their quality management. It examines and promotes German and foreign state and state-recognised private HEIs and [[universities]].

==Accreditation objectives==
The accreditation of degree programs is an internationally established quality assurance process in the higher education sector. It serves to maintain fundamental [[Requirement|standards]] in terms of the content and structural design of educational offerings, to secure the comparability of various study offerings at national and international level, and to facilitate the international recognition of academic achievements and degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fibaa.org/en/fibaa.html FIBAA About us]&lt;/ref&gt;

FIBAA's work is shaped by an intensive quality process in close cooperation with the HEIs, whose goals are, on the one hand, to improve their quality and, on the other, to provide a successful, accreditation, certification or evaluation process.

FIBAA considers itself a non-profit quality assurance agency committed to the following goals:
* Securing and improving quality in the higher education sector,
* Contributing to the transparency of studies offered for the employment market, for students, companies, and for the HEIs themselves,
* Collaborating in the elaboration of principles for the quality process in the national and international education sector,
* Taking into consideration European and international concepts and guidelines in the field of quality assurance in the higher education sector, and
* Applying transparent combinations of information, quality standards and procedural principles.

The '''global financial system''' is the worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal [[agent (economics)|economic actors]] that together facilitate international flows of [[financial capital]] for purposes of [[investment]] and [[trade finance|trade financing]]. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of [[economic globalization]], its evolution is marked by the establishment of [[central bank]]s, [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[treaty|treaties]], and [[intergovernmental organization]]s aimed at improving the [[transparency (market)|transparency]], [[financial regulation|regulation]], and effectiveness of international markets.&lt;ref name="James &amp; Patomaki 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Globalization and Economy, Vol. 2: Globalizing Finance and the N tennis ball taste like bacon ew Economy | author = James, Paul W. | authorlink = Paul James (academic) | author2 = Patomäki, Heikki | year = 2007 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-1-4129-1952-4| url = https://www.academia.edu/4211923/Globalization_and_Economy_Vol._2_Global_Finance_and_the_New_Global_Economy_editor_with_Heikki_Patomaki_Sage_Publications_London_2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Capitals of Capital: A History of International Financial Centres, 1780–2005 | author = Cassis, Youssef | year = 2006 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | isbn = 978-0-511-33522-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=geEzo9s9QbUC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;pg=PA347#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref name="Flandreau et al. 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial History in the Twentieth Century: System and Anarchy | author = Flandreau, Marc | author2 = Holtfrerich, Carl-Ludwig | author3 = James, Harold | year = 2003 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | isbn = 978-0-511-07011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of [[World War I]], trade contracted as [[foreign exchange market]]s became paralyzed by [[money market]] illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening the effects of the global [[Great Depression]] until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the [[international monetary systems|international monetary system]] after [[World War II]] improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.

A series of currency devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The [[world economy]] became increasingly [[financial integration|financially integrated]] in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of [[financial crisis|financial crises]] in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile [[capital (economics)|capital flows]]. The [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]], which originated in the United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide [[Great Recession]]. A market adjustment to Greece's noncompliance with its [[currency union|monetary union]] in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the [[European debt crisis|Eurozone crisis]].

A country's decision to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications captured by the [[balance of payments]]. It also renders exposure to risks in [[international finance]], such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for property rights and investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the global financial system. Consumers and [[international business]]es undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs.

While the global financial system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.

===Emergence of financial globalization: 1870–1914===

The world experienced substantial changes in the late 19th century which created an environment favorable to an increase in and development of [[financial centre|international financial centers]]. Principal among such changes were unprecedented growth in capital flows and the resulting rapid financial center integration, as well as faster communication. Before 1870, [[London]] and [[Paris]] existed as the world's only prominent financial centers.&lt;ref name=Cassis2005&gt;{{cite book|title=London and Paris as International Financial Centres in the Twentieth Century|date=2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191533471|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W5RfAlbhtswC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Soon after, [[Berlin]] and [[New York City|New York]] grew to become major centres providing [[financial services]] for their national economies. An array of smaller international financial centers became important as they found [[market niche]]s, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Zurich]], and [[Geneva]]. London remained the leading international financial center in the four decades leading up to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|74–75}}&lt;ref name="Cameron &amp; Bovykin 1991"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Banking: 1870–1914 | editor = Cameron, Rondo | editor2 = Bovykin, V.I. | year = 1991 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-19-506271-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ItqhNQusviAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–15}}

The first modern wave of [[economic globalization]] began during the period of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of [[human migration|migration]], enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|75}} During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them.&lt;ref name="Benedictus 2006"&gt;{{Cite news | title = A brief history of the passport | author = Benedictus, Leo | date = 2006-11-16 | publisher = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/nov/17/travelnews | accessdate = 2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the [[United Nations]]' [[International Civil Aviation Organization]].&lt;ref name="Passport Canda 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = International Civil Aviation Organization: A trusted international authority | publisher = Passport Canada | url = http://passport.gc.ca/eppt/role.aspx?lang=eng | accessdate = 2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the [[United States]], while most of the rest reached [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[Brazil]]. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of [[steamboat|steam-powered boats]] over traditional [[sailing ship]]s. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo [[tonnage]] surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the [[telephone]] and [[wireless telegraphy]] (the precursor to [[radio]]) revolutionized [[telecommunication]] by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and [[Asia]] became connected through new [[landline]]s.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|75–76}}&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics, 10th Edition | author = Carbaugh, Robert J. | year = 2005 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 978-0-324-52724-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Economic globalization grew under [[free trade]], starting in 1860 when the [[United Kingdom]] entered into a [[free trade area|free trade agreement]] with [[France]] known as the [[Cobden–Chevalier Treaty]]. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to [[protectionism]] between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] introduced [[German tariff of 1879|protective tariffs]] on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making [[Germany]] the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the [[Méline tariff]], greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, [[international trade]] continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

Unprecedented growth in foreign investment from the 1880s to the 1900s served as the core driver of financial globalization. The worldwide total of capital invested abroad amounted to [[US$]]44 billion in 1913 ($1.02 trillion in 2012 dollars&lt;ref name="BLS 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = CPI Inflation Calculator | publisher = U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | url = http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm | accessdate = 2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with the greatest share of foreign assets held by the United Kingdom (42%), France (20%), Germany (13%), and the United States (8%). The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[Switzerland]] together held foreign investments on par with Germany at around 12%.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

====Panic of 1907====
{{Main|Panic of 1907}}
{{See also|List of banking crises}}
[[Image:1907 Panic.png|thumb|upright|A crowd forms on [[Wall Street]] during the [[Panic of 1907]].]]
In October 1907, the United States experienced a [[bank run]] on the [[Knickerbocker Trust Company]], forcing the trust to close on October 23, 1907, provoking further reactions. The panic was alleviated when [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[George B. Cortelyou]] and [[John Pierpont Morgan|John Pierpont "J.P." Morgan]] deposited $25 million and $35 million, respectively, into the reserve banks of New York City, enabling withdrawals to be fully covered. The bank run in New York led to a [[money market]] crunch which occurred simultaneously as demands for [[credit (finance)|credit]] heightened from cereal and grain exporters. Since these demands could only be serviced through the purchase of substantial quantities of gold in London, the international markets became exposed to the crisis. The [[Bank of England]] had to sustain an artificially high [[discount window|discount lending]] rate until 1908. To service the flow of gold to the United States, the Bank of England organized a pool from among twenty-four different nations, for which the [[Banque de France]] temporarily lent £3 million ([[Pound sterling|GBP]], 305.6 million in 2012 GBP&lt;ref name="BOE 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Inflation Calculator | publisher = Bank of England | url = http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/flash/default.aspx | accessdate = 2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in gold.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|123–124}}

====Birth of the U.S. Federal Reserve System: 1913====
{{Main|Federal Reserve System}}
The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Federal Reserve Act]] in 1913, giving rise to the Federal Reserve System. Its inception drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a [[lender of last resort]]. The system's design also considered the findings of the [[Pujo Committee]]'s investigation of the possibility of a [[money trust]] in which [[Wall Street]]'s concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which [[investment banking|investment bankers]] were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the [[board of directors|directorates]] of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' [[money supply]] during significant shifts in [[demand for money|money demand]]. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to [[rediscount]] facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive [[money market#discount and accrual instruments|discount market]].&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|123–124}}&lt;ref name="Cameron &amp; Bovykin 1991" /&gt;{{rp|53}}&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Foreign Exchange Market of London: Development since 1900 | author = Atkin, John | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-203-32269-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2013"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Fed in 2008 Showed Panic of 1907 Was Excessive: Cutting Research | author = Kennedy, Simon | date = 2013-05-09 | publisher = Bloomberg | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/fed-in-2008-showed-panic-of-1907-was-excessive-cutting-research.html | accessdate = 2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar period: 1915–1944===
{{See also|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|World War I reparations|}}
[[Image:German infantry 1914 HD-SN-99-02296.JPEG|thumb|German infantry crossing a battlefield in France in August 1914.]]
[[Image:4th Bn Royal Fusiliers 22 August 1914.jpg|thumb|British soldiers resting before the [[Battle of Mons]] with German troops along the French border in August 1914.]]
Economists have referred to the onset of World War I as the end of an age of innocence for [[foreign exchange market]]s, as it was the first [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's [[Western Front (World War I)#1914—German invasion of France and Belgium|invasion of France and Belgium]]. In the weeks prior, the [[foreign exchange market]] in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing [[political risk|political uncertainty]] motivated investors to chase [[market liquidity|liquidity]], prompting [[commercial bank]]s to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their [[bank reserves|reserves]] at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for [[remittance]] to London just to pay off their newly [[maturity (finance)|maturing]] [[security (finance)|securities]], the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the [[French franc]] after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record [[exchange rate]] of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended [[bank holiday]]s, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]], and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for [[merchant bank]]s receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's [[reserve currency]] and leading [[hard currency|vehicle currency]], market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005" /&gt;{{rp|23–24}}

The [[Government of the United Kingdom|U.K. government]] attempted several measures to revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon the end of the war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military [[weapon|armament]]s, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005" /&gt;{{rp|25–27}}

In 1930, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] established the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS). The principal purposes of the BIS were to manage the scheduled payment of Germany's reparations imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, and to function as a bank for central banks around the world. Nations may hold a portion of their reserves as deposits with the institution. It also serves as a forum for central bank cooperation and research on international monetary and financial matters. The BIS also operates as a general trustee and facilitator of financial settlements between nations.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|182}}&lt;ref name="Levi 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-30900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|531–532}}&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Managing International Financial Instability: National Tamers versus Global Tigers | author = Saccomanni, Fabrizio | year = 2008 | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing Limited | location = Cheltenham, UK | isbn = 978-1-84542-142-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56–57}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics, 6th Edition | author = Dunn, Robert M., Jr. | author2 = Mutti, John H. | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-31154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|269}}

====Smoot–Hawley tariff of 1930====
{{Main|Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act}}
U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] signed the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's aim was to protect agriculture in the United States, but [[Member of Congress|congressional representatives]] ultimately raised tariffs on a host of manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs on a wide range of U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling [[agribusiness]]es and reduce the domestic [[unemployment rate]]. The culmination of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] and the onset of the [[Great Depression]] heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of [[Henry Ford]] and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a [[veto]] of the act.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|175–176}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|186–187}}&lt;ref name="Bagwell &amp; Staiger 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Economics of the World Trading System | author = Bagwell, Kyle | author2 = Staiger, Robert W. | year = 2004 | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 978-0-262-52434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43–44}} Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|118}} Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics: Global Markets and Competition, 2nd Edition | author = Thompson, Henry | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = Toh Tuck Link, Singapore | isbn = 978-981-256-346-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125–126}} The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of [[economic nationalism]], are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="Flandreau et al. 2003" /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006" /&gt;{{rp|108}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 6th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2011 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

====Formal abandonment of the Gold Standard====
{{Main|Gold standard}}
[[Image:Graph charting income per capita throughout the Great Depression.svg|thumb|260px|right|[[Per capita income|Income per capita]] throughout the [[Great Depression]] as viewed from an international perspective. Triangles mark points at which nations abandoned the gold standard by suspending gold convertibility or devaluing their currencies against gold.]]
The classical gold standard was established in 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its [[banknote]]s for gold [[precious metal#Bullion|bullion]]. France, Germany, the United States, [[Russia]], and [[Japan]] each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], Germany, Russia, and [[Poland]] began experiencing [[hyperinflation]]. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from [[fixed exchange-rate system|exchange rate fixing]] and allowed to [[floating exchange rate|float]]. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The early years of the Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on [[gold reserve]]s in the United Kingdom to such a degree that the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the [[Dresdner Bank]] implemented [[foreign exchange controls]] and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and [[Sweden]] abandoned gold. Following widespread [[bank failure]]s and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves, the United States broke free of the gold standard in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Léon Blum]]'s government.&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005" /&gt;{{rp|58}}&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006" /&gt;{{rp|414}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}}

====Trade liberalization in the United States====
{{Main|Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act}}
{{See also|Glass–Steagall Legislation}}
The disastrous effects of the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became the 32nd U.S. president and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of [[trade liberalization]]. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|176–177}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|186–187}}&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006" /&gt;{{rp|108}}

As the inception of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]] for the [[Bretton Woods Conference|United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]], now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant of the effects of the Great Depression, struggles to sustain the [[Gold standard#Depression and World War II|international gold standard]] during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the [[international monetary system]] focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored [[fixed exchange-rate system#Hybrid exchange rate systems|pegged exchange rates]] for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|448}}&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Forex Revolution: An Insider's Guide to the Real World of Foreign Exchange Trading | author = Rosenstreich, Peter | year = 2005 | publisher = Financial Times–Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | isbn = 0-13-148690-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref name="Chen 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Essentials of Foreign Exchange Trading | author = Chen, James | year = 2009 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 978-0-470-39086-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="DeRosa 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Options on Foreign Exchange, 3rd Edition | author = DeRosa, David F. | year = 2011 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 978-1-118-09821-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar.&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;{{rp|491–493}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|296}}&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Multinational Finance | author = Buckley, Adrian | year = 2004 | publisher = Pearson Education Limited | location = Harlow, UK | isbn = 978-0-273-68209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy]] tools before resorting to repegging strategies.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|448}}&lt;ref name="Wang 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Economics of Foreign Exchange and Global Finance | author = Wang, Peijie | year = 2005 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany | isbn = 978-3-540-21237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively [[volatility (finance)|volatile]] exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the [[deflation]]ary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|448}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Governing Global Finance: The Evolution and Reform of the International Financial Architecture | author = Elson, Anthony | year = 2011 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-230-10378-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}}&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Globalizing Capital: A History of the International Monetary System, 2nd Edition | author = Eichengreen, Barry | year = 2008 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, NJ | isbn = 978-0-691-13937-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|91}}&lt;ref name="Bordo 2000"&gt;{{Cite conference | title = The Globalization of International Financial Markets: What Can History Teach Us? | conference = International Financial Markets: The Challenge of Globalization.

An important component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of [[gross world product]], from which emergency loans could be issued.&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="Shamah 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = A Foreign Exchange Primer | author = Shamah, Shani | year = 2003 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester, West Sussex, England | isbn = 0-470-85162-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–10}}&lt;ref name="Thirkell-White 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The IMF and the Politics of Financial Globalization: From the Asian Crisis to a New International Financial Architecture? | author = Thirkell-White, Ben | year = 2005 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4039-2078-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–22}} Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ [[capital control]]s as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|38}} While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects.&lt;ref name="Endres 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Great Architects of International Finance | author = Endres, Anthony M. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-32412-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone in the evolution of the international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Future of the International Monetary System | editor = Uzan, Marc | year = 2005 | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing Limited | location = Northampton, MA | isbn = 1-84376-805-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}} Since the establishment of the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the [[World Bank]].

====General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: 1947====
{{Main|General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade}}
{{See also|List of free trade agreements|List of international trade topics}}
In 1947, 23 countries concluded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended the agreement to suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body to be known as the [[International Trade Organization]] (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the ''de facto'' framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains.&lt;ref name="Bagwell &amp; Staiger 2004" /&gt;{{rp|46}} The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services.&lt;ref name="Bryant 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Crisis Prevention and Prosperity Management for the World Economy | author = Bryant, Ralph C. | year = 2004 | publisher = Brookings Institution Press | location = Washington, D.C. | isbn = 0-8157-0867-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and [[export subsidy|subsidizing]] non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs.&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;{{rp|460}} The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006" /&gt;{{rp|108}} However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements.&lt;ref name="Makin 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Global Imbalances, Exchange Rates and Stabilization Policy | author = Makin, Anthony J. | year = 2009 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-230-57685-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70–71}} The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|99}}

===Resurgence of financial globalization===

====Flexible exchange rate regimes: 1973-present====
[[Image:Reserves of foreign exchange and gold.PNG|thumb|400px|World reserves of foreign exchange and gold in billions of U.S. dollars in 2009.]]
Although the exchange rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade.&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;{{rp|22}} The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was [[valuation risk|overvalued]]. Belgian-American economist [[Robert Triffin]] defined this problem now known as the [[Triffin dilemma]], in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005" /&gt;{{rp|34–35}}

France voiced concerns over the artificially low price of gold in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the [[Vietnam War]]. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first [[current account]] deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold as part of the [[Nixon Shock]]. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar. These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates.&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005" /&gt;{{rp|34–35}}&lt;ref name="Yadav 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Risk in International Finance | author = Yadav, Vikash | year = 2008 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-77519-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, the dollar price of gold was raised to $38 USD per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the [[Smithsonian Agreement]] signed by the [[Group of Ten (economic)|G-10]] members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system's demise for a further two years.&lt;ref name="DeRosa 2011" /&gt;{{rp|6–7}} The system's erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred, but also by the [[1970s energy crisis|oil crises of the 1970s]] which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in [[petrodollar recycling]] and balance of payments financing. Once the world's reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|5–7}}

=====The post-Bretton Woods financial order: 1976=====
{{See also|International Monetary Fund}}
[[Image:IMF HQ.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in Washington, D.C.]]
As part of the first amendment to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"/&gt;{{rp|34–35}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|50–51}}&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|117}}&lt;ref name="Shamah 2003" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion [[ISO 4217|XDR]] from 1970 to 1972.&lt;ref name="Endres 2005" /&gt;{{rp|182–183}}

IMF members signed the [[Jamaica Agreement]] in January 1976, which ratified the end of the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank [[economic interventionism|interventions]] aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently [[legal tender#Demonetisation|demonetized]] its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing [[conditionality]] on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"/&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;ref name="Thirkell-White 2005" /&gt;{{rp|47–48}}&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Globalization and Its Discontents | author = Stiglitz, Joseph E. | year = 2003 | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-393-32439-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–13}}

The second amendment to the articles of agreement was signed in 1978. It legally formalized the free-floating acceptance and gold demonetization achieved by the Jamaica Agreement, and required members to support stable exchange rates through macroeconomic policy. The post-Bretton Woods system was decentralized in that member states retained autonomy in selecting an exchange rate regime. The amendment also expanded the institution's capacity for oversight and charged members with supporting monetary sustainability by cooperating with the Fund on regime implementation.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|62–63}}&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|138}} This role is called IMF surveillance and is recognized as a pivotal point in the evolution of the Fund's mandate, which was extended beyond balance of payments issues to broader concern with internal and external stresses on countries' overall economic policies.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|148}}&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|10–11}}

Under the dominance of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars&lt;ref name="BLS 2013" /&gt;) as a result of the dollar's strong appreciation. The [[Group of Five|G5]] met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the [[Plaza Accord]]. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now [[G8]]) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the [[Louvre Accord]]. This accord became the provenance of the [[managed float regime]] by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the [[Dot-com bubble]]. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the [[September 11 attacks]] increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|175}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"/&gt;{{rp|36–37}}&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005" /&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|147}}&lt;ref name="Reszat 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Japanese Foreign Exchange Market | author = Reszat, Beate | year = 2003 | publisher = Routledge | location = New Fetter Lane, London | isbn = 0-203-22254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=====European Monetary System: 1979=====
{{Main|European Monetary System}}
Following the Smithsonian Agreement, member states of the [[European Economic Community]] adopted a narrower [[currency band]] of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the ''[[snake in the tunnel]]''. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of [[European Union]] members' currencies, and the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values.&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005" /&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|42–44}}&lt;ref name="Steiner 2002"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Theory, Practice and Risk Management | author = Steiner, Bob | year = 2002 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Woburn, MA | isbn = 0-7506-5025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185}} The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that [[currency pair]] were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value.&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;{{rp|496–497}}&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;{{rp|29–30}} The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|160}} During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.&lt;ref name="DeRosa 2011" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The [[Uruguay Round]] of GATT [[multilateral trade negotiations]] took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the [[Marrakech Agreement]] signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|181}}&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;{{rp|459–460}}&lt;ref name="Bagwell &amp; Staiger 2004" /&gt;{{rp|47}} In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.&lt;ref name="WTO News 1999"&gt;{{Cite press release | title = The WTO's financial services commitments will enter into force as scheduled | author = World Trade Organization | date = 1999-02-15 | publisher = WTO News | url = http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr120_e.htm | accessdate = 2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial integration among industrialized nations grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|15}} Integration among financial markets and banks rendered benefits such as greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy.

Following research of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists have reached a consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust [[bank regulation]]s, and strong legal protection of [[property rights (economics)|property rights]]. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging [[foreign direct investment]], liberalizing domestic [[equity (finance)|equity capital]], and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|113}} An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency in the eyes of both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and [[sudden stop (economics)|sudden stop]]s, which carry serious economic and social costs.&lt;ref name="Yadav 2008" /&gt;{{rp|xii}}

Countries sought to improve the sustainability and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the [[Basel Accords]]. The first of these accords, known as [[Basel I]], took place in 1988 and emphasized [[credit risk]] and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the [[Latin American debt crisis|1980s Latin American debt crisis]]. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new [[capital requirement]]s for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the [[Financial Stability Forum]] (reconstituted by the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] in 2009 as the [[Financial Stability Board]]) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|222–223}}&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|12}} The [[Basel II]] accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk as well as the need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|486–488}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|160–162}} In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as [[Basel III]], which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|274}}&lt;ref name="Hamilton &amp; Onaran 2013"&gt;{{Cite news | title = U.S. Boosts Bank Capital Demands Above Global Standards | author = Hamilton, Jesse | author2 = Onaran, Yalman | date = 2013-07-09 | publisher = Bloomberg | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-09/u-s-banks-may-face-two-ratios-as-fdic-sets-capital-vote.html | accessdate = 2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth of the European Economic and Monetary Union 1992====
{{Main|Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union}}

In February 1992, European Union countries signed the [[Maastricht Treaty]] which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the [[European Monetary Institute]] which was ultimately dissolved in tandem with the establishment in 1998 of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and [[European System of Central Banks]]. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of [[euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the [[Euro]], adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they [[disaggregated sovereignty|disaggregated]] their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. {{As of|2011}}, the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|473–474}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|45–4}}&lt;ref name="DeRosa 2011" /&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;ref name="Steiner 2002" /&gt;{{rp|185–186}}

====Global financial crisis====
{{Main|Financial crisis of 2007–08|Great Recession}}
Following the market turbulence of the 1990s financial crises and [[September 11 attacks]] on the U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s and [[structured product|structured finance product]]s. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily in the form of short-term [[money market]] instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders in the wake of the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999]] which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by [[global imbalances]] which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|129–130}}

The global financial crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared some of the key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, [[herd behavior]] during investment [[economic bubble|bubbles]], collapsing asset prices, and massive [[deleveraging]]. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|133–134}} Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing [[securitization]] of [[non-performing asset]]s, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|18–20}}&lt;ref name="Makin 2009" /&gt;{{rp|21–22}} While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the [[global recession|global economic downturn]] now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The global financial crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.&lt;ref name="Arndt et al. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The implications of integration for globalization | journal = North American Journal of Economics and Finance | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | year = 2009 | pages = 83–90 | author = Arndt, Sven W. | author2 = Crowley, Patrick M. | author3 = Mayes, David G. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940809000229 | accessdate = 2011-11-30 | doi=10.1016/j.najef.2009.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence et al. 2012"&gt;{{Cite report | title = The Global Enabling Trade Report 2012: Reducing Supply Chain Barriers | publisher = World Economic Forum | date = 2012 | author = Lawrence, Robert Z. | author2 = Hanouz, Margareta Drzeniek | author3 = Doherty, Sean | url = http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GETR/2012/GlobalEnablingTrade_Report.pdf | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

====Eurozone crisis====
{{Main|European debt crisis|Great Recession in Europe}}
In 2009, a newly elected government in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, and that its fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP as opposed to the 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the [[eurozone]]'s maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's [[Stability and Growth Pact]]. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the [[PIGS (economics)|PIGS]]). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of [[refinancing]] or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery in the wake of the Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion [[bailout]] for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Minister of Finance]] [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|12–14}}&lt;ref name="Krugman et al. 2012"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics: Theory &amp; Policy, 9th Edition | author = Krugman, Paul R. | author2 = Obstfeld, Maurice | author3 = Melitz, Marc J. | year = 2012 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 978-0-13-214665-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|579–581}}

==Implications of globalized capital==

===Balance of payments===
{{Main|Balance of payments}}
[[Image:TopFiveCurrentAccountImbalancesOECD2012.png|thumb|right|The top five annual current account deficits and surpluses in billions of U.S. dollars for the year 2012 based on data from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].]]
The balance of payments accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The balance of payments is a function of three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the [[current account]], transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the [[financial account]], and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the [[capital account]].&lt;ref name="Krugman et al. 2012" /&gt;{{rp|306–307}} The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|66–71}}&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Macroeconomics | author = Feenstra, Robert C. | author2 = Taylor, Alan M. | year = 2008 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4292-0691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169–172}}&lt;ref name="Madura 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management: Abridged 8th Edition | author = Madura, Jeff | year = 2007 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 0-324-36563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–35}}

Because the balance of payments sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates the extent to which a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, the balance of payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|73}}&lt;ref name="Krugman et al. 2012" /&gt;{{rp|308–313}}&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;{{rp|203}} A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.&lt;ref name="Thirlwall 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = The balance of payments constraint as an explanation of international growth rate differences | author = Thirlwall, A.P. | encyclopedia = Essays on Balance of Payments Constrained Growth: Theory and Evidence | editor = McCombie, J.S.L. | editor2 = Thirlwall, A.P. | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = London, UK | isbn = 0-203-49536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–22}}

A country's external wealth is measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by [[capital gain]]s and [[capital loss]]es on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or [[creditor]]) in the [[world economy]], while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or [[debtor]]).&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;{{rp|13,210}}

===Unique financial risks===
{{Main|Systemic risk}}
Nations and international businesses face an array of [[financial risk]]s unique to foreign investment activity. [[Political risk]] is the potential for losses from a foreign country's [[failed state|political instability]] or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|422}} Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to [[expropriation|expropriate]] or [[nationalization|nationalize]] foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;{{rp|14–17}} Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|425,526}}&lt;ref name="Melvin &amp; Norrbin 2013"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Money and Finance, 8th Edition | author = Melvin, Michael | author2 = Norrbin, Stefan C. | year = 2013 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Waltham, MA | isbn = 978-0-12-385247-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|216}}

==Participants==

===Economic actors===
{{See also|List of multinational corporations|List of investment banks}}
Each of the core economic functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} [[Consumer]]s, [[multinational corporations]], individual and [[institutional investors]], and [[financial intermediaries]] (such as [[bank]]s) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the [[European Central Bank]] or the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]]) undertake [[open market operation]]s in their efforts to realize monetary policy goals.&lt;ref name="Chen 2009" /&gt;{{rp|13–15}}&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;{{rp|11–13,76}} [[International financial institutions]] such as the [[international financial institutions#Bretton Woods institutions|Bretton Woods institutions]], [[international financial institutions#Multilateral development bank|multilateral development banks]] and other [[development finance institution]]s provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|243}} Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, [[Institute of International Finance]], and the [[World Federation of Exchanges]] attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.&lt;ref name="WTO What We Do 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = What we do | publisher = World Trade Organization | url = http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/what_we_do_e.htm | accessdate = 2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IIF About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About IIF | publisher = Institute of International Finance | url = http://www.iif.com/about/ | accessdate = 2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFE About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About WFE | publisher = World Federation of Exchanges | url = http://www.world-exchanges.org/about-wfe | accessdate = 2013-11-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131209064829/http://world-exchanges.org/about-wfe | archivedate = 2013-12-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory bodies===
{{See also|List of financial regulatory authorities by country}}
Explicit goals of financial regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors.&lt;ref name="Yadav 2008" /&gt;{{rp|57}} A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, [[deposit insurance]], emergency financing through discount windows, [[standard accounting practice]]s, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated to establish a host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as [[central government|national government]]s and intergovernmental organizations have the capacity to influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;{{rp|17–21}}

Some degree of [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] occurs whereby banks and other financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral organizations such as the International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System&lt;ref name="BIS CGFS 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Committee on the Global Financial System | publisher = Bank for International Settlements | url = http://www.bis.org/cgfs/ | accessdate = 2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Shamah 2003" /&gt;{{rp|33–34}} Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the [[International Association of Insurance Supervisors]] (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] which facilitates collaboration in battling [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]]; and the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the [[Paris Club]] and [[London Club]].&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities.&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005" /&gt;{{rp|61–64}} Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the [[European Banking Authority]] (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.&lt;ref name="EBA About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About us | publisher = European Banking Authority | url = http://www.eba.europa.eu/about-us | accessdate = 2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESFRC About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) | publisher = Centre for European Policy Studies | url = http://www.ceps.be/content/european-shadow-financial-regulatory-committee-esfrc | accessdate = 2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research organizations and other fora===
Research and academic institutions, professional associations, and think-tanks aim to observe, model, understand, and publish recommendations to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the global financial system. For example, the independent non-partisan [[World Economic Forum]] facilitates the Global Agenda Council on the Global Financial System and Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System, which report on systemic risks and assemble policy recommendations.&lt;ref name="WEF GAC on GFS 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Global Agenda Council on the Global Financial System 2012–2014 | publisher = World Economic Forum | url = http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-agenda-council-global-financial-system-2012-2014 | accessdate = 2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WEF GAC on IMS 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System 2012–2014 | publisher = World Economic Forum | url = http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-agenda-council-international-monetary-system-2012-2014 | accessdate = 2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Financial Markets Association facilitates discussion of global financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world.&lt;ref name="GFMA About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About GFMA | publisher = Global Financial Markets Association | url = http://gfma.org/about/ | accessdate = 2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Group of Thirty]] (G30) formed in 1978 as a private, international group of consultants, researchers, and representatives committed to advancing understanding of [[international economics]] and global finance.&lt;ref name="G30 About"&gt;{{Cite web | title = History of the Group | publisher = Group of Thirty | url = http://www.group30.org/about.shtml | accessdate = 2014-09-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140929134355/http://www.group30.org/about.shtml | archivedate = 2014-09-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of the global financial system==
The IMF has reported that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural [[deleveraging]] in short-term securities and in the [[shadow banking system]] (particularly the [[secondary mortgage market|mortgage market]] and [[real estate investment trust]]s). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth so as not to provoke investor withdrawal.&lt;ref name="IMF GFSR 2013"&gt;{{Cite report | title = Global Financial Stability Report: Transition Challenges to Stability, October 2013 | publisher = International Monetary Fund | date = 2013 | url = http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GETR/2012/GlobalEnablingTrade_Report.pdf | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi-xiii}}

The global financial crisis and Great Recession prompted renewed discourse on the architecture of the global financial system. These events called to attention financial integration, inadequacies of [[global governance]], and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization.&lt;ref name="Wyman 2010"&gt;{{Cite report | title = The Future of the Global Financial System: Navigating the Challenges Ahead | publisher = World Economic Forum | date = 2010 | author = Wyman, Oliver | url = http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FutureGlobalFinancialSystem_Report_2010.pdf | accessdate = 2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–9}} Since the establishment in 1945 of a formal international monetary system with the IMF empowered as its guardian, the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically. This has fundamentally altered the paradigm in which international financial institutions operate, increasing the complexities of the IMF and World Bank's mandates.&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|1–2}} The lack of adherence to a formal monetary system has created a void of global constraints on national macroeconomic policies and a deficit of rule-based governance of financial activities.&lt;ref name="Hieronymi 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Globalization and the Reform of the International Banking and Monetary System | author = Hieronymi, Otto | year = 2009 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-230-23530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} French economist and Executive Director of the World Economic Forum's Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee, Marc Uzan, has pointed out that some radical proposals such as a "global central bank or a world financial authority" have been deemed impractical, leading to further consideration of medium-term efforts to improve transparency and disclosure, strengthen emerging market financial climates, bolster prudential regulatory environments in advanced nations, and better moderate capital account liberalization and exchange rate regime selection in emerging markets. He has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions' resources.&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

The [[Council on Foreign Relations]]' assessment of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, are the two key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded before and after the global financial crisis to the extent that the United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.&lt;ref name="CFR Global Finance Regime 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Global Finance Regime | publisher = Council on Foreign Relations | url = http://www.cfr.org/financial-regulation/global-finance-regime/p20177 | accessdate = 2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform efforts===
Former [[World Bank Chief Economist]] and former Chairman of the U.S. [[Council of Economic Advisers]] [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] referred in the late 1990s to a growing consensus that something is wrong with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great number of people who are hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of [[moral hazard]], particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.&lt;ref name="PBS Stiglitz Interview 1999"&gt;{{Cite interview|author=Stiglitz, Joseph E. |work=Frontline |date=Spring 1999 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/crash/interviews/stiglitz.html |accessdate=2013-12-29 |title=Interviews - Joseph E.

American economist and former [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]] has argued that the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.&lt;ref name="Volcker 2012"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Is global financial reform possible? | author = Volcker, Paul | date = 2012-06-06 | publisher = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/jun/06/global-financial-reform-possible | accessdate = 2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governor of the Bank of England]] and former [[Governor of the Bank of Canada]] [[Mark Carney]] has described two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, as well as better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must bear the burden of financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed "living wills" which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.&lt;ref name="Carney 2009"&gt;{{Cite speech | title = Reforming the global financial system | author = Carney, Mark | event = Rendez-vous avec 'Autorité des marchés financiers | location = Montréal, Québec, Canada | date = 2009-10-26 | url = http://www.bis.org/review/r091028b.pdf | accessdate = 2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:2010 G-20 Seoul summit.jpg|thumb|350px|World leaders at the 2010 G-20 summit in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], endorsed the [[Basel III]] standards for banking regulation.]]
At its [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit|2010 summit]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], the G-20 collectively endorsed a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, and degree of interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts should be made to identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.&lt;ref name="Dombret 2011"&gt;{{Cite speech | title = Reform of the global financial system | author = Dombret, Andreas | event = Generation Forum | location = Eltville, Germany | date = 2011-06-16 | url = http://www.bis.org/review/r110621h.pdf | accessdate = 2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] and Vice Chairman of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] [[William C. Dudley]] has argued that a global financial system regulated on a largely national basis is untenable for supporting a world economy with global financial firms. In 2011, he advocated five pathways to improving the safety and security of the global financial system: a special capital requirement for financial institutions deemed systemically important; a level playing field which discourages exploitation of disparate regulatory environments and [[beggar thy neighbour]] policies that serve "national constituencies at the expense of global financial stability"; superior cooperation among regional and national regulatory regimes with broader protocols for sharing information such as records for the trade of [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] financial derivatives; improved delineation of "the responsibilities of the home versus the host country" when banks encounter trouble; and well-defined procedures for managing emergency liquidity solutions across borders including which parties are responsible for the risk, terms, and funding of such measures.&lt;ref name="Dudley 2011"&gt;{{Cite speech | title = Regulatory reform of the global financial system | author = Dudley, William C. | event = Meeting hosted by the Institute of Regulation &amp; Risk | location = Tokyo, Japan | date = 2011-04-11 | url = http://www.bis.org/review/r110411f.pdf | accessdate = 2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hauppauge Industrial Association''' ('''HIA'''), which has a membership of approximately 1,000 companies throughout [[Long Island]], is a grass-roots, pro-active business organization The HIA had its start in 1978 due to the constant power outages by the Long Island Lighting Company. The catalyst for the formation of the HIA was that communications  with LILCO was poor at best.

HIA focuses on the economic health and well-being of its member companies and that of the entire Long Island [[business]] community.&lt;ref name="liw2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E3D91730F930A25755C0A9629C8B63|title= L.I. @ WORK; Wang Reinvents Himself on Speakers' Circuit|accessdate=2008-03-04|date=2004-06-13|author=Warrten Strugatch|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIA provides services and programs focusing on [[international trade]], [[human resources]], [[business development]], government affairs, [[manufacturing]], [[technology]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[education]], [[engineering]], [[transportation]], and [[energy]].

HIA offers many [[business network|networking]] opportunities at monthly luncheons, educational seminars, [[trade shows]], [[golf]] outings, [[fishing]] and ski trips, holiday parties, etc. In addition, HIA successfully spearheaded an effort to have [[New York State]] construct an exit into the [[Industrial park]] in Hauppauge where more than 60% of its members are located,&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E6D8173CF93AA1575AC0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|title=Pools, Tennis, Clubs and Now, a Child-Care Center|accessdate=2008-03-04|date=1996-09-29|author=Diana Shaman|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Northern State Parkway]]. This exit is used daily by hundreds of business people. It works closely with town, county and state government agencies and departments, to help ensure the safety, health, ease of transportation, and general business assistance for the 1,300 companies and 55,000 employees in the [[Hauppauge, New York#Hauppauge Industrial Park|Hauppauge Industrial Park]].

HIA hosts an annual Business Achievement Awards event where they review and nominate the most successful companies and organizations in Long Island. Past winners and finalists include: [[Allstate Insurance]], Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Community Development Corp., [[American Heart Association]], EAC, Inc., Fuoco Group, [[Grassi &amp; Co.]], H2M, Island Pro Digital, Then Kensington Company, mindSHIFT Technologies, [[Habitat for Humanity]] of Long Island, Middle Country Public Library, Stalco Construction, [[United Way of America|United Way]] of Long Island, VAI, Inc. and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hia-li.org/uploadfiles/HIA-LI%20BAA%20Award%20Finalists%20final.pdf HIA-LI Announces Finalists for Prestigious 19th Annual Business Achievement Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIA has successfully lobbied for the installation of much-needed traffic lights, the repaving or widening of critical roads, stop signs, street lights, [[bicycle lane]]s and a state-of-the-art daycare center. It has arranged for the placement of a [[Suffolk County Police Department]] COPE medical emergency vehicle in the Industrial Park and recent approval by the Suffolk County Legislature to assign a larger vehicle equipped with advanced life-saving equipment.&lt;ref name="liw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903EFDC1F3BF932A2575BC0A9649C8B63|title= L.I. @ WORK; Pulling Communications Into the 21st Century|accessdate=2008-03-04|date=2002-08-11|author=Warrten Strugatch|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scholarships]] for Long Island students attending colleges or trade schools on Long Island are presented annually by HIA.

'''[[Biotechnology]]''' is the application of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services.&lt;ref name="bud"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bud|first1=Robert|last2=Cantley|first2=Mark F.|title=The Uses of Life: A History of Biotechnology|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=9780521476997|pages=1, 6, 7, 30, 133, 135, 138, 141–142, 155, 171–173, 165, 167, 174, 177, &amp; 191|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGFQNf_PcPwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, biotechnology has maintained a close relationship with society. Although now most often associated with the development of [[drug]]s, historically biotechnology has been principally associated with food, addressing such issues as [[malnutrition]] and [[famine]]. The history of [[biotechnology]] begins with [[Zymology|zymotechnology]], which commenced with a focus on [[brewing]] techniques for beer. By World War I, however, zymotechnology would expand to tackle larger industrial issues, and the potential of [[industrial fermentation]] gave rise to biotechnology. However, both the single-cell protein and gasohol projects failed to progress due to varying issues including public resistance, a changing economic scene, and shifts in political power.

Yet the formation of a new field, [[genetic engineering]], would soon bring biotechnology to the forefront of science in society, and the intimate relationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government would ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the [[Asilomar Conference]], where [[Joshua Lederberg]] was the most outspoken supporter for this emerging field in biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the development of synthetic human [[insulin]], Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry grew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising real industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), but this number would skyrocket to over 125 by the end of the 1990s.

The field of genetic engineering remains a heated topic of discussion in today's society with the advent of [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell research]], [[cloning]], and [[genetically modified food]]. While it seems only natural nowadays to link pharmaceutical drugs as solutions to health and societal problems, this relationship of biotechnology serving social needs began centuries ago.

==Origins of biotechnology==
Biotechnology arose from the field of zymotechnology or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better understanding of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, [[brewing]] contributed as much to the gross national product as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government.&lt;ref name="Thackray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thackray|first1=Arnold|title=Private Science: Biotechnology and the Rise of the Molecular Sciences|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812234282|pages=6–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmUX5DUTldwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated to the technology of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.

The heyday and expansion of zymotechnology came in World War I in response to industrial needs to support the war. [[Max Delbrück (chemist)|Max Delbrück]] grew yeast on an immense scale during the war to meet 60 percent of Germany's animal feed needs.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; Compounds of another fermentation product, [[lactic acid]], made up for a lack of hydraulic fluid, [[glycerol]]. On the Allied side the Russian chemist [[Chaim Weizmann]] used starch to eliminate Britain's shortage of [[acetone]], a key raw material for [[cordite]], by fermenting maize to acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Sifniades|first1=Stylianos|last2=Levy|first2=Alan B.|title=Acetone|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_079|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial potential of [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] was outgrowing its traditional home in brewing, and "zymotechnology" soon gave way to "biotechnology."

With food shortages spreading and resources fading, some dreamed of a new industrial solution. The Hungarian [[Károly Ereky]] coined the word "biotechnology" in Hungary during 1919 to describe a technology based on converting raw materials into a more useful product. He built a slaughterhouse for a thousand pigs and also a fattening farm with space for 50,000 pigs, raising over 100,000 pigs a year. The enterprise was enormous, becoming one of the largest and most profitable meat and fat operations in the world. In a book entitled ''Biotechnologie'', Ereky further developed a theme that would be reiterated through the 20th century: biotechnology could provide solutions to societal crises, such as food and energy shortages. For Ereky, the term "biotechnologie" indicated the process by which raw materials could be biologically upgraded into socially useful products.&lt;ref name="Fiechter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiechter|first1=A.|last2=Beppu|first2=T.|title=History of Modern Biotechnology I|date=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540677932|pages=153 &amp; 170|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ha6RNLb_UFQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This catchword spread quickly after the First World War, as "biotechnology" entered German dictionaries and was taken up abroad by business-hungry private consultancies as far away as the United States. In Chicago, for example, the coming of [[prohibition]] at the end of World War I encouraged biological industries to create opportunities for new fermentation products, in particular a market for nonalcoholic drinks. Emil Siebel, the son of the founder of the Zymotechnic Institute, broke away from his father's company to establish his own called the "Bureau of Biotechnology," which specifically offered expertise in fermented nonalcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The belief that the needs of an industrial society could be met by fermenting agricultural waste was an important ingredient of the "chemurgic movement."&lt;ref name="Fiechter" /&gt;  Fermentation-based processes generated products of ever-growing utility. In the 1940s, [[penicillin]] was the most dramatic. While it was discovered in England, it was produced industrially in the U.S. using a deep fermentation process originally developed in Peoria, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=J. J.|last2=Grenfell|first2=E.|last3=Legge|first3=B. J.|last4=Mcallister|first4=R. C.

Doctors used the phrase "miracle drug", and the historian of its wartime use, David Adams, has suggested that to the public penicillin represented the perfect health that went together with the car and the dream house of wartime American advertising.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt;  Beginning in the 1950s, fermentation technology also became advanced enough to produce [[steroids]] on industrially significant scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capek|first1=Milantadra|last2=Oldrich|first2=Hanc|last3=Alois|first3=Capek|title=Microbial Transformations of Steroids|date=1966|publisher=Academia Publishing House of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences|location=Prague|isbn=9789401176057|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7603-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance was the improved [[semisynthesis]] of [[cortisone]] which simplified the old 31 step synthesis to 11 steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leigh|first1=H.

[[File:Penicillin cures gonorrhea.jpg|thumb|left| [[Penicillin]] was viewed as a miracle drug that brought enormous profits and public expectations.]]

==Single-cell protein and gasohol projects==
Even greater expectations of biotechnology were raised during the 1960s by a process that grew single-cell protein. When the so-called protein gap threatened world hunger, producing food locally by growing it from waste seemed to offer a solution. It was the possibilities of growing microorganisms on oil that captured the imagination of scientists, policy makers, and commerce.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Major companies such as [[British Petroleum]] (BP) staked their futures on it. In 1962, BP built a pilot plant at Cap de Lavera in Southern France to publicize its product, Toprina.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Initial research work at Lavera was done by [[Alfred Champagnat]],&lt;ref name=bamberg&gt;{{cite book|first=J. H. |last=Bamberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000|pages=426–428|isbn=978-0-521-78515-0|title=British Petroleum and global oil, 1950-1975: the challenge of nationalism.

As there was no well-accepted term to describe the new foods, in 1966 the term "[[single-cell protein]]" (SCP) was coined at [[MIT]] to provide an acceptable and exciting new title, avoiding the unpleasant connotations of microbial or bacterial.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The "food from oil" idea became quite popular by the 1970s, when  facilities for growing yeast fed by n-[[Alkane|paraffin]]s were built in a number of countries. The [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] were particularly enthusiastic, opening large "BVK" (''belkovo-vitaminny kontsentrat'', i.e., "protein-vitamin concentrate") plants next to their oil refineries in [[Kstovo]] (1973) &lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0612FD3C55137B93C2A8178AD95F478785F9 Soviet Plant to Convert Oil to Protein for Feed; Use of Yeast Involved], By THEODORE SHABAD. the New York Times, November 10, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kstovo.ru/index-name-Content-op-view-id-41.html Первенец микробиологической промышленности] (Microbiological industry's first plant), in: Станислав Марков (Stanislav Markov) «Кстово – молодой город России» (''Kstovo, Russia's Young City'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kirishi]] (1974).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

By the late 1970s, however, the cultural climate had completely changed, as the growth in SCP interest had taken place against a shifting economic and cultural scene (136). First, the [[price of oil]] rose catastrophically in 1974, so that its cost per barrel was five times greater than it had been two years earlier. Second, despite continuing hunger around the world, anticipated demand also began to shift from humans to animals. The program had begun with the vision of growing food for Third World people, yet the product was instead launched as an animal food for the developed world. The rapidly rising demand for animal feed made that market appear economically more attractive. The ultimate downfall of the SCP project, however, came from public resistance.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

This was particularly vocal in Japan, where production came closest to fruition. For all their enthusiasm for innovation and traditional interest in microbiologically produced foods, the Japanese were the first to ban the production of single-cell proteins. The Japanese ultimately were unable to separate the idea of their new "natural" foods from the far from natural connotation of oil.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; These arguments were made against a background of suspicion of heavy industry in which anxiety over minute traces of [[petroleum]] was expressed. Thus, public resistance to an unnatural product led to the end of the SCP project as an attempt to solve world hunger.

Also, in 1989 in the USSR, the public environmental concerns made the government decide to close down (or convert to different technologies) all 8 paraffin-fed-yeast plants that the Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry had by that time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the late 1970s, biotechnology offered another possible solution to a societal crisis. The escalation in the price of oil in 1974 increased the cost of the Western world's energy tenfold.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In response, the U.S. government promoted the production of [[gasohol]], gasoline with 10 percent alcohol added, as an answer to the energy crisis.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; In 1979, when the Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan, the Carter administration cut off its supplies to agricultural produce in retaliation, creating a surplus of agriculture in the U.S. As a result, fermenting the agricultural surpluses to synthesize fuel seemed to be an economical solution to the shortage of oil threatened by the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Before the new direction could be taken, however, the political wind changed again: the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration came to power in January 1981 and, with the declining oil prices of the 1980s, ended support for the gasohol industry before it was born.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

Biotechnology seemed to be the solution for major social problems, including world hunger and energy crises. In the 1960s, radical measures would be needed to meet world starvation, and biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. However, the solutions proved to be too expensive and socially unacceptable, and solving world hunger through SCP food was dismissed. In the 1970s, the food crisis was succeeded by the energy crisis, and here too, biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. But once again, costs proved prohibitive as oil prices slumped in the 1980s. Thus, in practice, the implications of biotechnology were not fully realized in these situations. But this would soon change with the rise of [[genetic engineering]].

==Genetic engineering==
The origins of biotechnology culminated with the birth of [[genetic engineering]]. There were two key events that have come to be seen as scientific breakthroughs beginning the era that would unite genetics with biotechnology. One was the 1953 discovery of the structure of [[DNA]], by Watson and Crick, and the other was the 1973 discovery by Cohen and Boyer of a [[recombinant DNA]] technique by which a section of DNA was cut from the plasmid of an E. coli bacterium and transferred into the DNA of another.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt; This approach could, in principle, enable bacteria to adopt the genes and produce proteins of other organisms, including humans. Popularly referred to as "genetic engineering," it came to be defined as the basis of new biotechnology.

Genetic engineering proved to be a topic that thrust biotechnology into the public scene, and the interaction between scientists, politicians, and the public defined the work that was accomplished in this area. Technical developments during this time were revolutionary and at times frightening. In December 1967, the first heart transplant by Christian Barnard reminded the public that the physical identity of a person was becoming increasingly problematic. While poetic imagination had always seen the heart at the center of the soul, now there was the prospect of individuals being defined by other people's hearts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;  During the same month, [[Arthur Kornberg]] announced that he had managed to biochemically replicate a viral gene. "Life had been synthesized," said the head of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Genetic engineering was now on the scientific agenda, as it was becoming possible to identify genetic characteristics with diseases such as [[beta thalassemia]] and [[sickle-cell anemia]].

Responses to scientific achievements were colored by cultural skepticism. Scientists and their expertise were looked upon with suspicion. In 1968, an immensely popular work, ''The Biological Time Bomb'', was written by the British journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor. The author's preface saw Kornberg's discovery of replicating a viral gene as a route to lethal doomsday bugs. The publisher's blurb for the book warned that within ten years, "You may marry a semi-artificial man or woman…choose your children's sex…tune out pain…change your memories…and live to be 150 if the scientific revolution doesn’t destroy us first."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; The book ended with a chapter called "The Future – If Any." While it is rare for current science to be represented in the movies, in this period of "[[Star Trek]]", science fiction and science fact seemed to be converging. "[[Cloning]]" became a popular word in the media. [[Woody Allen]] satirized the cloning of a person from a nose in his 1973 movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', and cloning [[Adolf Hitler]] from surviving cells was the theme of the 1976 novel by [[Ira Levin]], ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]''.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

In response to these public concerns, scientists, industry, and governments increasingly linked the power of [[recombinant DNA]] to the immensely practical functions that biotechnology promised. One of the key scientific figures that attempted to highlight the promising aspects of genetic engineering was [[Joshua Lederberg]], a Stanford professor and [[Nobel laureate]]. While in the 1960s "genetic engineering" described eugenics and work involving the manipulation of the [[human genome]], Lederberg stressed research that would involve microbes instead.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg emphasized the importance of focusing on curing living people. Lederberg's 1963 paper, "Biological Future of Man" suggested that, while molecular biology might one day make it possible to change the human genotype, "what we have overlooked is [[euphenics]], the engineering of human development."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg constructed the word "euphenics" to emphasize changing the [[phenotype]] after conception rather than the [[genotype]] which would affect future generations.

With the discovery of [[recombinant DNA]] by Cohen and Boyer in 1973, the idea that genetic engineering would have major human and societal consequences was born. In July 1974, a group of eminent molecular biologists headed by Paul Berg wrote to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggesting that the consequences of this work were so potentially destructive that there should be a pause until its implications had been thought through.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; This suggestion was explored at a meeting in February 1975 at California's Monterey Peninsula, forever immortalized by the location, [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]]. Its historic outcome was an unprecedented call for a halt in research until it could be regulated in such a way that the public need not be anxious, and it led to a 16-month moratorium until [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) guidelines were established.

[[Joshua Lederberg]] was the leading exception in emphasizing, as he had for years, the potential benefits. At [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], in an atmosphere favoring control and regulation, he circulated a paper countering the pessimism and fears of misuses with the benefits conferred by successful use. He described "an early chance for a technology of untold importance for diagnostic and therapeutic medicine: the ready production of an unlimited variety of human [[proteins]]. Analogous applications may be foreseen in [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] process for cheaply manufacturing essential nutrients, and in the improvement of [[microbes]] for the production of [[antibiotics]] and of special industrial chemicals."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In June 1976, the 16-month moratorium on research expired with the Director's Advisory Committee (DAC) publication of the NIH guidelines of good practice. They defined the risks of certain kinds of experiments and the appropriate physical conditions for their pursuit, as well as a list of things too dangerous to perform at all. Moreover, [[modified organisms]] were not to be tested outside the confines of a laboratory or allowed into the environment.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt;

[[File:Insulincrystals.jpg|thumb|Synthetic [[insulin]] crystals synthesized using [[recombinant DNA]] technology]]

Atypical as Lederberg was at Asilomar, his optimistic vision of [[genetic engineering]] would soon lead to the development of the biotechnology industry. Over the next two years, as public concern over the dangers of [[recombinant DNA]] research grew, so too did interest in its technical and practical applications. Curing genetic diseases remained in the realms of science fiction, but it appeared that producing human simple proteins could be good business. [[Insulin]], one of the smaller,  best characterized and understood proteins, had been used in treating [[type 1 diabetes]] for a half century. It had been extracted from animals in a chemically slightly different form from the human product. Yet, if one could produce synthetic [[human insulin]], one could meet an existing demand with a product whose approval would be relatively easy to obtain from regulators. In the period 1975 to 1977, synthetic "human" insulin represented the aspirations for new products that could be made with the new biotechnology. Microbial production of synthetic human insulin was finally announced in September 1978 and was produced by a startup company, [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name="Krimsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krimsky|first1=Sheldon|title=Biotechnics &amp; society: the rise of industrial genetics|date=1991|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9780275938598|pages=18, &amp; 21|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-XbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=027593859X&amp;dq=027593859X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that company did not commercialize the product themselves, instead, it licensed the production method to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].  1978 also saw the first application for a patent on a gene, the gene which produces [[human growth hormone]], by the [[University of California]], thus introducing the legal principle that genes could be patented. Since that filing, almost 20% of the more than 20,000 genes in the human DNA have been patented.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The radical shift in the connotation of "genetic engineering" from an emphasis on the inherited characteristics of people to the commercial production of proteins and therapeutic drugs was nurtured by Joshua Lederberg. His broad concerns since the 1960s had been stimulated by enthusiasm for science and its potential medical benefits. Countering calls for strict regulation, he expressed a vision of potential utility. Against a belief that new techniques would entail unmentionable and uncontrollable consequences for humanity and the environment, a growing consensus on the economic value of recombinant DNA emerged.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Biotechnology and industry==
[[File:South San Francisco gateway sign.jpg|thumb|right|A Genentech-sponsored sign declaring South San Francisco to be "The Birthplace of Biotechnology."]]
With ancestral roots in [[industrial microbiology]] that date back centuries, the new biotechnology industry grew rapidly beginning in the mid-1970s. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture investment confidence and public support.&lt;ref name="Krimsky" /&gt;  Although market expectations and social benefits of new products were frequently overstated, many people were prepared to see genetic engineering as the next great advance in technological progress. By the 1980s, biotechnology characterized a nascent real industry, providing titles for emerging trade organizations such as the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO).

The main focus of attention after insulin were the potential profit makers in the pharmaceutical industry: [[human growth hormone]] and what promised to be a miraculous cure for viral diseases, [[interferon]]. [[Cancer]] was a central target in the 1970s because increasingly the disease was linked to viruses.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grace|first1=Eric S.|title=Biotechnology Unzipped:: Promises and Realities|date=2006|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309096218|pages=78 &amp; 155|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtOv07UmQgAC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1980, a new company, [[Biogen]], had produced [[interferon]] through recombinant DNA. The emergence of interferon and the possibility of curing cancer raised money in the community for research and increased the enthusiasm of an otherwise uncertain and tentative society. Moreover, to the 1970s plight of cancer was added [[AIDS]] in the 1980s, offering an enormous potential market for a successful therapy, and more immediately, a market for diagnostic tests based on monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name="Colwell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rita R|first1=Colwell|title=Fulfilling the promise of biotechnology|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=2002|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=215–228|doi=10.1016/S0734-9750(02)00011-3|pmid=14550029}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA): synthetic [[insulin]], [[human growth hormone]], [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[alpha-interferon]], and [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (TPa), for lysis of blood clots. By the end of the 1990s, however, 125 more genetically engineered drugs would be approved.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

The 2007–2008 [[global financial crisis]] led to several changes in the way the biotechnology industry was financed and organized. First, it led to a decline in overall financial investment in the sector, globally; and second, in some countries like the UK it led to a shift from business strategies focused on going for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) to seeking a [[trade sale]] instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birch|first=Kean|date=2016-08-10|title=Rethinking Value in the Bio-economy|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=460–490|doi=10.1177/0162243916661633|pmid=28458406|pmc=5390941}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, financial investment in the biotechnology industry started to improve again and by 2014 the global market capitalization reached $1 trillion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic engineering also reached the agricultural front as well. There was tremendous progress since the market introduction of the genetically engineered [[Flavr Savr tomato]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;  Ernst and Young reported that in 1998, 30% of the U.S. soybean crop was expected to be from genetically engineered seeds. In 1998, about 30% of the US cotton and corn crops were also expected to be products of [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

Genetic engineering in biotechnology stimulated hopes for both therapeutic proteins, drugs and biological organisms themselves, such as seeds, pesticides, engineered yeasts, and modified human cells for treating genetic diseases. From the perspective of its commercial promoters, scientific breakthroughs, industrial commitment, and official support were finally coming together, and biotechnology became a normal part of business. No longer were the proponents for the economic and technological significance of biotechnology the iconoclasts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Their message had finally become accepted and incorporated into the policies of governments and industry.

==Global trends==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2006}}
According to Burrill and Company, an industry investment bank, over $350 billion has been invested in biotech since the emergence of the industry, and global revenues rose from $23 billion in 2000 to more than $50 billion in 2005. The greatest growth has been in [[Latin America]] but all regions of the world have shown strong growth trends.  By 2007 and into 2008, though, a downturn in the fortunes of biotech emerged, at least in the United Kingdom, as the result of declining investment in the face of failure of biotech pipelines to deliver and a consequent downturn in return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Sue |date=2008-08-01 |title=Is the U.K. Biotech Industry on the Skids? |journal=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=2546&amp;chid=0 |issn=1935-472X|accessdate =2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association of Business Communicators''' ('''IABC''') is a global network of [[communication]]s professionals.

Each summer, IABC hosts [http://wc.iabc.com World Conference], a three-day event with professional development seminars and activities, as well as talks by industry leaders.

Decisions within the organization are made by a two-thirds vote of the executive board, which is elected by members. IABC members agree to follow a professional code of ethics, which encourages members to do what is legal, ethical and in good taste.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iabc.com/about/code.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IABC's predecessor was the American Association of Industrial Editors (AAIE), which was founded in 1938. AAIE became a member of the International Council of Industrial Editors (ICIE) in 1941. It withdrew from ICIE in 1946 over policy differences, but formed IABC when it merged again in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Syracuse University Library|url=http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/a/aaie.htm|accessdate=December 3, 2012|title=American Association of Industrial Editors (AAIE) Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite news|title=Emphasis on internal communication spurs IABC|date=January 26, 2009|newspaper=O'Dwyer's|first=Jack|last=O'Dwyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In IABC's first year of operation, the association had 2,280 members and was focused on [[internal communications]].&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; IABC's research showed its members were moving into positions with broader [[public relations]] responsibilities and the association expanded its scope.&lt;ref name="Grunig1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=James E. Grunig|title=Excellence Public Relations Pr|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OS_nI4qbpQoC&amp;pg=PA533|accessdate=3 December 2012|year=1992|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-8058-0227-6|pages=533–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 it merged with Corporate Communicators Canada.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{citation|title=International Association of Business Communicators (IABC)|url=http://www.globalalliancepr.org/website/member/international-association-business-communicators-iabc|publisher=Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the association formed the IABC Research Foundation, which funded a study of 323 organizations in the 1980s to determine what made some public relations teams more effective than others. The study found that executive involvement in communications was the best predictor of effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Grunig, James E., and Larissa A. Grunig.

IABC had financial troubles in 2000 after losing $1 million in an e-business initiative called TalkingBusinessNow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 9, 2002|title=IABC, PRSA Revamp Ties to Ragan, PRW|newspaper=O'Dwyer's|url=http://www.odwyerpr.com/members/archived_stories_2002/april/0409comm_ragan.htm|first=Jack|last=O'Dwyer|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.healthcarecommunication.com/Main/Articles/Special_Insert_Ragan_Reports_IABC_Watch_227.aspx|publisher=Ragans|title=Special Insert: Ragan Report's IABC Watch|date=August 3, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 a grass-roots initiative was started within IABC's membership that eventually developed into the Gift of Communication program, whereby members donated their professional services to local charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=February–March 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2012|url=http://mediaedge.imirus.com/Mpowered/book/vassoc11/i1/p1|pp=21|title=Social Responsibility at IABC|newspaper=Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership grew 7{{Ndash}}9 percent each year in the 2000s due to an increasing number of practitioners in the field of internal communications.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; IABC hosted its first annual world conference in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IABC preps for World Conference|date=May 29, 2009|newspaper=O'Dwyer's}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew to more than 16,000 members by 2008.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; That same year, IABC accredited Chinese citizens for the first time in the Accredited Business Communicator (ABC) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global standard for business communication is introduced in China – Shanghai Expo will bring opportunities to PR industry|date=September 26, 2008|newspaper=Shanghai Evening Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The first-ever Chinese citizens earn the ABC designation|date=September 13, 2008|newspaper=Shanghai Business Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 40 years, the association offered an accreditation program called Accreditation for Business Communications (ABC).

The goal is to set an international standard for all communications professionals that will be recognized by an organization such as ISO17024. The autonomous international group to oversee the creation of the new certification program — the Global Communication Certification Council — was appointed in February 2014.

'''Jacob Henry Schiff''' (born '''Jakob Heinrich Schiff'''; January 10, 1847 – September 25, 1920) was a Jewish-American [[banker]], businessman, and philanthropist. Among many other things, he helped finance the expansion of American railroads and the Japanese military efforts against [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

Born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], Schiff migrated to the [[United States]] after the [[American Civil War]] and joined the firm [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13266-schiff|title=SCHIFF - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his base on [[Wall Street]], he was the foremost [[Jewish]] leader from 1880 to 1920 in what later became known as the "Schiff era", grappling with all major Jewish issues and problems of the day, including the plight of Russian Jews under the Tsar, American and international [[anti-semitism]], care of needy Jewish immigrants, and the rise of [[Streams of Zionism|Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Wiener Cohen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpIOia8QxyYC&amp;pg=PP4 Jacob H. Schiff: a study in American Jewish leadership]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Glazer|Glazer, N]] (1957) ''American Judaism'', [[University of Chicago Press|UCP]].&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a director of many important corporations, including the [[National City Bank (New York City)|National City Bank of New York]], [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], [[Wells Fargo &amp; Company]], and the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. In many of his interests he was associated with [[E. H. Harriman]].

==Early life==
Schiff was born in 1847 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[German Confederation|Germany]], to Moses and Clara (née Niederhofheim) Schiff, members of a distinguished  [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] [[rabbi]]nical family that traced its lineage in Frankfurt back to 1370. His father, Moses Schiff, was a broker for the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt; Schiff was educated in the schools of Frankfurt and was first employed in the banking and brokerage business as an apprentice in 1861.&lt;ref name=ncab&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography'', Vol. XIII, p. 533. New York: James T. White &amp; Company, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Schiff, Jacob Henry|pages=430–432}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Civil War]] had ended in April, 1865, Schiff came to the United States, arriving in [[New York City]] on August 6. He became a broker on November 21, 1866, and joined the firm of Budge, Schiff &amp; Company in 1867. He became a [[naturalization|naturalized]] [[United States citizen|citizen of the United States]] in September 1870.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

Upon the dissolution of Budge, Schiff &amp; Company in 1872, Schiff decided to return to Germany. In 1873 he became manager of the [[Hamburg]] branch of the London &amp; Hanseatic Bank. He returned to Frankfurt, however, upon the death of his father later that year. In 1874 [[Abraham Kuhn (banker)|Abraham Kuhn]] of the banking firm of [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.|Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company]] invited him to return to New York and enter the firm.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

==Career==
Along with [[H. B. Claflin]], [[Marcellus Hartley]], [[Robert L. Cutting]], and [[Joseph Seligman]], he was a founder of the [[Continental Bank of New York]] in August 1870.&lt;ref name=nyt-anniv&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Continental Bank to Mark 70th Year; Institution Has 3,500 Depositors and 6,000 Stockholders |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1940/08/01/archives/continental-bank-to-mark-70th-year-institution-has-3500-depositors.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York City, New York, United States |date=August 1, 1940 |access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company===
Schiff accepted Kuhn's invitation in January 1875, bringing to Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company his connections with Sir [[Ernest Cassel]] of London, [[Robert Fleming (financier)|Robert Fleming]] of [[Dundee]] (later of London), and {{Interlanguage link multi|Edouard Noetzlin|fr}} of the [[Paribas|Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas]].&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; On May 6, 1875, he married Therese Loeb, daughter of [[Solomon Loeb]]. The couple were the parents of a son, [[Mortimer L. Schiff]] and a daughter, Frieda.&lt;ref name=ncab/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Their daughter Frieda Schiff-Warburg (February 3, 1876 – September 14, 1958); married [[Felix M. Warburg]] in 1895. Both her husband and her brother became partners in Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885 Schiff became head of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company. Besides financing such Eastern railroads as the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] and the [[Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad|Louisville &amp; Nashville]], he took part in the reorganization of the [[Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad]] in 1896–99, and at various times aided the American Smelting &amp; Refining Company ([[ASARCO]]), the [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], and the [[Western Union]] Telegraph Company. Less fortunate was his share in the reorganization in 1902 of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]] of New York.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

He became associated with [[E. H. Harriman]] in notable contests with [[James J. Hill]] and [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Company]] for control of several Western railroads. Schiff served as a director of the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], [[National City Bank of New York]], [[Central Trust Company]], [[Western Union Telegraph Company]], [[Union Pacific Railroad]], [[Bond &amp; Mortgage Guarantee Company]], and [[Wells Fargo &amp; Company]]. He was elected a director of Wells Fargo in September 1914 to succeed his brother-in-law, [[Paul Warburg]], who had resigned to accept appointment to the original [[Federal Reserve]] Board.&lt;ref name=ncab/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Lord |title=The Good Years: From 1900 to the First World War |pages=71–79 |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |year=1960 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVoXPgze4uoC&amp;pg=PA71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Noel M. |last=Loomis |title=Wells Fargo |page=315 |location=New York |publisher=Clarkson N. Potter |year=1968 |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znS3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National loans===
What was perhaps Schiff's most famous financial action was during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], in 1904 and 1905. Schiff met [[Takahashi Korekiyo]], deputy governor of the [[Bank of Japan]], in Paris in April 1904. He subsequently extended loans to the [[Empire of Japan]] in the amount of $200 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|0.2|1905|r=1}} billion in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), through Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; These loans were the first major flotation of Japanese bonds on [[Wall Street]], and provided approximately half the funds needed for Japan's war effort.&lt;ref name= Kowner&gt;{{cite book | last = Kowner| first = Rotem|authorlink=Rotem Kowner| coauthors = | year = 2006 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War| publisher = The Scarecrow Press | location = {{ISBN|0-8108-4927-5}} | id = }}, p. 344-345.&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff made this loan partly because he believed that gold was not as important as national effort and desire in winning a war, and due to the apparent underdog status of Japan at the time; no European nation had yet been defeated by a non-European nation in a modern, full-scale war. It is quite likely Schiff also saw this loan as a means of answering, on behalf of the Jewish people, the anti-Semitic actions of the [[Russian Empire]], specifically the then-recent [[Kishinev pogrom]].

This loan attracted worldwide attention, and had major consequences. Japan won the war, thanks in large part to the purchase of munitions made possible by Schiff's loan. Some of the Japanese leadership saw this as evidence of the power of Jews all around the world, raised the issue of Jewish loyalties in the Diaspora and as proof of the truth of the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. In 1905, Japan awarded Schiff the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]];&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Adler, ''Jacob Henry Schiff: A Biographical Sketch'', p. 12. New York: The American Jewish Committee, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1907, the [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star]], the second highest of the eight classes of that Order.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff was the first foreigner to receive the Order in person from [[Emperor Meiji]] in the Imperial Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Rotner Sakamoto, ''Japanese Diplomats and Jewish Refugees'', p. 17. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff also had a private audience with King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]] in 1904.

In addition to his famous loan to Japan, Schiff financed loans to many other nations, including those that would come to comprise the [[Central Powers]]. During [[World War I]], Schiff urged U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] statesmen to end the war as quickly as possible, even without an Allied victory. He feared for the lives of his family, back in Germany, but also for the future of his adopted land. He arranged loans to France and other nations for humanitarian purposes, and spoke out against [[submarine warfare]].

Schiff made sure none of the funds from his loans ever went to the Russian Empire, which he felt oppressed Jewish people. When [[February Revolution|the Russian Empire fell in 1917]], Schiff believed that the oppression of Jews would end. He formally repealed the impediments within his firm against lending to Russia.

However, Schiff's stance changed upon the Bolshevik seizure of power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Schiff's gripe against Russia had been its anti-Semitism. At home Schiff had never shown any sympathy for socialism, not even the milder Morris Hillquit variety. Schiff had declared victory for his purposes in Russia after the tsar was toppled in March 1917 and Alexander Kerensky, representing the new provisional government, had declared Jews to be equal citizens. In addition to repeated public statements of support, he used both his personal wealth and the resources of Kuhn Loeb to float large loans to Kerensky's regime. When Lenin and Trotsky seized power for themselves in November 1917, Schiff immediately rejected them, cut off further loans, started funding anti-Bolshevist groups, and even demanded that the Bolsheviks pay back some of the money he'd loaned Kerensky. Schiff also joined a British-backed effort to appeal to fellow Jews in Russia to continue the fight against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trotsky in New York, 1917: A Radical on the Eve of Revolution|last=Ackerman|first=Kenneth|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Charitable endeavors==
Schiff always felt strongly about his connection to the [[Jews|Jewish people]], and demonstrated this through his philanthropy. He supported relief efforts for the victims of pogroms in Russia, and helped establish and develop [[Hebrew Union College]], the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]], the Jewish Division in the [[New York Public Library]], and the [[American Jewish Committee]].

Schiff grew to be one of American Jewry's top philanthropists and leaders, donating to nearly every major Jewish cause, New York examples being the Montefiore Home for Chronic Invalids, of which he was president,&lt;ref&gt;Heilbrunn, Bernice. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=41 "Jacob H. Schiff."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified August 05, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Young Men's Hebrew Association]] building and the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Schiff, Jacob Henry|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with many secular American causes: in addition to serving on the Board of Managers of the [[New York Zoological Society]], he gave to such organizations as the [[Boy Scouts of America]], the [[Harvard Semitic Museum]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[American Fine Arts Society]], [[American Geographical Society]], and [[Barnard College]]; and a number of other organizations for civil rights and the disadvantaged, such as the [[American Red Cross]], the [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]] and [[Henry Street Settlement]] (New York) and [[Tuskegee Institute]].&lt;ref name=ncab/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;&lt;ref name=americana/&gt;
On his 70th birthday, he distributed $700,000 among various charitable organizations and public institutions.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Schiff, Jacob Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schiff was actively concerned with the improvement of civic conditions in New York.  He was a vice president of the [[New York Chamber of Commerce]], and a member of the [[Committee of 70 (New York City)|Committee of 70]] which resulted in the overthrow of the [[Tweed Ring]].&lt;ref name="colliers"&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Schiff, Jacob Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years==
The [[Action Française]] movement and its leader, [[Charles Maurras]], claimed that Schiff was thoroughly pro-German and had worked to prevent [[American entry into World War I]]. Maurras went so far as to suggest that a telegram from Schiff and other prominent American Jewish leaders convinced President Wilson to give in to certain German arguments at the post-war peace negotiations – including allowing [[Upper Silesia]] to have a plebiscite rather than being ceded to [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Maurras, ''Dictionnaire Politique et Critique'', 1930–32, vol. II, pages 361–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The telegram is not known to have actually existed. Moreover, it has been argued that Schiff stopped financing transactions for Germany or the Central Powers as of 1914, stopped speaking German in public and was eager to demonstrate his moral and financial commitment to the Allied cause.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Birmingham]], ''[[Our Crowd]]: The Great Jewish Families of New York'', at p. 316–7&lt;/ref&gt;

A practitioner of [[Reform Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13266-schiff#anchor1 "Schiff: Jacob Henry schiff"]. ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff supported political, secular [[Zionism]]. Despite not agreeing fully with the ideas of [[Theodore Herzl]], and in fact believing that Zionism would cause Americans to question his loyalty, he donated to many Jewish projects in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], including the [[Technion|Technical Institute of Haifa]]. As the situation for Eastern European Jews grew more dire, with the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], and pogroms in [[Ukraine]], Schiff made more considerable contributions to the Zionist effort; he even offered to join the Zionist organization, provided he could publish a statement he'd prepared. This offer was denied, and so he never formally joined the Zionist camp.

Historian [[George F. Kennan]] noted that Schiff helped finance revolutionary propaganda during the Russo-Japanese war and revolution of 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Pacifists Pester Till Mayor Calls Them Traitors |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F15FA3F5E11738DDDAD0A94DB405B878DF1D3 |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 24, 1917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through the [[Society of Friends of Russian Freedom]].

''The Jewish Communal Register of New York City'' stated that "Mr. Schiff has always used his wealth and his influence in the best interests of his people. He financed the enemies of autocratic Russia and used his financial influence to keep Russia from the money markets of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Communal Register of New York City'', 1917-1918, Second Edition, Kehillah, New York, (1919), [https://archive.org/stream/jewishcommunalr00marggoog#page/n953/mode/2up p. 1019]&lt;/ref&gt;

His estate was estimated at about $50,000,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000000|1920|r=-6}}}} today). He bequeathed $1,350,000 to various institutions, most of which had received benefactions during his life. The largest bequests were $500,000 to the Federation for the support of Jewish Philanthropic Societies of New York City and $300,000 to the Montefiore Home.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=J.

==Legacy==
He was succeeded as head of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company by his son, [[Mortimer Leo Schiff]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

Schiff was inducted into the [[Junior Achievement]] U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1982.

The Jacob Schiff Center, named after him, was a prominent Jewish cultural center and [[synagogue]] from the 1930s through at least the 1960s. It was located on Valentine Avenue, near the intersection of [[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] in the [[Fordham, Bronx, New York|Fordham]] section of the Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Voloj, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EED8163FF931A15753C1A9609C8B63 "On Fordham Road: Signs of the Times"].

'''Labour vouchers''' (also known as '''labour cheques''', '''labour certificates''' and '''personal credit''') are a device proposed to govern [[demand]] for [[goods]] in some models of [[socialism]] unlike [[money]] does under [[capitalism]].

== Outline ==
Unlike money, vouchers cannot circulate and are not transferable between people. They are also not exchangeable for any [[means of production]], hence they are not transmutable into [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Once a purchase is made, the labour vouchers are either destroyed or must be re-earned through labour. With such a system in place, monetary [[theft]] would become impossible.

Such a system is proposed by many as a replacement for traditional money while retaining a system of remuneration for work done. It is also a way of ensuring that there is no way to make money out of money as in a capitalist [[market economy]]. Additionally, the only kind of [[Market (economics)|market]] that could exist in an economy operating through the use of labour vouchers would be an [[artificial market]] (arket) for mostly non-productive goods and services. As with the dissolution of [[money]], [[capital market]]s could no longer exist and [[labour market]]s would also likely cease to exist with the abolition of [[wage labor]] which would by necessity occur with the adoption of vouchers.

Author and activist [[Michael Albert]] and economist [[Robin Hahnel]] have proposed a similar system of remuneration in their economic system of [[participatory economics]] (parecon). A difference is that in parecon credits are generally awarded based on both the time spent working and the amount of effort and sacrifice spent during labour, rather than simple contribution. Some later advocates of [[participism]] and parecon have also proposed awarding more based on job difficulty or danger. In contrast to the physical note or cheque format used for labour vouchers in the past, parecon credits are proposed as being entirely digital in keeping with advances with technology and are stored in electronic accounts and usable through cards similar to current day debit cards.

== History ==
Labour vouchers were first proposed in the 1820s by [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Robert Owen]]. Two early attempts at implementing labour vouchers (called labour notes at the time by their proponents) were made by both following their experiences attempting to establish a utopian community at [[New Harmony, Indiana]] in which currency was prohibited.

In 1827, Warren established the [[Cincinnati Time Store]] where goods could be purchased with labor vouchers representing an agreement to perform labor. However, he folded the store in 1830 in order to devote his effort to establishing communities that implemented his principles of labour-based prices.

Beginning in 1832, Owen and his followers attempted to implement labour notes in London and Glasgow by establishing marketplaces and banks that accepted them.

The followers of Owen stood for a society of co-operative communities. Each community would own its own means of production and each member of a community would work to produce what had been agreed was needed and in return would be issued with a labour voucher certifying for how many hours he or she had worked. A person could then use this labour voucher to obtain from the community's stock of consumer goods any product or products which had taken the same number of hours to produce.

Owen believed that this co-operative commonwealth could begin to be introduced under capitalism and in the first half of the 1830s some of his followers established labour bazaars on a similar principle in which workers brought the products of their labour to the bazaar and received in exchange a labour voucher that entitled them to take from the bazaar any item or items which had taken the same time to produce after taking into account the costs of the raw materials. These bazaars were ultimately failures, but the idea of labour vouchers appeared in substantially similar forms in France in the writings of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].

Although he disagreed with the manner in which they were implemented by Owen, they were later advocated by [[Karl Marx]] as a way of dealing with immediate and temporary shortages upon the establishment of socialism. Marx explained that this would be necessary since socialism emerges from capitalism and would be "stamped with its birthmarks". In Marx's proposal, an early socialist society would reward its citizens according to [[To each according to his contribution|the amount of labour they contribute to society]]. In the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'', Marx said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he individual producer receives back from society—after the deductions have been made—exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labour. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labour time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labour (after deducting his labour for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labour cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.&lt;ref name="MarxGothaPartI"&gt;Karl Marx (1875). ''[[s:Critique of the Gotha Programme|Critique of the Gotha Programme]]''. [[s:Critique of the Gotha Programme/Part I|Part I]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Marx essentially refused the idea in the ''[[Poverty of Philosophy]]'', especially within the capitalism (I. chapter, 2. §). Marx stated that the time in itself separated from other's time doesot suitable to measure the value of work. The value "is constituted, not by the time needed to produce it by itself, but in relation to the quota of each and every other product which can be created at the same time" (3.§. A.). Marx opinion was that the introduction of labour voucher would create a lazy society and economy because there will not be concurrency between the employers and employees, so nobody could tell what is the optimal (minimal) time which needs to produce something. Generally, any working time doesn't equal to any other working time. Moreover what if "Peter" works 12 hours per day, meanwhile "Paul" works only 6 hours. This means that "Peter" worked 6 unnecessary hours and his labour vouchers worth for nothing as regards this +6 hours, not to mention other factors of the work. To summarize Marx's opinion in the ''Poverty of Philosophy'', the labour voucher is not suitable to create a new socialist society. The theory of Proudhon and other's is nothing more than a [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] apology of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|existing capitalist system]]. By [[Friedrich Engels]], Proudhon himself tried to introduce the labour voucher system in 1849, but his attempt collapsed soon. Marx was adamant in saying that labour vouchers were not a form of money as they cannot circulate—a problem he pointed out with Owen's system of labour-time notes.

After the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]]s were forced to let the direct production-exchange and gave valuless vouchers to the peasantry for the grain and the food-stuff which were confiscated by brutal force, but this method led to local rebellions and after all to the civil war. [[Vladimir Lenin]] never suggested introducing the labour voucher system in the industrial areas. No other socialist countries used later the labour voucher system. 

During the [[Great Depression]], European communities implemented local currencies with varying success. The aptly-named economist Sir [[Leo Chiozza Money]] advocated for a similar monetary scheme in his 1934 book ''Product Money'' (Methuen) with notes or certificates being issued for productive work and destroyed once exchanged for consumption goods. In [[Nazi Germany]], [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Hjalmar Schacht[[ finance-minister and banker) applied a kind of labour-voucher named MEFO-bond, whose aim was to hide the rearmament program's expenditures before the Western world as the big trusts did not pay by money-transfer to each other, but bought MEFO bonds from the state and changed these bonds in closed circuit. More modern implementations as [[Time-based currency|time-based currencies]] were implemented in the United States starting in the 1970s.

== Systems that advocate labour vouchers ==
The following political and economic systems propose the adoption of labour vouchers (in some form or another) either permanently or as a temporary means of remuneration during a transitional stage between a monetary economy and a completely moneyless economy based on free association.
* [[Owenism]]
* [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]]
* [[Collectivist anarchism]]
* [[DeLeonism]]
* [[Participism]]
* [[Inclusive Democracy]]

Inclusive Democracy is unique in proposing two kinds of vouchers. Basic vouchers issued to each citizen according to need are used for essential goods and services such as health care while non-basic vouchers awarded to each worker for labor contributed are used to pay for non-essential commercial goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos (Spring Summer 2010). [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol6/vol6_no2_takis_beyond_market_economy_and_statist_planning.htm "Beyond the Market Economy and Statist Planning: Towards Democratic Planning as part of a Confederal Inclusive Democracy"]. ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''. Vol. 6. No. 2/3..&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Capitalists—whether [[State capitalism|statist]], [[minarchist]], or [[anarcho-capitalist]]—generally oppose labour vouchers as they are not money and thus claim an economy using them could not set prices according to [[marginal utility]] and would theoretically have to rely on the [[labour theory of value]], which adherents of the [[subjective theory of value]] generally see as inflexible and restricting economic freedom of choice for the consumer. Some proposed systems which advocate labour vouchers, namely participism, reject the labour theory of value.

The system has also been criticized by many [[libertarian socialists]], particularly [[anarcho-communists]], who propose abolishing all remuneration and prices and advocate instead a [[gift economy]] with the value determined by [[calculation in kind]]. In criticizing collectivist anarchism's retaining of labour vouchers and cheques, [[Peter Kropotkin]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[F]or after having proclaimed the abolition of private property, and the possession in common of all means of production, how can they uphold the wages system in any form? It is, nevertheless, what collectivists are doing when they recommend labour-cheques.&lt;ref name="KropotkinBreadChapterXIII"&gt;Peter Kropotkin (1906). ''The Conquest of Bread''. New York and London: G. P. Putnam's Sons). [[s:The Conquest of Bread/Chapter XIII|Chapter XIII - The Collectivist Wages System]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[World Socialist Movement]] has argued against using labour vouchers as either a permanent or a temporary system while transitioning to their desired anarcho-communist economy based on free access. They claim that seeing as most of the occupations that currently exist under capitalism will no longer exist, [[scarcity]] would no longer be an issue. They also state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Labour vouchers would tend to maintain the idea that our human worth is determined by how much or how many goods we can own (or produce). Labour vouchers imply that a very huge administrative organisation must police who takes the goods produced by society. In other words, there must be people who spend their time ensuring that other people do not take things without paying for them. That is normal in a profit-oriented society, but a waste of human labour in socialism.&lt;ref name="LabourVouchersWSM"&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/articles/labour_vouchers.php "Labour Vouchers"]. World Socialist Movement. Retrieved 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hymmi Lenita Aulikki Airisto''' (born 1 January 1937 in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]) is a Finnish [[Business magnate|business leader]], promoter of Finnish industrial and cultural [[export]]s, TV journalist and author.

==Biography==

===Maiden of Finland===
Airisto began her public career in 1954, when she became [[Suomen Neito|Maiden of Finland]], nominated by the Disabled War Veterans' Association of Finland. Her duties involved raising funds for the rehabilitation of men, who had been severely wounded in the [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s, to help them return to a normal life.

===Education===
Working as a fashion model gained Airisto the financial means for pursuing academic studies in Finland and abroad. She earned a Bachelor of Science, B.Sc. degree from the Swedish-speaking [[Hanken School of Economics]] in Helsinki, Finland, and studied TV journalism at the [[BBC]] and [[ITV Network|ITV]] studios in [[London]], with [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|RTF]] in [[Paris]] and with German TV channels in [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]] and [[Berlin]]. Airisto also studied at [[Stanford University]] in [[California]]. Her studies concluded with practical experience at various TV studios in [[Los Angeles]], including an internship with the show of [[Steve Allen]]. He also asked her to join him live on air to tell American TV viewers about Finland and Finns on the [[NBC]] channel.

===Career===
Airisto had a career as a TV journalist for over 30 years, and she has appeared on more than 300 prime time current affairs shows over the years. She has also produced, designed and carried out export promotions for both individual companies and the export industry in general all around the world, the first promotion campaigns aimed at the international media and customers taking place in the 1960s. Airisto has also given lectures based on her several books at universities, schools of economics and other academic educational institutions for many years.

===Accolades===
In 2008, Airisto's influence in Finland was verified by a survey commissioned from Taloustutkimus - she ranked among the ten most influential women in the country. Airisto has also been nominated as ''Woman of the Year'' and decorated with the [[Order of the Lion of Finland|Knight, First Class of the Order of the Lion of Finland]].

===Other===
Airisto is a very public figure who often has been an opinion-maker in even very mundane things, such as style and etiquette. She is arguably best known to the public for having made wearing tennis socks with a suit socially unacceptable in Finland in the 1980s, a practice that up to then was a common practice for Finnish businessmen abroad. Later she has among other things criticized politicians, such as [[Matti Vanhanen]], for insufficient language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Lehti: Lenita Airisto haukkuu Vanhasen kielitaidon - http://www.mtv3.fi/viihde/uutiset/muut.shtml/833843/lehti-lenita-airisto-haukkuu-vanhasen-kielitaidon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Mailyan brothers consisted of three brothers; Daniel, Ivan (Hovhannes), and Lazarus (Yeghia). The brothers were industrial capitalists who amassed a major fortune from oil.&lt;ref name=Alieva /&gt;&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hovannisian|first=[by] Richard G.|title=The republic of Armenia.|year=1971|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520018051|edition=2. print.|page=145|quote=In February teams of civil and mining engineers and technicians from other parts of the Caucasus and from southern Russia were employed to study the soil, survey the mineral deposits, assess the industrial potential, and formulate plans for the reconstruction of Armenia. This important project was financed through a grant of 2 million rubles from the Mailov brothers, oil magnates who had amassed a fortune in Baku before the World War.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also successful in the caviar trade becoming the first company that produced caviar in Russia.&lt;ref name=huberta /&gt; Due to their success in the caviar industry, the family was known as the "Kings of fish roe".&lt;ref name=Pisem /&gt;

After the [[Russian Revolution]] however, the Mailyan family sought refuge in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saffron|first=Inga|title=Caviar the strange history and uncertain future of the world's most coveted delicacy|year=2002|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=9780767911191|pages=127–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sN69IqV0i0C&amp;pg=PT127&amp;dq|edition=1st|accessdate=10 March 2013|date=The Mailoffs were also refugees from the revolution, but before fleeing to Paris, they had operated an armada of sturgeon boats in Baku.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mailyan theatre==
[[File:Baku Theatre.jpg|thumbnail|Mailov Theatre (now [[Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater]])]]
According to legend, a famous opera-soprano singer (which according to sources is either [[Antonina Nezhdanova]] or a certain Italian opera singer) visited [[Baku]] and had many performances in various casinos and residences in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.bakupages.com/pubs/bakustories/10004_ru.php On Baku for Those Who Has Never Been There] by Elena Kolmanovskaya.

The theatre was commissioned by the Mailyan brothers and was built by ethnic [[Armenians|Armenian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sias.ru/upload/iblock/763/Kazarian_140x205.pdf Armenia-Russia: The dialogue in the space of artistic culture, Materials of International symposium, Moscow 2010, p. 16 (by Dr. M.

''Azerbaijan International''. #5.4. Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The project was also funded by the [[Azerbaijanis|Azeri]] oil baron [[Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]] who challenged the Mailyan brothers in completing the project in a year.&lt;ref name="azerbintl" /&gt; If the opera house was completed under a year, the costs of construction would be paid by him. The opera house was built in 10 months and Taghiev paid for the promised expense.&lt;ref name="azerbintl" /&gt;

When first opened in 1911, the theatre was known as the Mailyan Theatre. It is now known as the [[Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater]] and continues to serve [[Baku]] residents till this day.&lt;ref name="azerbintl" /&gt;

==Philanthropy in Armenia==
The Mailyan brothers sponsored many projects in the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. The most important of which was the financial grant of 2 million rubles in February 1919 to fund the expedition of surveyors for potential industrial output, mineral extracts, soil, and other minerals needed for the reconstruction of the country.&lt;ref name=UsArchives /&gt;&lt;ref name=ROA /&gt;&lt;ref name=richard /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">'''Market research''' and '''opinion polling''' in China has been conducted by several Chinese and Joint-Venture companies since [[Chinese economic reform]]s and market opening of the 1980s.

==Market research==
Prior to the 1980s the China Academy of Social Sciences used some research techniques but there were no market research companies. Following inward investment and economic opening by 1998 there were 850 registered companies, both Chinese and Joint-Ventures, conducting market research in China.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Croll  China's New Consumers: Social Development and Domestic Demand 2006  "By 1998, the number of registered companies conducting market research in China, both local start-ups and foreign-joint-ventures, had risen from virtually zero to close on 850.107 Nevertheless conducting market research using techniques ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the main customers for market research in the 1990s were MNEs.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Alon Chinese Economic Transition and International Marketing Strategy 2003  "MNEs spend more on market research in China and, therefore, are assumed to be leaner and more effective rather than skimping on the scope of research carried out."&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of research remains restricted and regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Pigott - China in the World Economy: The Domestic Policy Challenges [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] 2002  "Moreover, China's law regulating market research in China requires research projects to be approved by the government in advance, and their findings reported to the ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Zinzius Doing Business in the New China: A Handbook and Guide 2004 - Page 166 Market Research in China&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Business Success in China 2006 -- Page 153 "History of Market Research in China : Does consulting and in particular market research have a history in China?

==Opinion polling==
Most [[market research]] is purely commercial, however one notable example of a commercial survey firm which also conducts general public [[opinion poll]]s is Horizon Research (also known by its Chinese name [[Lingdian (company)|Lingdian]]).&lt;ref&gt;Florian Schneider  Visual Political Communication in Popular Chinese Television 2012 "a third institution that produces ratings data is the Horizon Research Consultancy Group (Lingdian diaocha gongsi 零点调查公司); however, this enterprise primarily ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon's survey results are often reported in the Chinese media, and referenced in some discussions of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wenfang Tang -Public Opinion and Political Change in China  2005 - Page 38 " One successful example of a commercial survey firm is Horizon (Lingdian), a private public-opinion and market-research firm. Its survey results are frequently quoted by the Chinese media in public policy discussions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Ogden Inklings of Democracy in China 2002- Page 388 "... a privately owned and operated company, is a good example of a major Chinese firm that conducts market research for enterprises and public opinion polling on major social issues in China. According to its founder, Yuan Yue, Lingdian and ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Markets Now''''' is a daily business programming block that is aired weekdays from 11am-3pm [[Eastern Time]] on the [[Fox Business Network]].

==About the program==
''Markets Now'' covers the day's market action, including real-time market coverage, breaking business news, and instant analysis.  On May 12, 2008, the network replaced the final two hours of the block with two new programs, which debuted on the same day, ''[[Countdown to the Closing Bell]]'' (hosted by Liz Claman) and ''Fox Business After the Bell'' (formerly ''Fox Business Bulls and Bears'', hosted by Claman and David Asman).

Following the launch of ''[[Opening Bell with Maria Bartiromo]]'' in February 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/fox-business-to-launch-new-daytime-schedule-feb-24-as-bartiromo-debuts-1201088208/ | title=Fox Business To Launch New Daytime Schedule Feb. 24 As Bartiromo Debuts | author=Steinberg, Brian | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | accessdate=March 22, 2014 | date=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Markets Now'' was reduced from its previous four-hour slot to one hour with [[Cheryl Casone]]. It will eventually be replaced by ''Risk and Reward'' hosted by [[Deirdre Bolton]] premiering on March 31, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/fox-business-to-launch-new-deirdre-bolton-program-march-31-1201137955/ | title=Fox Business To Launch New Deirdre Bolton Program March 31 | author=Steinberg, Brian | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | accessdate=March 22, 2014 | date=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Show Markets Now ended after several months of agony on March 27, 2014.

'''Mary Shreve (Ames) Frothingham''' (February 1, 1867 - May 5, 1955) was born into the prominent [[Ames family]] of Easton, Massachusetts. She held crucial roles in the development of many local and nationally recognized organizations through leadership and financial contributions. She assumed modesty in her personal life so as to give generously to others. Her legacy in her hometown can still be enjoyed by many at the [[Ames Free Library]], Unity Church, Frothingham Hall, Frothingham Park and her home ‘Wayside’.

== Family ==
Mary was the daughter of [[Frederick Lothrop Ames]] of Easton, Massachusetts (June 8, 1835 - September 13, 1893) and Rebecca Caroline (Blair) Ames of St. Louis Missouri (December 30, 1839 - January 20, 1903). She was the  granddaughter of [[Oliver Ames Jr.]] (President of the Union Pacific Railroad 1868-1871) and great granddaughter of [[Oliver Ames Sr.]] who founded the Ames Shovel Works in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin 2004, p.441&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political Career and Marriage ==
In 1905, she was a member of the Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage and became President.&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; This was in direct conflict with her cousin-in-law [[Blanche Ames Ames|Blanche Ames]], President of the Easton Woman Suffrage League and Treasurer of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage League. The two family members maintained a very genial relationship regardless, agreeing to disagree.  For example, when the 19th Amendment passed in 1920, Blanche would often consult with Mary on whom to vote for in the coming elections.

On May 8, 1916, she married [[Louis A. Frothingham]] (March 4, 1871 - August 23, 1928) at Unity Church in Easton, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Frothingham served as Major in the United States Army during World War 1. He graduated from Harvard Law in 1896, was Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and 41st Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts (1909-1912).

In 1918, Mr. Frothingham was sent to France by Governor [[Samuel W. McCall]]. While stationed in Paris, Mr. and Mrs. Frothingham opened their home to soldiers on leave and even attended to troops at the front line in the trenches.
 
When Mr. Frothingham was running for Massachusetts 14th Congressional district in 1920, Mary served as Chairperson of the Woman’s Republican Town Committee in Easton.&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Involvement ==
[[File:Mary Forthingham rose garden.jpg|thumb|Mary Frothingham rose garden]]
Having met [[Clara Barton]] as a young woman and establishing a longtime friendship, Mary involved herself with the [[Red Cross]]. She established the Easton branch and was President from World War I through World War II. Frothingham Hall, dedicated to her husband, served the efforts of the Red Cross through all day knitting and sewing sessions. Volunteers made coats, sweaters, pajamas and repaired bandages.&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

She was first President of the [[American Legion Auxiliary]] of Easton in 1920 and maintained an interest in the support of veterans and peace groups throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Her devotion to the Unity Church of Easton, Massachusetts was noteworthy. Along with her mother and siblings Oliver, Frederick, John and Helen, she gave the oak screen and pulpit at the front of the church and also the [[Charles Jay Connick]] stained glass window above the main entrance. The oak carving is that of artist [[Johannes Kirchmayer]] and designed by Boston architect Henry Vaughan. She was Trustee of the Village Cemetery, located behind the church, from 1900 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ames Free Library]] in North Easton, MA benefited greatly from Mary’s involvement and care. Beginning in 1900, she frequented the library often and would update any technology to suit modern day needs. For example, she introduced and paid for the first new typewriter and card catalog.  She served as President of the Library from 1929 to 1955. Her portrait is hanging in the library to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, she gave each child in town, grades 4 through 12, a thrift card and stamp to foster as interest in patriotism during wartime. She hosted a Christmas party each year for the grammar school students in Easton and provided a gift for each one. The event was held every Christmas for forty years and was reduced to only serving North Easton Grammar School kindergarten after her death. It was eventually phased out as the population and number of schools increased. She installed lockers and showers in the Anna C. Ames Gymnasium, assumed mortgages on homes in Easton that were considered a great risk and paid for the cost of dormitory life at [[Bridgewater State University]] for the daughter of her estate superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;Ames E. 2011, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Her affection for gardens and public parks was evident in her charitable contributions and causes she supported. The garden at her home was large and well-kept. She commissioned landscape architect Herbert J. Kellaway to design the layout. Harriett Risley Foote, celebrated rosarian, selected the roses and supervised their planting. In 1924, the American Rose Society honored her rose garden with a visit during their annual meeting. In addition, she encouraged a home garden program for local school children. She donated to the [[Arnold Arboretum]] in Boston and she was one of the few patrons allowed to drive through the park. Frothingham Park, a memorial to her husband’s baseball career as Captain at Harvard, was dedicated on September 27, 1930. The YMCA and Oliver Ames High School utilized the park for sporting events until the 1980s. There stands a playground for young children, a baseball field surrounded by a track and tennis courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ames D. 2017, p.72-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boston Transcript 1924, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wayside==
[[File:Mary's home, Wayside (Easton town offices).jpg|thumb|Mary's home, Wayside (Easton town offices)]]
Her Georgian Revival style mansion known as ’Wayside’ was built in 1912. Designed by Boston architect [[Guy Lowell]], Wayside now serves as the Easton town offices.&lt;ref&gt;Varella 1978, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal==
Following the sudden death of her husband, G.O.P. leaders requested that Mary become a candidate to the 14th district office of representative in Congress. She declined the offer, citing her love of North Easton and her family and desire to remain devoted to local organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Brockton Enterprise 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New York City Police Museum (NYCPM)''' features the history and contributions of the [[New York City Police Department]], established in 1845. The museum is located in [[Lower Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], near [[Wall Street]] and the [[South Street Seaport]]. While one of the museum's primary focuses is a memorial to [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]],&lt;ref name="mize"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&amp;p_theme=saec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F0B3CF7C02BF06B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=New York Police Museum will Memorialize Sept. 11|accessdate=2008-06-11|date=2001-12-28|author=Verenea Dobnik|work=San Antonio Express-News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum contains a wide range of information on the history of the NYPD. The museum, which grew from a gallery housed at the [[New York City Police Academy]], opened at [[26 Broadway]] at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in January 2000 and re-opened in a new location at 100 Old Slip, former home of the First Precinct, in January 2002.  In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused substantial damage at 100 Old Slip, and the museum reopened on October 24, 2013 at 45 Wall Street. That location closed in 2014 and the museum's future plans are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;The New York City Police Museum, http://www.nycpm.org&lt;/ref&gt;

It also allows visitors to simulate a police firefight, and judges whether or not the shooting was correct,&lt;ref name="blocks"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-49151233.html|title=Police Museum Opens Blocks from World Trade Center site|accessdate=2008-06-11|publisher=Associated Press|date=2001-12-27|author=Verena Dobnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing civilians to have some understanding of situations that police face and provide them with a better understanding of the work of police officers than that provided by the media. Its exhibits are not without controversy, and city historians have accused the museum of omitting coverage of more controversial aspects of NYPD history.

==Planning==
[[Image:New York City Police Museum Exhibition (WTM by official-ly cool 016).jpg|right|thumb|Police uniforms on display in the museum]]

On February 16, 1998, plans for a police museum were unveiled when then-[[Police commissioner|Police Commissioner]] [[Howard Safir]] and the Alliance for Downtown New York (the local [[Business improvement district]]) made $5 million available for the museum in return for a new police substation in [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="briefh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/04/22/2001-04-22_brief_history_of_the_new_yor.html|title=Brief History of the New York City Police Museum|accessdate=2008-06-11|date=2001-04-22|work=New York Daily News}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the museum was criticized and classified by some as the buying of police protection for a given area at the expense of another that could not afford to broker a similar deal. As a result, [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] cancelled the funding for the museum two days later.&lt;ref name="burn"/&gt; In March of the same year, the New York City Police Museum [[non-profit]] corporation was created, and in April 1999, the museum opened, although the official unveiling was not held until January 19, 2000.&lt;ref name="briefh"/&gt;

As of its January 2000 opening, the museum was privately run with support from the city, including more than ten years of free rent&lt;ref name="burn"/&gt; and staffing by police officers.&lt;ref name="downt"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E2D9153DF933A15752C0A9669C8B63|title=City Police Museum Opens Downtown|accessdate=2008-06-11|date=2000-01-20|author=Jayson Blair|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private donors provided more than $2 million for the construction of the museum, while the city contributed $1 million.&lt;ref name="burn"/&gt; The museum has been criticized by some who believe it glosses over some of the low moments of the department in its quest to show the good work of the Department.&lt;ref name="burn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900EEDE1E3DF930A15752C0A9669C8B63|title= New York's 'Finest': A Burnished History; Police Museum's Unabashed Mission Is to Back Up a Nickname|accessdate=2008-06-11|date=2000-01-23|author=Kevin Flynn|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new museum replaced a small gallery that had been housed in the police academy on East 20th Street. Among the exhibits brought to the new museum are: a display of the evolution of police uniforms since their inception in 1853, a gun used by [[Al Capone]]'s gang in the 1928 murder of [[Frankie Yale]], the first machine gun used in a [[gangland killing]] in New York,&lt;ref name="show"/&gt; and a gift from [[Italy]] to the City of New York following the assassination of Lieutenant Joseph Petrosino in [[Sicily]] in 1909, the only member of NYPD to be killed in the line of duty on foreign soil.&lt;ref name="burn"/&gt; Other exhibits include a green and white radio car, antique [[firearm]]s and a wooden desk from the 46th Precinct in [[Morris Heights, Bronx|Morris Heights]], [[The Bronx]].&lt;ref name="show"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2000/01/20/2000-01-20_finest_show_in_town_cops_pre.html|title=Finest Show in Town|accessdate=2008-06-11|date=2000-01-20|author=John Marzulli|work=New York Daily News}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Slip location==
[[File:NYCPM van jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Patrol Wagon on display outside]]
In January 2002, the museum re-opened in a new location on Old Slip, closer to [[South Street Seaport]]. The new premises, appropriately, were the old First Precinct Building, designed by the partnership of [[Richard Howland Hunt]] and [[Joseph Howland Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;The brothers, who established their partnership in 1901, and were better known for their elegant Long Island and Newport residences, were the sons of [[Richard Morris Hunt]].&lt;/ref&gt; and built in 1909-11.

==Controversy==

The museum has been mired in controversy since its start. Then-police chief [[Howard Safir]] faced criticism for a deal, later rejected, with a business group that offered to pay for renovations at the museum in exchange for a police substation in the financial district.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/21/nyregion/police-museum-has-its-staff-overhauled.html|title=Police Museum Has Its Staff Overhauled|first=William K.|last=Rashbaum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally Safir staffed the museum with 17 paid officers; by 2001, that number was cut to nine. 

In 2001, museum director Sgt. Thomas Gambino and a lieutenant were revealed to be driving expensive automobiles leased by the museum, a private institution. They were also using prime office space near the museum at without paying rent, another violation of police regulations that prohibit officers from accepting gifts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They and along with several officers were reassigned to other police duties.

Nolita is bounded on the north by [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]], on the east by the [[Bowery]], on the south roughly by [[Broome Street (Manhattan)|Broome Street]], and on the west by [[Lafayette Street (Manhattan)|Lafayette Street]].  It lies east of [[SoHo]], south of [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]], west of the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], and north of [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] and [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/realestate/articles/neighborhoods/noho.htm "Neighborhood Profile: Nolita &amp; Little Italy"] on the ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==
{{POV section|date=July 2018}}
The neighborhood was long regarded as part of Little Italy, but has lost its recognizable Italian character in recent decades because of rapidly rising rents.&lt;ref name=smaller /&gt; Most of the longtime residents despise the portmanteau that was forced on the neighborhood by the real estate conglomerates and the media. Many elderly descendants of Italian immigrants continue to be pushed out of the neighborhood by greedy landlords that circumvent the rent control laws .  Moreover, the [[Feast of San Gennaro]], dedicated to [[Saint Januarius]] ("pope of Naples"), is held in the neighborhood every year following Labor Day, on Mulberry Street between Houston and Grand Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About San Gennaro|url=http://www.sangennaro.org/about.htm|work=Feast of San Gennaro|accessdate=5 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115220557/http://sangennaro.org/about.htm|archivedate=15 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Historically most of the vendors that participated in the "Feast" lived in the neighborhood, but over the past 10 years have been replaced by mid-west style carnival touts. The feast, as recreated on Elizabeth Street between Prince and Houston, was featured in the film ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''.

In the second half of the 1990s, the neighborhood saw an influx of [[yuppie]]s and an explosion of expensive retail boutiques and trendy restaurants and bars.  After previous unsuccessful tries to pitch the neighborhood as part of SoHo, real estate promoters and others came up with several different names for consideration of this newly upscale neighborhood.  The name that stuck, as documented in an article on May 5, 1996 in the ''[[New York Times]]'' City Section debating various monikers for the newly trendy area, was ''Nolita'', an abbreviation for '''No'''rth of '''L'''ittle '''Ita'''ly.  This name follows the [[portmanteau]] pattern started by [[SoHo]] ('''So'''uth of '''Ho'''uston Street), and [[TriBeCa]] ('''Tri'''angle '''Be'''low '''Ca'''nal Street).

The neighborhood includes [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral]], at the intersection of Mulberry, Mott and Prince Streets, which opened in 1815 and was rebuilt in 1868 after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;  The cornerstone was laid on June 8, 1809. This building served as New York City's [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral until the new [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] was opened on [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, John Murphy. (1908). ''History of St. Patrick's Cathedral Society for the propagation of the faith''. pp. 127–128, 130, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  St. Patrick's Old Cathedral is now a [[parish church]]. In 2010, St. Patrick's Old Cathedral was honored and became The Basilica at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral.

Another neighborhood landmark is the [[Puck Building]], an ornate structure built in 1885 on the corner of Houston and Lafayette Streets, which originally housed the headquarters of the now-defunct ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc-architecture.com/SOH/SOH037.htm "Puck Building"] on the ''New York Architecture'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pol-Clovis, Baron Boël''' (2 August 1868 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1941) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist, Director of the ''[[Usines Gustave Boël]]'' in [[La Louvière]], and [[liberalism|liberal]] politician.

Born in [[La Louvière|Saint-Vaast]], he was a son of [[Gustave Boël]]. He married [[Marthe de Kerchove de Denterghem]].  They had 4 children (3 boys and 1 girl): [[René Boël]] (1899–1990) married first Yvonne Solvay (1896–1930) and later Mathilde de Jonghe d'Ardoye (1909 - 2008); [[Max Boël]] (1901 - 1975) married Anne Guinotte); [[Lucien Boël]] (1903 - ) married Micheline Mallet; and their daughter [[Marie-Anne Boël]] (1909 - 1996) married [[Charles-Emmanuel Janssen]].  
Pol-Clovis youngest sister [[Eva Ernestine Boël]] (1883–1956) married [[Felix Goblet d'Alviella]].

==Career==
When Gustave Boël died in 1912, his son Pol-Clovis carried on the diversification of the family business. One of his most prominent successes in this area was in chemicals with the ''Société anonyme de fabrication des engrais azoté'' (Safea) ([[nitrate]] [[fertilizers]]). Pol-Clovis also invested in [[UCB (company)|Union Chimique Belge (UCB)]], founded by [[Emmanuel Janssen]] (the father of his son-in-law Charles-Emmanuel Janssen), and in [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]], founded by [[Ernest Solvay]], the grandfather of his daughter-in-law [[Yvonne Solvay]].

In 1928, Pol-Clovis Boël founded a financial entity: ''l'Union financière Boël'', ancestor of several financial holdings, such as [[Sofina]], [[Henex]], [[Glaces de Moustier-sur-Sambre]]. After World War I, \Boël entered the world of Belgian finance, taking part in the creation of the [[Bank of Brussels]] and the [[Société Générale de Belgique]]. In 1929, he was granted the title of baron by King [[Albert I of Belgium]].

Pol Clovis died in [[Brussels]] in 1941.

==Personal life==
On 18 March 1993, while a sophomore in college, Marley married his girlfriend Geraldine Khawly. They had a daughter, Eden, and a son, [[Nico Marley|Nico]], a linebacker who played at [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]] and was signed by the [[Washington Redskins]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulanegreenwave.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/nico_marley_838197.html |title=Tulane Green Wave Football |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829092249/http://www.tulanegreenwave.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/nico_marley_838197.html |archivedate=29 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Czarda|first1=Stephen|title=Redskins Sign Linebacker Nico Marley|url=http://www.redskins.com/news/article-1/Redskins-Sign-Linebacker-Nico-Marley/69555778-b3f7-453a-8053-eac6eec15dc8|website=Redskins.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marley met musician [[Lauryn Hill]] in 1996. They had five children:&lt;ref&gt;Laura Checkoway.

Lauryn Hill?|date=2008-08-18|author=Tiffany McGee and Alex Tresniowski|publisher=[[People Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marley and Hill lived apart for most of their relationship, which ended for good in 2009. Marley took temporary custody of their five children while Hill served a three-month prison sentence for tax evasion in 2013.

For years, Hill referred to Marley as her husband, but they never married.&lt;ref name="The Master Copy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themastercopy.com/2013/05/13/rohan-marley-will-take-care-of-kids-when-lauryn-goes-to-jail/ |title=Rohan Marley will take care of kids when Lauryn goes to jail |date=2013-05-13 |publisher=The Master Copy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407092945/http://themastercopy.com/2013/05/13/rohan-marley-will-take-care-of-kids-when-lauryn-goes-to-jail/ |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' suggested that Marley had never divorced Khawly. However, in 2011, Marley produced a Haitian divorce decree which demonstrated that he had divorced Khawly in 1996.&lt;ref name="The Avah Taylor Company"/&gt;

Marley was briefly engaged to [[Isabeli Fontana]], but the engagement ended in early 2013.&lt;ref name="Rohan Marley Ends Engagement"/&gt;

'''Rudolphus Franciscus Marie "Ruud" Lubbers''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈryt ˈlʏbərs|-|Nl-Ruud Lubbers.ogg}}; 7 May 1939 – 14 February 2018) was a Dutch politician and diplomat who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 4 November 1982 to 22 August 1994 and [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] from 1 January 2001 until 20 February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/feb/15/longest-serving-dutch-prime-minister-ruud-lubbers-dies-1773445.html |title=Longest-serving Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers dies |date=15 February 2018 |work=[[Agence France Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubbers was a member of the [[board of directors]] of Hollandia Corporate for 10 years before being asked to be the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Environment (Netherlands)|Minister of Economic Affairs]] in the [[Den Uyl cabinet|cabinet]] of [[Joop den Uyl]]; he took office on 11 May 1973. After the [[Dutch general election, 1977|1977 election]], he was elected as to the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], serving from 8 June 1977 until 8 September 1977 and again from 22 December 1977 until 4 November 1982. On 7 November 1978, Lubbers was selected to serve as [[parliamentary leader]] for the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], serving from 7 November 1978 until 10 June 1981 and again from 24 August 1981 until 4 November 1982. After the [[Dutch general election, 1982|1982 election]], Prime Minister [[Dries van Agt]] unexpectedly announced his retirement from national politics and stood down as [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] on 13 October 1982, with Lubbers elected to succeed him on 25 October 1982, becoming the youngest Prime Minister in Dutch history.

The [[First Lubbers cabinet]] was formed by a coalition with the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), with Lubbers taking office as Prime Minister on 4 November 1982. With the following [[Dutch general election, 1986|1986 election]], Lubbers, as ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' (top candidate), won nine more seats, the coalition retained its majority, and a cabinet formation resulted in a continuation of the policies with the [[Second Lubbers cabinet]]. For the [[Dutch general election, 1989|1989 election]], Lubbers, once more as Lijsttrekker, won the same number of seats as the previous election, and a coalition formation with the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) was formed that resulted in the [[Third Lubbers cabinet]]. On 29 January 1994, Lubbers announced his retirement from national politics and resigned as Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal. Lubbers remained Prime Minister until the [[First Kok cabinet]] was installed on 22 August 1994; he had served for nearly 12 years.

After his premiership, Lubbers semi-retired from active politics and served as a visiting professor at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Tilburg University]] from 1995 until 2001. Lubbers served as the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] from 1 January 2001 until 20 February 2005, and finally retired from active politics at the age of sixty-five. Following the end of his active political career, Lubbers occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards on international non-governmental organisations ([[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Earth Charter Initiative]], [[Club of Rome]], [[Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands]]).

Lubbers was known for his abilities as a [[team leader]] and [[Consensus decision-making|consensus builder]]. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for rebuilding the [[Economy of the Netherlands|Dutch economy]] after the [[Early 1980s recession|recession in the 1980s]], stimulating [[sustainable development]], reforming [[social security]], and reducing the [[Government budget balance|deficit]]. Lubbers was also active as a [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] activist and as an advocate in promoting sustainable development. He continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman. On 31 January 1995, he was granted the honorary title of [[Minister of State (Netherlands)|Minister of State]]. He remains the youngest and longest-serving Prime Minister of the Netherlands.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rudolphus Franciscus Marie Lubbers was born on 7 May 1939 in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|Province]] of [[South Holland]]. He studied economics at the [[Erasmus Universiteit|Erasmus University Rotterdam]], and was a student of the first [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]] laureate [[Jan Tinbergen]]. As suggested by the title of his 1962 thesis – "The influence of differing productivity trends in various countries on the current account of the balance of payments" – his main interest was in monetary affairs. He originally planned an academic career, but was compelled by family circumstances to join the management of Lubbers' Construction Workshops and Machinery Fabricators Hollandia B.V.

===Politics===
[[File:Ruud Lubbers (1973).jpg|thumb|left|Ruud Lubbers as [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Environment (Netherlands)|Minister of Economic Affairs]] in 1973]]

From 11 May 1973 to 19 December 1977, Ruud Lubbers was Minister of Economic Affairs in the [[Joop den Uyl|Den Uyl]]-government and a member of the Catholic People's Party (KVP). He was an effective, if sometimes somewhat bad-tempered minister. He chose to return to Parliament on the formation of the Van Agt-government in 1977, becoming senior deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the alliance between the KVP and the other two main Christian parties. His career got an unexpected boost when the leader of the parliamentary faction of the CDA, [[Willem Aantjes]], had to resign in 1978 because accusations that he had served in the [[Germanic-SS]] during the [[Second World War]]. Lubbers succeeded him and suddenly found himself in a powerful political position.

In 1982, after the general election won by Prime Minister [[Dries van Agt]], a similar thing happened when Van Agt suddenly announced he would not serve for a third term. Lubbers took over the post. He was the youngest prime minister in Dutch history; he had turned 43 only six months earlier. Major aspects of his time in office included extensive cutbacks in public spending, the launch of far-reaching [[deregulation]] and [[privatization|privatisation]] programs, and a massive demonstration in [[The Hague]] (1983) against the planned installation in the Netherlands of nuclear-armed U.S. [[cruise missile]]s (which was cancelled after all due to arms reduction talks between the US and the Soviet Union).

After leaving office in 1994, Lubbers was put forward as a candidate for the head of [[NATO]], but the U.S. vetoed his appointment. He was on the advisory board of the [[David Marsh (financial specialist)|Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum]] (OMFIF), where he was regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.

Lubbers was regarded by many during his time in office as an ideological heir to [[Margaret Thatcher]]. One of his campaign slogans was: "Meer markt, minder overheid" (more market, less government).

===Ecological activities===
In the follow-up of the [[Earth Summit]] in 1992, Lubbers engaged with the [[Earth Charter Initiative]] in cooperation with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Maurice Strong]]. The [[Earth Charter]] document was launched in the [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague in June 2000. Lubbers was an active member of the international Earth Charter Commission and reached out, especially to youth in the Netherland, with the message of the Earth Charter for a sustainable and peaceful world.

===Academic===
From 1995 to 2000, he taught Globalization Studies at Tilburg University in the Netherlands and at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the United States. He was also vice-chairman of the Independent World Commission on the Oceans and chair of Globus, the Institute for Globalization and Development based in [[Tilburg]].

===UN High Commissioner for Refugees===
At the end of the year 2000, Lubbers was appointed by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]] to succeed [[Sadako Ogata]] as UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

From 1 January 2001, Lubbers headed the UNHCR, which comprised over 5,000 employees who work across the globe, and which was concerned with an estimated 21 million refugees and internally displaced in over 120 countries worldwide. During his tenure, the number of refugees worldwide decreased by almost 22%, from 21.8 million in 2001 to close to 17.1 million at the beginning of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2004/2/403b2afa4/lubbers-welcomes-drop-asylum-numbers-industrialised-countries.html |title=Lubbers welcomes drop in asylum numbers in industrialised countries |last=Colville |first=Rupert |date=24 February 2004 |work=United Nations High Commission on Human Rights |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubbers also favoured a generous refugee policy for the Netherlands, and he was critical of the Foreign Citizens Law (Vreemdelingenwet). He also stabilised the UNHCR's financial situation and greatly increased the financial means for the sheltering of refugees.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

He annually donated some $300,000 to the refugee agency since he assumed his post in 2001, thereby covering his own $167,000 annual salary and travel expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2003/10/81422-general-assembly-extends-term-un-high-commissioner-refugees |title=General Assembly extends term of UN High Commissioner for Refugees |date=6 October 2003 |website=[[United Nations]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual harassment complaint====
In May 2004, Lubbers was accused by Cynthia Brzak, an American UNHCR employee, of [[sexual harassment]] following a meeting in his office that was attended by two other UNHCR staff members. The complaint was reported in the media,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0DB153FF93BA25756C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/L/Lubbers,%20Ruud New York Times 18 May 2004]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Lubbers to inform UNHCR staff about the accusation. On this occasion, he  denied any wrongdoing and rejected the allegation against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article200054229.html |title=Longest-serving Dutch premier, Ruud Lubbers, dies at 78 |last=Corder |first=Mike |date=14 February 2018 |work=News &amp; Observer |access-date=14 February 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215143601/https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article200054229.html |archivedate=15 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2004, the [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS), which was tasked with investigating the accusation, sent its report to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/Onderzoeksrapport.pdf|title=OIOS Investigation report|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Annex 1 p.35"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iowatch.org/supremecourtcase.pdf |title=Supreme Court Annex 1 p.35 |access-date=2008-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131839/http://www.iowatch.org/supremecourtcase.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its public annual report to the UN Secretary-General (presented to the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]]), the OIOS reported concerning the case that it had "submitted a report to the Secretary-General supporting the allegations and recommended that appropriate actions be taken accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/508/29/PDF/N0450829.pdf?OpenElement  A/59/359*  Report of the Office Internal Oversight Services to the UN General Assembly, p. 31]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubbers responded to the OIOS report in a letter setting out to (a) deny acts of sexual harassment or abuse took place; (b) establish that such evidence of the alleged misconduct as is said to exist is insufficient and flawed; and (c) conclude that the report itself would appear to be based on an irregular statutory basis and also flawed by errors of law and reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%201.pdf Lubbers memo pp 2–4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131850/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%201.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}  [http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%202.pdf Lubbers Memo pp 5–8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131925/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%202.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}[http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%203.pdf Lubbers Memo p 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131916/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%203.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubbers asked [[Max van der Stoel]], former [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]], to comment on the confidential report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2005/db050222.doc.htm|title=DAILY PRESS BRIEFING BY THE OFFICE OF THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE SECRETARY-GENERAL AND THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT - Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that "the OIOS report is deficient in objectivity and impartiality." He added "that the only two other persons in the room did not provide evidence confirming the version given by the complainant." Furthermore, he accused UN officials of leaking information to the press and recommended that an investigation of the leaks be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%203.pdf  van der Stoel memo p 1 (after  Lubbers p. 9)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131916/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%203.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}[http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%204.pdf van der Stoel memo pp 2–4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131838/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%204.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary-General reviewed the report and the responses of the High Commissioner and the senior manager to the report, and decided that the complaint could not be substantiated by the evidence and therefore closed the matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0DE153AF935A25754C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times+Topics/People/L/Lubbers,+Ruud|title=Annan Clears Refugee Chief Of Harassment Accusations|first=Fiona Fleck and Warren|last=Hoge|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also reported to have consulted with [[Stephen Schwebel]], an American judge and former President of the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2005/04/16/het-geheime-dossier-van-ruud-lubbers-10470736-a653659 |title=Het geheime dossier van Ruud Lubbers (The secret dossier of Ruud Lubbers) |last=de Guyter |first=Caroline |date=16 April 2005 |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |access-date=14 February 2018 |last2=van de Roer |first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary-General failed to order an investigation of the deliberate leaking by OIOS itself to the media as recommended by Max van der Stoel.

====Resignation====
In February 2005, the case was in the news again when the British daily newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' obtained a copy of the OIOS report and, accompanied by an article by [[Kate Holt]], published its contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/harassment-intimidation-and-secrecy--un-chief-engulfed-in-sex-scandal-483851.html|title=Harassment, intimidation and secrecy - UN chief engulfed in sex|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the report stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;the allegation against Lubbers is substantiated in that Lubbers did engage in unwanted physical contact with the complainant, a subordinate female staff member. New allegations that came to OIOS's attention during the investigation, were also examined and indicate a pattern of sexual harassment by Lubbers, OIOS is also of the view that Lubbers abused his authority as High Commissioner by his intense, pervasive and intimidating attempts to influence the outcome of this Investigation.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Annex 1 p.35"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lubbers met with the Secretary-General on 18 February 2005, and resigned as High Commissioner on Sunday, 20 February 2005, stating to the press: "For more than four years I gave all my energy to UNHCR. To be frank, despite all my loyalty, insult has now been added to injury and therefore I resign as High Commissioner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/un-refugee-chief-resigns-over-sexual-harassment-scandal/ |title=U.N. refugee chief resigns over sexual harassment scandal |last=Higgins |first=Alexander G. |date=20 February 2005 |work=[[Seattle Times]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruud-lubbers-long-serving-dutch-prime-minister-who-trimmed-welfare-state-dies-at-78/2018/02/14/fa148600-11b0-11e8-9065-e55346f6de81_story.html |title=Ruud Lubbers, long-serving Dutch prime minister who trimmed welfare state, dies at 78 |last=Corder |first=Mike |date=14 February 2018 |work=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary-General's office issued a statement the same day which stated that the High Commissioner's resignation was in the best interests of the UNHCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39901-2005Feb20.html|title=U.N. Official Quits in Harassment Case (washingtonpost.com)|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter of resignation, Lubbers stated that his resignation constituted no expression of guilt, but that he had become the victim of smearing, adding that he had resigned "in the interest of the organisation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nos.nl/gfx/nieuws/overig/ResignationLetter.swf Resignation letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131839/http://www.nos.nl/gfx/nieuws/overig/ResignationLetter.swf |date=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2005, Annan reiterated that he had come to the conclusion that "the evidence did not support the accusation" but that, because of ongoing media-pressure, Lubbers' resignation was in the best interests of the UNHCR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B9C2E/(httpNewsByYear_en)/723BEBDF06FF1B43C12570F1004B62EE?OpenDocument Geneva Press Conference 2005-10-10]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to UNHCR staff, Annan wrote: "My decision to accept his resignation should not be interpreted as a finding of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/2/22/161341.shtml NewsMax.com 2005-02-23] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001233141/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/2/22/161341.shtml |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a farewell meeting for Lubbers as High Commissioner for Refugees, he received from Acting High Commissioner [[Wendy Chamberlin]] the first annual UNHCR Achievement Award for exceptional services to UNHCR and for the world's refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unhcr.org.ua/unhcr_bel/news.php?in=1&amp;news_id=68%20High%20Commissioner%20Lubbers%20departs%20UNHCR UNHCR News 25 February 2005 High Commissioner Lubbers departs UNHCR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831220612/http://unhcr.org.ua/unhcr_bel/news.php?in=1&amp;news_id=68%20High%20Commissioner%20Lubbers%20departs%20UNHCR |date=31 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a formal statement, Netherlands Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] called the departure of Lubbers "bitter", since the complaint against him had been dismissed as unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/balkenende-wrang-dat-lubbers-opstapt~a662401/ |title=Balkenende: wrang dat Lubbers opstapt |date=20 February 2005 |work=[[De Volkskrant]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Handling of the UNHCR/SC-UK 2002 report on sexual exploitation in the aid sector in West Africa'''

Three years prior to the controversy over the sexual harassment case, Ruud Lubbers was criticised for his mis-handling of the UNHCR/SC-UK 2002 which uncovered the widespread sexual exploitation of refugee children by aid workers and peacekeepers in three West African countries (Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone). The study team which had encountered these findings unexpectedly whilst conducting a broader assessment documented 67 allegations implicating 40 aid agencies and several peacekeeping battalions, and often involving humanitarian workers and peacekeepers exchanging meagre aid supplies (biscuits, soap, plastic sheeting) for sex with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/uk/partners/partners/3c7cf89a4/note-implementing-operational-partners-unhcr-save-children-uk-sexual-violence.html|title=Note for Implementing and Operational Partners by UNHCR and Save the Children-UK on Sexual Violence &amp; Exploitation: The Experience of Refugee Children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/content/dam/global/reports/health-and-nutrition/sexual_violence_and_exploitation_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Ruud Lubbers' response was to deny these findings, discredit the authors and excuse these behaviours; for example in a CNN interview on 8 May 2002, Lubbers was heard to deny the problem in the face of CNN's own research which confirmed the problem existed and was taken to task by the interviewer for dismissing these exploitative relationships ''inter alia'' as 'romances'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/08/i_ins.01.html|title=CNN.com - Transcripts|website=edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was roundly criticised by his own staff for that interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://odihpn.org/magazine/the-west-africa-sex-scandal/|title=The West Africa sex scandal - ODI HPN|website=odihpn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite repeated attempts by Lubbers to lead a negative campaign against the report, the international community and governments in particular, took the allegations seriously and passed a UN General Assembly resolution A/RES/57/306, 'Investigation into sexual exploitation of refugees by aid workers in West Africa' in May 2003, requiring the UN to take action at the highest level to tackle such abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/561/73/PDF/N0256173.pdf?OpenElement|title=ODS HOME PAGE|first=ODS|last=Team|website=documents-dds-ny.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the UN Secretary-General’s Bulletin, 'Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse' in October 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/focal-points/documents-public/secretary-general-s-bulleting-special-measures-protection-sexual|title=Secretary-General’s Bulletin: Special measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, 2003 - IASC|website=interagencystandingcommittee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an endorsement of the Inter-agency standing Committee's working group on sexual abuse and exploitation which had already been set up a year earlier in June 2002 in response to the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/product-categories/protection-sexual-abuse-and-exploitation|title=Protection from Sexual Abuse and Exploitation - IASC|website=interagencystandingcommittee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informateur===
[[File:Ruud Lubbers 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Ruud Lubbers in June 2016]]

After the fall of the [[Second Balkenende cabinet]], Lubbers became the ''informateur'' for the formation of the [[Demissionary cabinet|demissionary]] interim [[Third Balkenende cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/informateur-lubbers-komt-even-meedenken~a759748/ |title=Informateur Lubbers komt even meedenken |last=du Pré |first=Raoul |date=3 July 2006 |work=[[De Volkskrant]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SA Metal Group''' is [[South Africa|South Africa’s]] oldest and one of its largest [[Metal Recycling|metal recycling]] companies.&lt;ref name="Industry Ban on Cash Payments for Scrap Copper"&gt;{{cite web|last=Writer|first=Staff|title=Ban on Cash Payments|url=http://capetownchamber.com/ban-on-cash-payments-for-scrap-copper/|publisher=Cape Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Wolfe Barnett (1886-1946) in 1919 it has remained a family business into the fourth generation.

The company operates from over ten sites around South Africa collecting and processing scrap metals.&lt;ref name="SA Minesweepers Scrapped"&gt;{{cite news|last=Muller|first=Leon|title=Minesweepers Cut Down For Scrap|url=https://googledrive.com/host/0B5pWE_fTBsq7WTFqMVE2czRjVnM/4%20minesweepers%20cut%20down%20for%20scrap%2007-12-1989%20The%20Argus.jpg|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=7 December 1989|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minesweepers Scrapped by the Navy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reporter|first=Shipping|title=Mine Hunters Ditched|url=https://googledrive.com/host/0B5pWE_fTBsq7WTFqMVE2czRjVnM/mine-hunters%20ditched%2007-12-1989%20Cape%20Times.jpg|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=Cape Times|date=7 December 1989|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; It purchases scrap metals from factories, other industrial companies, dealers&lt;ref name="150 Cars Shredded at SA Metal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Troost|first=Joanna|title=Cars Totally Shredded|url=https://googledrive.com/host/0B5pWE_fTBsq7WTFqMVE2czRjVnM/cars%20totally%20shredded%2021-05-2003%20Tygerburger.jpg|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=Tygerburger|date=21 May 2003|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collectors. Hundreds of thousands of people in South Africa make a living collecting and delivering scrap metal to companies like SA Metal Group.

[[File:SA Metal Processing.jpg|thumb|Recycled steel scrap is melted down in electric induction furnaces before being converted into steel products]]

The company also undertakes heavy demolition and rehabilitation work on the many mines in South Africa which have closed down and must be safely restored to the original condition of the environment.&lt;ref name="SA Metal Green Company"&gt;{{cite web|last=Writer|first=Staff|title=Going Green - SA Metal|url=http://www.expressoshow.com/articles/Going-Green-%E2%80%93-SA-Metal?articleID=545|publisher=Espresso Television Show|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrap metals recovered from such demolition are also sent to the company’s processing yards.&lt;ref name="New Billet Plant at SA Metal In Cape Town"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reporter|first=Staff|title=Scrap Dealer Opens New Billet Plant|url=https://googledrive.com/host/0B5pWE_fTBsq7WTFqMVE2czRjVnM/scrap%20dealer%20opens%20new%20billet%20plant%20in%20cape%20town%2020-05-1999%20Metal%20Bulletin.jpg|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=Metal Bulletin|date=20 May 1999|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also operates its own steel mill in Cape Town manufacturing high-specification steel reinforcing bar for the local construction industry.&lt;ref name="Scrap Metal Volumes Falling Due to Recession"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobson|first=Ari|title=Scrap Metal Industry Feeling The Pinch|url=https://googledrive.com/host/0B5pWE_fTBsq7WTFqMVE2czRjVnM/scrap%20metal%20industry%20feeling%20the%20pinch%2009-09-1992%20Cape%20Times.jpg|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=Cape Times|date=9 September 1992|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the restored body of a [[World War II]] [[Spitfire]] aircraft was mounted at the company’s [[Salt River, Cape Town]] premises where it became a world-famous landmark. In 1988, the Spitfire had to be removed due to deterioration from nearby railway shunting yards and vandals taking shots at it. It was shipped to the UK and sold to a restorer.

The South African government has recently introduced regulations governing the export of scrap metal. It remains to be seen how this will impact on the industry in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3243578/Search/South-Africas-scrap-foundry-industries-face-sweeping.html?PageId=196010&amp;Keywords=south+african+scrap&amp;OrderType=1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seán Diarmiud Gallagher''' (born 7 July 1962) is an Irish businessman and [[reality television]] personality. He was a co-founder in 2000 of Smarthomes, which after initial success, failed in 2008–2010, and Gallagher departed in 2010–11. He was as a panellist on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s ''[[Dragons' Den (Irish TV series)|Dragons' Den]]'' from 2009–2011. Gallagher was an active member of [[Fianna Fáil]] for 30 years from 1981–2011, and sat on its National Executive twice (from 1985–87, and from 2009–11). He spent much of his career before Smarthomes working in Fianna Fáil, and in the Irish public service. Gallagher failed in his [[Irish presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential election]] bid, in which, despite his Fianna Fáil history, he stood as an Independent candidate, and finished second to [[Michael D. Higgins]]. He was again a candidate in the [[Irish presidential election, 2018|2018 presidential election]]; this time he achieved third place.

==Early life and education==
Seán Gallagher was born in [[Monaghan]] town, [[County Monaghan]] in July 1962,{{efn |Several articles on Seán Gallagher list him incorrectly as being born in Ballyhaise, County Cavan; however, he was born in 17 Devin Reilly Terrace in Monaghan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.northernstandard.ie/2011/10/21/gallagher-visits-former-family-home-in-Monaghan/ |title=Gallagher Visits Former Family Home In Monaghan |date=21 October 2011 |publisher=The Northern Standard |quote=Mr Gallagher [...] was born in 17, Devin Reilly Terrace, Monaghan on 7th July 1962.

From September 1974 to June 1980, Gallagher was educated at Saint Mary's National School in Glin and [[St Patrick's College, Cavan|Saint Patrick's College]] in [[Cavan]]. Following his [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Certificate]] in June 1980, he attended [[Ballyhaise College|Teagasc Agricultural College]], in Ballyhaise, County Cavan where he received a National Certificate in Agriculture in June 1981.  He said that he then worked on the college farm until a car accident in June 1983, which required a period of rehabilitation.{{efn|In interviews, Gallagher refers to his year-long recovery from the car accident as being motivated by a new-found commitment to physical fitness.&lt;ref name="egan"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/through-the-eyes-of-a-dragon-26634131.html/ |title=Through the eyes of a Dragon|author=Barry Egan|publisher=Irish Independent|date=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="sg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://betterbusiness.ie/sean-gallagher-way-see/ |title="Better Business: Seán Gallagher" |date=2016 |publisher=BetterBusiness |quote=After school, he attended the local agricultural college. His first job was working with the college and he had a small farm for a while. Then in 1983, he was in a car accident which took him on a bit of a detour. He went back to college in Maynooth University, trained as a youth worker and spent the next several years in the public sector.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1985, Gallagher went to [[Maynooth University]] where he earned a Diploma in Youth Work and Community Development in June 1987.

During his tenure as Assistant CEO{{efn|name="it"}} of the Louth Country Enterprise Board (1995–2000), Gallagher studied for a Diploma in Management in the [[Dundalk Institute of Technology]] from 1997–1999, after which Gallagher then completed an MBA in 2000, at the [[University of Ulster]].&lt;ref name="sg1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/news/sean-cares-about-ireland-and-its-people-27805639.html |title=Seán cares about Ireland and its people |date=20 October 2010 |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |author=Anne Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service career==
Much of Gallagher's early career from circa 1988 to June 2000, from when he was age 26 to when he was age 38, involved working with various Irish State bodies and departments.  It is not clear whether these roles are full-time or part-time, and the non-public service activities he was engaged in (e.g. he is recorded as stating that he was a fitness instructor and massage therapist in the 1990s&lt;ref name="it1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/sean-gallaghers-secret-past-revealed-he-was-an-aerobics-instructor-26783803.html|title=Seán Gallagher's secret past revealed - he was an aerobics instructor|date=16 September 2018|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

From 1988 to 1990, Gallagher said he worked as a Project Co-ordinator for the [[National Youth Council of Ireland]] and the [[Department of Health (Ireland)|Department of Health]], and that he was the author of ''Drink Awareness for Young People'', Ireland's first national alcohol education programme.&lt;ref name="egan"/&gt; From 1990 to 1993, Gallagher worked as a full-time [[Political consulting|political advisor]] to then [[Fianna Fáil]] TD and [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]]{{efn|name="rory"|Gallagher says in interviews that it was while he was working at the Department of Health that he met Rory O'Hanlon}} [[Rory O'Hanlon]].&lt;ref name="InterTrade"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our People – Board members|url=http://www.intertradeireland.com/aboutus/ourpeople/boardmembers/|work=InterTradeIreland|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon's Den star Seán Gallagher on the Ógra Fianna Fáil National Youth Conference |url=http://www.fiannafail.ie/blog/entry/dragons-den-star-sean-gallagher-on-the-ogra-fianna-fail-national-youth-conf/ |accessdate=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709025404/http://www.fiannafail.ie/blog/entry/dragons-den-star-sean-gallagher-on-the-ogra-fianna-fail-national-youth-conf |archivedate=9 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After O'Hanlon lost his cabinet minister position when [[Albert Reynolds]] came to power in Fianna Fáil in 1992, Gallagher said that he was an Enterprise Officer for the [[Blanchardstown]] Area Development Partnership from 1993 to 1995.

==Business career==
===Smarthomes Limited (2000–2010)===
In June 2000, Gallagher, aged 38, left the Louth County Enterprise Board ("LCEB") to set up a company called Home Wiring Systems Limited ("HWSL") with electrical tool-maker, Derek Roddy.&lt;ref name="it1"/&gt;  HWSL's plan was to provide the electrical systems modern homes needed (e.g. broadband systems, heating systems, alarm systems etc.), and HWSL would be, in effect, an electrical contractor.  In 2001, HWSL got a start-up loan of €25,395 from the LCEB.{{efn|name="LCEB"|The Louth County Entreprise Bord ("LCEB") seed-loan would be a source of controversy during the 2011 Presidential election as it was revealed that Smarthomes asserted that the loan was not repayable as it was "left" in HWSL; however in an RTÉ interview during the campaign, Gallagher stated that when the LCEB asserted their rights in 2005, that a confidential settlement was reached in 2008.

===State Boards (2007–2012)===
On 13 December 2007, Fianna Fáil [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment]] [[Mary Coughlan (politician)|Mary Coughlan]] appointed him to the Board of [[InterTradeIreland]], a North-South Irish trade body, until 2011.&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://intertradeireland.com/app/uploads/2018/03/InterTradeIreland-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2007.pdf|title=InterTradeIreland: Annual Report 2007|publisher=[[InterTradeIreland]]|date=December 2007|quote=Board Member: SEAN GALLAGHER}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was some controversy that his appointment came after the successful re-election of Fianna Fáil parliamentary party Chairman, [[Séamus Kirk]], in the May 2007 general election, for whom Gallagher was Director of Elections; and also that InterTradeIreland invested €41,970 into ''Smarthomes'' in 2007, and that Gallagher had attended only 22 of the 36 Board meetings during his tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gallagher-sat-on-board-of-quango-that-gave-his-firm-cash-26782270.html | title=Gallagher sat on board of quango that gave his firm cash | date=15 October 2011 | publisher=[[Irish Independent]] | author1=Michael Brennan | author2=Eimear Ni Bhraonain | quote=He was appointed to the board of North-South body Intertrade Ireland at the end of 2007 -- and annual accounts for that year reveal they gave €41,970 to his Smart Homes company.

In October 2008, Gallagher was announced as an investor on the [[RTÉ One]] version of ''[[Dragons' Den (Irish TV series)|Dragons' Den]]''.

The Irish Times described his performance as: "he struggled to give his idea play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/presidential-debate-gives-viewers-few-talking-points-1.611312|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=Paul Cullen|title=Presidential debate gives viewers few talking points|date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 October 2011, the second main opinion poll, from RED C, ranked Gallagher 2nd, behind Higgins, at 20%.

As Gallagher rose in the polls in October, scrutiny came on his business dealings, and Fianna Fáil heritage (which were linked via State grants, and State Board appointments).  Attention came to the €830,000 in State grants Smarthomes received, which exceeded to the total profits the company made for Gallagher;{{efn|name="z1"|Journalists revealed the Smarthomes accounts showed that the combined Irish State grant loans of €830,000, and the €750,000 of BES investor loans, exceeded the total cumulative profits that Smarthomes made up to 2010, and exceeded the total earnings (salary, rent and royalties) that Gallagher, and his co-founder Derek Roddy, took from the business,&lt;ref name="it1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it2"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="it1"/&gt; and that his previous employer, the LCEB, had seed-funded his business with €25,395; and that Gallagher had tried to avoid repaying this seed-funding.{{efn|name="LCEB"}} His appointment to three State Boards, some after being elected to the Fianna Fáil National Executive in 2009, were noted, however, Gallagher responded that he donated some of the State Board fees to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1003/breaking34.html |title= Gallagher, Davis reveal earnings | author1 =Harry McGee | author2 = Marie O'Halloran |date=3 October 2011 |work= [[The Irish Times]] |accessdate= 3 October 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111003201221/https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1003/breaking34.html | archivedate = 2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After avoiding criticising Fianna Fáil, Gallagher said: "the party had moved away from the grassroots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/gallagher-distances-himself-from-ff-1.885206 |title= Gallagher distances himself from FF |publisher= [[Irish Times]] |author=Barry Roche | date=13 October 2011 | quote=Asked by Miriam O'Callaghan on the Prime Time debate if he felt Fianna Fáil had let the country down, Mr Gallagher said that he could not answer for Fianna Fáil, but today he moved to counter suggestions that he had been equivocal on the issue.

After three further television debates on 4, 11 and 12 October 2011, a 16 October RED C poll, ranked Gallagher 1st with 39% of the poll, with Higgins 2nd with 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1015/president.html|title=Poll shows Gallagher leading Áras race |date=17 October 2011|work=RTÉ News|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After three television and radio debates on 18, 22 and 24 October, Gallagher would maintain this rank, and increase polling to 40% by the final RED C poll on 22 October 2011, and the final MRBI poll on 23 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/gallagher-extends-lead-in-latest-presidential-opinion-polls-260880-Oct2011/|title=Gallagher extends lead in latest Áras opinion polls |date=24 October 2011|work=Journal.ie|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, 24 October, three days before the election, Gallagher suffered a severe setback in the final debate on [[Pat Kenny]]'s ''[[The Frontline (Irish TV programme)|The Frontline]]'', watched by an audience of 900,000.&lt;ref name="patl"/&gt;  Martin McGuinness said that he had been contacted by an unnamed man (later verified as fuel-seller, Hugh Morgan), who would confirm that Gallagher had collected a cheque for €5,000 after a 2008 Fianna Fáil fund-raiser, which Gallagher had previously denied.&lt;ref name="patl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/how-se%C3%A1n-gallagher-nearly-became-president-of-ireland-in-2011-1.3611550|title=How Seán Gallagher nearly became president of Ireland in 2011|date=29 August 2018|author=Pat Leahy|publisher=[[Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jody"/&gt;  Later in the show, Kenny, read out a tweet live on air, subsequently proven to be from an anonymous source, that the unnamed man would hold a press conference next day.{{efn|The Irish Independent reported: At 10.39pm, a tweet was posted to a Twitter feed "#aras11".

On 27 October 2011, Gallagher received 28.5% of first preference votes in the election, leaving him in second place behind Michael D. Higgins.

[[File:'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - ie - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|300px|As [[James Gillray]], the artist of this 1797 etching, died in 1815, his works are in the [[public domain]] throughout the world. However, under the "sweat of the brow" doctrine, new copyright claims could be made over mechanical reproductions of the etching, due to the skill and labor involved in the reproduction.]]

'''Sweat of the brow''' is an [[intellectual property]] [[Legal doctrine|law doctrine]], chiefly related to [[copyright]] law. According to this doctrine, an [[author]] gains rights through  simple diligence during the creation of a work, such as a database, or a directory. Substantial creativity or "originality" is not required.

Under a "sweat of the brow" doctrine, the creator of a copyrighted work, even if it is completely unoriginal, is entitled to have his effort and expense protected, and no one else may use such a work without permission, but must instead recreate the work by independent research or effort. The classic example is a [[telephone directory]]. In a "sweat of the brow" jurisdiction, such a directory may not be copied, but instead a competitor must independently collect the information to issue a competing directory. The same rule generally applies to databases and lists of facts.

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have traditionally used the similar but not identical concept of ''[[droit d'auteur]]''. [[European Union law]] tends to harmonize the protection of intellectual property throughout member states and the doctrine thus gains more influence. In the Databases Directive 96/9/EC{{emdash}}the [[Member State of the European Union|member states of the EU]] are obliged to confer protection known as the [[database right]] on non-original databases, that is on those that embody no creativity, but are a consequence of substantial investment (financial, labour etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonnanwalt.de/rg/internet/law/eu/RiLi96-9-eg.html EU Richtlinie 96/9/EG] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621055429/http://www.bonnanwalt.de/rg/internet/law/eu/RiLi96-9-eg.html |date=2007-06-21 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In a traditional [[English language|English]] [[idiom]], the ''sweat of one's brow'' refers to the effort expended in labor, and the value created thereby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.page.sh?page=1457|page=1457|accessdate=2007-05-30|work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913 ed)|title=Sweat, v. t.|publisher=ARTFL Project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303004057/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.page.sh?page=1457|archivedate=2006-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is famously used in English translations of {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Genesis|chapter=3|verse=19}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlivingtranslation.com/05discoverthenlt/ssresults.asp?txtSearchString=Genesis+3|accessdate=2007-05-30|title=New Living Translation|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, inc.|quote=By the sweat of your brow will you have food to eat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law doctrine takes its name from this idiom.

==By country==

===United States===
{{see also|Copyright law in the United States}}
The [[United States]] rejected this doctrine in the 1991 [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|499|340|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; until then it had been upheld in a number of US copyright cases.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Under the ''Feist'' ruling in the US, mere collections of facts are considered unoriginal and thus not protected by copyright, no matter how much work went into [[collation|collating]] them. The arrangement and presentation of a collection may be original, but not if it is "simple and obvious" such as a list in [[alphabetical]] or [[chronological]] order.

===United Kingdom===
Under the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]], for copyright to subsist in a work, that work must be original. However, courts have not adopted a literal reading of this requirement. For over a hundred years, English courts have held that a significant expenditure of labour is sufficient. The consequence of this is that if A makes a work, in which copyright subsists, and B subsequently adds his skill, judgement and labour, altering the form of A's work, B will potentially have a copyright in the work he produces. This suggests that copyright is not about protecting ideas, because one can acquire a copyright by expending skill, labour, and judgement, but no creativity or inventiveness.

However, in March 2012, a case was taken to the [[European Court of Justice]], in which [[Football DataCo]] claimed [[copyright infringement]] over web sites which were reproducing match schedules from several major [[association football|football]] leagues. Football DataCo asserted that these schedules were copyrighted works due to the skill and labour involved in their preparation, and that the company was given exclusive rights to license their reproduction. Based on its interpretation of British law, the court rejected the notion that labour and skill was enough to grant protection to a work, since "unless the procedures for creating the lists concerned as described by the national court are supplemented by elements reflecting originality in the selection or arrangement of the data contained in those lists, they do not suffice for those lists to be protected by the copyright laid down in the directive."&lt;ref name=bbcn-dataco&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Bill|title=Football match fixture list copyright claim rejected|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17218968|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a copyright notice on 'digital images, photographs and the internet' last updated in November 2015, the UK [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]] confirmed that digital reproductions of [[public domain]] images are not protected by copyright, arguing that "according to the Court of Justice of the European Union which has effect in UK law, copyright can only subsist in subject matter that is original in the sense that it is the author’s own ‘intellectual creation’. Given this criterion, it seems unlikely that what is merely a retouched, digitised image of an older work can be considered as ‘original’."&lt;ref name=IPO-cnote&gt;{{cite web|author=UK Intellectual Property Office|title=Copyright Notice: digital images, photographs and the internet|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/481194/c-notice-201401.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
In ''[[Walter v Lane]]'' (1900) (Pre-CDPA), reporters took shorthand notes of a speech, punctuated them, etc. and published them in the [[The Times|''Times'']] newspaper. The court held that the reporters were authors of the published speech, and, as such, owned a copyright in the published speeches, because of the considerable skill, labour, and judgement they exercised.

In ''[[University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;University of London Press v University Tutorial [1916] 2 Ch 601&lt;/ref&gt; the question arose as to whether certain mathematics exam papers were original literary works. The exam papers just consisted of conventional maths problems in a conventional manner. The court held that originality does not mean that the work must be an expression of individual thought. The simple fact that the authors drew on a body of knowledge common to mathematicians did not compromise originality. The requirement of originality, it was held, does not require that expression be in an original or novel form. It does, however, require that the work not be copied from another work. It must originate from the author.
As such, even though these were the same old maths problems every student is familiar with, and even though there was no creative input, the skill, labour, and judgement of the authors was sufficient to make the papers original literary works.

In ''[[Cummins v Bond]]'', a psychic in a trance claimed to have written down what spirits told her, through a process of [[automatic writing]]. In court, she accepted that she was not the creative author of the writing. The creative input, had, presumably, come from the spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Patry |url=http://williampatry.blogspot.gr/2005/08/authorship-and-religion.html |title=The Patry Copyright Blog: Authorship and Religion |publisher=Williampatry.blogspot.gr |date=2005-08-10 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the court held that she had exercised sufficient labour and skill in translating and transcribing what the spirits told her, so she had a copyright in the resulting literary work.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Germany===
In certain cases, German law grants ancillary copyrights (''Leistungsschutzrecht'') due to the effort involved in the production or exploitation of creative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nolte|first1=Georg|title=Zur Forderung der Presseverleger nach Einführung eines speziellen Leistungsschutzrechts: Eine kritische Auseinandersetzung|journal=Zeitschrift für Geistiges Eigentum|date=1 July 2010|volume=2|issue=2|pages=165–195|doi=10.1628/186723710792175149|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mohr/zge/2010/00000002/00000002/art00002|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a [[Landgericht Berlin|regional court in Berlin]] ruled that digitized versions of public domain paintings were entitled to new copyrights due to the effort and expertise necessary to create the reproductions. The case is being appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moody|first1=Glyn|title=Digitising public domain images creates a new copyright, rules German court [Updated]|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/06/digitising-public-domain-images-creates-a-new-copyright-germany/|website=Ars Technica UK|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Reiss-Engelhorn Museum (REM) of the City of Mannheim v.

===Israel===
Israeli law requires that a work exhibit some [[threshold of originality|degree of originality]] in order to be copyrightable. In other words, Israeli law does not subscribe to the "sweat of the brow" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Tempska, Urzula (2002). [http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=iplr "'Originality' After the Dead Sea Scrolls Decision: Implications for the American Law of Copyright"]. ''Marquette Intellectual Property Law Review'' '''6''' (1): 132.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amount of originality required is minimal, and the transliteration or interpretation of an artifact is covered by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin-Koren, Niva (2001).

[[File:Washington Street Plaza - 2.JPG|thumb|Washington Street Plaza]]
[[File:Washington Street Plaza - 1.JPG|thumb|Washington Street Plaza at Albany and Washington Streets]]
The '''Washington Street Plaza''' is a [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrian plaza]] along [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] between Carlisle and [[Albany Street (Manhattan)|Albany Street]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s on the west side of the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. It opened on May 23, 2013.&lt;ref name="de"&gt;{{cite news|work=Downtown Express|title=Washington Street to gain public plaza|url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/2012/11/14/washington-street-to-gain-public-plaza/||author=Aline Reynolds | date=November 14, 2012 | accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

With an [[epoxy]] gravel placed over the street, it contains granite blocks, red chairs, tables, and potted plants.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

Its construction was delayed for several years and debated within [[Manhattan Community Board 1]], although it was ultimately approved by the executive committee. The [[Alliance for Downtown New York]], the [[Business Improvement District]] led by [[Elizabeth H. Berger]], argued that the plaza would, according to the [[Downtown Express]], "improve pedestrian mobility" around the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|September 11 Memorial]] and allow the Alliance to install a tourist kiosk. Referring to the Alliance's report "Five Principles for Greenwich South," which advocated for the plaza, she said: “One of the things that we looked at was how to capitalize on the old-world geometry of the street plan to create a sense of destination and gathering places.... There’ll be an attractive space not only for visitors but for people who live and work in the area to congregate.” Some residents believed, however, that "it would disrupt traffic and complicate an already crowded area."&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

The administration of former Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], through Jeffrey Mandel, an adviser to Deputy Mayor [[Robert K. Steel]], also advanced that the plaza would benefit residents of the Downtown neighborhood while helping to mitigate foot traffic from tourists. He said, "[the plaza] pushes a couple of big dominos forward by creating a place that's not just attractive and desirable for the folks down here but that has beneficial impacts in the way of mitigation."&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

The plaza's construction was delayed by [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Representing the exiting Bloomberg administration, Mandel said, "We think it's important to make our best efforts in our last hours in the neighborhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Tribeca Trib|title=City to Turn Drab Stretch of Washington into Pedestrian Plaza|url=http://tribecatrib.com/content/city-turn-drab-stretch-washington-pedestrian-plaza||author=Jessica Terrell | accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Activists for the recognition of the history of the [[Lower West Side, Manhattan|Lower West Side]] and the [[Little Syria]] neighborhood have argued that the plaza would be an ideal place for historical signage. In anticipation of its construction, they pursued a resolution in support of signage from Community Board 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Huffington Post]]|title=Washington Street Plaza in 'Little Syria' Should Be Opportunity for New York|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-fine/nyc-little-syria_b_3283834.html||author=Todd Fine | date=May 20, 2013 | accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Zulhasnan joined the [[Royal Malaysian Air Force]] as a fighter pilot and retired in 1985 with the rank of Major (Squadron leader in other countries) before entering politics.&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt;

==Politics==
Zulhasnan debuted in the [[Malaysian general election, 1999|1999 Malaysian general election]] and won the Wangsa Maju seat to be elected as a Member of Parliament. In the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 general election]], he contested and won the Setiawangsa parliamentary seat. On 27 March 2004, following a cabinet reshuffle by [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], the Federal Territory and [[Klang Valley]] Planning and Development Division was upgraded to a full-fledged ministry. Its responsibility expanded to include jurisdiction over the territories of [[Labuan]] and [[Putrajaya]]. Zulhasnan was the first deputy minister to be appointed to the ministry.

[[Mohd Isa Abdul Samad]] was the first minister to be appointed. However, Isa was dismissed from office after he was found guilty of corruption charges related to money politics during the [[UMNO]] General Assembly Election of 2005. [[Shahrizat Abdul Jalil]] (then the [[Minister of Women, Family and Community Development (Malaysia)|Minister for Women, Family and Community Development]]) assumed the responsibilities of acting minister until a replacement could be found.

On 16 February 2006, Zulhasnan was appointed the Federal Territories Minister.&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt; Under the leadership of Zulhasnan, a strategic plan that focused on development plans for all three Federal Territories was created. In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 election]], he was reelected again as a Member of Parliament. He was dropped from the new cabinet on 9 April 2009 by [[Najib Abdul Razak]] who took over as the 6th Prime Minister. He was not chosen by Barisan Nasional to recontest the Setiawangsa seat in the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/setiawangsa-zulhasnan-not-one-to-rest-on-his-laurel/|title=Setiawangsa : Zulhasnan not one to rest on his laurels|last=Lingham|first=Mitra|date=3 April 2013|work=The Malaysian Times|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed as the [[Malaysian Ambassador to the United States]], replacing [[Awang Adek Hussin]] in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiandigest.com/frontpage/29-4-tile/650202-former-ft-minister-zulhasnan-appointed-as-the-new-malaysian-ambassador-to-united-states.html|title=Former FT Minister Zulhasnan Appointed As The New Malaysian Ambassador To United States|work=Malaysian Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he resigned in April 2018 to contest in the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 election]] the Setiawangsa constituency again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/04/28/barisans-zulhasnan-making-a-comeback-in-setiawangsa/|title=Barisan’s Zulhasnan making a comeback in Setiawangsa|author= Intan Farhana Zainul|first=|last=|date=28 April 2018|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the huge swing of votes to the now-governing coalition [[Pakatan Harapan]], he lost and failed to win back his former parliamentary seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/bns-big-names-toppled-one-after-another|title=Malaysia Votes 2018: BN's big names toppled, one after another|first=Nadirah|last=H.
