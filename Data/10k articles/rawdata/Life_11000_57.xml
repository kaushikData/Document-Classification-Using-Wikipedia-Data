'''Andrés Alejandro Palomeque González'''&lt;ref name="Ovacinones21536"/&gt; (July 1, 1971 – March 22, 2009) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Lucha libre|Luchador]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "masked [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]"). He is best known for appearing under the [[ring name|stage name]] '''Abismo Negro''', which is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Black Abyss" or "black hole", in the [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. Before appearing under the ring name Abismo Negro, Palomeque worked for five years under the alias "[the] Winners" and before that also wrestled as the characters "Alex Dinamo", "Pequeño Samurai", and "Furor" for short periods. Palomeque owned and operated the ''Gimnasio Abismo Negro'', a wrestling school where individuals were trained to become professional wrestlers.

In his professional wrestling career, Palomeque worked for the two most prominent professional wrestling promotions in Mexico: [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) and AAA. He also worked for the North American–based promotions the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) due to talent exchange programs between AAA and WWF in 1997 and TNA in 2004, as well as making appearances for the [[Michinoku Pro]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] promotions in [[Japan]]

On March 22, 2009, Palomeque was found dead in a river near [[El Rosario, Sinaloa|El Rosario]], [[Sinaloa]]; the official cause of death was listed as drowning. On the night before, a wrestler using the Abismo Negro outfit worked an AAA show pretending to be Palomeque; this incident caused the promoter to be barred from promoting shows for two years. Palomeque was inducted into the [[AAA Hall of Fame]] in June 2013.

==Early life==
Andrés Alejandro Palomeque González was born July 1, 1971, in [[Villahermosa, Tabasco]], [[Mexico]]. Palomeque started to get interested in professional wrestling at the age of nine when his father, Juan Francisco Palomeque Torres, took him to his first wrestling event. Later the Palomeque Family moved to Poza Rica where a young Palomeque took up [[Pentathlon]] ([[long jump]], [[high jump]], 110 metres [[hurdling|hurdles run]], [[shot put]], 1500 metres run) in school.&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt;&lt;ref name="NoruegoInterview"/&gt; He and his brother, César Palomeque, had an interest in Martial Arts and trained together for years.&lt;ref name=DosdeTres&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/especial-abismo-negro.html|title=El material inédito de Abismo Negro|date=2009-05-14|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=AAA|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525141038/http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/especial-abismo-negro.html|archive-date=2009-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Palomeque was thirteen years old he began working in a gymnasium where professional wrestlers were trained, initially he paid for the use of the gymnasium by cleaning it after hours. When the family moved back to the Tabasco region he began training under Don Nerio Soto, who worked under the ring name ''El Noruego'' (the [[Norway|Norwegian]]), and his brother Delio Soto to become a luchador, or professional wrestler. Professional wrestlers perform in a non-competitive sport based on simulated fighting with storylines written by creative teams and matches with predetermined results. Don Soto later recollects how he and his family took the young man in and made him part of their family, practically adopting him while he was enrolled in Soto's wrestling school and later as he worked on the local [[Independent circuit|wrestling circuit]].&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt;&lt;ref name="NoruegoInterview"/&gt; Palomeque made his professional wrestling debut in 1987, at the age of 16, under the ring name "Alex Dinamo".&lt;ref name="NoruegoInterview"/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Palomeque received further training from famous Mexican wrestling coaches [[Diablo Velasco]] and [[Ray Mendoza]] before changing his character and ring name to "Pequeño Samurai"—a masked persona patterned after the [[Japan]]ese [[Samurai]] tradition. In 1991, Palomeque began working for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL; Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"), the biggest wrestling promotion in Mexico at that time.

In 1992 CMLL head [[Booker (professional wrestling)|writer]] [[Antonio Peña]] left the company to create his own wrestling promotion [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA; Spanish for "Assistance, Consulting and Administration") promotion; Palomeque was one of the many young wrestlers who left CMLL to work for the newly formed AAA.&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; In AAA, his ring personal was changed and he became "Winners" (sometimes written Winner's), a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] character (known as a ''Técnico'' in Lucha Libre) who wore a silver bodysuit and mask.&lt;ref Name="SLObit"/&gt; Palomeques work as "Winners" earned him a match on the very first [[Triplemanía I|Triplemanía]] where he teamed with [[Super Caló]] and [[Rafael Herbert Reyes|El Salsero]] to defeat the team of May Flowers, Rudy Reyna, and Baby Sharon in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six Man Tag Team match]].&lt;ref name="Trip1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#i |title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania |accessdate= February 19, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004505/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html| archivedate= 16 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year at [[Triplemanía II-A]] he teamed up with [[Rey Misterio, Sr.|Rey Misterio]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Misterio, Jr.]] to defeat the team known as ''Los Destructores'' (Tony Arce, Vulcano, and Rocco Valente).&lt;ref name="Trip2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html|title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania|accessdate= 2008-06-16|date=2000-07-05|publisher=SLAM!

===Abismo Negro===
In January 1997, Palomeque's character was changed from that of the quintessential heroic ladies' man known as "Winners", to that of a cheating [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] (referred to as a ''Rudo'') known as "Abismo Negro". Part of his new routine as Abismo Negro was a flamethrower display, created by using a lighter and an [[Aerosol spray]] can.&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; Palomeque would regularly use this during his entrance and on occasion during a match as when he worked as "Abismo Negro" character. As part of his Rudo act Palomeque began using the ''Marinete'' — a wrestling move known as a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|Piledriver]] where he simulates driving the top of his opponents' head into the mat — the Marinete is "banned" Mexican wrestling, which means that it can lead to a disqualification if used during the match. The Marinete became such a signature move for the Abismo Negro character that he earned the nickname ''El Rey del Martinete'' (The King of the Piledriver).&lt;ref name="Ovacinones21536"/&gt; He made his debut as Abismo Negro on January 10, 1997, in an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|Eight Man Tag Team match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/abismo-debut.html|title=El Debut de Abismo Negro|accessdate=2009-03-28|date=2009-03-26|publisher=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]]|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090329115337/http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/abismo-debut.html|archive-date=2009-03-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his debut as Abismo Negro, he made his [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) debut on the January 19, 1997, episode of the [[WWE Free for All|WWF Free For All]] [[pay-per-view]] [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|event]] pre–show before the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]]. On the telecast, Negro teamed with [[Heavy Metal (wrestler)|Heavy Metal]] and [[Super Crazy|Histeria]] in a losing effort against the team of [[Octagón]], [[Blue Demon, Jr.]], and [[Tinieblas, Jr.]] in a six-man tag team match.&lt;ref name="Figurefour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/8736/| title=This is one bad week for the wrestling business|accessdate=2009-07-15|publisher=Wrestling Observer / Figure Four Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Fin|title=Back on Top (Royal Rumble 1997)|work =Power Slam Magazine|id=32|location= England|pages=12–15|date=March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OWW results"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble97.html |title=Royal Rumble 1997 Results|accessdate=2008-02-04| publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080217030825/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble97.html| archivedate= 17 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match was one of the early results of a working relationship between the WWF and AAA that had been created in late 1996.&lt;ref Name="SLObit"/&gt; The relationship saw Negro make an appearance in January against [[Perro Aguayo, Jr.]] and two appearances on the WWF's primary television program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' in March 1997.&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; During his appearances in March, Negro was announced as being part of [[Los Vipers]], a recently created alliance of wrestlers.&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; After March, Negro did not make any more appearances for the WWF.

In AAA, [[Cibernético]] formed ''[[Los Vipers]]'' with Negro along with [[Psicosis II|Psicosis (II)]], Mosco De La Merced, Maniaco and Histeria. Histeria was replaced a few weeks later by [[Histeria (wrestler)|Histeria II]]. In 1998, Negro acquired a "mascot": a [[Midget professional wrestling|midget wrestler]] called [[Mini Abismo Negro]].&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; Abismo, Mini Abismo, and new Vipers member [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]] were defeated by Octagón, his mascot [[Octagóncito (AAA)|Octagóncito]], and Pentagón in a six-man tag team match at [[Triplemanía]].&lt;ref name="Trip6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#vi|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania|accessdate=2009-02-19|publisher=Pro Wrestling History| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004505/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html| archivedate= 16 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Los Vipers engaged in several scripted rivalries with other AAA groups, such as the group of masked wrestlers dressed as clowns known as Los Payasos. They also had a long-running rivalry with Los Vatos Locos—consisting of Espiritu, Picudo, [[Nygma (wrestler)|Nygma]], May Flowers, and Silver Cat during the rivalry—over the [[Mexican National Atómicos Championship]]. Los Vipers won the Atómicos titles from Los Vatos on several occasions, but Negro was not part of the teams that won. Palomeque wrestling as Abismo Negro did capture a title of his own when he defeated Pentagón on May 19, 1998, to win the [[Mexican National Middleweight Championship]], a title he held until January 1999.&lt;ref name="BookMiddle"&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will| title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=MEXICO: National Middleweight Championship|page=392 |year=2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Los Vipers split into two factions, with Abismo Negro leading a splinter group called ''Los Vipers Extreme'' consisting of Electroshock, Pentagón, [[Cima (wrestler)|Shiima]], [[Dark Cuervo|El Cuervo]] and Mini Abismo Negro while Cibernético created a group called ''Los Vipers Primera Clase'' (First Class Vipers). After less than two months, the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] was dropped and Los Vipers reunited. Not long after Los Vipers reunited, Cibernético formed a group called Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was inspired by [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]].&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers.&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; On May 2, 1999, Negro and Electroshock teamed up to defeat [[Perro Aguayo]] and Perro Aguayo, Jr. to win the [[Mexican National Tag Team Championship]]. Los Vipers held the tag team title for four months before losing it to the team of Haytor and the Panther.&lt;ref name="BookMexTag"&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will|chapter=MEXICO: National Tag Team Titles |pages=396–397|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Palomeque participated in a AAA tour of [[Japan]] and competed at [[Triplemanía VIII]], where he was on the losing side of an eight-man tag team match main event; Negro teamed with Cibernetico, [[Nobuhiko Oshima|Shiima Nobunaga]] and Electro Shock against Octagón, [[Jushin Thunder Liger]], [[Latin Lover (wrestler)|Latin Lover]] and Cuije.&lt;ref name="Trip8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#viii|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania|accessdate=2009-02-19|publisher=Pro Wrestling History| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004505/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html| archivedate= 16 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While touring with AAA, Palomeuqe also made an appearance at [[Michinoku Pro]]'s April 9 Sumo Hall card, where he defeated [[Oriental (wrestler)|Oriental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/lucha/mich/michcard.html#0400|title=Michinoku Pro Shows|accessdate=2009-03-03|publisher=Pro Wrestling History| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041853/http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/lucha/mich/michcard.html| archivedate= 27 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, Abismo Negro and Electroshock regained the Mexican National Tag Team title by defeating Haytor and the Panther but only held on to the title for two months before losing it to [[Héctor Garza]] and Perro Aguayo, Jr.

Negro became one of the driving forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top técnicos of AAA such as [[La Parka II|La Parka, Jr.]], Octagón and [[Latin Lover (wrestler)|Latin Lover]]. Negro's position as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual [[Rey de Reyes (2000)|Rey de Reyes]] tournament. In the opening round, he defeated [[Dos Caras]], Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated [[El Alebrije (wrestler)|El Alebrije]], [[Charly Manson]] and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament.&lt;ref name="Rey2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2000|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes 2000|accessdate=2009-02-19|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301173345/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2000|archivedate=2009-03-01|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers.

===Black Abyss===
In late 2007, AAA created a ring persona for a new wrestler called [[Black Abyss]]; the gimmick featured the same mask and attire as Negro and used a similar wrestling style to Negro as well. Initially, it was believed that this was done because there were rumors of him jumping to CMLL or to cover several [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-show|no-shows]].&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; In 2008, Negro's "almost winning" streak at [[Rey de Reyes (2008)|Rey de Reyes]] continued as he lost in the final to [[El Zorro (wrestler)|El Zorro]]. Black Abyss made sure Negro did not win but interfering on Zorro's behalf during the match, furthering the storyline between the two.&lt;ref name="Rey2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2008|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes Tournament|accessdate=2009-02-19|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301173345/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2008|archivedate=2009-03-01|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fall of 2008, AAA pushed the storyline further by having Black Abyss "injure" Negro with his own trademark move the "Martinete".&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt; Abismo Negro was scheduled to take part in [[Triplemanía XVI]] in a match where he would face Los Vipers (Psicosis, Histeria, Black Abyss and [[Mr. Niebla]]) in a cage match, but in the weeks leading up to the show Abismo Negro suffered an injury and the match had to be cancelled, AAA used the attack at Rey de Reyes as a storyline explanation of why the match did not take place.&lt;ref name=NoTM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/segunda-triplemania-sin-abismo-negro.html|title=La segunda TripleMania Sin Abismo Negro|date=2009-06-09|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=AAA|language=Spanish}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2008 [[Guerra de Titanes (2008)|Guerra de Titanes]], Negro returned to challenge Los Vipers' Revolution and specifically Black Abyss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/abismo-negro-reaparece-en-xalapa.html|title=En Xalapa y Evento Grabado para la TV Reaparece Abismo Negro|accessdate=2009-03-04|language=Spanish|publisher=luchalibreAAA.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327040606/http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/abismo-negro-reaparece-en-xalapa.html|archivedate=2009-03-27|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the storyline between Negro and Black Abyss seemed to be building to a Luchas de Apuestas fight between the two, with their masks on the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/rivalidad-abismo-negro-black-abyss.html|title=En Cuautla Abismo Negro VS.

===Abismo Negro II===
On September 27, 2011, AAA announced the start of a competition to find a new Abismo Negro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2011/09/28/doce-participantes%E2%80%A6-un-nuevo-abismo-negro/|title=Doce participantes...

==Personal life==
Palomeque was married to a woman named Martha for 15 years and the couple had four children, two girls and two boys. Palomeque's wife has been suffering from [[breast cancer]] for a number of years.&lt;ref name="Wake"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tabascohoy.com/nota.php?id_nota=172497|title=Expediente Abismo Negro: Habla la ex amante|author=Redacción|publisher= TabascoHoy.com|date=2009-04-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403191839/http://www.tabascohoy.com/nota.php?id_nota=172497| archivedate= 3 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He often appeared on the morning television program ''Vida TV'', in full wrestling gear and persona, billed as Abismo Negro. He usually appeared as a kind of judge for talent contests on the show earning him the nickname ''Fiscal De Hierro de la Televisión'' (the Iron Judge of Television).&lt;ref Name="SLObit"/&gt; Palomeque owned and operated "Gimnasio Abismo Negro" where he taught both professional wrestling and physical fitness.

==Death==
Palomeque was found dead on March 22, 2009. His body was found in a river near the town of [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]], [[Sinaloa]]. According to a bus driver who was transporting Palomeque and other passengers to [[Mexico City]] on Friday night March 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A [[text message]] he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of March 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such an [[anxiety attack]] could be [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]] related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed.&lt;ref name="DeathNoroeste"/&gt; An autopsy was carried out on March 23, which determined that the cause of death was drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned.&lt;ref name="Autopsy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabascohoy.com/nota.php?id_nota=172134|title=Abismo negro ¡Murió ahogado!|accessdate=2009-03-24|date=2009-03-24|publisher=Tabasco Hoy|language= Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326235037/http://www.tabascohoy.com/nota.php?id_nota=172134| archivedate= 26 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial was held in Mexico City on March 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque.&lt;ref name="Wake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/?p=20141|title= Hoy será velado Abismo Negro en la colonia San Angel de la Ciudad de México|accessdate=2009-03-24|date=2009-03-24|publisher= SuperLuchas.net|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327025329/http://superluchas.net/?p=20141| archivedate= 27 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was subsequently [[cremation|cremated]], with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt;

On Saturday March 21, while Palomeque was either lost in the hills or already dead, someone worked as Abismo Negro on an AAA show in [[Cancun]]. In the past, the wrestler known as Black Abyss had worked as Abismo Negro when Palomeque failed to show, but this time Black Abyss was not the man behind the mask, as he was on the opposing team that night. Following the discovery of Palomeque's body, the deception in Cancun received national coverage in Mexico and the local promoter responsible for the show, Renán Martínez, was suspended for two years by the Benito Júarez Boxing and Wrestling commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/?p=21047|title=¿Veto por dos años, al promotor y a la AAA por el aparente fraude de Abismo Negro en Cancún?|first=Jorge Ocampo| last=Alcazar|publisher=SuperLuchas.net|date=2009-03-31|accessdate=2009-04-02|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090406105730/http://superluchas.net/?p=21047| archivedate= 6 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=4&amp;schid=1037&amp;secid=0&amp;cid=1893827|title=Suplantaron a 'Abismo' el día que murió: Comisión de box y lucha investiga|author=Notimex|publisher=Univision|date=2009-04-02|accessdate=2009-04-02|language=Spanish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406052415/http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=4&amp;schid=1037&amp;secid=0&amp;cid=1893827|archivedate=6 April 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2009 AAA held the ''Torneo Abismo Negro'' in honor of Palomeque, the tournament was a 7-man [[Gauntlet for the Gold|gauntlet]]-style match and included a mix of five AAA veterans and two Abismo Negro students. The participants were [[Dark Cuervo|Cuervo]], Black Abyss, [[Gato Eveready]], Kempo Dragon, [[Joe Lider]], [[Extreme Tiger]] and Relámpago. Relámpago, Abismo Negro's last student to turn professional, won the match after 48 minutes. The event was not televised and did not become an annual event.&lt;ref name=SL318&gt;{{cite news|last=Echeagaray|first=Jorge|title=Se realizó el torneo "Abismo Negro"|work=SuperLuchas|id=318|location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexican Federal District|D.F.]]|pages=6–7|date=2009-06-08|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Triplemania XVII]] there was a moment of silence in memory of Abismo Negro, Antonio Peña and [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] (Misawa had died the night before).&lt;ref name=SLTrp17&gt;{{cite web|url= http://superluchas.net/blog/2009/06/13/triplemania-17-resultados-y-cobertura-13-junio-2009-dr-wagner-jr-vs-el-mesias-konnan-vs-roldan/|title=Triplemania 17 (Resultados y cobertura 13 Junio 2009) - El Hijo del Santo salva a AAA - Nuevo Mega Campeón: Dr. Wagner Jr. - Xtreme Tiger nuevo Campeón Crucero AAA|author=Jose Miguel|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-06-14|publisher=SuperLuchas magazine|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090615070851/http://superluchas.net/blog/2009/06/13/triplemania-17-resultados-y-cobertura-13-junio-2009-dr-wagner-jr-vs-el-mesias-konnan-vs-roldan/| archivedate= 15 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}
'''Accelerated aging''' is testing that uses aggravated conditions of heat, humidity, oxygen, sunlight, vibration, etc. to speed up the normal aging processes of items. It is used to help determine the long-term effects of expected levels of stress within a shorter time, usually in a laboratory by controlled [[Technical standard|standard]] [[test method]]s.   It is used to estimate the useful lifespan of a product or its [[shelf life]] when actual lifespan data is unavailable.  This occurs with products that have not existed long enough to have gone through their useful lifespan: for example, a new type of car engine or a new polymer for replacement joints.

[[Physical test]]ing or [[chemical test]]ing is carried out by subjecting the product to 
* representative levels of stress for long time periods, 
* unusually high levels of stress used to accelerate the effects of natural aging, or 
* levels of stress that intentionally force failures (for further analysis).  
Mechanical parts are run at very high speed, far in excess of what they would receive in normal usage.  Polymers are often kept at elevated temperatures, in order to accelerate chemical breakdown. [[Environmental chamber]]s are often used.

Also, the device or material under test can be exposed to rapid (but controlled) changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, strain, etc. For example, cycles of heat and cold can simulate the effect of day and night for a few hours or minutes.

==Library and archival preservation science==
Accelerated aging is also used in library and archival preservation science. In this context, a material, usually paper, is subjected to extreme conditions in an effort to speed up the natural aging process. Usually, the extreme conditions consist of elevated temperature, but tests making use of concentrated pollutants or intense light also exist.&lt;ref name="Porck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ica.org/download.php?id%3D604 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129054703/http://www.ica.org/download.php?id=604 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy }}, Porck, H. J. (2000). ''Rate of paper degradation: The predictive value of artificial aging tests.'' Amsterdam: European Commission on Preservation and Access.&lt;/ref&gt; These tests may be used for several purposes.

* ''To predict the long-term effects of particular conservation treatments. '' In such a test, treated and untreated papers are both subjected to a single set of fixed, standardized conditions. The two are then compared in an effort to determine whether the treatment has a positive or negative effect on the lifespan of the paper.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;
* ''To study the basic processes of paper decay. '' In such a test, the purpose is not to predict a particular outcome for a specific type of paper, but rather to gain a greater understanding of the chemical mechanisms of decay.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;
* ''To predict the lifespan of a particular type of paper. '' In such a test, paper samples are generally subjected to several elevated temperatures and a constant level of relative humidity equivalent to the relative humidity in which they would be stored. The researcher then measures a relevant quality of the samples, such as folding endurance, at each temperature. This allows the researcher to determine how many days at each temperature it takes for a particular level of degradation to be reached. From the data collected, the researcher extrapolates the rate at which the samples might decay at lower temperatures, such as those at which the paper would be stored under normal conditions. In theory, this allows the researcher to predict the lifespan of the paper. This test is based on the [[Arrhenius equation]]. This type of test is, however, a subject of frequent criticism.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;

There is no single recommended set of conditions at which these tests should be performed. In fact, temperatures from 22 to 160 degrees Celsius, relative humidities from 1% to 100%, and test durations from one hour to 180 days have all been used.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt; ISO 5630-3 recommends accelerated aging at 80 degrees Celsius and 65% relative humidity&lt;ref name="Bansa 1992"&gt;Bansa, H. (1992). Accelerated aging tests in conservation research: Some ideas for a future method. ''Restaurator 13.3'', 114-137.&lt;/ref&gt; when using a fixed set of conditions.

Besides variations in the conditions to which the papers are subjected, there are also multiple ways in which the test can be set up. For instance, rather than simply placing single sheets in a climate controlled chamber, the Library of Congress recommends sealing samples in an air-tight glass tube and aging the papers in stacks, which more closely resembles the way in which they are likely to age under normal circumstances, rather than in single sheets.&lt;ref name="LOC 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preserv/acceltest.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727062407/http://www.loc.gov/preserv/acceltest.html |archivedate=27 July 2009 |df=dmy }}, Library of Congress (2006). Accelerated aging of paper: A new test. ''The Library of Congress: Preservation''. Retrieved 8 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The technique of artificially accelerating the deterioration of paper through heat was known by 1899, when it was described by W. Herzberg.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt; Accelerated aging was further refined during the 1920s, with tests using sunlight and elevated temperatures being used to rank the permanence of various papers in the United States and Sweden. In 1929, a frequently used method in which 72 hours at 100 degrees Celsius is considered equivalent to 18–25 years of natural aging was established by R. H. Rasch.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;

In the 1950s, researchers began to question the validity of accelerated aging tests which relied on dry heat and a single temperature, pointing out that relative humidity affects the chemical processes which produce paper degradation and that the reactions which cause degradation have different [[Activation energy|activation energies]]. This led researchers like Baer and Lindström to advocate accelerated aging techniques using the Arrhenius equation and a realistic relative humidity.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;

===Criticism===
Accelerated aging techniques, particularly those using the Arrhenius equation, have frequently been criticized in recent decades. While some researchers claim that the Arrhenius equation can be used to quantitatively predict the lifespan of tested papers,&lt;ref name="Zou"&gt;Zou, X.; Uesaka, T; &amp; Gurnagul, G. (1996). Predication of paper permanence by accelerated aging I. Kinetic analysis of the aging process. ''Cellulose 3'', 243-267.&lt;/ref&gt; other researchers disagree. Many argue that this method cannot predict an exact lifespan for the tested papers, but that it can be used to rank papers by permanence.&lt;ref name="Strofer"&gt;Strofer-Hua, E. (1990). Experimental measurement: Interpreting extrapolation and prediction by accelerated aging. ''Restaurator 11'', 254-266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Begin"&gt;Bégin, P. L. &amp; Kaminska, E. (2002). Thermal accelerated ageing test method development. ''Restaurator 23'', 89-105.&lt;/ref&gt; A few researchers claim that even such rankings can be deceptive, and that these types of accelerated aging tests can only be used to determine whether a particular treatment or paper quality has a positive or negative effect on the paper’s permanence.&lt;ref name="Bansa 2002"&gt;Bansa, H. (2002). Accelerated aging of paper: Some ideas on its practical benefit. ''Restaurator 23'', 106-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several reasons for this skepticism. One argument is that entirely different chemical processes take place at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures, which means the accelerated aging process and natural aging process are not parallel.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bansa 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bansa 1989"&gt;Bansa, H. (1989). Artificial aging as a predictor of paper’s future useful life. ''The Abbey Newsletter Monograph Supplement 1''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that paper is a “complex system”&lt;ref name="Strofer"/&gt; and the Arrhenius equation only applicable to elementary reactions. Other researchers criticize the ways in which deterioration is measured during these experiments. Some point out that there is no standard point at which a paper is considered unusable for library and archival purposes.&lt;ref name="Bansa 1989"/&gt; Others claim that the degree of correlation between macroscopic, mechanical properties of paper and molecular, chemical deterioration has not been convincingly proven.&lt;ref name="Strofer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvini"&gt;Calvini, P. &amp; Gorassini, A. (2006). On the rate of paper degradation: Lessons from the past. ''Restaurator 27'', 275-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to improve the quality of accelerated aging tests, some researchers have begun comparing materials which have undergone accelerated aging to materials which have undergone natural aging.&lt;ref name=" Batterham "&gt;[http://www.naa.gov.au/images/batterham-rai_tcm2-13043.pdf ] Batterham, I &amp; Rai, R. (2008). A comparison of artificial ageing with 27 years of natural ageing. ''2008 AICCM Book, Paper and Photographic Materials Symposium'', 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress, for instance, began a [[long-term experiment]] in 2000 to compare artificially aged materials to materials allowed to undergo natural aging for a hundred years.&lt;ref name="LOC 2008"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/rt/projects/100-yr_nat_aging.html], Library of Congress (2008). 100-year paper natural aging project.

'''Acetic acid bacteria''' (AAB) are a group of [[Gram-negative]] bacteria which [[Oxidation|oxidize]] [[sugar]]s or [[ethanol]] and produce [[acetic acid]] during [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]].&lt;ref name=Raspor2008&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Raspor P |author2=Goranovic D |title=Biotechnological applications of acetic acid bacteria |journal=Critical Reviews in Biotechnology |volume=28 |issue=2 |date=2008 |pages=101–124 |doi=10.1080/07388550802046749 |pmid=18568850}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acetic acid bacteria consist of 10 [[genus|genera]] in the family ''[[Acetobacteraceae]]''.&lt;ref name=Raspor2008/&gt; Several species of acetic acid bacteria are used in industry for production of certain foods and chemicals.&lt;ref name=Raspor2008/&gt;

==Characteristics==
All acetic acid bacteria are rod-shaped and [[obligate aerobe]]s.&lt;ref name=Raspor2008/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Acetic acid bacteria are airborne and are ubiquitous in nature. They are actively present in environments where ethanol is being formed as a result of fermentation of sugars. They can be isolated from the [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] of flowers and from damaged fruit. Other good sources are fresh apple [[cider]] and unpasteurized beer that has not been filter sterilized. In these liquids, they grow as a surface film due to their aerobic nature and active motility.  [[Drosophilidae|Fruit flies]] or [[Turbatrix aceti|vinegar eels]] are considered as a common vector in propagating acetic acid bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-88-470-0865-6#section=103531&amp;page=1 |accessdate=28 May 2016 |title=Vinegars of the World |chapter=Chapter 5 |isbn=978-88-470-0865-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppression==
The growth of ''Acetobacter'' in wine can be suppressed through effective sanitation, by complete exclusion of air from wine in storage, and by the use of moderate amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] in the wine as a preservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page4.htm |accessdate=28 May 2016 |title=Sulfur Dioxide: Science behind this anti-microbial, anti-oxidant |website=Practical Winery &amp; Vineyard Journal |date=February 2009 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==
[[Vinegar]] is produced when acetic acid bacteria act on alcoholic beverages such as wine. They are used to perform specific oxidation reactions through processes called “oxidative fermentations”, that creates vinegar as a byproduct. In the biotechnological industry, these bacterias' oxidation mechanism is exploited to produce a number of compounds such as l-ascorbic acid, dihydroxyacetone, gluconic acid, and cellulose.&lt;ref name="Mamlouk, D. 2013"&gt;Mamlouk, D. &amp; Gullo, M. Acetic Acid Bacteria: Physiology and Carbon Sources Oxidation. Indian Journal of Microbiology 53, 377–384 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides food industry, some acetic acid bacterias are used as biocatalysts for the industrial production of compounds. They are used as the important biocatalysts for the development of eco-friendly fermentation processes as an alternative to the chemical synthesis.&lt;ref name="Mamlouk, D. 2013"/&gt;

Some genera, such as ''Acetobacter'', can oxidize ethanol to carbon dioxide and water using [[Krebs cycle]] enzymes. Other genera, such as ''Gluconobacter'', do not oxidize ethanol, as they do not have a full set of Krebs cycle enzymes.

As these bacteria produce acid, they are usually acid-tolerant, growing well below pH 5.0, although the pH optimum for growth is 5.4-6.3.

One species of ''Acetobacter'', ''[[Acetobacter xylinum]]'', is able to synthesize [[cellulose]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1275385/pdf/biochemj00918-0116.pdf?tool=pmcentrez |accessdate=28 May 2016 |title=Formation of cellulose by certain species of ''Acetobacter'' |journal=Biochem.

'''Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Mansur Shah''' (died 1488) was a sultan of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] from 1477 to 1488.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=krl1BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=Sultan+Alauddin+Riayat+Syah+1477&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ysvcVLjLIciguQTp9oKYCg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sultan%20Alauddin%20Riayat%20Syah%201477&amp;f=false Museums, History and Culture in Malaysia, By Abu Talib Ahmad]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{Cite book

He was famous for going undercover at night to personally check on the well-being of his people, as well as on the condition of his sultanate itself. On one of these nights he was even reported to have run after a thief himself. He was a very good and religious ruler and is renowned to be a fair king. But his position is envied by his brother, Raja Ahmad (the ruler of Pahang, a region under Malaccan rule), because Raja Ahmad believed that the rulership of Malacca was his right. 

Sultan Alauddin had many enemies, both within and outside of his court. He had a total of four children, two from each of his two wives, and this has led to his wives squabbling over the heirship to his throne. The sultan's second wife is from Indian Muslim descent. During this period, Sultan Alaudin has been facing problems with the ''mamak'' people, who were beginning to grow in power in comparison to Malays. His new advisor, Bendahara Seri Maharaja (equivalent to the modern-day prime minister) was also of ''mamak'' blood. 

After 11 years on the throne, Sultan Alauddin was reported in history to have died of mysterious causes. Other accounts suggest that he was poisoned in a conspiracy primarily involving Raja Ahmad, Bendahara Seri Maharaja and Tun Senaja, his second wife.  His son, Raja Mahmud and his brother-in-law Raja Merlang (Tun Senaja's brother) was also thought to be involved. 

After his demise, the rulership went to Raja Mahmud, whom he fathered with his Tun Senaja, and denying Raja Munawar, Sultan Alaudin's firstborn son with his first wife Raja Fatimah, who was widely thought to be the true successor to the throne. In any case, the ''mamak'' bloodline finally gained control over the Malaccan Empire. However, it was not long before the Portuguese invasion came in 1511, the aftermath of which ended the Sultanate rule over the [[Malacca]].

Today, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah's tomb can be found situated in [[Pagoh]], [[Johor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourmalaysia.com/malaysia-tourism/muar-heritage-trails-sultan-alauddin-riayat-tomb-kampong-raja-pagoh/ |title=Muar Tourist Attraction: Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah's Tomb Kampong Raja Pagoh |publisher=[[Joshua Project]] |accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6451">'''Ali II of Yejju''' (c. 1819 &amp;ndash; c. 1866) was a [[Ras (title)|Ras]] of [[Begemder]] and [[Enderase]] (Regent) of the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]]. He was the son of [[Alula of Yejju]] (sometime governor of [[Damot]] and then of [[Gojjam]]) and [[Menen Liben Amede]] (later Empress of [[Ethiopia]] through her marriage to [[Yohannes III|Emperor Yohannes III]]) and nephew of  [[Gugsa of Yejju]].

==Appointment as ruler==
In July 1831, after the death of his cousin, [[Dori of Yejju|Ras Dori]], Ali was appointed Ruler of Begemder and Imperial Regent at the age of 12 in a meeting of the chief nobles of the [[Yejju Oromo|Yejju]] at the dynastic capital of [[Debre Tabor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Abir|first= Mordechai |title= Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769-1855)|year= 1968|publisher= Longmans|location= London|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ali was a minor, a council of regents was appointed from these nobles. However, his mother, Menen, soon came to control this council and exerted much influence over political decisions for the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rubenson|first= Sven |title= King of Kings: Tewodros of Ethiopia|year= 1966|publisher= Haile Selassie I University|location= Addis Ababa|page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ras Ali was officially a [[Christian]] but his contemporaries doubted the sincerity of his faith and suspected that he was a secret [[Muslim]]. Some modern scholars consider him as indifferent to religion as he was to the problems of ruling his portion of Ethiopia, although Trimingham observes that he attempted to revive the cult of [[Ahmad Gragn]] by requiring pilgrimages to his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;J. Spencer Trimingham, ''Islam in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press, 1952), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the morale of the [[Ethiopian Church]] reached its lowest point in the 1840s and 1850s.

For much his reign Ras Ali was constantly at war, either putting down rebellions in his core territories, or defending his territory from rival lords. In one of these continual campaigns, Ras Ali II plundered the imperial capital, [[Gondar]], in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Abir, ''Era of the Princes'', p. 111f&lt;/ref&gt;

Ras Ali made [[Sahle Dengel of Ethiopia|Sahle Dengel]] Emperor in 1832, but the clergy of [[Azazo]] disapproved of the new Emperor's religious beliefs, and convinced Ras Ali to remove him. Sahle Dengel was sent to [[Zengaj]], and Ras Ali recalled [[Gebre Krestos of Ethiopia|Gebre Krestos]] from [[Mitraha Island|Mitraha]], an island in [[Lake Tana]], and restored him as Emperor. However, Gebre Krestos died after three months, and Sahle Dengel met with Ras Ali in the village of Tsagur where he convinced Ras Ali to restore him to the throne once again (October, 1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Weld Blundell|first= H. |title= The Royal chronicle of Abyssinia, 1769-1840 |year= 1922|publisher= University Press|location= Cambridge|page = 489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Ras Ali married Hirut, the daughter of [[Dejazmach]] [[Wube Haile Maryam]], warlord of [[Semien province|Semien]] and of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]; when he placed her in the church of [[Mahdere Maryam]] for her safety before the [[Battle of Debre Tabor]] (6 February 1842), his opponents violated the refuge of the church and kidnapped her. Their only daughter [[Tewabech Ali|Tewabech]] was married 1848 to Kassa Hailu of [[Qwara province|Qwara]], who in 1854 proclaimed himself a [[Negus]]. They had no surviving issue.

==End of reign==
Although his reign was punctuated by recurrent rebellions, Ali managed to keep all of the major lords subject to his rule until the final years. Shiferaw Bekele asserts that "it is to his credit" that there were only two major wars while he was ''Ras Bewodded'': the Battle of Debre Tabor in 1842, and [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Kassa Hailu]]'s successful offensive in 1852/1853.&lt;ref&gt;Shiferaw Bekele, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ethio_0066-2127_1990_num_15_1_951?_Prescripts_Search_isPortletOuvrage=false "Reflections on the Power Elite of the Wärä Seh Mäsfenate (1786-1853)" ''Annales d'Éthiopie''] 15 (1990), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Future events were foreshadowed in October, 1846, when Kassa Hailu defeated detachments of Empress Menen's army at two separate battles in [[Dembiya]]; at the time, ''Ras'' Ali was away in [[Gojjam]] attempting to subdue the province's warlord, [[Birru Goshu]], and unable to assist his mother. Kassa defeated the army of Empress Menen the following year on 18 June at [[Battle of Iloha|Iloha]], and took both Menen and her husband the former Emperor [[Yohannes III of Ethiopia|Yohannes III]] captive, forcing Ras Ali to negotiate their release. After three months, in return for making Kassa [[dejazmach]] over Dembiya, north of [[Lake Tana]], the Empress and her powerless husband were released.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenson, ''King of Kings'', pp. 37f&lt;/ref&gt; Dejazmach Kassa later reconciled himself to ''Ras'' Ali in 1849, and Kassa remained loyal to Ali for the next three years.

However, the relationship between the two eventually deteriorated. Following a series of stunning victories by Kassa, Ali II was decisively defeated by his son-in-law ''Dejazmach'' Kassa (who later assumed the throne name of [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]]) in the [[Battle of Ayshal]] on 29 June 1853, and he lost both the regentship and his territories. At first Ali fled to safety at a local church, then a few days later fled to the territories of his kinsmen in [[Wollo]] province, where he disappeared to history. Sven Rubenson states that he advised Queen [[Worqitu of Wollo|Worqitu]] of the [[Wollo Oromo]] to avoid a major battle with Tewodros when the Emperor marched through Wollo on his campaign against [[Shewa]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenson, ''King of Kings'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Proutky&lt;ref&gt;Chris Proutky, ''Empress Taytu and Menelik II: Ethiopia 1883-1910'' (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1986), p. 27n&lt;/ref&gt; and Trimingham&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham, ''Islam'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; give the date of 1866 for his death, without further details.

'''Amniotic band constriction''' (also known as "amniotic band syndrome", "ADAM complex", "Amniotic band sequence", "Congenital constriction bands" and "Pseudoainhum"&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author =Rapini, Ronald P. |author2 =Bolognia, Jean L. |author3 =Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[congenital disorder]] caused by entrapment of fetal parts (usually a limb or digits) in fibrous amniotic bands while in utero.

==Signs and symptoms==
The constriction of appendages by amniotic bands may result in:

# Constriction rings around the digits, arms and legs
# Swelling of the extremities distal to the point of constriction ([[congenital lymphedema]])
# Amputation of digits, arms and legs ([[congenital amputation]])

A strong relationship between ABS and [[clubfoot]] (also called "talipes") exists. A 31.5% of associated clubfoot deformity and ABS can be correlated with 20% occurring [[bilateral symmetry|bilateral]]ly. Other abnormalities found with ABS include: [[clubhand]]s, [[cleft lip]], and/or [[cleft palate]], and [[hemangioma]].

Decreased fetal movement could be a sign of a serious problem which may include ABS.  It is rare but possible for the membrane to become wrapped around the placenta or the neck of the baby in the womb causing strangulation and death.

==Cause==
To explain the cause of ABS, there are two main theories.

The '''amniotic band''' theory is that ABS occurs due to a partial rupture of the [[amniotic sac]].  This rupture involves only the [[amnion]];  the [[chorion]] remains intact.  Fibrous bands of the ruptured amnion float in the [[amniotic fluid]] and can encircle and trap some part of the fetus.  Later, as the fetus grows but the bands do not, the bands become constricting.  This constriction reduces blood circulation, hence causes congenital abnormalities. In some cases a complete "natural" [[congenital amputation|amputation]] of a digit(s) or limb may occur before birth or the digit(s) or limbs may be necrotic (dead) and require surgical amputation following birth.

The '''vascular disruption''' theory:
Because the constricting mechanism of the amniotic band theory does not explain the high incidence of [[cleft palate]] and other forms of cleft defects occurring together with ABS, this co-occurrence suggests an "intrinsic" defect of the blood circulation.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ultrasound Scan ND 008.jpg|thumb]]
Amniotic band syndrome is often difficult to detect before birth as the individual strands are small and hard to see on ultrasound. Often the bands are detected indirectly because of the constrictions and swelling upon limbs, digits, etc. Misdiagnosis is also common, so if there are any signs of amniotic bands, further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity.  3D ultrasound and MRI can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damage/danger to the fetus.
==Prevention==
Amniotic band syndrome is considered an accidental event and it does not appear to be genetic or hereditary, so the likelihood of it occurring in another pregnancy is remote. The cause of amnion tearing is unknown and as such there are no known preventative measures.

==Treatment==
In rare cases, if diagnosed in utero, [[fetal surgery]] may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation or other deformity. This typically would not be attempted if neither vital organs nor the [[umbilical cord]] were affected. This operation has been successfully performed on fetuses as young as 22 weeks.&lt;ref name=abc20080608&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/08/2268374.htm |title=Surgeons save unborn baby's legs |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work=News Online |date=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery took place at Melbourne's Monash Medical Centre in [[Australia]] and is believed to be the earliest surgery of its type, as surgeons usually hold off on operating until the woman is in week 28 of gestation.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} There are also several facilities in the United States that have performed successful amniotic band release surgery.

Treatment usually occurs after birth and where plastic and reconstructive surgery is considered to treat the resulting deformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Gabos PG |title=Modified technique for the surgical treatment of congenital constriction bands of the arms and legs of infants and children |journal=Orthopedics |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=401–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16729738 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic surgery ranges from simple to complex depending on the extent of the deformity. Physical and occupational therapy may be needed long term.

Prosthetics may help some ABS sufferers to live more functional lives. The price and complexity of these prosthetics vary dramatically, but advances in [[3-D printing]] have helped to increase the availability of artificial fingers while reducing their cost of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kuow.org/post/3-d-printer-brings-dexterity-children-no-fingers  |title=3-D Printer Brings Dexterity To Children With No Fingers |work=News Online |date=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
[[File:Amniotic Band Syndrome 26 Year old Male.jpg|thumb|Amniotic Band Syndrome, 26-year-old Male]]
The [[prognosis]] depends on the location and severity of the constricting bands. Every case is different and multiple bands may be entangled around the fetus.

Bands which wrap around fingers and toes can result in [[syndactyly]] or [[congenital amputation|amputation]]s of the digits. In other instances, bands can wrap around limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet. In more severe cases, the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation. Amniotic bands can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate. If the bands become wrapped around the head or umbilical cord it can be life-threatening for the fetus.

The number of cases of [[miscarriage]] that can be attributed to ABS is unknown, although it has been reported that it may be the cause of 178 in 10,000 miscarriages.

==Epidemiology==
Amniotic banding affects approximately 1 in 1,200 live births.  It is also believed to be the cause of 178 in 10,000 [[miscarriage]]s. Up to 50% of cases have other congenital anomalies including cleft lip, cleft palate, and clubfoot deformity. Hand and finger anomalies occur in up to 80%.

==People living with ABS==
Among the more notable people living with ABS are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6909">'''''Battle at Kruger''''' is an eight-minute amateur wildlife video that depicts a confrontation between a herd of [[African buffalo|Cape buffalo]], a small group of young [[lion]]s from a pride, and one [[crocodile]].&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nhongosafaris.co.za/index.php/battle-in-the-kruger |first=Frank |last=Watts |title=Battle in the Kruger |work=Nhongo Safaris.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was shot in September 2004 at the Transport Dam watering hole in [[Kruger National Park]], [[South Africa]], during a [[safari]] guided by Frank Watts. It was filmed by videographer David Budzinski and photographer Jason Schlosberg.

Since being posted on [[YouTube]] on 3 May 2007, ''Battle at Kruger'' has received 80 million views as of November 2018 and has become a [[viral video]] sensation. It was widely praised for its dramatic depiction of wildlife on the African [[savannah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU8DDYz68kM |title=Battle at Kruger |website=YouTube |date=3 May 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become one of YouTube's most popular nature videos, and has won the Best Eyewitness Video in the 2nd Annual YouTube Video Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/ytawards07winners |title=2nd Annual YouTube Awards Winners |website=YouTube |accessdate=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was also the subject of an article in the 25 June 2007 issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A little help from his friends |date=25 June 2007 |journal=TIME |volume=169 |number=26 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured in the first episode of [[ABC News]]' ''[[i-Caught]]'', which aired on 7 August 2007. A [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] documentary on the video debuted on the [[National Geographic Channel]] on 11 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Drew |last=Millhon |title=Video Captures Animal Battle for Survival |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/icaught/story?id=3418552&amp;page=1 |publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures |date=1 August 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Taken from a small [[game viewer vehicle]] on the opposite side of the watering hole with a digital [[camcorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/10/arts/television/10kruger.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5087&amp;em&amp;en=8457d49e0d39ce63&amp;ex=1210564800 |title=You’ve Seen the YouTube Video; Now Try the Documentary |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 May 2008 |quote=A Canon ZR50MC MiniDV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video begins with the herd of African buffalos approaching the water, unaware that a small group of female lions are lying nearby.&lt;ref name=Watts/&gt; The lioness crouches as the herd nears; it is uncertain if the lioness attacks first, or the lead buffalo becomes startled and turns to run, but the buffalos flee and the lions charge and disperse the herd, with the lioness picking off a buffalo calf, both of them falling into the water.&lt;ref name=Watts/&gt; As the lions try to drag the buffalo out of the water, the calf is grabbed by a [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]], who fights for it in a brief [[tug of war]] before giving up and leaving it to the lions. The lions lie down and prepare to feast, but the full buffalo herd approach and surround the lions. One of the lions is tossed into the air by a charging buffalo and chased away. The remaining lions are subsequently scattered and chased away soon after the initial engagement, and the baby buffalo escapes into the herd while a few lions remain surrounded by the buffalos. The buffalos then proceed to aggressively chase the remaining lions away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bobbie |last=Johnson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,2145733,00.html |title=10m viewers for YouTube phenomenon |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 August 2007 |accessdate=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expert commentary ==

Two veterinarians and animal behaviorists interviewed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' assert that the behavior exhibited by the buffalo is not unusual. Dr. Sue McDonnell of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (School of [[Veterinary Medicine]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.vet.upenn.edu/labs/equinebehavior/Bios/smm_bio.htm |title=Sue McDonnell PhD (Profile) |work=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |accessdate=18 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210075751/http://www3.vet.upenn.edu/labs/equinebehavior/Bios/smm_bio.htm |archivedate=10 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; said of the video:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The larger herd is broken down into smaller [[harem]]s, with a [[alpha male|dominant male]] and many females and their babies. The crocodile attacked the baby and the lion  If a youngster is threatened, both the harem males and bachelor males—which usually fight with one another—will get together to try to rescue it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jeffrey |last=Kluger |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1630667,00.html |title=When Animals Attack — and Defend |journal=[[TIME]] |date=7 June 2007 |accessdate=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is, however, rare for such events to be captured on film even by professional wildlife photographers. Indeed, Dereck Joubert, a photographer and writer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/83/Dereck-Joubert.html |title=Dereck Joubert Biography (1956-) |website=filmreference.com |accessdate=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[National Geographic magazine|National Geographic]]'' said of the video:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There is no doubt at all that the tourist who shot that scene ... was unbelievably lucky. I mean, we would've considered ourselves lucky to have had that whole scene happen in front of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Drew |last=Millhon |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/icaught/Story?id=3418552&amp;page=2 |title=Video Captures Animal Battle for Survival |website=ABC News |date=1 August 2007 |accessdate=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bed-making''' is the act of arranging the [[Bed sheet|bedsheets]] and other [[bedding]] on a [[bed]], to prepare it for use.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/112645?rskey=tyGmtC&amp;result=9&amp;isAdvanced=false#|chapter=Make (v. 1): 62:|quote=To prepare (a bed) for sleeping in; to arrange bedclothes on (a bed) for future use.|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a household chore, but is also performed in establishments including hospitals, hotels, and military or educational residences. Bed-making is also a common childhood chore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aguirre|first=Sarah|title=Make a Bed|url=http://housekeeping.about.com/od/bedrooms/ht/makebed.htm|work=About.com: Housekeeping|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Beds must sometimes be made to exacting standards, demanded of nurses or military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=Mike|title=Close Quarter Battle|year=1997|publisher=Corgi Books|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=0-552-14465-7|edition=1998|page=44|chapter=Chapter 2|quote=At the crack of dawn, the screaming started again. Beds had to be made, with the sheets and grey army blankets stacked neatly and perfectly square on top.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[hospital]] or other health-care environment, beds must sometimes be made while occupied by a patient. Specialised techniques are taught to healthcare staff to enable beds to be made efficiently with due care for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bed Making|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/6635685/Bed-Making|work=scribd.com|accessdate=26 June 2012}} ''A sample training document''&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are different bed-making techniques, such as "hospital corners" and "mitred corners". [[Military recruit]]s are often taught how to make a neat and tidy bed with hospital corners. Military personnel are expected to fold the bed very tightly, in some cases so that a coin can bounce off of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Gary|title=In Good Company|year=1987|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Sydney, Australia|isbn=1-86448-904-9|edition=1998|page=19|chapter=Chapter 2 - Doing Extras at Scheyville|quote=He stepped into my mess of a room and by dinnertime he had run me through the whole gammut of how to set up the room in inspection order, and how to make the bed properly so the drillies could bounce a 20c coin off the counterpane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, many [[self-making bed]]s which automatically rearrange the bedding are in development and in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marable|first=Eileen|title=Yes, yes a million times: Bed makes itself in 50 seconds|url=http://dvice.com/archives/2012/06/bed-makes-itsel.php|work=Dvice|accessdate=26 June 2012|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://myluxurybed.co.uk/blogs/blog/a-chore-no-more-the-self-making-bed-is-here | title=OHEA smart bed | accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; New innovations in bedding have arisen in recent years (beginning in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover Beddy's|url=https://beddys.com/pages/what-are-beddys-bed-sets}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that have further simplified bed-making—some claiming that zipper beds can be made in under 10 seconds.

==Record==
[[Guinness World Records]] reports that the record time for two people to make a bed "with one blanket, two sheets, an undersheet, an uncased pillow, one pillowcase, one counterpane and hospital corners" is 14.0 seconds. This feat was achieved by two nurses from the [[Royal Masonic Hospital]] in London in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fastest time to make a bed by a team of two|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/fastest-time-to-make-a-bed-by-a-team-of-two/|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Ellis''' (born 1929) is an Emeritus Professor in the philosophy department at [[La Trobe University]] in Victoria, Australia, and Professional Fellow in philosophy at the University of Melbourne. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/staff.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307113209/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/staff.html |archivedate=7 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Editor of the ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' for twelve years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philosopher.io/About|title=About - Philosopher.io|website=philosopher.io|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the major proponents of the [[New essentialism|New Essentialist]] school of [[philosophy of science]] (philosophy of nature).

The new [[essentialism]] has evolved from these beginnings and can reasonably claim to be a comprehensive philosophy of nature. Philosophers around the world, including; Sydney Shoemaker, Charles Martin, George Molnar, George Bealer, John Bigelow, Caroline Lierse, Evan Fales, Crawford Elder, Nicholas Maxwell, [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and John Heil, have contributed to in various ways to its development. The new essentialism is not just a personal view, but an emerging metaphysical perspective that is the culmination of many different attempts to arrive at a satisfactory post-Humean philosophy of nature.&lt;ref&gt;p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this list of claimed allies has been disputed by [[Stephen Mumford]], at least with regard to Shoemaker, Martin, Molnar, Heil and Cartwright. &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mumford, "Kinds, Essences, Powers" ''Ratio (new series)'' XVIII (4 December 2005), 420-436.&lt;/ref&gt;

“'''Causal Powers and Categorical Properties'''”

In this chapter of ''The Metaphysics of Powers: Their Grounding and Their Manifestations,'' Ellis argues that categorical properties and causal powers are distinct from one another, and that categorical properties are not dispositional, but quiddities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/4749/|title=CAUSAL POWERS AND CATEGORICAL PROPERTIES|last=Brian|first=Ellis,|date=2009|website=philsci-archive.pitt.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quidditism accounts for identity of a property based only on what it ''is'' rather than what it disposes its bearer to do. Although categorical properties do not necessarily dispose their bearers to do anything, they do determine where active properties of things may exist, or be distributed, and thus where the effects of such activities can be observed. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He gives a detailed logical account of how a causal power can be defined. Ellis defines a causal power as a quantitative property that positions its’ bearer in specific circumstances take part in a physical causal process with a certain outcome.  Such powers are to either act or resist change within the bearer (e.g. temperature, elasticity). 

All causal powers must meet two criteria.  First, they must all have contingent locations, since they have to act from somewhere.  Second, they all must have laws of action outlining their nature.  Such laws reference both the location of the object that possesses the power, as well as the location of things it interacts with. Locations, however, are impotent. Ellis argues that neither locations nor categorical properties such as shape and size are causal powers, yet they can make a difference in outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Burmah''''' was a [[passenger ship]], which disappeared ''en route'' from [[England]] to [[New Zealand]] in 1859 or 1860.

==Last voyage==
The ''Burmah'' was chartered by Willis, Gann &amp; Co.  The ship left London for New Zealand on 30 August 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otago Witness]], 10 October 1859 p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001260/18590830/035/0005|title=Gravesend|last=|first=|date=30 August 1859|work=Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Burmah'' was seen by the ship ''Regina'' on 17 November,  about 14 days sailing distance west of New Zealand, at {{Coord|48|S|97|E|display=inline}}.  The ''Regina'' passed [[icebergs]] the day after it passed ''Burmah''.&lt;ref&gt;Otago Witness, 11 February 1860 p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Burmah'' never arrived at New Zealand and was officially declared lost by Lloyds on 6 May 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Otago Witness, 4 August 1860&lt;/ref&gt;

''Burmah'' was carrying passengers and an assortment of breeding [[livestock]].

The novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] was booked to travel on the ''Burmah'' to New Zealand,  but he changed to a different ship, the ''Roman Emperor'' at the last moment, and therefore avoided the wreck of the ''Burmah''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyttelton Times]], 28 January 1860&lt;/ref&gt;

Hank Henshaw was an astronaut at [[NASA]] until a solar flare hit his space shuttle during an experiment in space, damaging the ship and the crew. Henshaw and the crew found that their bodies had begun to mutate and, after returning to Earth, Henshaw's entire crew (including his wife) eventually committed suicide. After learning that [[Superman]] had thrown [[Eradicator (comics)|the Eradicator]] into the sun in a battle during the space shuttle experiment, Henshaw blamed Superman for the solar flare and the accident. Before his body completely disintegrated due to the radiation exposure, Henshaw was able to save his consciousness. Using NASA communications equipment, Henshaw beamed his mind into the birthing matrix which had carried Superman from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] to Earth as an infant. He created a small exploration craft from the birthing matrix and departed into outer space alone. Becoming increasingly mentally unstable, Henshaw used Superman's birthing matrix to create a body identical to Superman's, albeit with cybernetic parts. He returned to Earth to kill Superman, only to discover that [[The Death of Superman|Superman had already died]] during Henshaw's absence. Following Superman's eventual resurrection, Henshaw would not only become a recurring adversary of Superman but of [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] as well. Hank Henshaw became a member of the [[Sinestro Corps]] during the [[Sinestro Corps War]].

[[Zor-El]] is the younger brother of [[Jor-El]], husband of [[Alura]], father of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and paternal uncle of [[Superman]]. Originally, he escaped from Krypton's destruction along with the other inhabitants of [[Argo City]]. In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Supergirl discovers an amnesiac Cyborg Superman living on the planet I'noxia. This turns out to be Zor-El, who was rescued from Krypton's destruction by Brainiac and reconfigured as a half-man half-machine to be his scout looking for stronger species in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Supergirl'' Vol. 6 #22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and Abilities==

===Hank Henshaw===
As Cyborg Superman, Hank Henshaw possesses the ability to control and reanimate various machines. Due to his experience with Superman's birth matrix, Henshaw now has all of Superman's powers and genetic tissue identical to the Man of Steel's. As a member of the Sinestro Corps, Henshaw has access to a power ring fueled by fear energy that allows him to create any construct he can imagine.

===Zor-El===
As Cyborg Superman, Zor-El is cybernetically enhanced with the ability to fly, fire powerful heat rays from his cybernetic eye, and project electricity from his body. Zor-El's cybernetic arm can shape shift into whatever he desires, limited only by the technology available to him at the given moment that he chooses to use this ability. Zor-El is virtually indestructible, and also has super-speed and super-strength.

==In other media==

===Television===
* In the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' episode "Message in a Bottle", a [[Superman robot]] that resembles the Cyborg Superman appears as the [[property caretaker]] of the [[Fortress of Solitude]] in the [[31st century]]. He is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]].
* [[David Harewood]] portrays Hank Henshaw in the 2015 [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'' TV series]].&lt;!-- Do NOT add that he is Martian Manhunter. The real Hank Henshaw has already appeared on the series in flashback, and is played by the same actor. The Martian Manhunter twist has nothing to do with Cyborg Superman. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/supergirl-cbs-cast-chyler-leigh-david-harewood-1201442407/|title=‘Supergirl': David Harewood &amp; Chyler Leigh Join CBS Pilot Cast|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing his character, Harewood stated, "Hank Henshaw ends up becoming Cyborg Superman in the comics, battling Superman. So I'm looking forward to that. He's a bit of a supervillain. He seems pretty indestructible. Which I kind of like because I keep getting blown up in these things. I'm kind of looking forward to being indestructible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/05/12/supergirls-david-harewood-teases-becoming-cyborg-superman/|title=Supergirl's David Harewood Teases Becoming Cyborg Superma|work=comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Do NOT add that he is Martian Manhunter. The real Hank Henshaw has already appeared on the series in flashback, and is played by the same actor. The Martian Manhunter twist has nothing to do with Cyborg Superman. --&gt; Cyborg Superman debuted in the episode "[[The Darkest Place]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2016/11/04/supergirl-season-2-cyborg-superman/|title=Cyborg Superman is Coming To Supergirl!|publisher=ComicBook.com|last=Jayson|first=Jay|date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
* In the 2016 film [[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League – Cosmic Clash]], Superman under the control of Brainiac shares a slight resemblance to Cyborg Superman.
* Henshaw appears in the 2018 film ''[[The Death of Superman (film)|The Death of Superman]]'', voiced by [[Patrick Fabian]]. His story plays out like in the comics with the exception that his shuttle's destruction was caused by the meteor holding Doomsday with his crew killed instantly, his body being the only unaccounted casuality in the aftermath. The final pose-credit scene of the movie depicts Cyborg Superman flying above the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-death-of-superman-movie-changes-up-a-classic-dc-com-1827775139|title=The Death of Superman Movie Changes Up a Classic DC Comics Story Just Enough to Work|website=io9|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|date=July 22, 2018|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character will return prominently in the sequel ''Reign of the Supermen''.

===Video games===
* Cyborg Superman is a playable character as one of the Supermen included in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] &amp; [[Mega Drive|Genesis]] video game ''[[The Death and Return of Superman]]'' in 1994. He is also the final boss of the game.
* Hank Henshaw appears as a boss character in 2002's ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel (2002 video game)|Superman: The Man of Steel]]''.
* Cyborg Superman appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', as a downloadable alternate skin for Superman.
* Hank Henshaw also appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' in the ninth DLC, "War of the Light Part I". As a Hero, you fight him and Sinestro in "Assault &amp; Battery", and again as a boss in "Mist Recovery". As a Villain, he assists the players in collecting Mist and fighting Kyle Rayner in "Mist Recovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcuniverseonline.com/shop/dlc-packs.vm?dlc=war-of-the-light-part-1 |title=War of the Light Part 1 |publisher=DC Universe Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202225733/https://www.dcuniverseonline.com/shop/dlc-packs.vm?dlc=war-of-the-light-part-1 |archivedate=2 October 2016 |date= |accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cyborg Superman appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].

===Radio===
British wunderkind radio producer [[Dirk Maggs]] produced a Superman radio series for [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] in the 1990s. When the "Death of Superman" story arc happened in the comics, Maggs presented a very faithful, though much pared down, version of the tale which featured [[Stuart Milligan]] as Clark Kent/Superman, [[Lorelei King]] as Lois Lane, and [[William Hootkins]] as Lex Luthor. Versatile American actor [[Kerry Shale]] was cast both as the villainous Hank Henshaw and as [[Superboy]]. The story arc was packaged for sale on cassette and CD as ''[[Superman: Doomsday and Beyond]]'' in the UK and as ''[[Superman Lives!]]'' in the USA.

===Miscellaneous===
* In a comic book crossover starring Superman and the Fantastic Four, [[Reed Richards]] and his team are forced into an uneasy alliance with Hank Henshaw when the [[Marvel Universe]]'s world-eating [[Galactus]] kidnaps Superman and transforms him into his herald. In conversation with [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]], Henshaw points out the "ironic" similarity between his origin and the FF's. The story concludes with Galactus blasting Henshaw with a ray that turns him into a simple metal rod in response to his pleas for perfection, after the discovery that Henshaw was responsible for Superman coming to the Marvel Universe after he planted faked evidence that Galactus was involved in Krypton's destruction (having previously encountered the [[Silver Surfer]] in ''Green Lantern VS Silver Surfer'', Henshaw had learned of Galactus and sought the enhanced power of becoming a herald).
* Hank Henshaw appeared in issue 19 of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' comics. Batman had to work with the Green Lantern Corps to keep Hank Henshaw from killing Hal Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in the cosmopolitan city of [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) into a [[Jewish]] family. His father was David Kolker and his mother was Isabella Beyle (née Stepanovsky), who later on married Fishl Oistrakh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naftali.livejournal.com/50235.html naftali: oystrakh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822230221/http://naftali.livejournal.com/50235.html |date=2011-08-22 }}. Naftali.livejournal.com (2005-12-13). Retrieved on 2012-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five, young Oistrakh began his studies of [[violin]] and [[viola]] as a pupil of [[Pyotr Stolyarsky]]. In his studies with Stolyarsky he became very good friends with [[Joseph Brodsky|Iosif Brodsky]], [[Nathan Milstein]] and other great violinists with whom he collaborated numerous times after achieving fame since their beginnings as fellow students at Stolyarsky School. 

In 1914, at the age of six, Oistrakh performed his debut concert.  He entered the [[Odessa Conservatory]] in 1923, where he studied until his graduation in 1926. In the Conservatory he also studied [[harmony]] with composer [[Mykola Vilinsky]]. His 1926 graduation concert consisted of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] [[Partita for Violin No. 2 (Bach)|Chaconne]], [[Giuseppe Tartini|Tartini's]] [[Devil's Trill Sonata]], [[Anton Rubinstein|Rubinstein's]] [[Viola Sonata]], and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev's]] [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major]]. In 1927, Oistrakh appeared as soloist playing the [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]] [[Violin Concerto (Glazunov)|Violin Concerto]] under the composer's own baton in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] — a concert which earned him an invitation to play the [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] with the [[Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra|Philharmonic Orchestra]] under [[Nikolai Malko]] the following year.

===In Moscow===
In 1927, Oistrakh relocated to [[Moscow]], where he gave his first recital and met his future wife: pianist [[Tamara Rotareva]] (1906–1976). They were married a year later, and had one child, [[Igor Oistrakh]], who was born in 1931. Igor Oistrakh would follow his father's path as a violinist, and eventually performed and recorded side-by-side with his father, including [[Concerto for Two Violins (Bach)|Bach's Double Concerto]], which they first recorded in 1951, and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra (Mozart)|Sinfonia Concertante]]. In at least one of the recordings of Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, Igor Oistrakh played violin, while David Oistrakh played viola.

From 1934 onwards, David Oistrakh held a position teaching at the [[Moscow Conservatory]], and was later made professor in 1939. Some of his colleagues while teaching at the Moscow Conservatory included [[Yuri Yankelevich]] and [[Boris Goldstein]]. Oistrakh taught [[Oleg Kagan]], [[Emmy Verhey]], [[Gidon Kremer]], Yulia Brodskaya (Julia Verba), [[Zoya Petrosyan]], [[Victor Danchenko]], Victor Pikaizen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AgJMAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Victor+Pikaizen+Oistrakh+pupil&amp;dq=Victor+Pikaizen+Oistrakh+pupil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFqu3tieHaAhXGjVkKHbEDCXQQ6AEISTAI|title=Music in the USSR|last=|first=|publisher=VAAP-INFORM|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=We repeated it almost word for word at the meeting of the musical society in the district centre of Sirvintos, attended by Igor Oistrakh, Khalida Akh- tyamova, Victor Pikaizen, the pupils of the great David Oistrakh to whose memory are devoted the courses of the highest performing skill,}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWw9AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Victor+Pikaizen+Oistrakh+pupil&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Pikaizen+and+Rosa+Fain%2C+all+pupils|title=The Strad - Volume 95|last=|first=|publisher=Orpheus|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=413|quote=He left a number of recordings as a conductor, the most interesting being those in which he accompanied string soloists: Harold in Italy with Barshai (Oistrakh did not make a recording of this work playing the viola, although it was in his regular repertory) and concertos with Oleg Kagan, Igor Oistrakh, Viktor Pikaizen and Rosa Fain, all pupils of his. Which brings us to one of the most enduring monuments to Oistrakh's genius - his success as a pedagogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Cyrus Forough]], Olga Parhomenko, and his son Igor Oistrakh.  In the 1950s, David Oistrakh invited Yulia Brodskaya to be his assistant in teaching solo and chamber music and Rosa Fine as his assistant for solo students.  

From 1940 to 1963, Oistrakh performed extensively in a trio that also included the cellist [[Sviatoslav Knushevitsky]] and the pianist [[Lev Oborin]]. It was sometimes called the 'Oistrakh Trio.' Oistrakh collaborated extensively with Oborin, as well as [[Jacques Thibaud]], a [[French people|French]] [[violin]]ist.

===During World War II===
During World War II, he was active in the Soviet Union, premiering new concerti by [[Nikolai Miaskovsky]] and [[Aram Khachaturian|Khachaturian]] as well as two sonatas by his friend [[Sergei Prokofiev]].  He was also awarded the Stalin Prize in 1942. The final years of the war saw the blossoming of a friendship with Shostakovich, which would lead to the two violin concertos and the sonata, all of which were to be premiered by and become firmly associated with Oistrakh in the following years. Oistrakh's career was set from this point, although the Soviet Union was "protective" of its people and refused to let him perform abroad. He continued to teach in the Moscow Conservatory, but when [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union]], he went to the front lines, playing for soldiers and factory workers under intensely difficult conditions. Arguably one of the most heroic acts in his life was a performance of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto to the end in the central music hall during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in the winter of 1942 while central Stalingrad was being massively bombed by the German forces.  However, other sources indicate that Oistrakh performed in Leningrad that winter.&lt;ref&gt;Yakov Soroker, "David Oistrakh" p.139. Lexicon Publishing, Jerusalem, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether Oistrakh performed in Stalingrad is unconfirmed.

===International travel===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-23447-0001, Dresden, Konzert David Oistrach (crop).jpg|thumb|Oistrakh in 1954]]
Oistrakh was allowed to travel after the end of the war.  He traveled to the countries in the Soviet bloc and even to the West. His first foreign engagement was to appear at the newly founded "Prague Spring" Festival where he was met with enormous success. In 1949 he gave his first concert in the West – in Helsinki. In 1951, he appeared at the "Maggio Musicale" Festival in Florence, in 1952 he was in East Germany for the Beethoven celebrations, France in 1953, Britain in 1954, and eventually, in 1955, he was allowed to tour the United States. By 1959, he was beginning to establish a second career as a conductor, and in 1960 he was awarded the coveted Lenin Prize. His Moscow conducting debut followed in 1962, and by 1967 he had established a partnership with the celebrated Soviet pianist [[Sviatoslav Richter]].

===Later years===
1968 saw wide celebrations for the violinist's sixtieth birthday, which included a celebratory performance in the Great Hall of Moscow Conservatory of the Tchaikovsky concerto, one of his favourite works, under the baton of [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]]. Oistrakh was now seen as one of the great violinists of his time, among such luminaries as Romania's [[George Enescu]] and Lithuanian-born [[Jascha Heifetz]].

Oistrakh suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] as early as 1964. He survived and continued to work at a furious pace. He had already become one of the principal cultural ambassadors for the Soviet Union to the West in live concerts and recordings. After conducting a cycle of Brahms with the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]], he died from another heart attack in Amsterdam in 1974. His remains were returned to Moscow, where he was interred in [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

==Distinctions==
Oistrakh received many awards and distinctions. Within the Soviet Union, David Oistrakh was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] in 1943, the title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]] in 1953, and the [[Lenin Prize]] in 1960. He also won the 1935 [[Soviet Union Competition]]. Several reputable works from the standard violin repertoire are dedicated to Oistrakh, including a concerto by Khachaturian, two concerti by Shostakovich, and several other pieces.

Oistrakh's fame and success were not limited to the Soviet Union: he placed second at the [[Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition]] in [[Warsaw]], after 16-year-old prodigy [[Ginette Neveu]], and further improved upon that by winning the grand prize in the [[Queen Elisabeth Competition]] in [[Brussels]].

Additionally, the [[asteroid]] [[42516 Oistrach]] is named in honour of him and his son, the violinist [[Igor Oistrakh]].

==Instruments==
David Oistrakh is known to have played at least seven [[Stradivarius]] violins owned by the Soviet Union. He initially selected the 1702 Conte di Fontana Stradivarius, which he played for 10 years before exchanging it for the 1705 [[Marsick Stradivarius]] in June 1966, which he played until his death.

David Oistrakh used  bows by [[Albert Nürnberger]] and [[Andre Richaume]] throughout his life.
Up until 1957, he used a Nürnberger bow.
"The [[Andre Richaume]] bow bought by his son Igor Oistrakh in 1957 had filled David with such enthusiasm that Igor made a gift of it."&lt;ref name="francois"&gt;{{cite book | last=Raffin | first=Jean Francois |author2=Millant, Bernard | title=L'Archet | location=Paris | publisher=L'Archet Éditions | year=2000 | isbn=2-9515569-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oistrakh had remarked that this (Richaume) bow  gave him great satisfaction, so much so that when in Paris, he had to meet Richaume in person.&lt;ref name="francois"/&gt;

'''Ethnic cleansing''' is the systematic forced removal of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or racial groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically [[homogeneous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Rubenstein |title=The Cultural Landscape: An Introduction to Human Geography |publisher=Pearson, |year=2008 |isbn=9780131346819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} The forces applied may be various forms of [[forced migration]] ([[deportation]], [[population transfer]]), intimidation, as well as [[genocide]] and [[genocidal rape]].

Ethnic cleansing is usually accompanied with efforts to remove physical and cultural evidence of the targeted group in the territory through the destruction of homes, social centers, farms, and infrastructure, and by the desecration of monuments, cemeteries, and places of worship.

Initially used by the perpetrators during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and cited in this context as a euphemism akin to that of Nazi Germany's "[[Final Solution]]", by the 1990s, the term gained widespread acceptance due to journalism and the media's heightened use of the term in its generic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thum |first1= Gregor |year= 2006–2007 |title= Ethnic Cleansing in Eastern Europe after 1945 |journal= Contemporary European History |volume= 19 |issue=1 |pages= 75–81 |doi=10.1017/S0960777309990257 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
An antecedent to the term is the Greek word ''andrapodismos'' ({{lang-gr|ανδραποδισμός}}; lit. "enslavement"), which was used in ancient texts to describe atrocities that accompanied [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in 335 BC.&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Booth|year=2012|title=The Kosovo Tragedy: The Human Rights Dimensions|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-13633-476-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4MsBgAAQBAJe|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, regional variants of the term could be found among the Czechs ''(očista)'', the Poles ''(oczyszczanie)'', the French ''(épuration)'' and the Germans ''(Säuberung)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Ther |editor1=Rainer Munz |editor2=Rainer Ohliger |year=2004 |title=Diasporas and Ethnic Migrants: Germany, Israel and Russia in Comparative Perspective |chapter=The Spell of the Homogeneous Nation State: Structural Factors and Agents of Ethnic Cleansing |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-13575-938-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEOQAgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} A 1913 [[Carnegie Endowment]] report condemning the actions of all participants in the [[Balkan Wars]] contained various new terms to describe brutalities committed toward ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://balkanologie.revues.org/2365|title=The Two Carnegie Reports: From the Balkan Expedition of 1913 to the Albanian Trip of 1921|first=Nadine|last=Akhund|date=December 31, 2012|publisher=|journal=Balkanologie.

During [[World War II]], the euphemism ''čišćenje terena'' ("cleansing the terrain") was used by the Croatian [[Ustaše]] to describe military actions in which non-Croats were purposely killed or otherwise uprooted from their homes.&lt;ref name="Toal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toal|first1=Gerard|last2=Dahlman|first2=Carl T.|title=Bosnia Remade: Ethnic Cleansing and Its Reversal|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2011|isbn= 978-0-19-973036-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1TrvGxJeasC|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viktor Gutić]], a senior Ustaše leader, was one of the first Croatian nationalists on record to use the term as a euphemism for committing atrocities against [[Serbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=West|year=1994|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7867-0332-6|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later used in the internal memorandums of Serbian [[Chetniks]] in reference to a number of retaliatory massacres they committed against [[Bosniaks]] and [[Croats]] between 1941 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edina |last=Becirevic|year=2014|title=Genocide on the River Drina|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-3001-9258-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0X4AwAAQBAJ|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian phrase очистка границ (''ochistka granits''; lit. "cleansing of borders") was used in Soviet documents of the early 1930s to refer to the forced resettlement of Polish people from the {{convert|22|km|adj=on}} [[Border Security Zone of Russia|border zone]] in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSRs]]. This process was repeated on an even larger scale in 1939–41, involving many other groups suspected of disloyalty towards the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; During [[The Holocaust]], [[Nazi Germany]] pursued a policy of ensuring that Europe was "cleansed of Jews" ''([[Judenrein]])''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mary |last=Fulbrooke|year=2004|title=A Concise History of Germany|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-52154-071-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFBu8ujJWzkC|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its complete form, the term appeared for the first time in the Romanian language (''purificare etnică'') in an address by Vice Prime Minister [[Mihai Antonescu]] to cabinet members in July 1941. After the beginning of the invasion of the USSR,{{huh?|date=October 2017}} he concluded: “I do not know when the Romanians will have such chance for ethnic cleansing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnopolitical Temptations Reach Southeastern Europe: Wartime Policy Papers of Vasa Čubrilović and Sabin Manuilă|last=Petrovic|first=Vladimir|publisher=CEU Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the Soviets used the term "ethnic cleansing" to describe the inter-ethnic violence in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt; At around the same time, the Yugoslav media used it to describe what they alleged was an Albanian nationalist plot to force all Serbs to leave [[Kosovo]]. It was widely popularized by the Western media during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95). The first recorded mention of its use in the Western media can be traced back to an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' dated 15 April 1992, in a quote by an anonymous Western diplomat.&lt;ref name="Toal"/&gt;

Synonyms include ''ethnic purification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Drazen |last=Petrovic |url=http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/5/1/1247.pdf |title=Ethnic Cleansing – An Attempt at Methodology |journal=European Journal of International Law |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=1994 |page=343 |accessdate=May 20, 2006 |quote=In English, reference is also made to 'ethnic purification'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Final Report of the Commission of Experts established pursuant to [[Security Council Resolution 780]] defined ethnic cleansing as "a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas".&lt;ref name="SCRes780-Report-130"&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 780 (1992) |date=May 27, 1994 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 |publisher=United Nations Security Council |format=PDF |page=33 &lt;!--paragraph 130--&gt; |quote=Upon examination of reported information, specific studies and investigations, the Commission confirms its earlier view that 'ethnic cleansing' is a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas. To a large extent, it is carried out in the name of misguided nationalism, historic grievances and a powerful driving sense of revenge. This purpose appears to be the occupation of territory to the exclusion of the purged group or groups. This policy and the practices of warring factions are described separately in the following paragraphs.}} Paragraph 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In its previous, first interim report it noted, "[b]ased on the many reports describing the policy and practices conducted in the former [[Yugoslavia]], [that] 'ethnic cleansing' has been carried out by means of murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, [[war rape|rape]] and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property. Those practices constitute [[crimes against humanity]] and can be assimilated to specific [[war crime]]s. Furthermore, such acts could also fall within the meaning of the [[Genocide Convention]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 780 (1992) |date=May 27, 1994 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 |publisher=United Nations Security Council |format=PDF |page=33}} Paragraph 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The official United Nations definition of ethnic cleansing is "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or [[intimidation]] to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Robert M. (1996) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2501233 "Schindler's Fate: Genocide, Ethnic Cleansing, and Population Transfers"]. ''[[Slavic Review]]'' 55 (4), 727-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a category, ethnic cleansing encompasses a continuum or spectrum of policies. In the words of [[Andrew Bell-Fialkoff]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]thnic cleansing [...] defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with deportation and genocide. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of a population from a given territory''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html "A Brief History of Ethnic Cleansing"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203000000/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html |date=February 3, 2004 }}, ''Foreign Affairs'' 72 (3): 110, Summer 1993. Retrieved May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Terry Martin (publisher)|Terry Martin]] has defined ethnic cleansing as "the forcible removal of an ethnically defined population from a given territory" and as "occupying the central part of a continuum between genocide on one end and nonviolent pressured ethnic emigration on the other end".&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin, Terry (1998). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/235168 "The Origins of Soviet Ethnic Cleansing"]. ''[[The Journal of Modern History]]'' 70 (4), 813–861. pg. 822&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] in the judgement of [[Jorgic v. Germany]] on July 12, 2007 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] quoted from the ICJ ruling on the ''Bosnian Genocide Case'' to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide'':
{{quote|The term 'ethnic cleansing' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are the subject of this case ... [UN] General Assembly resolution 47/121 referred in its Preamble to 'the abhorrent policy of "ethnic cleansing", which is a form of genocide', as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ... It [i.e., ethnic cleansing] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [Genocide] Convention, if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area "ethnically homogeneous", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can ''as such'' be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is "to destroy, in whole or in part" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''dolus specialis''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the ICTY has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' (''Krstić'', IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 2 August 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide.' |ECHR quoting the ICJ.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-81608 ''Jorgic v. Germany''] §45 citing ''Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro'' ("Case concerning application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide"), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found under the heading of “intent and ‘ethnic cleansing’” (at § 190)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==As a crime under international law==

There is no international treaty that specifies a specific crime of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ward |last=Ferdinandusse |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |title=The Interaction of National and International Approaches in the Repression of International Crimes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705180121/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=5 |year=2004 |p=1042, note 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense—the forcible deportation of a population—is defined as a [[crime against humanity]] under the statutes of both [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm "Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113100723/http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm |date=January 13, 2008 }}, Article 7; [https://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/index.htm ''Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia''], Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under public international law of [[crimes against humanity]] and in certain circumstances [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daphna |last=Shraga |first2=Ralph |last2=Zacklin |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |title=The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233818/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=3 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however situations, such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]], where ethnic cleansing has taken place without legal redress (see [[Preussische Treuhand v. Poland|''Preussische Treuhand'' v. Poland]]). [[Timothy V. Waters]] argues therefore that similar ethnic cleansing could go unpunished in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy V. Waters, [http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4600&amp;context=expresso "On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing"], Paper 951, 2006, [[University of Mississippi]] School of Law. Retrieved on 2006, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there – thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity". For example, the post-WWII [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.--&gt;

==Genocide==
[[File:Armenianvictimsassault.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Genocide]] victims]]
Academic discourse considers both [[genocide]] and ethnic cleansing to exist in a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or population transfer whereas genocide is the intentional murder of part or all of a particular ethnic, racial, religious, or national group. While ethnic cleansing and genocide may share the same goal and the acts used to perpetrate both crimes may often resemble each other, ethnic cleansing is intended to displace a persecuted population from a given territory, while genocide is intended to destroy a population.&lt;ref name=Schabas&gt;{{cite book |last=Schabas |first=William |year=2000 |title=Genocide in International Law |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYptuRHDQPgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=199–201 |isbn=9780521787901}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some academics consider genocide as a subset of "murderous ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |year=2005 |title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Dark+Side+of+Democracy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=17 |isbn=9780521538541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these concepts are different, but related, as Norman Naimark writes: "literally and figuratively, ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide, as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people".&lt;ref name=MassVio&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Naimark |first=Norman |date=4 November 2007 |url=http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |title=Theoretical Paper: Ethnic Cleansing |encyclopedia=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306173512/http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |archivedate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Schabas adds, "Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come.

In 1946 [[Königsberg]] was renamed [[Kaliningrad]]. The survivors of the German population were forcibly expelled and the city was repopulated with Soviet citizens.

In the 1990s [[Bosnian war]], ethnic cleansing was a common phenomenon. It typically entailed intimidation, forced expulsion and/or killing of the undesired ethnic group, as well as the destruction or removal of key physical and cultural elements. These included places of worship, cemeteries, works of art and historic buildings. According to numerous ICTY verdicts, both Serb&lt;ref name="ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm |title=ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414072922/http://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Croat&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm |title=ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627000306/http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forces performed ethnic cleansing of their intended territories in order to create ethnically pure states ([[Republika Srpska]] and [[Herzeg-Bosnia]]). Serb forces were also judged to have committed [[Srebrenica genocide|genocide in Srebrenica and Zepa]] at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY; "Address by ICTY President Theodor Meron, at Potočari Memorial Cemetery" The Hague, June 23, 2004 [https://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2004/p860-e.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403003018/http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2004/p860-e.htm |date=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the evidence of numerous attacks by Croat forces against Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993, the Croat leadership from Bosnia and Herzegovina had a designated plan to ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley in Central Bosnia. Dario Kordić, the local political leader, was found to be the instigator of this plan.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict - IV. Attacks on towns and villages: killings - C.

In the same year (1993), ethnic cleansing was also occurring in another country. During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]], the armed [[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]] [[separatist]] insurgency implemented a campaign of [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] against the large population of ethnic Georgians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an NEUTRAL expert opinion this sentence is OR.

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of systemic impacts. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians—recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it removes the fish by draining the water{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to the new Germany]] after 1945, it can contribute to long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} Some individuals of the large German population in [[Czechoslovakia]] and prewar [[Poland]] had encouraged Nazi [[jingoism]] before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} It thus establishes "[[facts on the ground]]"—radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse.

==Silent ethnic cleansing==
[[File:16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 05082011 355.jpg|thumb|A ceremony marking the 16th anniversary of [[Operation Storm]], which resulted in the expulsion of more than 200,000 ethnic [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs from Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4747379.stm Evicted Serbs remember Storm ]". BBC News. 5 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{refimprove|date=August 2017}}

Silent ethnic cleansing is a term coined in the mid-1990s by some observers of the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Apparently concerned with Western media representations of atrocities committed in the conflict—which generally focused on those perpetrated by the Serbs—atrocities committed against [[Serbs]] were dubbed "silent" on the grounds that they did not receive adequate coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Krauthammer, Charles: "When Serbs Are 'Cleansed,' Moralists Stay Silent", ''International Herald Tribune'', August 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some incidents in [[Northern Ireland]] and during [[the Troubles]] between Protestants and Catholics were considered to be "ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/10/northernireland.race|title=Racist war of the loyalist street gangs|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|date=January 10, 2004|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/06/07/news/unionist-react-angrily-to-ira-ethnic-cleansing-plan-550226/|title=Unionists react angrily to IRA ‘ethnic cleansing' border plan|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included events after the [[Holy Cross dispute]] in 2001 when Protestant paramilitaries were accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing of Catholics in north [[Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1974017.stm|title=Fresh trouble in Belfast|date=May 8, 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/09/northernireland.rosiecowan|title='Ethnic cleansing' claim over Ulster attacks|first=Rosie|last=Cowan|date=September 9, 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases where accusations of ethnic cleansing have circulated, partisans have fiercely disputed such an interpretation and the details of the events which have been described as ethnic cleansing by academic or legal experts. This often leads to the promotion of vastly different versions of the event in question.

==Criticism of the term==
[[Gregory Stanton]], the founder of [[Genocide Watch]], has criticised the rise of the term and its use for events that he feels should be called "genocide": as "ethnic cleansing" has no legal definition, its media use can detract attention from events that should be prosecuted as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blum |first=Rony |last2=Stanton |first2=Gregory H. |last3=Sagi |first3=Shira |last4=Richter |first4=Elihu D. |title='Ethnic cleansing' bleaches the atrocities of genocide |journal=European Journal of Public Health |year=2007 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pmid=17513346 |pages=204–209 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Ethnic Cleansing and Genocidal Intent: A Failure of Judicial Interpretation?", ''Genocide Studies and Prevention'' 5, 1 (April 2010), Douglas Singleterry&lt;/ref&gt; Because of widespread acceptance after media influence, it has become a term used legally, but carries no legal repercussions as there is no legal definition.

In 1992, the German equivalent of ethnic cleansing" ({{lang-de|Ethnische Säuberung}}) was named [[Un-word of the year|German Un-Word of the Year]] by the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' due to its euphemistic, inappropriate nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christoph |last=Gunkel |date=October 31, 2010 |url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l18/l0/F.html#featuredEntry |publisher=[[Spiegel Online]] |title=Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort! |language=de |trans-title=One year, one (un)word!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eudokia Angelina''' (or '''Eudocia Angelina''') ({{lang-gr|Ευδοκία Αγγελίνα}}, {{lang-sr|Evdokija Anđel}}; around 1173–died {{circa|1211}}, or later) was the consort of [[Stefan the First-Crowned]] [[Serbian Grand Principality|of Serbia]] from 1196 to 1198. She later became the mistress of [[Alexios V Doukas]],  the future Emperor. She was a daughter of [[Alexios III Angelos]] and [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]].

==Life==
Eudokia first married [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan]], the second son of [[Stefan Nemanja]], Grand Župan of [[Rascia]]. The marriage was arranged by her uncle, the emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]], around 1186, while her father was in exile in Syria. In 1195, on her father-in-law's retirement to a monastery, Eudokia's husband became ruler of Rascia. According to the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Nicetas Choniates]], Stefan and Eudocia quarrelled and separated, accusing one another of adultery, after June 1198. In 1200 or 1201, Eudokia was banished from his realm. Eudokia fled on foot with only the clothes on her back, seeking refuge at the court of [[Vukan Nemanjić|Vukan]], ruler of [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]], who befriended her and provided for. When she recovered, Eudokia went to [[Dyrrachium]], from where a Byzantine ship returned her to her father in [[Constantinople]]. The [[Repudiation (marriage)|repudiation]] of Eudokia shows the decline of Byzantine power and prestige.&lt;ref name=Fine94&gt;{{cite book | last=Fine | first=John Van Antwerp, Jr. |author-link=John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr. | title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest | publisher=University of Michigan Press | location=Michigan | year=1994 | isbn=0-472-08260-4 |page=46|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Constantinople Eudokia became the mistress of the future [[Alexios V Doukas]], with whom she (and her mother) fled the city into [[Thrace]] on April 12, 1204, as the Crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] were storming the city. Reaching her deposed father at [[Mosynopolis]], Eudocia was allowed to marry Alexios V, but he was enucleated on the orders of Alexios III shortly afterwards, then captured and sentenced to death by the Crusaders.

Eudokia married thirdly [[Leo Sgouros]], the independent ruler of [[Corinth]], after he offered asylum to Alexios III and his family in 1204. Blockaded in the citadel of Corinth, Leo Sgouros committed suicide in 1207/1208. Eudokia is thought to have died around 1211.

By her marriage to Stefan of Serbia she had two children:&lt;ref&gt;Laskaris, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Evo: The Last Gasp of the Dinosaurs''''' is a [[German-style board game]] for three to five players, designed by [[Philippe Keyaerts]] and published by [[Eurogames (game publisher)|Eurogames]].  The game won the ''[[GAMES Magazine]]'' award for ''Game of the year 2002'' and was [[nominated]] for the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game 2000''. The game went out of print in 2007, and a second edition was released in 2011.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Deskohraní 08-09-27 227.jpg|thumb|Evo]]
The main game board is made of two reversible sections; on each, the two sides contain differently-sized halves of a [[prehistoric]] [[island]]. The board can therefore be assembled in four ways:
*small-small for three players
*small-large or large-small for four players
*large-large for five players.

The island itself is made up of hexes of four different [[terrain]] types - "Hot", "Warm", "Cool" and "Cold". The game also uses a separate board for marking the current [[climate]] and round number, another for players scoring and bidding progress, and each player has a board to mark their [[dinosaur]]'s [[mutation]]s. The players' scores are also used as money during bidding phases.

Players start with three Event cards, a stack of "dino" tokens several mutations: one "[[Egg (biology)|Egg]]", one "[[Leg]]", one "[[Tail]]", one "[[Horn (anatomy)|Horn]]", one "[[Fur]]" and one "[[Parasol]]". Each player places a dino token on their starting hex and a scoring marker on "10". Play proceeds through various phases:

#'''Initiative''' - the order players will act in is determined by the number of "tail" mutations they have. Ties are resolved by roll-offs on a six-sided die.
#'''Climate''' - a six-sided die is rolled to determine how the climate changes. Normally it proceeds in a cycle from hot to cold and back again, but on a 5 it stays the same, and on a 6 it moves in the opposite direction to the expected one.
#'''Movement and Combat''' - players can move their dinos. The more "leg" mutations they have, the further they can move their dinos. If they attempt to move into a space occupied by another dino, they must fight. The aggressor is at a disadvantage unless they have more "horn" mutations than the defender.
#'''Birth''' - players can add one new dino to the board for each "egg" mutation they possess, next to their existing dinos.
#'''Survival and Mutation''' - dinos die off depending on climate and terrain. "Parasol" and "Fur" mutations allow them to withstand heat and cold, respectively. The players then bid for new mutations; their (successful) bids are subtracted from their score. In addition to the starting mutations, there are "gene" mutations which make future purchases cheaper, and "card" mutations which give the player additional event cards.
#'''Meteor and Evolution''' - In later turns, there is a chance that a [[Meteor]] strikes the island, ending the game. In earlier turns, and in later turns in which the game does not end, the players gain one point for each dino of their colour on the board.

Event cards can be used at various points to alter the game. The player with the most points when the game ends wins.

==Game interest==
The simple [[strategy game]] at the core of ''Evo'' is made more interesting by the constantly changing climate. Positions which can be advantageous in one turn are often deadly a few turns later, so unlike many games where a winning player can come to dominate the game, the balance of power shifts frequently.

Unlike most [[German-style board game]]s, in the first edition it is possible for a player to be eliminated if all his dino tokens are removed from the board. However, this is very rare in practice. In the new edition, player elimination has been prevented by allowing players who only have two dinosaurs to be invulnerable during survival and combat phases. One of the many new unique gene abilities increases this limit to three, allowing players doing poorly to remain competitive.

'''Foton''' (or Photon) is the project name of two series of [[Russia]]n science [[satellite]] and [[reentry vehicle]] programs. Although [[Unmanned space mission|unmanned]], the design was adapted from the manned [[Vostok spacecraft]] capsule.  The primary focus of the Foton project is [[materials science]] research, but some missions have also carried experiments for other fields of research including [[biology]].  The original Foton series included 12 launches from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] from 1985 to 1999.  The second series, under the name '''Foton-M''', incorporates many design improvements over the original Foton, and is still in use.  So far, there have been four launch attempts of the Foton-M.  The first was in 2002 from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]], which [[Foton-M1|ended in failure]] due to a problem in the launch vehicle.  The last three were from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], in 2005, 2007, and 2014; all were successful.  Both the Foton and Foton-M series used [[Soyuz-U]] (11A511U and 11A511U2) rockets as launch vehicles. Starting with the Foton-7 mission, the [[European Space Agency]] has been a partner in the Foton program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=facfoton | title = Foton | publisher = [[ESA]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060323090947/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=facfoton | archivedate = 2006-03-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foton-M==
'''Foton-M''' is a new generation of [[Russia]]n [[robotic spacecraft]] for research conducted in the [[microgravity]] environment of Earth [[orbit]]. The Foton-M design is based on the design of the [[Foton (space programs)|Foton]], with several improvements including a new [[telemetry]] and [[telecommand]] unit for increased data flow rate, increased [[battery (electricity)|battery]] capacity, and a better thermal control system. It is produced by [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center|TsSKB-Progress]] in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]].

The first launch, of [[Foton-M No.1|Foton-M1]], failed because of a malfunction of the [[Soyuz-U]] [[launch vehicle|launcher]]. The second launch, of [[Foton-M No.2|Foton-M2]], was, however, a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMZDJ0DU8E_index_0.html | title = European experiments successfully launched aboard Foton spacecraft | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foton-M3 was launched on 14 September 2007 carried by a [[Soyuz-U]] rocket lifting off from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMQDB13J6F_index_0.html | title = Lift-off for Foton microgravity mission | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Nadezhda (cockroach)|Nadezhda]], a cockroach that was the first earth creature  to produce offspring that had been conceived in space. It returned successfully to Earth on September 26, 2007, landing in [[Kazakhstan]] at 7:58 [[GMT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFVO6H07F_index_0.html |title=Foton-M3 experiments return to Earth |accessdate= 2007-09-26 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reentry ==
The Foton capsule has limited thruster capability. As such, the reentry path and orientation can not be controlled after the capsule has separated from the engine system. This means that the capsule has to be protected from reentry heat on all sides, thus explaining the spherical design (as opposed to Project Mercury's conical design), which allows for maximum volume while minimizing the external surface. However, the lack of lift means the capsule experiences high forces on reentry, up to 8 to 9g.

[[File:Poulenc-1922.jpg|alt=head and shoulder shot of young man looking towards the camera|thumb|Poulenc in the early 1920s]]
'''Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃sis ʒɑ̃ maʁsɛl pulɛ̃k|lang}}; 7 January 1899{{spaced ndash}}30 January 1963) was a French composer and pianist. His compositions include ''[[mélodie]]s'', solo piano works, chamber music, choral pieces, operas, ballets, and orchestral concert music. Among the best-known are the piano suite ''[[Trois mouvements perpétuels]]'' (1919), the ballet ''[[Les biches]]'' (1923), the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'' (1928) for [[harpsichord]] and orchestra, the [[Organ Concerto (Poulenc)|Organ Concerto]] (1938), the opera ''[[Dialogues des Carmélites]]'' (1957), and the ''[[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]]'' (1959) for [[soprano]], choir and orchestra.

As the only son of a prosperous manufacturer Poulenc was expected to follow his father into the family firm, and he was not allowed to enrol&lt;!-- ENROL NOT ENROLL - THIS ARTICLE USES BRITISH AND NOT AMERICAN SPELLING--&gt; at a music college. Largely self-educated musically, he studied with the pianist [[Ricardo Viñes]], who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc soon came under the influence of [[Erik Satie]], under whose tutelage he became one of a group of young composers known collectively as ''[[Les Six]]''. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.

In addition to composing, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the [[baritone]] [[Pierre Bernac]] (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano [[Denise Duval]], touring in Europe and America with each, and making many recordings. He was among the first composers to see the importance of the [[phonograph|gramophone]], and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.

In his later years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, particularly in his native country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. During the 21st century more attention has been given to his serious works, with many new productions of ''Dialogues des Carmélites'' and ''[[La voix humaine]]'' worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and choral music.

==Life==
===Early years===
Poulenc was born in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]], the younger child and only son of Émile Poulenc and his wife, Jenny, ''née'' Royer.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Émile Poulenc was a joint owner of the [[Poulenc Frères]], a successful manufacturer of pharmaceuticals (later [[Rhône-Poulenc]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cayez, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of a pious Roman Catholic family from [[Espalion]] in the [[Departments of France|département]] of [[Aveyron]]. Jenny Poulenc was from a Parisian family with wide artistic interests. In Poulenc's view, the two sides of his nature grew out of this background: a deep religious faith from his father's family and a worldly and artistic side from his mother's.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Chimènes, Myriam and Roger Nichols. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22202 "Poulenc, Francis"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 24 August 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic Claude Rostand later described Poulenc as "half monk and half naughty boy".{{refn|"...y a en lui du moine et du voyou."&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; "Voyou" has no exact English translation, and as well as "naughty boy",&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (2014), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; it has been variously rendered as "ragamuffin or street-urchin",&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; "guttersnipe",&lt;ref&gt;Buckland and Chimènes, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; "bad boy",&lt;ref&gt;Ivry, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; "bounder",&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; "hooligan",&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Lynne.

[[File:P1040339 Paris VIII place des Saussaies rwk.JPG|thumb|left|alt=19th century buildings in Parisian style|The Place des Saussaies, Paris, where Poulenc was born]]
Poulenc grew up in a musical household; his mother was a capable pianist, with a wide repertoire ranging from classical to less elevated works that gave him a lifelong taste for what he called "adorable bad music".&lt;ref name=h2&gt;Hell, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Jenny Poulenc's favourites ranged from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] to popular sentimental pieces by composers such as [[Anton Rubinstein]].&lt;ref name=h2/&gt; Poulenc dedicated his opera ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'' (1956) to "the memory of my mother, who revealed music to me".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Schmidt (2001), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He took piano lessons from the age of five; when he was eight he first heard the music of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and was fascinated by the originality of the sound. Other composers whose works influenced his development were [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]: the former's ''[[Winterreise]]'' and the latter's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' made a deep impression on him.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; At his father's insistence, Poulenc followed a conventional school career, studying at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] in Paris rather than at a music conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), pp. 6 and 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 a childhood friend, Raymonde Linossier (1897–1930), introduced Poulenc to [[Adrienne Monnier]]'s bookshop, the ''Maison des Amis des Livres''.&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (1978), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; There he met the ''avant-garde'' poets [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Paul Éluard]] and [[Louis Aragon]]. He later set many of their poems to music.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he became the pupil of the pianist [[Ricardo Viñes]]. The biographer [[Henri Hell]] comments that Viñes's influence on his pupil was profound, both as to pianistic technique and the style of Poulenc's keyboard works. Poulenc later said of Viñes:
[[File:Ricardo-vines.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=middle aged man with huge moustache|The pianist [[Ricardo Viñes]], with whom Poulenc studied from 1914]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was a most delightful man, a bizarre hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used to rap my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough.&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (1978), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, he was the only virtuoso who played Debussy and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything&amp;nbsp;... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Schmidt (2001), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Poulenc was sixteen his mother died; his father died two years later. Viñes became more than a teacher: he was, in the words of Myriam Chimènes in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', the young man's "spiritual mentor".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; He encouraged his pupil to compose, and he later gave the premieres of three early Poulenc works.{{refn|The works were ''[[Trois mouvements perpétuels]]'', ''Trois pastorales'' and ''Suite pour piano''.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 2001, p. 21"&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Through him Poulenc became friendly with two composers who helped shape his early development: [[Georges Auric]] and [[Erik Satie]].&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Auric, who was the same age as Poulenc, was an early developer musically; by the time the two met, Auric's music had already been performed at important Parisian concert venues. The two young composers shared a similar musical outlook and enthusiasms, and for the rest of Poulenc's life Auric was his most trusted friend and guide.&lt;ref name=h4/&gt; Poulenc called him "my true brother in spirit".&lt;ref name="Schmidt 2001, p. 21"/&gt; Satie, an eccentric figure, isolated from the mainstream French musical establishment, was a mentor to several rising young composers, including Auric, [[Louis Durey]] and [[Arthur Honegger]]. After initially dismissing Poulenc as a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] amateur, he relented and admitted him to the circle of protégés, whom he called ''"Les Nouveaux Jeunes"''.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Poulenc described Satie's influence on him as "immediate and wide, on both the spiritual and musical planes".&lt;ref&gt;Romain, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The pianist [[Alfred Cortot]] commented that Poulenc's ''[[Trois mouvements perpétuels]]'' were "reflections of the ironical outlook of Satie adapted to the sensitive standards of the current intellectual circles".&lt;ref name=h4&gt;Hell, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===First compositions and ''Les Six''===
Poulenc made his début as a composer in 1917 with his ''[[Rapsodie nègre]]'', a ten-minute, five-[[movement (music)|movement]] piece for [[baritone]] and chamber group;{{refn|The Poulenc scholar Carl B Schmidt lists two works earlier than ''Rapsodie nègre'', unperformed and known to have been destroyed by the composer: "Processional pour la crémation d'un mandarin" (Processional for the Cremation of a Mandarin) (1914) and Préludes (1916) both for solo piano;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (1995), pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; several later pieces composed between 1917 and 1919 were also destroyed or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (1995), p. 525&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer [[Jane Bathori]]. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian [[Flâneur|boulevard]] slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the [[rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]]. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This ''jeu d'esprit'' was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call "leg-Poulenc".&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|A pun on the English colloquial expression "leg-pulling"&amp;nbsp;– playful, humorous deception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107003?redirectedFrom=leg-pulling#eid39632778 "leg-pull"], ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', retrieved 20 September 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Machart, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot.&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (1978), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 Poulenc got to know Ravel well enough to have serious discussions with him about music. He was dismayed by Ravel's judgments, which exalted composers whom Poulenc thought little of above those he greatly admired.&lt;ref name=rn117&gt;Nichols, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Poulenc recalled Ravel as saying that [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]] was a genius, Schumann was mediocre and much inferior to [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], late Debussy (such as ''[[Jeux]]'') was poor, and [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]]'s [[orchestration]] incompetent.&lt;ref name=rn117/&gt; Chabrier's music was one of Poulenc's particular enthusiasms. He said in the 1950s, "Ah! Chabrier, I love him as one loves a father! An indulgent father, always merry, his pockets full of tasty tit-bits. Chabrier's music is a treasure-house you could never exhaust. I just could not do without it. It consoles me on my darkest days, because you know&amp;nbsp;... I am a sad man&amp;nbsp;– who likes to laugh, as do all sad men."&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (1978), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He told Satie of this unhappy encounter; Satie replied with a dismissive epithet for Ravel who, he said, talked "a load of rubbish".&lt;ref name=rn117/&gt;{{refn|In the original, Poulenc's quotation of Satie's words is given as, "Ce c... de Ravel, c'est stupide tout ce qu'il dit!"&lt;ref name=p6375&gt;Poulenc (1963), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} For many years Poulenc was equivocal about Ravel's music, though always respecting him as a man. Ravel's modesty about his own music particularly appealed to Poulenc, who sought throughout his life to follow Ravel's example.&lt;ref name=n117&gt;Nichols, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Poulenc commented in 1958 how much he had come to admire Ravel and that he had been glad to be able to show it, not only in words, but as a pianist, through his interpretations of Ravel's works.&lt;ref name=t1958/&gt;|group= n}}

From January 1918 to January 1921 Poulenc was a conscript in the French army in the last months of the [[French Army in World War I|First World War]] and the immediate post-war period. Between July and October 1918 he served at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Franco-German front]], after which he was given a series of auxiliary posts, ending as a typist at the [[History of the Armée de l'Air_(1909–42)#World War I|Ministry of Aviation]].&lt;ref name=h9/&gt; His duties allowed him time for composition;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; the ''[[Trois mouvements perpétuels]]'' for piano and the Sonata for Piano Duet were written at the piano of the local elementary school at [[Saint-Martin-sur-le-Pré]], and he completed his first [[song cycle]], ''[[FP (Poulenc)#15a|Le bestiaire]]'', setting poems by Apollinaire. The sonata did not create a deep public impression, but the song cycle made the composer's name known in France, and the ''Trois mouvements perpétuels'' rapidly became an international success.&lt;ref name=h9&gt;Hell, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The exigencies of music-making in wartime taught Poulenc much about writing for whatever instruments were available; then, and later, some of his works were for unusual combinations of players.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;"Francis Poulenc", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 1963, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage in his career Poulenc was conscious of his lack of academic musical training; the critic and biographer [[Jeremy Sams]] writes that it was the composer's good luck that the public mood was turning against late-[[romantic music|romantic]] lushness in favour of the "freshness and insouciant charm" of his works, technically unsophisticated though they were.&lt;ref name=opera&gt;Sams, Jeremy. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O903945 " Poulenc, Francis"], ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 24 August 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of Poulenc's early works were premiered at the [[Salle Huyghens]] in the [[Montparnasse]] area, where between 1917 and 1920 the cellist Félix Delgrange presented concerts of music by young composers. Among them were Auric, Durey, Honegger, [[Darius Milhaud]] and [[Germaine Tailleferre]] who, with Poulenc, became known collectively as ''"[[Les Six]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; After one of their concerts, the critic [[Henri Collet]] published an article titled, "The Five Russians, the Six Frenchmen and Satie". According to Milhaud:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]], Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art&amp;nbsp;... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Hell, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Milhaud's view has been questioned by later writers. In ''[[Music &amp; Letters]]'' in 1957 Vera Rašín cast doubt on the statement that Collet's choice was arbitrary, surmising that the label ''"Les Six"'' was carefully planned by [[Jean Cocteau]], who had taken the group under his wing.&lt;ref name=vr&gt;Rašín, Vera. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/729312 "'Les Six' and Jean Cocteau"], ''Music &amp; Letters'', April 1957, pp. 164–169 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar view was put forward by the musicologist [[Robert Orledge]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cocteau, though similar in age to ''Les Six'', was something of a father-figure to the group.&lt;ref name=vr/&gt; His literary style, "paradoxical and lapidary" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 13 and 93; and Schmidt (2001), p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; When members of ''Les Six'' collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite ''[[L'Album des Six]]'' consists of six separate and unrelated pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hinson, p. 882&lt;/ref&gt; Their 1921 ballet ''[[Les mariés de la tour Eiffel]]'' contains three sections by Milhaud, two apiece by Auric, Poulenc and Tailleferre, one by Honegger and none by Durey, who was already distancing himself from the group.&lt;ref&gt;Desgraupes, p. 5; and Hell, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s Poulenc remained concerned at his lack of formal musical training. Satie was suspicious of music colleges, but Ravel advised Poulenc to take composition lessons; Milhaud suggested the composer and teacher [[Charles Koechlin]].&lt;ref name=h21&gt;Hell, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Koechlin, like Ravel, was a pupil of [[Gabriel Fauré]], but Poulenc did not share their love of Fauré's music: the Fauré scholar [[Jean-Michel Nectoux]] comments that Poulenc's aversion seems strange because of all the members of ''Les Six'', Poulenc "is the nearest to Fauré in the limpid clarity and singing quality of his own writing, in his charm".&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Poulenc worked with him intermittently from 1921 to 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s: increasing fame===
From the early 1920s Poulenc was well received abroad, particularly in Britain, both as a performer and a composer. In 1921 [[Ernest Newman]] wrote in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', "I keep my eye on Francis Poulenc, a young man who has only just arrived at his twenties. He ought to develop into a [[farce]]ur of the first order." Newman said that he had rarely heard anything so deliciously absurd as parts of Poulenc's song cycle ''Cocardes'', with its accompaniment played by the unorthodox combination of [[cornet]], trombone, violin and percussion.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Ernest. "The week in music", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 28 April 1921, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Poulenc and Milhaud travelled to Vienna to meet [[Alban Berg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Schönberg]]. Neither of the French composers was influenced by their Austrian colleagues' revolutionary [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] system, but they admired the three as its leading proponents.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Poulenc received a commission from [[Sergei Diaghilev]] for a full-length ballet score. He decided that the theme would be a modern version of the classical French ''[[fête galante]]''. This work, ''[[Les biches]]'', was an immediate success, first in Monte Carlo in January 1924 and then in Paris in May, under the direction of [[André Messager]]; it has remained one of Poulenc's best-known scores.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 24–28&lt;/ref&gt; Poulenc's new celebrity after the success of the ballet was the unexpected cause of his estrangement from Satie: among the new friends Poulenc made was Louis Laloy, a writer whom Satie regarded with implacable enmity.&lt;ref name=s136&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Auric, who had just enjoyed a similar triumph with a Diaghilev ballet, ''Les Fâcheux'', was also repudiated by Satie for becoming a friend of Laloy.&lt;ref name=s136/&gt;

[[File:W-Landowska2-crop.jpg|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders portrait of smiling middle-aged woman|upright|[[Wanda Landowska]], friend and colleague from 1923]]
As the decade progressed, Poulenc produced a range of compositions, from songs to chamber music and another ballet, ''[[Aubade (Poulenc)|Aubade]]''. Hell suggests that Koechlin's influence occasionally inhibited Poulenc's natural simple style, and that Auric offered useful guidance to help him appear in his true colours. At a concert of music by the two friends in 1926, Poulenc's songs were sung for the first time by the [[Baritone#Bariton/Baryton-Martin|baritone]] [[Pierre Bernac]], from whom, in Hell's phrase, "the name of Poulenc was soon to be inseparable."&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Another performer with whom the composer came to be closely associated was the [[harpsichord]]ist [[Wanda Landowska]]. He heard her as the soloist in [[Manuel de Falla|Falla]]'s ''[[El retablo de maese Pedro]]'' (1923), an early example of the use of a harpsichord in a modern work, and was immediately taken with the sound. At Landowska's request he wrote a concerto, the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'', which she premiered in 1929 with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Paris]] conducted by [[Pierre Monteux]].&lt;ref&gt;Canarina, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

The biographer Richard D. E. Burton comments that, in the late 1920s, Poulenc might have seemed to be in an enviable position: professionally successful and independently well-off, having inherited a substantial fortune from his father.&lt;ref name=b37&gt;Burton, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He bought a large country house, Le Grande Coteau, at [[Noizay]], Indre-et-Loire, {{convert|140|mi|km}} south-west of Paris, where he retreated to compose in peaceful surroundings.&lt;ref name=b37/&gt; Yet he was troubled, struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, which was predominantly homosexual. His first serious affair was with the painter [[Richard Chanlaire]], to whom he sent a copy of the ''Concert champêtre'' score inscribed, "You have changed my life, you are the sunshine of my thirty years, a reason for living and working".&lt;ref&gt;Ivry, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while this affair was in progress Poulenc proposed marriage to his friend Raymonde Linossier. As she was not only well aware of his homosexuality but was also romantically attached elsewhere, she refused him, and their relationship became strained.&lt;ref name=i74/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered the first of many periods of depression, which affected his ability to compose, and he was devastated in January 1930 when Linossier died suddenly at the age of 32. On her death he wrote, "All my youth departs with her, all that part of my life that belonged only to her. I sob&amp;nbsp;... I am now twenty years older".&lt;ref name=i74&gt;Ivry, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; His affair with Chanlaire petered out in 1931, though they remained lifelong friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ivry, p. 86; and Schmidt (2001), p. 461&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s: new seriousness===
At the start of the decade, Poulenc returned to writing songs, after a two-year break from doing so. His "Epitaphe", to a poem by [[François de Malherbe|Malherbe]], was written in memory of Linossier, and is described by the pianist [[Graham Johnson (musician)|Graham Johnson]] as "a profound song in every sense".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In addition to "Epitaphe", other Poulenc works were dedicated to Linossier or her memory are the Sonata for Horn, Trumpet and Trombone (1922), ''Ce doux petit visage'' (1939), ''Les Animaux modèles'' (1941) and "Voyage" from ''Calligrammes'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The following year Poulenc wrote three sets of songs, to words by Apollinaire and Max Jacob, some of which were serious in tone, and others reminiscent of his earlier light-hearted style, as were others of his works of the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 38–43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 his music was among the first to be broadcast on television, in a transmission by the [[BBC]] in which [[Reginald Kell]] and [[Gilbert Vinter]] played his [[Sonata for clarinet and bassoon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c88bcd0c71bd447fbc38c2ed188a8c46 "A Television Transmission by the Baird Process will take place during this programme"], Genome&amp;nbsp;– ''Radio Times'', 1923–2009, BBC, retrieved 17 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At about this time Poulenc began a relationship with Raymond Destouches, a chauffeur; as with Chanlaire earlier, what began as a passionate affair changed into a deep and lasting friendship. Destouches, who married in the 1950s, remained close to Poulenc until the end of the composer's life.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rocamadour fda.jpg|alt=View of small cliff-top village|thumb|[[Rocamadour]], which inspired Poulenc to compose religious works]]
Two unrelated events in 1936 combined to inspire a reawakening of religious faith and a new depth of seriousness in Poulenc's music. His fellow composer [[Pierre-Octave Ferroud]] was killed in a car crash so violent that he was decapitated, and almost immediately afterwards, while on holiday, Poulenc visited the sanctuary of [[Rocamadour]]. He later explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A few days earlier I'd just heard of the tragic death of my colleague&amp;nbsp;... As I meditated on the fragility of our human frame, I was drawn once more to the life of the spirit. Rocamadour had the effect of restoring me to the faith of my childhood. This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France&amp;nbsp;... had everything to captivate me&amp;nbsp;... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my ''Litanies à la Vierge noire'' for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of "peasant devotion" that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (2014), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other works that followed continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed his first major liturgical work, the [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G major for soprano and mixed choir ''[[a cappella]]'', which has become the most frequently performed of all his sacred works.&lt;ref name=sacred&gt;Thibodeau, Ralph.

In 1936 Poulenc began giving frequent recitals with Bernac. At the [[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale]] in Paris they gave the premiere of Poulenc's ''[[FP (Poulenc)#77|Cinq poèmes de Paul Éluard]]''. They continued to perform together for more than twenty years, in Paris and internationally, until Bernac's retirement in 1959. Poulenc, who composed 90&amp;nbsp;songs for his collaborator,&lt;ref name=bernac&gt;[[Alan Blyth|Blyth, Alan]].

Throughout the decade, Poulenc was popular with British audiences; he established a fruitful relationship with the BBC in London, which broadcast many of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor, pp. 69, 74, 78, 147, 226, 248, 343, 353–354, 370–371, 373, 380 and 382&lt;/ref&gt; With Bernac, he made his first tour of Britain in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (2014), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; His music was also popular in America, seen by many as "the quintessence of French wit, elegance and high spirits".&lt;ref name=ny&gt;"N.Y. Musical Tributes to Francis Poulenc", ''The Times'', 17 April 1963, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years of the 1930s, Poulenc's compositions continued to vary between serious and light-hearted works. ''[[Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence]]'' (Four Penitential Motets, 1938–39) and the song "Bleuet" (1939), an elegiac meditation on death, contrast with the song cycle ''[[Fiançailles pour rire]]'' (Light-Hearted Betrothal), which recaptures the spirit of ''Les biches'', in the opinion of Hell.&lt;ref name="Hell, pp. 60–61"&gt;Hell, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s: war and post-war===
Poulenc was briefly a soldier again during the [[Military history of France during World War II#French Army (1939–40)|Second World War]]; he was called up on 2 June 1940 and served in an anti-aircraft unit at [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; After France [[Battle of France|surrendered to Germany]], Poulenc was demobilised from the army on 18 July 1940. He spent the summer of that year with family and friends at [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]] in south-central France.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; In the early months of the war, he had composed little new music, instead re-orchestrating ''Les biches'' and reworking his 1932 [[Sextet (Poulenc)|Sextet]] for piano and winds. At Brive-la-Gaillarde he began three new works, and once back at his home in Noizay in October he started on a fourth. These were ''[[L'Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant]]'' for piano and narrator, the [[Cello Sonata (Poulenc)|Cello Sonata]], the ballet ''[[Les Animaux modèles]]'' and the song cycle ''[[Banalités (Poulenc)|Banalités]]''.&lt;ref name="Hell, pp. 60–61"/&gt;

For most of the war, Poulenc was in Paris, giving recitals with Bernac, concentrating on French songs.{{refn|Poulenc recalled later that they performed only French songs, but his recollection was inaccurate: German songs, notably those of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], were included in some programmes.&lt;ref name=fancourt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivry, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi rule]] he was in a vulnerable position, as a known homosexual (Destouches narrowly avoided arrest and deportation), but in his music he made many gestures of defiance of the Germans.&lt;ref name=fancourt&gt;Fancourt, Daisy.

In ''Les Animaux modèles'', premiered at the [[Paris Opera|Opéra]] in 1942, he included the tune, repeated several times, of the anti-German song "Vous n'aurez pas l'Alsace et la Lorraine".&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (2014), pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simeone&gt;Simeone Nigel.

The work, ending with "Liberté", could not be given in France while the Germans were in control; its first performance was broadcast from a BBC studio in London in March 1945,&lt;ref&gt;"Broadcasting Review", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 24 March 1945, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not sung in Paris until 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The music critic of ''[[The Times]]'' later wrote that the work "is among the very finest choral works of our time and in itself removes Poulenc from the category of ''petit maître'' to which ignorance has generally been content to relegate him."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Mann (critic)|Mann, William]]. "Poulenc's Choral Masterpiece", ''The Times'', 8 March 1963, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1945, commissioned by the French government, Poulenc and Bernac flew from Paris to London, where they received an enthusiastic welcome. The [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] gave a reception in the composer's honour;&lt;ref&gt;"Court Circular", ''The Times'', 5 January 1945, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; he and [[Benjamin Britten]] were the soloists in a performance of Poulenc's [[Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra (Poulenc)|Double Piano Concerto]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]];&lt;ref&gt;"Albert Hall", ''The Times'', 8 January 1945, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; with Bernac he gave recitals of French ''[[mélodie]]s'' and piano works at the [[Wigmore Hall]] and the [[National Gallery]], and recorded for the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;"National Gallery Concert", ''The Times'', 10 January 1945, p. 8; and Schmidt (2001), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Bernac was overwhelmed by the public's response; when he and Poulenc stepped out on the Wigmore Hall stage, "the audience rose and my emotion was such that instead of beginning to sing, I began to weep."&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; After their fortnight's stay, the two returned home on the first boat-train to leave London for Paris since May 1940.&lt;ref&gt;"The Paris Boat-Train", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 16 January 1945, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Poulenc completed his scores for ''L'Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant'' and his first opera, ''[[Les mamelles de Tirésias]]'' (The Breasts of [[Tiresias]]), a short [[opéra bouffe]] of about an hour's duration.&lt;ref name=sams/&gt; The work is a setting of Apollinaire's play of the same name, staged in 1917. Sams describes the opera as "high-spirited topsy-turveydom" concealing "a deeper and sadder theme&amp;nbsp;– the need to repopulate and rediscover a France ravaged by war".&lt;ref name=sams&gt;Sams, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; It was premiered in June 1947 at the [[Opéra-Comique]], and was a critical success, but did not prove popular with the public.{{refn|The piece was not produced in the US until 1953, and did not reach Britain until 1958, when Britten and Pears presented it at the [[Aldeburgh Festival]].&lt;ref name=sams/&gt; It remains by a considerable margin the least popular of Poulenc's three operas; ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'' and ''[[La voix humaine|La Voix humaine]]'' each received more than four times as many productions worldwide between 2012 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operabase.com/oplist.cgi?id=none&amp;lang=en&amp;is=&amp;by=Francis+Poulenc&amp;loc=&amp;stype=abs&amp;sd=7&amp;sm=10&amp;sy=2012&amp;etype=abs&amp;ed=&amp;em=&amp;ey= "Francis Poulenc"], Operabase, retrieved 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The leading female role was taken by [[Denise Duval]], who became the composer's favourite [[soprano]], frequent recital partner and dedicatee of some of his music.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), pp. 291 and 352&lt;/ref&gt; He called her the nightingale who made him cry (''"Mon rossignol à larmes"'').&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (1991), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pierre-Bernac-1968.jpg|alt=Image of bald late middle-aged man|thumb|[[Pierre Bernac]] (1960s photograph)]]
Shortly after the war, Poulenc had a brief affair with a woman, Fréderique ("Freddy") Lebedeff, with whom he had a daughter, Marie-Ange, in 1946. The child was brought up without knowing who her father was (Poulenc was supposedly her "godfather") but he made generous provision for her, and she was the principal beneficiary of his will.&lt;ref name="Johnson, p. 15"/&gt;

In the post-war period Poulenc crossed swords with composers of the younger generation who rejected Stravinsky's recent work and insisted that only the precepts of the [[Second Viennese School]] were valid. Poulenc defended Stravinsky and expressed incredulity that "in 1945 we are speaking as if the aesthetic of twelve tones is the only possible salvation for contemporary music".&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; His view that Berg had taken serialism as far as it could go and that Schoenberg's music was now "desert, stone soup, ersatz music, or poetic vitamins" earned him the enmity of composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]].{{refn|Despite their musical differences, Poulenc and Boulez maintained amicable personal relations: exchanges of friendly letters are recorded in Poulenc's published correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (1994), pp. 818, 950 and 1014&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Those disagreeing with Poulenc attempted to paint him as a relic of the pre-war era, frivolous and unprogressive. This led him to focus on his more serious works, and to try to persuade the French public to listen to them. In the US and Britain, with their strong choral traditions, his religious music was frequently performed, but performances in France were much rarer, so that the public and the critics were often unaware of his serious compositions.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;&lt;ref name=h74/&gt;{{refn|In 1949, thrilled by a new American recording of his 1936 Mass conducted by [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]], Poulenc exclaimed, "At last the world will know that I am a serious composer.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;|group= n}}

In 1948 Poulenc made his first visit to the US, in a two-month concert tour with Bernac.&lt;ref name=h74&gt;Hell, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; He returned there frequently until 1961, giving recitals with Bernac or Duval and as soloist in the world premiere of his [[Piano Concerto (Poulenc)|Piano Concerto]] (1949), commissioned by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===1950–63: ''The Carmelites'' and last years===
Poulenc began the 1950s with a new partner in his private life, Lucien Roubert, a travelling salesman.&lt;ref&gt;Ivry, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Professionally Poulenc was productive, writing a seven-song cycle setting poems by Éluard, ''[[FP (Poulenc)#147|La Fraîcheur et le feu]]'' (1950), and the ''[[Stabat Mater (Poulenc)|Stabat Mater]]'', in memory of the painter [[Christian Bérard]], composed in 1950 and premiered the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 97 and 100&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Poulenc was offered a commission by [[La Scala]] and the [[Milan]]ese publisher [[Casa Ricordi]] for a ballet. He considered the story of [[Margaret of Cortona|St Margaret of Cortona]] but found a dance version of her life impracticable. He preferred to write an opera on a religious theme; Ricordi suggested ''Dialogues des Carmélites'', an unfilmed screenplay by [[Georges Bernanos]]. The text, based on a short story by [[Gertrud von Le Fort]], depicts the [[Martyrs of Compiègne]], nuns guillotined during the French Revolution for their religious beliefs. Poulenc found it "such a moving and noble work",&lt;ref name=t1958&gt;"Les Dialogues de Poulenc: The Composer on his Opera", ''The Times'', 26 February 1958, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ideal for his libretto, and he began composition in August 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;

During the composition of the opera, Poulenc suffered two blows. He learned of a dispute between Bernanos's estate and the writer [[Emmet Lavery]], who held the rights to theatrical adaptations of Le Fort's novel; this caused Poulenc to stop work on his opera.&lt;ref&gt;Gendre, Claude, "The Literary Destiny of the Sixteen Carmelite Martyrs of Compiègne and the Role of Emmet Lavery", ''Renascence'', Fall 1995, pp. 37–60&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time Roubert became gravely ill.{{refn|The illness is variously reported as [[pleurisy]] and [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Intense worry pushed Poulenc into a nervous breakdown, and in November 1954 he was in a clinic at [[L'Haÿ-les-Roses]], outside Paris, heavily sedated.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; When he recovered, and the literary rights and royalty payments disputes with Lavery were settled, he resumed work on ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'' in between extensive touring with Bernac in England. As his personal wealth had declined since the 1920s he required the substantial income earned from his recitals.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on the opera, Poulenc composed little else; exceptions were two ''mélodies'', and a short orchestral movement, "Bucolique" in a collective work, ''[[Variations sur le nom de Marguerite Long]]'' (1954), to which his old friends from ''Les Six'' Auric and Milhaud also contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 97 and 104&lt;/ref&gt; As Poulenc was writing the last pages of his opera in October 1955, Roubert died at the age of forty-seven. The composer wrote to a friend, "Lucien was delivered from his martyrdom ten days ago and the final copy of ''Les Carmélites'' was completed (take note) at the very moment my dear breathed his last."&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;

The opera was first given in January 1957 at La Scala in Italian translation.&lt;ref name=sams/&gt; Between then and the French premiere Poulenc introduced one of his most popular late works, the [[Flute Sonata (Poulenc)|Flute Sonata]], which he and [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] performed in June at the Strasbourg Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Mike.

It was a tremendous success, to the composer's considerable relief.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; At around this time Poulenc began his last romantic relationship, with Louis Gautier, a former soldier; they remained partners to the end of Poulenc's life.&lt;ref&gt;Ivry p. 194 and Schmidt (2001), p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Poulenc embarked on a collaboration with his old friend Cocteau, in [[La voix humaine|an operatic version]] of the latter's 1930 [[monodrama]] ''[[The Human Voice|La Voix humaine]]''.{{refn|There was a joke in musical circles at the time that Poulenc was writing his solo opera for [[Maria Callas]], who was known for her reluctance to share the spotlight with anybody, but in fact there was never any thought that Callas, or anyone apart from Duval, should play the lead.&lt;ref name=s283&gt;Sams, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The work was produced in February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, under Cocteau's direction, with Duval as the tragic deserted woman speaking to her former lover by telephone.&lt;ref name=s283/&gt; In May Poulenc's 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter's retirement from public performance.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.poulenc.fr/en/?Biography "Biography"], Francis Poulenc: musicien français 1899–1963, retrieved 22 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Poulenc visited the US in 1960 and 1961.

== Music ==
::''See also: [[FP (Poulenc)|FP]] (Catalogue of compositions), [[List of compositions by Francis Poulenc|List of compositions]]''
Poulenc's music is essentially [[diatonic]]. In [[Henri Hell]]'s view, this is because the main feature of Poulenc's musical art is his melodic gift.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Roger Nichols (musical scholar)|Roger Nichols]] in the ''Grove'' dictionary, "For [Poulenc] the most important element of all was melody and he found his way to a vast treasury of undiscovered tunes within an area that had, according to the most up-to-date musical maps, been surveyed, worked and exhausted."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The commentator George Keck writes, "His melodies are simple, pleasing, easily remembered, and most often emotionally expressive."&lt;ref name=k18&gt;Keck, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Poulenc said that he was not inventive in his harmonic language. The composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] wrote of him, "All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity."&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;  Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language "as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing&amp;nbsp;... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with [[chromaticism]] that is rarely more than passing".&lt;ref name=k18/&gt; Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for "a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!"&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to [[dodecaphony]], led by [[René Leibowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (2014), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of [[Olivier Messiaen]], of whom he had earlier had high hopes.{{refn|In a letter to Milhaud in 1950 Poulenc, who had earlier singled out Messiaen as one of France's most promising young composers,&lt;ref&gt;Langham Smith, Richard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1002571 "More Fauré than Ferneyhough"], ''The Musical Times'', November 1992, pp. 555–557 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; privately compared Messiaen's recent compositions to "holy water out of a bidet".&lt;ref&gt;Chimènes, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is "directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice".&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up&amp;nbsp;– ''"la légende de facilité"''&amp;nbsp;– that his music came easily to him; he commented, "The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland and Chimènes, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The pianist [[Pascal Rogé]] commented in 1999 that both sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: "You must accept him as a whole. If you take away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale photocopy of what he really is."&lt;ref name=larner&gt;Larner, Gerald. "Maître with the light touch", ''The Times'', 6 January 1999, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Poulenc recognised the dichotomy,&lt;ref name=larner/&gt; but in all his works he wanted music that was "healthy, clear and robust – music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav".&lt;ref name=l162&gt;[[Paul Landormy|Landormy, Paul]]. 162&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|"Je souhaite une musique saine, claire et robuste, une musique aussi franchement française que celle de Strawinsky est slave."&lt;ref name=l162/&gt;|group= n}}

===Orchestral and concertante===
[[File:Bach-mozart-schubert-chabrier.jpg|thumb|alt=Four mugshots of old composers|Influences on Poulenc: from top left clockwise, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]]]]
Poulenc's principal works for large orchestra comprise two ballets, a ''[[Sinfonietta (Poulenc)|Sinfonietta]]'' and four keyboard concertos. The first of the ballets, ''[[Les biches]]'', was first performed in 1924 and remains one of his best-known works. Nichols writes in ''Grove'' that the clear and tuneful score has no deep, or even shallow, symbolism, a fact "accentuated by a tiny passage of mock-[[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] brass, complete with emotive [[Ninth#Minor ninth|minor 9ths]]".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The first two of the four concertos are in Poulenc's light-hearted vein. The ''[[Concert champêtre]]'' for harpsichord and orchestra (1927–28), evokes the countryside seen from a Parisian point of view: Nichols comments that the [[fanfare]]s in the last movement bring to mind the bugles in the barracks of [[Vincennes]] in the Paris suburbs.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The [[Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra (Poulenc)|Concerto for two pianos and orchestra]] (1932) is similarly a work intended purely to entertain. It draws on a variety of stylistic sources: the first movement ends in a manner reminiscent of [[Bali]]nese [[gamelan]], and the slow movement begins in a Mozartian style, which Poulenc gradually fills out with his own characteristic personal touches.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarche, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Organ Concerto (Poulenc)|Organ Concerto]] (1938) is in a much more serious vein. Poulenc said that it was "on the outskirts" of his religious music, and there are passages that draw on the church music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], though there are also interludes in breezy popular style. The second ballet score, ''[[Les Animaux modèles]]'' (1941), has never equalled the popularity of ''Les biches'', though both Auric and Honegger praised the composer's harmonic flair and resourceful orchestration.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Honegger wrote, "The influences that have worked on him, Chabrier, Satie, Stravinsky, are now completely assimilated. Listening to his music you think&amp;nbsp;– it's Poulenc."&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sinfonietta'' (1947) is a reversion to Poulenc's pre-war frivolity. He came to feel, "I dressed too young for my age&amp;nbsp;... [it] is a new version of ''Les biches'' but young girls [''biches''] that are forty-eight years old&amp;nbsp;– that's horrible!"&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; The [[Piano Concerto (Poulenc)|Concerto for piano and orchestra]] (1949) initially caused some disappointment: many felt that it was not an advance on Poulenc's pre-war music, a view he came to share. The piece has been re-evaluated in more recent years, and in 1996 the writer Claire Delamarche rated it as the composer's finest concertante work.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarche, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piano===
{{see also|List of solo piano compositions by Francis Poulenc}}
Poulenc, a highly accomplished pianist, usually composed at the piano and wrote many pieces for the instrument throughout his career. In Henri Hell's view, Poulenc's piano writing can be divided into the percussive and the gentler style reminiscent of the harpsichord. Hell considers that the finest of Poulenc's music for piano is in the accompaniments to the songs, a view shared by Poulenc himself.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of the piano works are, in the view of the writer Keith W Daniel, "what might be called 'miniatures'".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back at his piano music in the 1950s, the composer viewed it critically: "I tolerate the ''Mouvements perpétuels'', my old ''[[Piano Suite (Poulenc)|Suite en ut]]'' [in C], and the ''Trois pieces''. I like very much my two collections of Improvisations, an [[Intermezzo]] in A flat, and certain [[Nocturne]]s. I condemn ''Napoli'' and the ''[[Soirées de Nazelles]]'' without reprieve."&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the pieces cited with approval by Poulenc, the fifteen Improvisations were composed at intervals between 1932 and 1959.{{refn|At the time of Poulenc's comments there were only twelve: the first set, numbers 1–10, date from the 1920s and the second set, numbers 11 and 12, from the 1930s; numbers 13–15 were written in 1958–59.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;|group= n}} All are brief: the longest lasts a little more than three minutes. They vary from swift and balletic to tender lyricism, old-fashioned [[march (music)|march]], ''[[perpetuum mobile]]'', [[waltz (music)|waltz]] and a poignant musical portrait of the singer [[Édith Piaf]].&lt;ref name=ledin3&gt;Ledin, Marina and Victor.

Numbers one and two were composed in August 1934; the A flat followed in March 1943. The commentators Marina and Victor Ledin describe the work as "the embodiment of the word 'charming'. The music seems simply to roll off the pages, each sound following another in such an honest and natural way, with eloquence and unmistakable Frenchness."&lt;ref name=ledin&gt;Ledin, Marina and Victor. [http://marylebone.naxosmusiclibrary.com/blurbs_reviews.asp?catNum=553929&amp;filetype=About+this+Recording&amp;language=English "Francis Poulenc (1899–1963) Piano Music, Volume 1"], Naxos Music Library, retrieved 22 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The eight nocturnes were composed across nearly a decade (1929–38). Whether or not Poulenc originally conceived them as an integral set, he gave the eighth the title "To serve as Coda for the Cycle" (''Pour servir de Coda au Cycle''). Although they share their generic title with the nocturnes of [[John Field (composer)|Field]], Chopin and Fauré, Poulenc's do not resemble those of the earlier composers, being "night-scenes and sound-images of public and private events" rather than romantic [[Symphonic poem|tone poems]].&lt;ref name=ledin/&gt;

The pieces Poulenc found merely tolerable were all early works: ''Trois mouvements perpétuels'' dates from 1919, the Suite in C from 1920 and the Trois pièces from 1928. All consist of short sections, the longest being the "Hymne", the second of the three 1928 pieces, which lasts about four minutes.&lt;ref name=ledin3/&gt; Of the two works their composer singled out for censure, ''Napoli'' (1925) is a three-movement portrait of Italy, and ''Les Soirées de Nazelles'' is described by the composer [[Geoffrey Bush]] as "the French equivalent of [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[Enigma Variations]]''"&amp;nbsp;– miniature character sketches of his friends. Despite Poulenc's scorn for the work, Bush judges it ingenious and witty.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Among the piano music not mentioned, favourably or harshly, by Poulenc, the best known pieces include the two [[Trois novelettes (Poulenc)|Novelettes]] (1927–28), the set of six miniatures for children, ''Villageoises'' (1933), a piano version of the seven-movement ''Suite française'' (1935), and ''L'embarquement pour Cythère'' for two pianos (1953).&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chamber===
In ''Grove'', Nichols divides the chamber works into three clearly differentiated periods. The first four sonatas come from the early group, all written before Poulenc was twenty-two. They are for two clarinets (1918), piano duo (1918), clarinet and bassoon (1922) and horn, trumpet and trombone (1922).&lt;ref&gt;Keck, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; They are early examples of Poulenc's many and varied influences, with echoes of rococo ''divertissements'' alongside unconventional harmonies, some influenced by jazz. All four are characterised by their brevity&amp;nbsp;– less than ten minutes each&amp;nbsp;– their mischievousness and their wit, which Nichols describes as acid. Other chamber works from this period are the ''[[Rapsodie nègre]]'', [[FP (Poulenc)|FP]] 3, from 1917 (mainly instrumental, with brief vocal episodes) and the [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano]] (1926).&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

The [[chamber music|chamber works]] of Poulenc's middle period were written in the 1930s and 1940s. The best known is the Sextet for Piano and Wind (1932), in Poulenc's light-hearted vein, consisting of two lively outer movements and a central ''divertimento''; this was one of several chamber works that the composer became dissatisfied with and revised extensively some years after their first performance (in this case in 1939–40).&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The [[List of compositions by Francis Poulenc]] gives dates for the major revisions|group= n}} The sonatas in this group are for [[Violin Sonata (Poulenc)|violin and piano]] (1942–43) and for [[Cello Sonata (Poulenc)|cello and piano]] (1948). Writing for strings did not come easily to Poulenc; these sonatas were completed after two unsuccessful earlier attempts,{{refn|An early violin sonata was performed at a Huyghens concert in 1919 but it was unpublished and is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (1995), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and in 1947 he destroyed the draft of a string quartet.{{refn|Hell notes that Poulenc reused some of the themes in his 1947 Sinfonietta.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Both sonatas are predominantly grave in character; that for violin is dedicated to the memory of [[Federico García Lorca]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Commentators including Hell, Schmidt and Poulenc himself have regarded it, and to some extent the cello sonata, as less effective than those for wind.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, p. 122; Hell, p. 65; and Schmidt (2001), pp. 282–283 and 455&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Aubade'', "Concerto choréographique" for piano and 18 instruments (1930) achieves an almost orchestral effect, despite its modest number of players.{{refn|Hell lists the piece under the separate heading of "Works for Chamber Orchestra" along with the occasional work Two Marches and an Intermezzo (1937).&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The other chamber works from this period are arrangements for small ensembles of two works in Poulenc's lightest vein, the ''Suite française'' (1935) and the ''Trois mouvements perpétuels'' (1946).&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The final three sonatas are for woodwind and piano: for [[Flute Sonata (Poulenc)|flute]] (1956–57), [[Clarinet Sonata (Poulenc)|clarinet]] (1962), and [[Oboe Sonata (Poulenc)|oboe]] (1962). They have, according to ''Grove'', become fixtures in their repertoires because of "their technical expertise and of their profound beauty". The ''Elégie'' for horn and piano (1957) was composed in memory of the horn player [[Dennis Brain]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; It contains one of Poulenc's rare excursions into dodecaphony, with the brief employment of a twelve-note [[tone row]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songs===
[[File:Guillaume-Apollinaire-1918.jpg|alt=Middle-aged man in French military uniform of the First World War|thumb|upright|[[Guillaume Apollinaire]], whose poems Poulenc frequently set]]
Poulenc composed songs throughout his career, and his output in the genre is extensive.{{refn|A 2013 CD set of the complete songs occupies four full discs and plays for more than five hours in total.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 4–10&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In Johnson's view, most of the finest were written in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Though widely varied in character, the songs are dominated by Poulenc's preference for certain poets. From the outset of his career he favoured verses by Guillaume Apollinaire, and from the mid-1930s the writer whose work he set most often was Paul Éluard. Other poets whose works he frequently set included Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, and [[Louise de Vilmorin]].&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 93–97&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of the music critic Andrew Clements, the Éluard songs include many of Poulenc's greatest settings;&lt;ref name=ac&gt;Clements, Andrew. [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/poulenc-the-complete-songs-review "Poulenc: The Complete Songs&amp;nbsp;– review"], ''The Guardian'', 17 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson calls the cycle ''Tel Jour, Telle Nuit'' (1937) the composer's "watershed work", and Nichols regards it as "a masterpiece worthy to stand beside Fauré's ''[[La bonne chanson (Fauré)|La bonne chanson]]''".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Clements finds in the Éluard settings a profundity "worlds away from the brittle, facetious surfaces of Poulenc's early orchestral and instrumental music".&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; The first of the ''Deux poèmes de Louis Aragon'' (1943), titled simply "C", is described by Johnson as "a masterpiece known the world over; it is the most unusual, and perhaps the most moving, song about the ravages of war ever composed."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In an overview of the songs in 1973, the musical scholar [[Yvonne Gouverné]] said, "With Poulenc, the melodic line matches the text so well that it seems in some way to complete it, thanks to the gift which the music has for penetrating the very essence of a given poem; nobody has better crafted a phrase than Poulenc, highlighting the colour of the words."&lt;ref name=gouverne&gt;Gouverné, Yvonne. [http://www.poulenc.fr/userfiles/downloads/poulenc_yvonne_gouverne_en.pdf "Francis Poulenc"], Francis Poulenc: musicien français 1899–1963, retrieved 27 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Among the lighter pieces, one of the composer's most popular songs is a setting of ''[[Les Chemins de l'amour]]'' for [[Jean Anouilh]]'s 1940 play as a Parisian waltz;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; by contrast his "monologue" "La Dame de Monte Carlo", (1961) a depiction of an elderly woman addicted to gambling, shows the composer's painful understanding of the horrors of depression.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choral===
Apart from a single early work for unaccompanied choir ("Chanson à boire", 1922), Poulenc began writing choral music in 1936. In that year he produced three works for choir: ''Sept chansons'' (settings of verses by Éluard and others), ''Petites voix'' (for children's voices), and his religious work ''[[Litanies à la Vierge Noire]]'', for female or children's voices and organ.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; The Mass in G major (1937) for unaccompanied choir is described by Gouverné as having something of a [[baroque music|baroque]] style, with "vitality and joyful clamour on which his faith is writ large".&lt;ref name=gouverne/&gt; Poulenc's new-found religious theme continued with ''Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence'' (1938–39), but among his most important choral works is the secular cantata ''Figure humaine'' (1943). Like the Mass, it is unaccompanied, and to succeed in performance it requires singers of the highest quality.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Other ''[[a cappella]]'' works include the ''Quatre motets pour le temps de Noël'' (1952), which make severe demands on choirs' rhythmic precision and intonation.&lt;ref&gt;Vernier, David. [http://www.classicstoday.com/review/resonant-resplendent-poulenc-motets-mass-chansons/ "Resonant, Resplendent Poulenc Motets, Mass, Chansons"], Classics Today, retrieved 18 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poulenc's major works for choir and orchestra are the ''Stabat Mater'' (1950), the ''Gloria'' (1959–60), and ''[[Sept répons des ténèbres]]'' (Seven responsories for ''[[Tenebrae]]'', 1961–62). All these works are based on liturgical texts, originally set to [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt; In the ''Gloria'', Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity.&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt; Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have three good religious works. May they spare me a few days in [[Purgatory]], if I narrowly avoid going to hell."&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt; ''Sept répons des ténèbres'', which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own [[requiem]] and is "the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his ''magnum opus sacrum'', the opera, ''Dialogues des Carmélites''."&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt;

===Opera===
[[File:Tiresias.jpg|thumb|alt=Stage design, fairly abstract|Design by Sylvain Lhermitte for ''[[Les mamelles de Tirésias]]'']]
Poulenc turned to opera only in the latter half of his career. Having achieved fame by his early twenties, he was in his forties before attempting his first opera. He attributed this to the need for maturity before tackling the subjects he chose to set. In 1958 he told an interviewer, "When I was 24 I was able to write ''Les biches'' [but] it is obvious that unless a composer of 30 has the genius of a Mozart or the precociousness of Schubert he couldn't write ''The Carmelites''&amp;nbsp;– the problems are too profound."&lt;ref name=t1958/&gt; In Sams's view, all three of Poulenc's operas display a depth of feeling far distant from "the cynical stylist of the 1920s": ''[[Les mamelles de Tirésias]]'' (1947), despite the riotous plot, is full of nostalgia and a sense of loss. In the two avowedly serious operas, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'' (1957) and ''[[La voix humaine|La Voix humaine]]'' (1959), in which Poulenc depicts deep human suffering, Sams sees a reflection of the composer's own struggles with depression.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In terms of musical technique the operas show how far Poulenc had come from his naïve and insecure beginnings. Nichols comments in ''Grove'' that ''Les mamelles de Tirésias'', deploys "lyrical solos, patter duets, chorales, [[falsetto]] lines for tenor and bass babies and&amp;nbsp;... succeeds in being both funny and beautiful".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; In all three operas Poulenc drew on earlier composers, while blending their influence into music unmistakably his own. In the printed score of ''Dialogues des Carmélites'' he acknowledged his debt to [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], Debussy and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]].&lt;ref name=grovedc/&gt; The critic [[Renaud Machart]] writes that ''Dialogues des Carmélites'' is, with Britten’s ''[[Peter Grimes]]'', one of the extremely rare operas written since the Second World War to appear on opera programmes all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Renaud Machart|Machart, Renaud]].

Even when he wrote for a large orchestra, Poulenc used the full forces sparingly in his operas, often scoring for woodwinds or brass or strings alone. With the invaluable input of Bernac he showed great skill in writing for the human voice, fitting the music to the [[tessitura]] of each character.&lt;ref name=grovedc&gt;Sams, Jeremy.

===Recordings===
Poulenc was among the composers who recognised in the 1920s the important role that the [[phonograph|gramophone]] would play in the promotion of music.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The first recording of his music was made in 1928, with the [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Claire Croiza]] accompanied by the composer at the piano, in the complete song cycle ''La bestiaire'' for French [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He made numerous recordings, mainly for the French division of [[EMI Classics|EMI]]. With Bernac and Duval he recorded many of his own songs, and those of other composers including Chabrier, Debussy, [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]] and Ravel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/recital-by-pierre-bernac-baritone-and-francis-poulenc-piano/oclc/3211740&amp;referer=brief_results "A recital by Pierre Bernac and Francis Poulenc"]; and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/francis-poulenc-et-denise-duval-interpretent/oclc/18020844&amp;referer=brief_results "Francis Poulenc et Denise Duval interprètent"], both WorldCat, retrieved 22 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He played the piano part in recordings of his ''Babar the Elephant'' with [[Pierre Fresnay]] and [[Noël Coward]] as narrators.&lt;ref&gt;Hell, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, EMI issued a DVD, "Francis Poulenc &amp; Friends", featuring filmed performances of Poulenc's music, played by the composer, with Duval, [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]], [[Jacques Février]] and [[Georges Prêtre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/francis-poulenc-friends/oclc/64431808&amp;referer=brief_results "Francis Poulenc &amp; Friends"], WorldCat, retrieved 21 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the singers, in addition to Bernac and Duval, the list includes [[Régine Crespin]], [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], [[Nicolai Gedda]], [[Peter Pears]], [[Yvonne Printemps]] and [[Gérard Souzay]].

The world premiere of ''Dialogues des Carmélites'' (in Italian, as ''Dialoghi delle Carmelitane'') was recorded and has been released on CD.

==Reputation==
The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer [[Ned Rorem]] observed, "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual";&lt;ref&gt;Rorem, Ned. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/943868 "Poulenc: A Memoir"], ''Tempo'', New Series, Number 64, Spring, 1963, pp. 28–29 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness.&lt;ref name=larner/&gt; His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's ''[[Le marteau sans maître]]'' with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today."&lt;ref name=mt&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/949032 "Francis Poulenc"], ''The Musical Times'', March 1963, p. 205 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, "There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after ''[[The Rite of Spring|Sacre]] [du Printemps]''. It was not progress."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Philip, "The Gramophone Interview&amp;nbsp;– Pierre Boulez", ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', October 2010, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: "You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music".&lt;ref&gt;Poulenc (1991), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last years Poulenc observed, "if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my ''Stabat Mater'' rather than the ''Mouvements perpétuels''." In a centenary tribute in ''The Times'' Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: "both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias."&lt;ref name=larner/&gt; At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as "a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation."&lt;ref&gt;Duchen, Jessica.

{{Sex (biology) sidebar|state=collapsed}}
'''Gametogenesis''' is a [[biology|biological]] process by which [[diploid]] or [[haploid]] [[precursor cell]]s undergo [[cell division]] and differentiation to form mature haploid [[gamete]]s. Depending on the [[biological life cycle]] of the [[organism]], gametogenesis occurs by [[meiosis|meiotic]] division of diploid [[gametocyte]]s into various gametes, or by mitosis. For example, [[plants]] produce gametes through mitosis in gametophytes. The gametophytes grow from haploid spores after sporic meiosis. The existence of a multicellular, haploid phase in the life cycle between meiosis and gametogenesis is also referred to as [[alternation of generations]].

==In Animals==
[[File:Gray's 7 (ovum maturation).svg|thumb|400px|Scheme showing analogies in the process of maturation of the ovum and the developmental to make any photo in Gujarati the developments and I am not of the service of the spermatids, following their individual pathways. The oocytes and spermatocytes are both gametocytes. Ova and spermatids are complete gametes. In reality, the first polar body typically dies without dividing.]]
Animals produce gametes directly through meiosis in organs called [[gonad]]s ([[testis]] in males and [[ovaries]] in females). [[Male]]s and [[female]]s of a species that [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] have different forms of gametogenesis:

* '''[[spermatogenesis]]''' (male)
* '''[[oogenesis]]''' (female)

===Stages===
However, before turning into gametogonia, the embryonic development of gametes is the same in males and females.

====Common path====
Gametogonia are usually seen as the initial stage of gametogenesis. However, gametogonia are themselves successors of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the dorsal [[endoderm]] of the [[yolk sac]] migrate along the hindgut to the [[gonadal ridge]]. They multiply by [[mitosis]], and, once they have reached the gonadal ridge in the late embryonic stage, are referred to as gametogonia.  Once the germ cells have developed into gametogonia, they are no longer the same between males and females.

====Individual path====
From gametogonia, male and female gametes develop differently - males by spermatogenesis and females by oogenesis. However, by convention, the following pattern is common for both:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Cell type''' || '''[[ploidy]]/[[chromosomes]] in humans''' || '''DNA copy number/[[chromatids]] in human'''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Sources are mixed when using this system of numbering. Some sources use the chromatid number when writing "n" rather than the ploidy number. Hence gametogonium and primary gametocyte would be "4n" rather than "2n" with "4c" for copies.  The system used below has been determined by wikipedia consensus and should not necessarily be used as the definitive source on the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; || '''Process''' 
 |- 
 | [[gametogonium]] || diploid (2N)/46 || 2C before replication, 4C after / 46 before, 46 X 2 after|| [[gametocytogenesis (disambiguation)|gametocytogenesis]] (mitosis)
 |- 
 | primary gametocyte || diploid (2N)/46 || 2C before replication, 4C after / 46 before, 46 X 2 after || [[gametidogenesis]] ([[meiosis]] I)
 |- 
 | secondary gametocyte || haploid (N)/23 || 2C / 46|| gametidogenesis (meiosis II)
 |- 
 | [[gametid]] || haploid (N)/23  || C / 23|| 
 |- 
 | gamete || haploid (N)/23 || C / 23|| 
|}

===In vitro gametogenesis===
In vitro gametogenesis (IVG) is the technique of developing [[in vitro generated gametes]], i.e., "the generation of eggs and sperm from pluripotent stem cells in a culture dish."&lt;ref name="ivg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Glenn |last2=Daley |first2=George Q. |last3=Adashi | first3=Eli Y. |date=January 11, 2017 |title=Disruptive reproductive technologies |url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/372/eaag2959.full |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=9 |issue=372 |pages= |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.aag2959 |access-date=January 16, 2017 | quote=In vitro gametogenesis (IVG)—the generation of eggs and sperm from pluripotent stem cells in a culture dish. Currently feasible in mice, IVG is poised for future success in humans and promises new possibilities for the fields of reproductive and regenerative medicine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique is currently feasible in mice and will likely have future success in humans and nonhuman primates.&lt;ref name="ivg"/&gt;

==In gametangia==
Fungi, algae, and primitive plants form specialized haploid structures called [[gametangium|gametangia]], where gametes are produced through mitosis. In some fungi, such as the [[Zygomycota]], the gametangia are single cells, situated on the ends of [[hypha]]e, which act as gametes by fusing into a [[zygote]]. More typically, gametangia are multicellular structures that differentiate into male and female organs:

* '''[[antheridium]]''' (male)
* '''[[archegonium]]''' (female)

==In flowering plants==
In angiosperms, the male gametes (always two) are produced inside the pollen tube (in 70% of the species) or inside the [[pollen|pollen grain]] (in 30% of the species) through the division of a generative cell into two sperm nuclei. Depending on the species, this can occur while the pollen forms in the [[anther]] (pollen tricellular) or after [[pollination]] and growth of the [[pollen tube]] (pollen bicellular in the anther and in the stigma). The female gamete is produced inside the [[embryo sac]] of the [[ovule]].

==Meiosis==

[[Origin and function of meiosis|Meiosis]] is a central feature of gametogenesis, but the adaptive function of meiosis is currently a matter of debate.  A key event during meiosis is the pairing of [[homologous chromosomes]] and [[homologous recombination|recombination]] (exchange of genetic information) between homologous chromosomes.  This process promotes the production of increased genetic diversity among progeny and the recombinational repair of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|damage]] in the DNA to be passed on to progeny.  To explain the adaptive function of meiosis (as well as of gametogenesis and the sexual cycle), some authors emphasize diversity,&lt;ref name="pmid20576791"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harrison CJ, Alvey E, Henderson IR |title=Meiosis in flowering plants and other green organisms |journal=J. Exp. Bot. |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=2863–75 |year=2010 |pmid=20576791 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erq191 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others emphasize [[DNA repair]]. &lt;ref name="pmid27605505"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mirzaghaderi G, Hörandl E |title=The evolution of meiotic sex and its alternatives |journal=Proc.

'''George Elmore Danielson''' (February 20, 1915 – September 12, 1998) was an [[United States|American]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician and judge from [[California]]. He served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1971 to 1982.

==Biography==
Born in [[Wausa, Nebraska]], Danielson attended [[Wayne State College|Wayne State Teachers College]] before earning his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] in 1937 and 1939, respectively. He was a special agent with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] from 1939 to 1944 and served in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] from 1944 to 1946. He was an [[Assistant United States Attorney]] from 1949 to 1951 and thereafter entered private practice.&lt;ref name="bioguide"&gt;{{CongBio|D000043|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/17/news/mn-23801|title=George Danielson; Appeals Court Judge, Legislator|last=Folkart|first=Burt A.|date=1998-09-17|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danielson was twice elected to the [[California State Assembly]], serving from 1963 to 1967, and to the [[California State Senate]], serving from 1967 to 1971. In 1970, he was elected to his first of six terms to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served on the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] during the [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment proceedings]] against President [[Richard Nixon]] and voted in favor of three of the articles. Danielson resigned from Congress on March 9, 1982 after being appointed an associate justice on the [[California Court of Appeal]] in the Second District, Division Three by Governor [[Jerry Brown]].&lt;ref name="bioguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/DanielsonG.pdf George E.

'''George Weber''' (March 23, 1961&lt;ref name=nypost/&gt; – March 20, 2009) was an American radio personality on the [[ABC Radio Network]] doing hourly news updates. For several years he was on the [[WABC (AM)|WABC 77]] morning show, with [[Curtis Sliwa]] and [[Ron Kuby]] in New York City. He did periodic news updates throughout the morning, as well as joining in conversation with the hosts about those news stories. He was found stabbed to death in his home on March 20, 2009, at the age of 47.

==Career==
Born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Weber began his radio career at WBUX (AM) in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]]. He then went on to [[WAEB (AM)|WAEB]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], where he worked for two and a half years as a reporter and news anchor. After contacting [[Phil Boyce]], then news director at Denver station [[KIMN]], he received an offer to be a street reporter and anchor with that station. Two and a half years later (after KIMN's demise) Weber went to crosstown rival [[KOA (AM)|KOA]], where he began a new career as the host of a night-time talk show. Some other important stops on his way to a full-time job with WABC were [[KGO (AM)|KGO]], [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]], [[KEIB|KTLK]], and [[KMPC]].&lt;ref name=official &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeweber.net|title=George Weber - the news guy|publisher=www.georgeweber.net|accessdate=2009-04-16|last=George|first=Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a former [[tobacco]] user, he has been featured in radio advertisements for ''KickTheHabitNow.com''.

Weber was fired by WABC at the same time as [[John R. Gambling]] in February 2008. Financial problems at ABC, coupled with the fact that ABC's new morning show ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' had its own newsman, [[Charles McCord]], led to his dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/02/29/2008-02-29_wabc_fires_john_gambling_brings_in_sliwa.html|title=WABC Fires John Gambling|publisher=''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]''|first=David|last=Hinckley|date=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, Weber obtained a new assignment doing news updates for the [[ABC Radio Network]].

{{Quotation|Hey it's George Weber, the news guy. For more than a decade, I've been on the airwaves in New York city radio, most of that time at 77 WABC. Currently, I'm a radio anchor at ABC NEWS. I started in broadcasting at the tender young age of 16 at tiny WBUX in Doylestown, Pennyslvania.{{sic}} For the next 25 years, I hopscotched the country working at great radio stations like KIMN, KOA and KTLK in Denver, KMPC and KABC in Los Angeles, KGO in San Francisco and KOGO in San Diego. Depending on the day and the year, I was either doing talk radio or news. I love them both.|George Weber|Personal Blog&lt;ref name=plog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgeweberthenewsguy.blogspot.com|title=George Weber....The news guy|publisher=George Weber|accessdate=2009-04-16|date=2008-03-01|last=Weber|first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==
A number of Weber's stories and investigations were based around experiences in his private life. He often reported about his neighborhood in New York and his two dogs featured in some of his stories. The last story on his website was published on the same day he died, March 20, 2009, and described an outbreak of bed bugs around his [[Carroll Gardens]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=window &gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.net/dist/custom/gci/InsidePage.aspx?cId=thejournalnews&amp;sParam=30436109.story|publisher=The Associated Press State &amp; Local Wire|date=2009-03-27|title=Slain newsman's blog a window into Brooklyn life|author=Richard Pyle|quote=Subjects often came from the day's news or other postings on the Internet.

As one who earned his living speaking proper English, Weber was offended by messages on [[Craigslist]] and other Web sites written in youth [[argot]] he called "ghetto speak". Among examples he cited said on Feb. 1, the "most outlandish" was "a little ditty from a gay kid trying to find another guy to have sex with."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''Extract from letter to dog Noodles after death of his other dog Romer:''&lt;br&gt;
Don't bite me, Noodles, if I hug you a little more these days or if I squeeze you too tight. That's how humans show how much we love each other and comfort each other in times of grief. And someday when you get old and frail, like Romer, I promise I will be by your side in the autumn of your life. You won't be as playful or agile but you will be wiser in your elder years. You'll be able to reflect on all the things you learned, all the friends you made and most of all, little buddy, you will continue to be my best friend well after you take your last nap. I Love You.

==Murder==
On Friday, March 20, 2009, George Weber was killed in his Brooklyn apartment on Henry Street. A co-worker became concerned when he didn't show up for work on Saturday, so police were dispatched to Weber's apartment on Sunday at 12:30am, but they noticed nothing amiss, and left. When the co-worker called again at 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., cops returned to the building, where a neighbor said he heard water running in the newsman's apartment all night.&lt;ref name="nydnGendar "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/03/23/2009-03-23_george_webers_killer_left_blood_at_wabc_.html|title=George Weber's killer left blood at WABC newsman's home, police say|last=Gendar|first=Alison|author2=Jonathan Lemire|date=March 24, 2009|work=NY Daily News|accessdate=2009-08-31|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police entered the apartment and discovered Weber's body, with his hands and feet bound.

[[File:granvilleelliott miniature.jpg|thumbnail|&lt;center&gt;'''Granville Elliott'''&lt;br&gt;(1713-1759)&lt;br/&gt;''with permission from''&lt;br&gt;The Eliot Archives&lt;/center&gt;]]

Major-General '''Granville Elliott''', 1st [[Count Elliott]] (7 October 1713 &amp;ndash; 10 October 1759), was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] military officer who served with distinction in several other European armies and subsequently in the [[British Army]]. He fought at the [[Battle of Minden]] where he was wounded, dying of his injuries several weeks later.

==Early life==
Elliott was born at Byfeld House, Church Road, [[Municipal Borough of Barnes|Barnes]], [[Surrey]] to [[Major-General]] [[Roger Elliott]] (c. 1665 &amp;ndash; 15 May 1714) and his wife Charlotte (née Elliot, c. 1692 - c. 1753). A member of the [[Eliot family (South England)|Eliot family]], he was baptised on 27 October 1713 at [[St Mary the Virgin's Church, Barnes]]. His godparents were [[George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne]] and Mrs Killigrew.

When Elliott was less than one year old, his father died and he was brought up by his mother and her new husband, Captain Thomas Burroughs. Later that decade, he was made a ward of his mother's younger brother Colonel [[William Elliot of Wells|William Elliot]] (c. 1704 &amp;ndash; 1764). In 1725, Elliott was admitted to Dr Dunster's Academy in Little Marlborough Street, [[London]], and in 1730 he matriculated as a Law Student at the [[University of Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]].

==Continental European military career==

By 1732, Elliott was in the service of the HM [[Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine|Karl Philipp von Pfalz-Neuburg]], [[Elector Palatine]] of the Rhine. On 7 March 1735, ahead of his marriage on 15 March 1735 at [[Mannheim]] to [[Jeanne Thérèse du Han]], Comtesse de Martigny and lady of honour to the Empress of Germany (30 October 1707 – 7 May 1748), he was created a [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] to his Majesty [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] and raised to the title of [[Count|Comte de]] [[Morhange]] in the Moselle region, later being made an [[Imperial Count]].&lt;ref name="Royal Naval Biography"&gt;Marshall, John, ''Royal Naval Biography'', Volume 3, Part 2, Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, London, 1832&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate the marriage, Elliott converted to Catholicism, and took the forename Joseph, which caused him problems with his mother's Calvinist relatives. In August 1736, he and his mother swore oaths at the [[College of Arms]] in London that the Elliott family descended from a legal marriage of [[Richard Eliot]] (b. 1614 - unknown), the wayward second son of Sir [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]] (1592–1632) to [[Catherine Killigrew]] (1617–1689), daughter of Sir [[Robert Killigrew]] (1580–1633) and Mary Woodhouse (CIR 1584 - 1655). However, the two oaths differed in some details, and no independent evidence for any marriage of Richard has ever come to light. Moreover, Catherine Killigrew was still described as spinster in 1655 when she executed her mother's will. As a result, Elliott was not recognised by the College of Arms as a legitimate relative of the then [[Lord Eliot]] of [[Port Eliot]] in [[Cornwall]], ancestors of the present [[Earl of St Germans|Earls of St Germans]]. Nevertheless, Granville Elliott had a pedigree drawn up (which survives today) and formally presented to him in Paris by the British Ambassador / Plenipotentiary. As a result of this device, Elliott became known at the Elector's Court as Comte Eliot de Port-Eliot, and [[Graf]] Eliot von Port-Eliot.

On 29 October 1736, Elliott was promoted to the rank of Colonel, taking over the colonelcy of the Carabinier Regiment on 1 February 1737, and the Dragoons Regiment on 10 July 1738. In 1737, Elliott was appointed Cavalry General of the [[States General of the Netherlands]], the legislature of the [[Dutch Republic]]. A few years later, he was working at [[Lunéville]], at the court of the exiled King [[Stanisław Leszczyński|Stanislaus I of Poland]] who had become Duke of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] and [[Barrois|Bar]]. On 22 April 1745, he was promoted to Major-General of Cavalry for the Elector Palatine; on 24 June 1746, to Lieutenant-General of Cavalry, and, on 2 November 1748, to Lieutenant-General of Cavalry for the States General of the Netherlands.

Elliott and his wife appeared regularly in the [[Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny|Madame de Graffigny]] correspondence, usually under his baptised name Joseph or his familiar name Cotoco. His wife died on 7 May 1748, and this caused a substantial change of direction for Elliott. He left his grown-up family with their French relatives, returned to the UK, forsook his Catholicism and repaired the bridges with his mother's relatives. It appears that Elliott did not subsequently contact his French family, although there was no known ill-will between them.

==British military career==
{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}
Back in the UK, he remarried, on 3 September 1750, to Elizabeth Duckett (25 June 1724 - October 1804) at [[St. Mary Magdalen Old Fish Street]], London. However, he soon returned to the service of the States General of the Netherlands, and was appointed Major-General of the Scotch Brigade. The first child of his second marriage was born in the Netherlands although later children would be born at their home in [[Kew]].

[[File:Evangelische Kirche (Rodheim-Bieber) (028).jpg|thumb|To commemorate Granville Elliott in the Church of Rodheim (Germany)]]
On 21 April 1758, Elliott was made Major-General in the British Army,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Beatson]], ''A political index to the histories of Great Britain and Ireland'' (1788) [https://books.google.com/books?id=njYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA382 vol. 1, p. 382].&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed Colonel of the [[61st Regiment of Foot]] - ''The Glorious Glosters''. That summer, he was a Staff Officer on [[Raid on St Malo|the army expedition]] to [[Saint-Malo|St Malo]], and, from 5 July 1758 to 31 August 1758, he received a short-term commission as Colonel and Lieutenant-General in the Dutch Army. The [[Seven Years' War]] had arrived, and Elliott's knowledge of continental warfare was significant. In early 1759, he returned to continental Europe, as part of a massive British army deployment. At the [[Battle of Minden]], on 1 August 1759, he commanded the Cavalry Regiment under [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby]]. Manners was himself second in command to [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Sir George Sackville]], who was later cashiered for his inaction at the battle. Despite this chain of command, Elliott saw significant action in battle, and was seriously wounded. He retired to convalesce at army headquarters in [[Rodheim an der Bieber]], [[Gießen (district)|Gießen]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], but died there 9 weeks later on 10 October 1759 from the wounds incurred. He was buried with [[military funeral|military honours]] in the local 13th century church at [[Krofdorf-Gleiberg|Krofdorf]] on 12 October; [[Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]] attended the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Scots Magazine]]'', vol. 21, October 1759, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aeARAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA558 p. 558].&lt;/ref&gt; A brass commemorative plaque was erected during the 20th century by his British descendants in the church.

Light Cavalry was introduced into the British Army as a direct result of advice from General Granville Elliott.

==Family==
'''Granville Elliott''' married twice.

Firstly, on 15 March 1735 at [[Mannheim]], to '''[[Jeanne Thérèse du Han]], Comtesse de Martigny''' (30 October 1707 – 7 May 1748), by whom he had at least six sons and a daughter.&lt;br&gt;
#'''Marie Charlotte Elliott''' (23 May 1736 - 3 February 1785)&lt;br&gt;
#'''Stanislaus François Xavier Elliott''' (6 July 1737 - after 1752)&lt;br&gt;
#'''Amable Gaspard Antoine Elliott''' (4 September 1738 - 14 June 1814), 2nd [[Count Elliott]]&lt;br&gt;
#'''Charles Phillippe Elliott''' (1 December 1740 - unknown)&lt;br&gt;
#'''Paul Antoine Elliott''' (12 June 1741 - 25 July 1741)&lt;br&gt;
#'''François Maximillian Elliott''' (12 June 1741 - unknown)&lt;br&gt;
#'''Jean-Baptiste-François Elliott''' (25 June 1747 - unknown)&lt;br&gt;

Secondly, on 3 September 1750 at [[St. Mary Magdalen Old Fish Street]], to '''Elizabeth Duckett''' (25 June 1724 - October 1804), by whom he had at least three sons and three daughters. Elizabeth was a niece of Sir [[George Duckett (Calne MP)|George Duckett]]. Of the children of his second marriage, '''[[Francis Perceval Eliot]]''' and his descendants continued the family's close connection with British armed forces. Francis also re-established contact with his French half-siblings.

Upon Elliotts death in 1759 his titles passed to his oldest living son Amable Gaspard Antoine Elliott. Amble chose his half-brother [[Francis Perceval Eliot]] to succeed him as [[Count Elliott|Count Eliot]].&lt;ref name="Royal Naval Biography" /&gt; Francis thought this was not proper and died without assuming the title.

'''HNLMS ''K XVI''''' was one of five {{Sclass-|K XIV|submarine}}s built for the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] (RNN). Entering service in 1934, the submarine was deployed to the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. On 24 December 1941, ''K XVI'' torpedoed and sank the {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Sagiri||2|up=yes}}; the first [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] submarine to sink a Japanese warship. A day later, the Dutch submarine was torpedoed by the [[Japanese submarine I-166|Japanese submarine ''I-66'']] (later renumbered to be I-166) off Borneo, with all aboard killed. The wreck of ''K XVI'' was rediscovered in October 2011 by a group of [[recreational diver]]s.

==Construction==
''K XVI'' was ordered from Rotterdam-based shipbuilder [[Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij]] on 30 May 1929, and was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 31 May 1930.&lt;ref name=DutchSubs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchsubmarines.com/boats/boat_kxvi.htm |title=The submarine K XVI |work=DutchSubmarines.com |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine was [[Ship launching|launched]] on 8 April 1933, and commissioned into the RNN on 31 January 1934.&lt;ref name=DutchSubs/&gt;

==Operational history==
In January 1935, the boat was deployed to the [[Netherlands East Indies]].&lt;ref name=DutchSubs/&gt; She remained in this area after the start of World War II.&lt;ref name=DutchSubs/&gt;

On 24 December 1941, approximately {{convert|35|nmi|km}} off Kuching, the submarine torpedoed and sank the {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Sagiri||2|up=yes}}.&lt;ref name=OzAFP&gt;Agence France-Presse, ''Missing Dutch WWII sub found off Borneo''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DAlbas&gt;D'Albas, ''Death of a Navy'', {{page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Brown, ''Warship Losses of World War II'', {{page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer's aft [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] caught fire and exploded, sinking the ship with 121 of the 241 personnel aboard killed.&lt;ref name=DAlbas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Later that evening, the submarine attempted to attack the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Murakumo|1928|2}}, but was fended off by [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref name=DutchSubs/&gt;

''K XVI'' was torpedoed by the {{ship|Japanese submarine|I-166||2|up=yes}} a day later, and sank with all 36 aboard.&lt;ref name=DutchSubs/&gt;&lt;ref name=OzAFP/&gt; The boat was one of seven Dutch submarines lost during World War II.&lt;ref name=OzAFP/&gt;

On 25 October 2011, the Dutch [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]] announced that the wreck of ''K XVI'' had been found by Australian and Singaporean [[recreational diver]]s off the northern coast of Borneo.&lt;ref name=OzAFP/&gt;

'''Hamsterz Life''' is a [[hamster]] simulation video game released by [[Ubisoft]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. ''Hamsterz Life'' is also known as ''Love ♥ Hamster'' or ''Love Love Hamster'' in Japan.

==Gameplay==
''Hamsterz Life'' is from the [[Petz]] series from Ubisoft for the handheld systems. Being released after ''Petz 5'', it is part of the second Petz series. ''Hamsterz Life'' lets you raise several breeds of [[hamsters]] and build fully customizable homes for them to live in. Just as in the other Petz games, players can interact with their hamsters by training, playing with, and feeding them.

At the start of the game, players can select their first hamster and name it. The hamster will then appear in a cage and be ready to play. Various actions can be chosen including training, feeding, care and other options. Training consists of teaching the hamster words (which they repeat back in their own hamster speak) by speaking the set phrases into the DS microphone. The hamster can repeat these phrases back, but inaudibly. Players can clean the cage and brush their hamsters. Hamsterz Life also includes many mini-games to play. Players can only have one hamster at home at once, any other hamsters that are owned are left with a girl with hamster ears until you wish to switch. Your hamsters can visit with the hamsters of friends who also own Hamsterz Life. When playing mini-games, if you win you receive prizes such as food or toys. You can also let your hamster out of its cage to play in the surrounding room. There are present boxes in the room, which contain prizes you receive when your hamster finds them.

==Cages==

Hamsterz Life contains a variety of different cages used for housing a pet hamster. They include Standard, Steel, Toy Box, Pastel, Plant and Wood. Each cage has its own theme song. Toys can be put into the cage for the hamsters to play with. The roller coaster, the slide and the tube cannot be placed into the Standard and Steel cages, for they are too small to fit large items. 
The standard cage is the cage you will start out with when you start the game. As you play mini-games, you may win cages.

==Different Types of Hamsters==

Different types of hamsters are shown in the game as you choose your pet hamster. There is Djungarian, Golden, Campbell, Cutie, Baby and Panda hamsters. Each will start out as a pup and eventually grow into an adult. You can play mini-games to win toys for your hamsters and teach them how to say basic phrases such as "hello" and "good-bye".

==Hammy==

Hammy is a hamster girl seen in the game. She appears as a girl with brown hair and hamster ears. She is also seen wearing an apron with a yellow dress underneath. She explains how to do things throughout the game such as how to play mini-games, taking care of your hamster. She is also there to help pick out a hamster. When switching for a visiting hamster, Hammy takes them and takes care of them until you come back to swap your current hamster for another that you already have.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17905">'''Henry'''{{efn|German ''Heinrich''; in the Latin of the ''Annals of Fulda'' his name is spelled ''Heimrih, Heimrich, Heimricus'' or ''Heimrichus'', in the ''Annals of Saint Vaast'', it is ''Heinricus''.}} (died 28 August 886) was the leading military commander of the last years of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. He was commander-in-chief under Kings [[Louis the Younger]] and [[Charles the Fat]]. His early career was mostly restricted to [[East Francia]], his homeland, but after Charles inherited [[West Francia]] in 884 he was increasingly active there. During his time, raids by the [[Vikings]] (mainly [[Danes]]) peaked in Francia. The sources describe at least eight separate campaigns waged by Henry against the Vikings, most of them successful.

Henry is described in the sources as a [[Saxons|Saxon]], [[Franks|Frank]] or [[Thuringian]]. His title is given variously as [[count]] (Latin ''comes''), [[margrave]] (''marchensis'') or [[duke]] (''dux''). The territory he governed is described variously in the sources as [[Francia]], [[Neustria]] or [[Austrasia]], perhaps indicating that his military command covered most of the north of the empire from the [[Breton March]] in the west to [[Frisia]] and [[Saxony]] in the east.

==Family==
Henry's family has been called the Popponids (German ''Popponen'') because the name Poppo was particularly common among them.&lt;ref name=Jackman9&gt;[[Donald C. Jackman]], ''Ius Hereditarium Encountered III: Ezzo's Chess Match'' (Editions Enlaplage, 2008), pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that he was a son of Count [[Poppo of Grapfeld]],&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Chisholm (ed.), [[:wikisource:1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Babenberg|"Babenberg"]], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed. (Cambridge University Press, 1911), vol. III, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps of Poppo's son, Christian I of Grapfeld, and his wife, Heilwig.&lt;ref name=Jackman20&gt;Jackman, ''Ius Hereditarium'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother was [[Poppo, Duke of Thuringia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Reuter]] (ed.), ''The Annals of Fulda'', Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II (Manchester University Press, 1992), p. 55, n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Popponids were probably related to the [[Hattonids]], and Henry may have "inherited" his positions in Saxony (from [[Banzleib]]) and in Austrasia (from Banzleib's brother Adalbert).&lt;ref name=Jackman20/&gt;

Henry's wife was probably Ingeltrude, daughter Duke [[Eberhard of Friuli]] and [[Gisela, daughter of Louis the Pious|Gisela]], a daughter of Emperor [[Louis the Pious]]. If this is true, Henry would have been related through his wife to the Carolingian ruling house. A memorial book of the [[abbey of Reichenau]] names a Henry (''Heimirich'') and an Ingeltrude (''Engildrud'') side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Jackman, ''Ius Hereditarium'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry had three sons, all of whom died during the so-called [[Babenberg feud]] with the rival [[Conradines|Conradine family]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard S. Bachrach]] and David S. Bachrach (eds.); Widukind of Corvey, ''Deeds of the Saxons'' (Catholic University of America Press, 2014), p. 32, n. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Riché&gt;Pierre Riché, ''The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993). pp. 228–29.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Adalbert of Babenberg|Adalbert]] (c. 854 – 9 September 906), captured and executed
* [[Adalhard of Babenberg|Adalhard]] (died 903), captured and executed
* Henry (died 902), killed in battle

[[Widukind of Corvey]] calls Adalbert a "close relative through his sister" of King [[Henry I of Germany]], which led Emil Kimpen to conclude that Henry I's mother, [[Hathui]] (Hedwig, Hadewig), was Adalbert's sister and Duke Henry's daughter. This suggestion has been widely accepted, not least because it explains the adoption of the name Henry by Henry I's family, the [[Liudolfings]].&lt;ref name=Jackman9/&gt; In this case, it is through Duke Henry that the name ultimately entered the East Frankish (German) and West Frankish (French) royal families, the [[Ottonians]] and [[Capetians]]. Hathui married Duke [[Otto I, Duke of Saxony|Otto of Saxony]]. Their son, Henry I, had a daughter, [[Hedwig of Saxony|Hedwig]], named after her grandmother, who married [[Hugh the Great]] and became the mother of [[Henry I, Duke of Burgundy]], and great-grandmother of King [[Henry I of France]].&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Riché/&gt;

The [[House of Babenberg]], which governed the [[March of Austria]] from 976 until 1246, is generally regarded as descending from the Popponids, possibly through an unnamed daughter of Henry. The names of the children—[[Henry I, Margrave of Austria|Henry]], [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest]], [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo]], [[Adalbert, Margrave of Austria|Adalbert]] and Leopold—of the first known Babenberger, Margrave [[Leopold I, Margrave of Austria|Leopold I]], are strongly suggestive of a link with Henry.&lt;ref&gt;See Jackman, ''Ius Hereditarium'', p. 34, for a hypothetical family tree.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Henry is described by [[Abbo Cernuus]] in his ''Bella Parisiacae urbis'' as a [[Saxons|Saxon]]. It is more likely he was a [[Thuringian]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon MacLean, ''Kingship and Politics in the Late Ninth Century: Charles the Fat and the end of the Carolingian Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 61 and n. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reign of Louis the Younger===
Henry is described by the ''[[Annals of Fulda]]'' as the "leader of the army" (''princeps militiae'') of Louis the Younger when the latter rebelled against his father, King [[Louis the German]], in 866. Louis was joined in his revolt by his younger brother, Charles the Fat. The brothers may have been upset by the grant of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] to their older brother, [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], as a sub-kingdom in 864. During the short revolt, Louis sent Henry on a mission to Duke [[Rastislav of Moravia]]. The rebellion was soon patched up, however, and Louis received [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] as a sub-kingdom, while Charles got [[Duchy of Alemannia|Alemannia]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, ''Annals of Fulda'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 871, a Saxon vassal of Henry's was blinded on the orders of Louis the German, which prompted Louis the Younger and Charles to temporarily cut off relations with their father in solidarity with Henry.&lt;ref name=Reuter65&gt;Reuter, ''Annals of Fulda'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacLean214&gt;MacLean, ''Kingship and Politics'', p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of Henry's reaction to this incident.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Reuter, ''Germany in the Early Middle Ages, c. 800–1056'' (Routledge, 2013), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Louis the German took advantage of his sons' insubordination to remove Henry from power in Saxony and replace him with Duke [[Bruno, Duke of Saxony|Bruno]] (brother of the aforementioned Otto, who probably married Henry's daughter).&lt;ref name=Jackman23&gt;Jackman, ''Ius Hereditarium'', pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 876, Louis the German died and his sons became kings in full in their respective sub-kingdoms. Henry remained in the service of Louis the Younger. In 880, he was sent with Count [[Adalhard of Metz]] to make war on Count [[Theobald of Arles]], the chief commander of the army of [[Hugh, Duke of Alsace|Hugh of Lotharingia]], Louis's second cousin who had been excluded from the succession. According to the ''Annals of Fulda'', Henry won a "bloody victory". The victorious army then joined the rest of Louis the Younger's forces and marched on [[Mâcon]], which they took from the rebel leader [[Boso of Provence|Boso]], who had made himself king in [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy and Provence]] in opposition to the Carolingians.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, ''Annals of Fulda'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reign of Charles the Fat===
Louis the Younger died in January 882 and was succeeded by Charles the Fat, who thus reunited the East Frankish kingdom of Louis the German. Under Charles, Henry's career is a succession of battles with Viking raiders. Charles almost immediately sent Henry with an army to [[Siege of Asselt|besiege Asselt]], where an army of Vikings was encamped. According to the ''Annals of Fulda'', Henry and Charles's nephew [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]] led the advance guard, with Henry in charge of the [[Franks|Frankish]] contingent and Arnulf leading the [[Bavarians|Bavarian]] troops.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, ''Kingship and Politics'', p. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles arrived with the main force in May 882.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, ''Kingship and Politics'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received oaths from the Viking leaders, the siege of Asselt was considered a success and the Frankish army withdrew. After his Christmas court in 882, the king sent Henry against some Vikings who had raided [[Deventer]]. According to the ''Annals of Fulda'', Henry "settled matters as well as he could, and returned."&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, ''Annals of Fulda'', p. 106 and n. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 883, Henry marched against the Vikings again, inflicting severe losses on them. According to the ''Annals of Fulda'', "it is said that not one escaped". Henry, however, was wounded in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, ''Annals of Fulda'', p. 107 and n. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 884, Henry won two more victories over the Vikings, slaughtering them "wherever they wanted to go to plunder", according to the annalist of Fulda. Some Vikings who had been harrying West Francia then overwintered in the [[Hesbaye]] in 884–85. In early 885, Henry and Archbishop [[Liutbert (archbishop of Mainz)|Liutbert of Mainz]] surprised them in their camp. The survivors fled by night, leaving their plunder behind.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, ''Kingship and Politics'', p. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry and Liutbert are the most prominent men (after the Carolingian kings) in the latter part of the Mainz recension of the ''Annals of Fulda''. This is probably because its author was a partisan of Louis the Younger, as Henry and Liutbert had been Louis's chief advisors.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, ''Annals of Fulda'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 885, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid]], one of the Viking leaders at Asselt who had sworn oaths to Charles, taken baptism and received [[Frisia]], was accused of plotting with the king's cousin Hugh to seize [[Lotharingia]]. Henry tricked him into a meeting and killed him with his followers.&lt;ref name=MacLean214/&gt;&lt;ref name=Riché/&gt; According to the ''[[Annals of Saint-Vaast]]'', one of Godfrid's followers, [[Gerolf of Holland|Gerolf]], defected and plotted Godfrid's downfall with Henry.&lt;ref name=AV&gt;Bernhard von Simson (ed.), ''Annales Xantenses et Annales Vedastini'', [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]], Scriptores rerum Germanicarum in usum scholarum separatim editi (Hanover, 1909), s.a. 885.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry then captured Hugh at [[Gondreville, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Gondreville]] and handed him over to the emperor, who had him blinded and imprisoned in the [[monastery of Saint Gall]].&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, ''Kingship and Politics'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 885, a large Viking force [[Siege of Paris (885–86)|laid siege to Paris]]. The defence of the city fell to Bishop [[Joscelin (bishop of Paris)|Joscelin]] and Count [[Odo of France|Odo]]. According to the ''Annals of Saint-Vaast'', after the Vikings destroyed one of Paris's towers, Joscelin sent Count Herkenger of Melun to East Francia with specific instructions to ask Henry to come with an army.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;

As a result, in 886 Henry led the first army to relieve the siege. it was in the field from 9 February until 1 May, but its only actions were skirmishes with Vikings who occasionally strayed too far from their fortifications. By July, Charles himself was leading a huge army towards Paris. Henry was again sent off with an advance guard while the emperor was still at [[Metz]]. It was during this expedition that Henry's horse fell into a trap near [[Quierzy-sur-Oise|Quierzy]] and he was cut off from his men and killed on 28 August. The same basic account of Henry's death is found in the ''Annals of Saint-Vaast'', the chronicle of [[Regino of Prüm]] and the ''Annals of Fulda''.&lt;ref name=Reuter100&gt;Reuter, ''Annals of Fulda'', pp. 100–01 and nn. 1 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death, burial and epitaph==
The deaths of Hugh and Henry in August placed Count Odo in a preeminent position in West Francia. While writers looking back tended to see him as succeeding his brother, [[Robert the Strong]], directly, he did not in fact do so. Rather, the sudden deaths of the Hugh and Henry followed by that of the Emperor Charles less than two years later left a vacuum in the West that Odo was able to take advantage of to have himself elected king in 888.&lt;ref name=MacLean66/&gt;

The ''Annals of Fulda'' appear assign blame for Henry's death when recording that he was "abandoned by his men".&lt;ref name=Reuter100/&gt; Regino records that Henry was buried in the [[Abbey of Saint-Médard de Soissons]]. An eight-[[distich]] epitaph for Henry was added by an eleventh-century hand to a copy of Regino's chronicle. A marginal note{{efn|''cuius epitaphium in fine huius libri invenies ad hoc signum'' [[Chi Rho|⳩]]: "whose epitaph you will find at the end of the book beside this sign ⳩".}} beside Regino's account of Henry's death directs the reader to the epitaph, which appears at the end of the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Schleidgen, ''Die Überlieferungsgeschichte der Chronik des Regino von Prüm'' (Selbstverlag der Gesellschaft für Mittelrheinische Kirchengeschichte, 1977), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|

==Titles==
By 871, according to the ''Annals of Fulda'', Henry was a [[count]] (Latin ''comes''), a title the annalist prefers him until the end of his life, even after he had attained higher rank. By contrast, Regino of Prüm, usually calls Henry a [[duke]] (''dux''), a title implying military command and the control of territory much larger than a county.&lt;ref name=Reuter65/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacLean214/&gt; Under the year 885, the ''Annals of Saint Vaast'' call Henry the Duke of the Austrasians (''dux Austrasiorum'').&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;

The ''Annals of Fulda'' describe Henry in 886 as "the margrave of the Franks, who held Neustria at that time" (''marchensis Francorum, qui in id tempus Niustriam tenuit'').&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, ''Annals of Fulda'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted as "a generalised military responsibility which included Neustria".&lt;ref name=MacLean66&gt;MacLean, ''Kingship and Politics'', p. 66 and n. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Ferdinand Werner]] goes further, saying that "in all the Frankish kingdoms properly so-called," that is, in Austrasia, Neustria and [[Franconia]],{{efn|The ethnically Frankish lands east of the Rhine.}} "Charles gave all powers to his commander-in-chief Henry."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;[[Karl Ferdinand Werner]], "Les Robertiens", in M. Parisse and X. Barral i Altet (eds.), ''Le Roi de France et son royaume autour de l'an mil'' (Paris: 1992), pp. 15–26, at 20–21: "dans tous les royaumes proprement francs, Charles avait donné tous les pouvoirs à son général en chef Henri".&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Donald Jackman]] sees Henry's final command as restricted to Neustria proper, where he succeeded [[Hugh the Abbot]] after the latter's death on 12 May 886.&lt;ref name=Jackman23/&gt; According to Henry's epitaph, he was "triarch" (''triarchos'') of the Saxons, Franks and Frisians, which may mean that he ruled over them simultaneously or in succession. Rule over Frisia may have indicated in fact a march in western Saxony bordering Frisia.&lt;ref name=Jackman20/&gt; Jackman favours three successive marcher commands for Duke Henry, while Matthias Becher suggests that ''triarchos'' is just a corruption of ''trimarchio'' (three-times margrave) under the influence of ''demarchus'' (people-ruler) and indicates that Henry acquired multiple marches simultaneously. There is no question that Henry in the reign of Charles the Fat was second only to the king in power.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Becher, ''Rex, Dux und Gens: Untersuchungen zur Entstehung des sächischen Herzogtums im 9. und 10. Jahrhundert'' (Matthiesen Verlag, 1996), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Humanin diagram for wikipedia.png|thumb|The humanin gene is found within the 16S rRNA gene (MT-RNR2) in the mitochondrial genome]]
'''Humanin''' is a peptide encoded in the mitochondrial genome by the [[16S ribosomal RNA]] gene, [[MT-RNR2]]. Its structure contains a three-turn [[Alpha helix|α-helix]], and no symmetry.

In ''in vitro'' and animal models, it appears to have cytoprotective effects.

==Interactions==
Extracellular interaction with a tripartite receptor composed of [[gp130]], [[WSX1]], and [[CNTFR]], as well as interaction with the [[formyl peptide receptor 2]] (formylpeptide-like-1 receptor) have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashimoto|first=Y|author2=Kurita, M |author3=Aiso, S |author4=Nishimoto, I |author5= Matsuoka, M |title=Humanin inhibits neuronal cell death by interacting with a cytokine receptor complex or complexes involving CNTF receptor alpha/WSX-1/gp130|journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell|date=Jun 2009|volume=20|issue=12|pages=2864–73|pmid=19386761|doi=10.1091/mbc.E09-02-0168|pmc=2695794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ying|first=G|author2=Iribarren, P |author3=Zhou, Y |author4=Gong, W |author5=Zhang, N |author6=Yu, ZX |author7=Le, Y |author8=Cui, Y |author9= Wang, JM  |title=Humanin, a newly identified neuroprotective factor, uses the G protein-coupled formylpeptide receptor-like-1 as a functional receptor|journal=Journal of Immunology|date=Jun 1, 2004|volume=172|issue=11|pages=7078–85|pmid=15153530 |doi=10.4049/jimmunol.172.11.7078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Humanin was independently found by three different labs looking at different parameters.  The first to publish, in 2001, was the Nishimoto lab, which found humanin while looking for possible proteins that could protect cells from [[amyloid beta]], a major component of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="Hashimoto2001" /&gt;  The Reed lab found humanin when screening for proteins that could interact with [[Bcl-2-associated X protein]] (Bax), a major protein involved in [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Guo2003" /&gt;  The [[Pinchas Cohen]] lab independently discovered humanin when screening for proteins that interact with [[IGFBP3]].&lt;ref name="Ikonen2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ikonen|first=M|author2=Liu, B |author3=Hashimoto, Y |author4=Ma, L |author5=Lee, KW |author6=Niikura, T |author7=Nishimoto, I |author8= Cohen, P |title=Interaction between the Alzheimer's survival peptide humanin and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 regulates cell survival and apoptosis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Oct 28, 2003|volume=100|issue=22|pages=13042–7|pmid=14561895|doi=10.1073/pnas.2135111100|pmc=240741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Experiments using cultured cells have demonstrated that humanin has both neuroprotective as well as cytoprotective effects and experiments in rodents have found that it has protective effects in Alzheimer's disease models, Huntington's disease models and stroke models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yen|first=K|author2=Lee, C |author3=Mehta, H |author4= Cohen, P |title=The emerging role of the mitochondrial-derived peptide humanin in stress resistance|journal=Journal of molecular endocrinology|date=Feb 2013|volume=50|issue=1|pages=R11–9|pmid=23239898|doi=10.1530/JME-12-0203|pmc=3705736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John George Phillips''' (11 April 1887 – 15 April 1912) was a British [[telegraphist]] and senior [[wireless telegraphy|wireless]] officer aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} who died during its ill-fated maiden voyage in April 1912. As the ship was sinking, Phillips worked tirelessly to send messages to other ships to enlist their assistance with the rescue of ''Titanic''{{'}}s passengers and crew. Before the ship hit the iceberg, Phillips told [[Cyril Furmstone Evans|Cyril Evans]], the radio operator of {{SS|Californian||2}}, "Keep out; Shut up! I am working [[Cape Race]]!", when interrupted on-air by his counterpart warning him that  ''Titanic'' was in the vicinity of an ice field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marconigraph.com/titanic/faqs/faqs2.html FAQs, page 2] {{better source|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Phillips was born on 11 April 1887 in [[Farncombe]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name="Farncombe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/themes/places/surrey/waverley/godalming/phillips/3-2/|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=Godalming Museum|publisher=Exploring Surrey's Past|date=2013|title=John George (Jack) Phillips, (1887 – 1912)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of George Alfred Phillips, a [[draper]] and Ann (née Sanders), Phillip's family originally came from [[Trowbridge]], [[Wiltshire]], from a lineage of [[Weaving|weavers]], but moved to Farncombe around 1883.&lt;ref name="Farncombe"/&gt; Phillips lived with his five siblings, of whom only two twin sisters survived to adulthood, above a draper's shop – Gammons – which his father managed in Farncombe Street.&lt;ref name="Farncombe"/&gt; Educated at a private school on Hare Lane, then St John Street's School, Phillips sang as a choirboy at St John the Evangelist – Farncombe's church.&lt;ref name="Farncombe"/&gt;

He finished school in 1902 and began working at the Godalming post office, where he learned [[telegraphy]]. He started training to work in [[wireless]] for the [[Marconi Company]] in March 1906, in [[Seaforth, Merseyside|Seaforth]], and graduated five months later in August. Phillips's first assignment was on the [[White Star Line]] ship ''[[SS Teutonic|Teutonic]]''. He later worked on board [[Cunard Line|Cunard]]'s {{RMS|Campania||2}}; the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers|Allan Line]]'s ''Corsican'', ''Pretorian'' and {{RMS|Victorian||2}}; and then Cunard's {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}. In May 1908, he was assigned to the Marconi station outside [[Clifden]], Ireland, where he worked until 1911, when he was assigned to the {{RMS|Adriatic||2}} and later, in early 1912, to the {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|2}}.

===RMS ''Titanic''===
In March 1912, Phillips was sent to [[Belfast]], Ireland, to be the senior wireless operator on board the ''Titanic'' for her maiden voyage. He was joined by junior wireless operator [[Harold Sydney Bride|Harold Bride]].&lt;ref name="Harold Bride"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wireless Man of Titanic Describes Wreck of Vessel|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1912-04-19/ed-1/seq-5/#date1=1836&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Belfast+Titanic&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=Titanic+Belfast&amp;y=12&amp;x=16&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|accessdate=18 May 2015|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=April 19, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories have appeared that Phillips knew Bride before ''Titanic'', but Bride insisted they had never met before Belfast.&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/john-george-phillips.html "Mr. John George Phillips"] (2014) ''[[Encyclopedia Titanica]]'' (ref: #2051, accessed 1 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Titanic'' sailed for [[New York City]], United States, from [[Southampton]], England, on 10 April 1912, and during the voyage Phillips and Bride transmitted passengers' personal messages and received [[iceberg]] warnings and other navigational information from other ships. Phillips celebrated his 25th birthday the day after the voyage began.

On the evening of 14 April, in the wireless room on the boat [[Deck (ship)|deck]], Phillips was sending messages to [[Cape Race]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], working to clear a backlog of passengers' personal messages that had accumulated when the wireless had broken down the day before.&lt;ref name="Harold Bride" /&gt; Bride was asleep in the adjoining cabin, intending to relieve Phillips at midnight, two hours early. Shortly after 9:30 pm, Phillips received an ice warning from the [[steamship]] ''Mesaba'' reporting a large number of icebergs and an ice field directly in ''Titanic''{{'}}s path. Phillips acknowledged  ''Mesaba''{{'}}s warning and continued to transmit messages to Cape Race. '' Mesaba''{{'}}s wireless operator waited for Phillips to report that he had given the report to the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], but Phillips continued working Cape Race. The message was one of the most important warnings ''Titanic'' received, but it was never delivered to the bridge.

Second Officer (Second Mate) [[Charles Lightoller]] reports in Chapter 31 of his autobiography: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Phillips explained when I (Lightoller) said that I did not recollect any Mesaba report: "I just put the message under a paper weight at my elbow, just until I squared up what I was doing before sending it to the Bridge." That delay proved fatal and was the main contributory cause to the loss of that magnificent ship and hundreds of lives. Had I as Officer of the Watch, or the Captain, become aware of the peril lying so close ahead and not instantly slowed down or stopped, we should have been guilty of culpable and criminal negligence.&lt;ref name="Lightoller(1935)ch:31"&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Herbert Lightoller (1935) in Chapter 31|title=Southampton|work=Titanic and Other Ships|publisher=London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301011h.html#ch27|format=eBook|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At 10:55 pm, Phillips was again interrupted by another ship, this time the {{SS|Californian}}. ''Californian''{{'}}s only wireless operator, [[Cyril Evans (Wireless Operator)|Cyril Evans]], was reporting that they were stopped and surrounded by ice. ''Californian''{{'}}s relative proximity (and the fact that both Evans and Phillips were using [[Spark-gap transmitter|spark gap wireless sets]] whose signals bled across the spectrum and were impossible to tune out) meant that Evans's signal was strong and loud in Phillips's ears, while the signals from Cape Race were faint to Phillips and inaudible to Evans. Phillips quickly sent back, "Keep out; shut up, I'm working: Cape Race", and continued communicating with Cape Race, while Evans listened a while longer before going to bed for the night.

It can be argued that this communication had important consequences:  Firstly, Evans was giving a warning of ice, which, if heeded, could have prevented ''Titanic''{{'}}s sinking.  Secondly, ''Californian'' was the closest ship to ''Titanic''. As the radio had been switched off by Evans, Phillips had no way of communicating with ''Californian'' should ''Titanic'' require immediate assistance, which she very soon did.  However, others{{who|date=March 2016}} point out that several ice warnings had already been received and communicated to the captain, so he was aware that there was ice in the area, and a lookout had been posted.

Furthermore, Evans did not request that the message be delivered to the bridge, and the crew of ''Californian'' did see the rockets from  ''Titanic'' at 12:47 AM and woke their captain, who chose to ignore the rockets and returned to bed.

''Titanic'' struck an iceberg at 11:40 PM that night and began sinking. Bride had woken up and begun getting ready to relieve Phillips, when [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Edward Smith]] came into the wireless room and told Phillips to prepare to send out a [[distress signal]]. Shortly after midnight, Captain Smith came in again and told them to send out the call for assistance and gave them ''Titanic''{{'}}s estimated position. Phillips began sending out the distress signal, code [[CQD]], while Bride took messages to Captain Smith about which ships were coming to ''Titanic''{{'}}s assistance. At one point, Bride jokingly reminded Phillips that the new call was [[SOS]] and said, "Send S.O.S., it's the new call, and it may be your last chance to send it."&lt;ref name="Harold Bride"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1912"&gt;{{cite news|author=Harold Bride, Surviving Wireless Operator of the Titanic|title=THRILLING STORY BY TITANIC'S SURVIVING WIRELESS MAN; Bride Tells How He and Phillips Worked and How He Finished a Stoker Who Tried to Steal Phillips's Life Belt – Ship Sank to Tune of "Autumn"|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E0DF153CE633A2575AC1A9629C946396D6CF|accessdate=10 July 2010 | date=19 April 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A myth developed after the disaster that this was the first time SOS was used, but it had been used on other ships previously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/history/titanic/sos.asp Snopes.com: Titanic First Ship to Use an SOS?]&lt;/ref&gt;)

After taking a quick break, Phillips returned to the wireless room and reported to Bride: the [[bow (ship)|forward]] part of the ship was flooded, and they should put on more clothes and [[Personal flotation device|lifebelts]]. Bride began to get ready, while Phillips went back to work on the wireless machine.

The wireless power was almost completely out shortly after 2:00 am, when Captain Smith arrived and told the men they had done their duty and were relieved. Bride later remembered being moved by the way Phillips continued working. While their backs were turned, a crew member (either a stoker or trimmer) snuck in and attempted to steal Phillips's lifebelt. Bride saw and grabbed the man as Phillips stood up and knocked the crew member out. The water was beginning to flood the wireless room as they both ran out of the wireless room, leaving the unconscious crewman where he fell. The men then split up, Bride heading forward and Phillips heading [[stern|aft]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1912"/&gt; This was the last time Bride saw Phillips.&lt;ref name="nytimes1912"/&gt;

[[File:BoatBbyMB.gif|thumb|Many researchers have expressed the belief that Phillips died aboard [[RMS Titanic Lifeboat Collapsible B|Collapsible B]], despite evidence to the contrary.]]
For many years, there has been conflicting and contradictory information regarding the exact manner in which Phillips met his death. Many researchers have expressed the belief that Phillips managed to make it to the overturned [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic#Collapsible Boat B (port)|lifeboat B]], which was in the charge of Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]], along with [[Harold Bride]].

In Lightoller's autobiography, ''Titanic and Other Ships'', he writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Phillips, the senior wireless operator, standing near me, told me the different ships that had answered our call ..."
&lt;p&gt;
"... As it turned out, the information from Phillips, and the calculation, were about right, though poor old Phillips did not live to benefit by it. He hung on till daylight came in and we sighted one of the lifeboats in the distance ..."
&lt;p&gt;
"... I think it must have been the final and terrible anxiety that tipped the beam with Phillips, for he suddenly slipped down, sitting in the water, and though we held his head up, he never recovered. I insisted on taking him into the lifeboat with us, hoping there still might be life, but it was too late."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Herbert Lightoller (1935) in Chapter 35|title=The Rescue|work=Titanic and Other Ships|publisher=London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301011h.html#ch35|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bride reporting seeing Phillips's body as he boarded the ''Carpathia''.&lt;ref name="nytimes1912"/&gt;

However, Lightoller's and Bride's claims about Jack Phillips are contradicted elsewhere by [[Archibald Gracie IV|Archibald Gracie]], who made it clear that the wireless operator who cheered up the occupants of the upturned collapsible by calling out the names of approaching ships was Harold Bride, not Jack Phillips (as Lightoller thought in 1934.) It is also clear from the accounts of Gracie and Lightoller that only one body was transferred from the collapsible onto boat #12. Bride stated that he knew the body of "the man lying aft" was transferred to #12—which was undoubtedly the body of the crewman mentioned by Gracie and which Lightoller (in 1912) agreed was the body of a crewman. Bride's assumption that the body of Phillips (which he never saw) was also taken on board the Carpathia was just that - an assumption (since he obviously did not see Phillips's body lying abandoned in #12 after the boat was emptied of living passengers.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wormstedt.com/GeorgeBehe/Page13.htm|title=The Fate of Jack Phillips -George Behe's " Titanic " Tidbits''|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are memorials to Jack Phillips in Nightingale cemetery, Farncombe and in the Phillips Memorial Cloister, part of the Phillips Memorial Ground, which lies to the north of [[Church of St. Peter &amp; St. Paul, Godalming]].

To mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking, the [[BBC World Service]] broadcast, on 10 April 2012, a radio documentary in the "Discovery" series, entitled ''Titanic – In Her Own Words''. The programme was conceived and created by Susanne Weber and was narrated by Sean Coughlan, who had previously written a book on the ''Titanic'' radio messages.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, J. A. and Coughlan, S., (1993) ''"Titanic": Signals of Disaster'', White Star Publications, {{ISBN|0-9518190-1-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9518190-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme used [[voice synthesis]] to re-create "... the strange, twitter-like, mechanical brevity of the original [[Morse code]] messages ... " transmitted by ''Titanic'' and neighbouring ships. Messages often included the fashionable slang expressions of the time, such as "old man". The BBC noted that "these messages were recorded at the time in copper-plate handwriting, now scattered across the world in different collections, but together forming a unique archive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00q89fy |work=Discovery|title=Titanic – In Her Own Words|publisher= BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Robert Laxer''' (22 December 1941&amp;nbsp;– 23 February 2018), also known as '''Jim Laxer''', was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[political economist]], historian, [[public intellectual]], and political [[activism|activist]] who served as a professor at [[York University]].{{sfnm |1a1=Evans |1y=1991 |1p=306 |2a1=MacDonald |2a2=Gastmann |2y=2001 |2pp=292ff}}&lt;ref name="neren"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nerenberg |first=Karl |author-link=Karl Nerenberg |date=26 February 2018 |title=James Laxer and the Movement He Helped Create |url=http://rabble.ca/news/2018/02/james-laxer-and-movement-he-helped-create |work=Rabble.ca |access-date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Best known as co-founder of [[the Waffle]], on whose behalf he ran for the [[New Democratic Party leadership election, 1971|leadership of the New Democratic Party in 1971]], he is the author of more than two dozen books, mostly on Canadian political economy and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TPL Eh List: James Laxer |url=https://site.houseofanansi.com/event/tpl-eh-list-james-laxer/ |location=Toronto |publisher=House of Anansi Press |access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Laxer was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], on 22 December 1941{{sfn|Laxer|2004|pp=7, 52}} and was the son of Edna May (née Quentin) and [[Robert Laxer]], a psychologist, professor, author, and political [[activism|activist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fulford |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Fulford (journalist) |date=11 September 2004 |title=A Rare Glimpse at Canadian Stalinism |url=http://www.robertfulford.com/2004-09-11-laxer.html |newspaper=National Post |location=Toronto |access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Jewish]] and his mother was from a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] family. Both were members of the [[Communist Party of Canada]] and its public face, the [[Labor-Progressive Party]], with Robert Laxer being a national organizer for the party. The Laxers left the party, along with many other members, following [[Khrushchev's Secret Speech]] revealing [[Joseph Stalin]]'s crimes, and the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary]]. James Laxer wrote about his experiences growing up during this period in his memoir ''Red Diaper Baby: A Boyhood in the Age of McCarthyism''.{{sfn|Doughty|2005}} His father came to serve as a significant influence on his political worldview.{{sfn|Bullen|1983|p=192}}

His paternal grandfather was a [[rabbi]] and his maternal grandfather was a minister and [[Christian mission]]ary to [[China]], where Laxer's mother was born.{{sfn|Laxer|2004|p=54}} His brother, Gordon Laxer, would become a [[political economist]], author, and founder of the [[Parkland Institute]].&lt;ref name=starobit&gt;{{cite news |last=Rizza |first=Alanna |date=25 February 2018 |title=James Laxer, One-Time NDP Leadership Candidate, Dead at 76 |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/02/25/james-laxer-one-time-ndp-leadership-candidate-dead-at-76.html |work=Toronto Star |access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gordon Laxer |url=http://www.parklandinstitute.ca/gordonlaxer |location=Edmonton |publisher=Parkland Institute |access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Master of Arts]] (following approval of his thesis ''French-Canadian Newspapers and Imperial Defence, 1899–1914'' in 1967) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees from [[Queen's University]].{{sfn|Laxer|1967}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jim Laxer |url=http://people.laps.yorku.ca/people.nsf/researcherprofile?readform&amp;shortname=jlaxer |location=Toronto |publisher=York University |access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active student journalist both at ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'' at the University of Toronto and later at the ''[[The Queen's Journal|Queen's Journal]]''&lt;!--"The" wasn't part of the periodical's title during that period. --&gt; and was elected president of [[Canadian University Press]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 January 1965 |title=Laxer Chosen CUP National President |url=https://archive.org/details/queensjournal92pt2 |newspaper=Queen's Journal |volume=92 |issue=23 |location=Kingston, Ontario |publisher=Alma Mater Society |access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1969, Laxer, along with his father Robert Laxer, [[Mel Watkins]], and others, founded [[the Waffle]],{{sfn|Fleming|2010|p=182}} a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] group influenced by the [[New Left]], the anti–[[Vietnam War]] movement, and Canadian [[economic nationalism]], that tried to influence the direction of the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP).{{sfnm |1a1=Azzi |1y=2012 |1p=223 |2a1=Pitsula |2y=2008 |2pp=39–40 |3a1=Watkins |3y=2015}} Laxer was a principal author of their [[Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada]] in 1969 alongside [[Ed Broadbent]] and [[Gerald Caplan]].{{sfn|McAllister|1984|p=108}} The manifesto was debated at the 1969 federal NDP convention and was rejected by the delegates in favour of a more moderate declaration.{{sfn|Pitsula|2008|p=40}}

In 1971, Laxer ran for the [[New Democratic Party leadership election, 1971|leadership]] of the federal NDP and shocked the convention by winning one-third of the vote on the fourth and final ballot against party stalwart [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt;{{sfnm |1a1=Erickson |1a2=Laycock |1y=2015 |1p=16 |2a1=Isitt |2y=2011 |2p=187}} The Waffle was ultimately forced out of the NDP and briefly became a political party under the name Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada.&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt;{{sfn|Bullen|1983|p=212}} Laxer and other Wafflers unsuccessfully ran for [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] in 1974.{{sfn|Laxer|1996|p=162}} This electoral failure led to the Waffle's demise,&lt;ref name="Watkins"&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Mel |author-link=Mel Watkins |date=27 February 2018 |title=Reflections on Jim Laxer |url=http://www.rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/rabblecas-staff-blog/2018/02/mel-watkins-reflections-jim-laxer |work=Rabble.ca |access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Laxer concentrated on his work at [[York University]], where he was a professor of [[political science]] for 47 years,&lt;ref name="globeobit"/&gt; and in broadcasting.

In 1981, he was hired as director of research for the federal NDP, but left in controversy in 1983 when he published a report critiquing the party's economic policy as being "out of date".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hansard.gov.yk.ca/25-legislature/003_March15_1984.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laxer |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Laxer |date=26 February 2018 |title=Remembering James Laxer, Canadian Iconoclast |url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/rabblecas-staff-blog/2018/02/remembering-james-laxer-canadian-iconoclast |website=Rabble.ca |access-date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic, writer, and broadcaster==
Laxer hosted ''The Real Story'', a nightly half-hour current affairs program on [[TVOntario]] in the early 1980s. He also variously wrote a column and [[op-ed]] pieces for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' from the 1980s until shortly before his death, as well as op-ed pieces for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Laxer |first=James |date=9 September 2014 |title=Scottish Referendum: World's First Vote on Economic Inequality |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/scottish-referendum-the-worlds-first-vote-on-economic-inequality/article20489038/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played "Talleyrand", a mock political insider, on [[CBC Radio]]'s ''[[Morningside (radio program)|Morningside]]'' in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://archivesfa.library.yorku.ca/filelist/2003-009.166.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Laxer co-wrote and presented the five-part [[National Film Board]] documentary series ''Reckoning: The Political Economy of Canada'' in 1986, which examined Canada's economic and political relationships with the United States&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt;{{sfn|Evans|1991|p=306}} and Canada's place in the changing global economy.&lt;ref name=york/&gt; Laxer and his co-writer won a [[Gemini Award]] in 1988 for Best Writing in an Information/Documentary  Program or Series for episode one of ''Reckoning'' titled "In Bed with an Elephant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 1989 |title=Gemini Awards: The Winners |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/download/4267/4301&amp;ved=2ahUKEwioucv8hcjZAhVB4WMKHa7FAAUQFjARegQIABAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2_beB7nAEf42GoNr6nFT4g |work=Cinema Canada |access-date=28 February 2018}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Laxer|url=http://www.news.yorku.ca/experts/?name_or_keyword=Laxer&amp;research_area=&amp;submit=Search+the+Guide&amp;search=Y|website=York University Experts Guide |location=Toronto |publisher=York University |access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] refused to air the series due to its critical view of [[free trade]] with the United States, which was being negotiated at the time, and it aired instead on [[TVOntario]] and other educational channels in Canada as well as a number of [[PBS]] stations in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Evans|1991|p=306}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hays |first=Matthew |author-link=Matthew Hays |date=12 March 2009 |title=To NFB or Not to NFB |url=https://thewalrus.ca/2009-03-film/ |magazine=The Walrus |location=Toronto |access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[democratic socialist]],&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt; Laxer believed that Canadian economic nationalism was a progressive force against the United States and [[American imperialism]].{{sfn|Burgess|2002|p=239}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=26 February 2018 |title=Remembering Jim Laxer |url=http://ndpsocialists.ca/remembering-jim-laxer/ |publisher=NDP Socialist Caucus |access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote extensively about the influence of American [[multinational corporation]]s in the Canadian economy, particularly in the oil and gas industry, and his agitation helped lead to the creation of [[Petro-Canada]].&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite web |year=2013 |orig-year=2002 |title=Inventory of the James Laxer Fonds |url=http://archivesfa.library.yorku.ca/fonds/ON00370-f0000166.htm |work=Clara Thomas Archives |location=Toronto |publisher=York University |access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[Foreign Investment Review Agency]], and the [[Canadian Development Corporation]] in the 1970s is also attributed in part to the work of Laxer, Watkins, and the Waffle.{{sfn|Smart|2009|p=316}} In the 1980s he strongly opposed the adoption of the [[Canada–US Free Trade Agreement]],{{sfn|Warnock|1988|p=320}} though he still believed that [[free trade agreement]]s were capable of being used to the advantage of the political left through the entrenchment of social charters.{{sfn|Mandel|1992|p=224}}

Laxer died suddenly and unexpectedly in [[Paris]] of heart-related problems on 23 February 2018 while in Europe researching a book on Canada's role in the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="globeobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laxer |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Laxer |date=23 February 2018 |title=In Memoriam: James Laxer, 1941–2018 |url=http://theleftchapter.blogspot.ca/2018/02/in-memoriam-james-laxer-1941-2018.html |website=The Left Chapter |access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Ikazuchi'''''|雷|"Thunder"}} &lt;ref&gt;Nelson. ''Japanese-English Character Dictionary''. Page 943&lt;/ref&gt; was the twenty-third {{sclass-|Fubuki|destroyer}}, or the third {{sclass-|Akatsuki|destroyer (1931)|4}} (if that sub-class is regarded as a separate class), built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in the inter-war period. When introduced into service, these ships were the most powerful destroyers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Globalsecurity.org| first = | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/fubuki-dd.htm| title = IJN Fubuki class destroyers| work = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained formidable weapons systems well into the [[Pacific War]].

''Ikazuchi'', built at the [[Uraga Dock Company]], was the third of the “Type III” improved series of ''Fubuki'' destroyers, incorporating a modified [[gun turret]] which could elevate her main battery of [[Type 3 127 mm 50 caliber naval gun]]s to 75° as opposed to the original 40°, thus permitting the guns to be used as [[dual purpose gun]]s against aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;F Fitzsimons, ''Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare'' (London: Phoebus, 1977), Volume 10, p.1040.&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ikazuchi'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 7 March 1930, [[Ship launching|launched]] on 22 October 1931 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 August 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0424.htm | title= Akatsuki class 1st class destroyers| last= Nishidah | first=  Hiroshi| year= 2002 | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction of the advanced ''Akatsuki''-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimons, ''Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare'' p.1040&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Akatsuki'' class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated {{nihongo|''Special Type destroyers''|特型|Tokugata}}. The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many [[light cruiser]]s in other navies.  The ''Akatsuki'' sub-class was an improved version of the ''Fubuki'', externally almost identical, but incorporating changes to her propulsion system.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie &amp; Evans, ''Kaigun'' page 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
On completion, ''Ikazuchi'' was assigned to Destroyer Division 6 along with her [[sister ship]]s, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Inazuma|1932|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hibiki|1932|2}}, and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Akatsuki|1932|2}}, under the [[IJN 1st Fleet]] and participated in operations in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

===World War II===
At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Ikazuchi'' was assigned to Destroyer Division 6 of Desron 1 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and had deployed from [[Mako Guard District]] to provide cover for landing operations in the [[Battle of Hong Kong|Invasion of Hong Kong]]. After assisting the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Isuzu||2}} in sinking [[Royal Navy|British]] [[gunboat]]s HMS ''Cicada'' and HMS ''Robin'', she helped secure [[Hong Kong Harbor]]. After the start of 1942, ''Ikazuchi'' deployed from Hong Kong to [[Davao City|Davao]], providing cover for landing operations during the [[Battle of Ambon]], and [[Battle of Timor]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/ikazuc_t.htm IJN Ikazuchi: Tabular Record of Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 1942, ''Ikazuchi'', along with ''Inazuma'', rescued 442 survivors from the [[Royal Navy]] destroyer {{HMS|Encounter|H10|6}} and [[United States Navy]] destroyer {{USS|Pope|DD-225|6}}. These ships had been sunk the previous day in the [[Second Battle of the Java Sea]], along with the cruiser {{HMS|Exeter|68|6}}, in the [[Java Sea]] between [[Java]] and [[Borneo]], off [[Surabaya]]. The survivors had been adrift for some 20 hours, in rafts and lifejackets or clinging to floats, many coated in oil and unable to see. Among the rescued was Sir [[Sam Falle]], later a [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat.&lt;ref name="BBC 2003"&gt;{{Cite web | author = BBC News | authorlink = British Broadcasting Corporation| title = Reunion for sailor saved by enemy | date = 2003-06-13  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/somerset/2986762.stm |accessdate = 2008-06-29 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This humanitarian decision by Lieutenant Commander [[Shunsaku Kudō]] placed ''Ikazuchi'' at risk of submarine attack, and interfered with her fighting ability due to the sheer numbers of rescued sailors. The action was later the subject of a book&lt;ref name="Megumi 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Megumi | first = Ryuunosuke | author-link = :ja:惠隆之介  | title = 敵兵を救助せよ!—英国兵422名を救助した駆逐艦「雷」工藤艦長  | place = Tokyo, Japan  | publisher = Soshisha Publishing Company   | date = 2006-07-05  | url = http://www.soshisha.com/book_search/detail/1_1499.html  | isbn = 978-4-7942-1499-7 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forum.axishistory.com 2007"&gt;{{Cite web

''Ikazuchi'' deployed from [[Ōminato Guard District]] in support of Admiral [[Boshiro Hosogaya]]’s Northern Force in the [[Aleutians campaign]], patrolling waters around [[Kiska]] and [[Attu Island|Attu]] during June and July, and towing the damaged destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kasumi|1937|2}} from Kiska back to Shimushu in the [[Chishima Islands]]. She continued to be assigned to northern patrols in the Chishima islands and [[Aleutian islands]] through the beginning of August.&lt;ref&gt;Morison. ''Aleutians, Gilberts and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From September, ''Ikazuchi'' was reassigned as escort for the new aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuihō||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Unyō||2}}, which the destroyer accompanied to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], and missions in the [[Solomon Islands]] and back to [[Kure Naval District]].

From October, ''Ikazuchi'' was used for numerous “[[Tokyo Express]]" high speed transport runs throughout the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref&gt;D’Albas. ''Death of a Navy: Japanese Naval Action in World War II''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 1942 ''Ikazuchi'', {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Akatsuki|1932|2}}, and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Shiratsuyu|1935|2}} conducted a daylight raid into the waters off [[Guadalcanal]]. In the resulting action, the fast [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{USS|Zane|DMS-14|6}} was damaged and fleet tug {{USS|Seminole|AT-65|6}} and patrol craft ''YP-284'' were sunk before the Japanese ships were driven off by [[USMC|US Marine]] [[coastal artillery]]. ''Ikazuchi'' suffered light damage from strafing attacks by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft, with four crewmen killed.

''Ikazuchi'' participated in the first night action of the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on 13 November 1942. Stationed on the right flank of the [[battleship]]s {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}} with two other destroyers, she engaged several U.S. warships, among them the cruiser {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|6}}, and received hits to her forward gun mount, which caught fire. In the battle, 21 crewmen were killed and 20 injured, and she had to return to Truk for emergency repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Hammel. ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After repairs at [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] from December to the end of February 1943, ''Ikazuchi'' returned to the north Pacific, and was present at the [[Battle of the Komandorski Islands]] on 26 March but saw no action. On 30 March, she collided with the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Wakaba|1934|2}}, suffering moderate damage.

''Ikazuchi'' was reassigned to Desron 11 of the IJN 1st Fleet on 1 April 1943. After repairs at Yokosuka, she returned to Truk, and escorted convoys between Truk and the Japanese home islands until mid-April 1944.

Under the command of Lieutenant Commander Ikunaga Kunio, on 13 April 1944, while escorting the transport ''Sanyō Maru'' to [[Woleai]], ''Ikazuchi'' was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine {{USS|Harder|SS-257|6}}, approximately {{convert|200|mi|km}} south-southeast of [[Guam]] at position {{coord|10|13|N|143|51|E|type:landmark_region:XZ|display=inline,title}}. There were no survivors.

On 10 June 1944, ''Ikazuchi'' was removed from the [[navy list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0424.htm| title=  Akatsuki class destroyers | last= Nishidah | first=  Hiroshi | year= 2002 | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerry Aroe Thomas ''' (born May 22, 1953) is a family practice [[physician]] in [[Franklinton, Louisiana|Franklinton]], [[Louisiana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthgrades.com/directory_search/physician/profiles/dr-md-reports/Dr-Jerry-Thomas-MD-0BAAA4A4.cfm|title=Dr. Jerry Thomas|publisher=healthgrades.com|accessdate=November 13, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; who served in both houses of the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] from 1988 to 2004. In 1979, at the age of twenty-six, Thomas was elected [[coroner]] of [[Washington Parish, Louisiana|Washington Parish]], the easternmost of the [[Florida Parishes]] in the southeastern portion of his state. He remained coroner from 1980 until he took his legislative seat in 1988.

==Early life==

Thomas was the son of Aroe Thomas (1930–1994) of Franklinton.&lt;ref name=ssdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Thomas High School in Franklinton and received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] in [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] in neighboring [[Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana|Tangipahoa Parish]]. He received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] credentials from [[Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=enlou&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enlou.com/officeholders/housedistrict75.htm |title=House District 75 |publisher=enlou.com (Encyclopedia Louisiana) |accessdate=November 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111123719/http://enlou.com/officeholders/housedistrict75.htm |archivedate=November 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==

Thomas was initially elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|
Democrat]] to the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana House of Representatives]] in the  [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held in October 1987. At the age of 34, Thomas unseated the long-term Democratic [[incumbent]], [[Lawrence A. Sheridan]] of [[Angie, Louisiana|Angie]] in Washington Parish, who was 34 years Thomas' senior.&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt; District 75 still encompasses Tangipahoa and Washington parishes. Thomas polled 9,266 votes (60.2 percent) to Sheridan's 6,121 (39.8 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&amp;rqsdta=102487|title=Louisiana election returns, October 24, 1987|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=November 13, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Sheridan sought a comeback but again lost to Thomas by an identical percentage: 6,312 (39.8 percent) to 9,532 (60.2 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&amp;rqsdta=101991|title=Louisiana election returns, October 19, 1991|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=November 13, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheridan had been chairman of the House Retirement Committee during much of his 28-year tenure in the House.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bogalusa Daily News]]'', "Lawrence A. Sheridan", [[obituary|Obituaries]], April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Thomas won his last term in the House by defeating his successor in both the House and the Senate, [[Ben Nevers|Ben W. Nevers]], an electrical contractor from Bogalusa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10211995/10211995_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana election returns, October 21, 1995|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1999, Nevers was unopposed for Thomas's former House seat.&lt;ref name=returns&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresults.sos.la.gov/graphical/|title=Louisiana aprimary election returns, October 23, 1999|publisher=electionresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1995 [[general election]], Short had unexpectedly unseated the legendary [[Sixty Rayburn|B.B. "Sixty" Rayburn]] of Bogalusa. Rayburn's former district appeared to have turned solidly Republican in the special election of February 6, 1999, when the sole Democratic candidate, Stanley Middleton, polled only 9 percent of the vote. Republican-convert Thomas won the position outright in the first round of balloting with 51 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&amp;rqsdta=020699|title=Louisiana special election returns, February 6, 1999|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=November 3, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Designated Flight 101. The two experienced crew of the U.S. Navy blimp [[L class blimp|''L-8'']] disappeared without explanation during the flight giving it the name "The Ghost Blimp." The blimp drifted inland from its Pacific patrol route, striking the ground and leaving its [[depth charge]] armament on the beach. It then lifted off and drifted further inland and crashed on a downtown street in [[Daly City, California]]. The gondola door had been latched open, and the safety bar which was normally used to block the doorway was no longer in place. Two of the three life jackets on board were missing, but these would have been worn by the two crew during flight, as regulations required. A year after their disappearance the pilots were officially declared dead.&lt;ref name="CheckSixL-8"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/L-8_crash_site.htm| title = The Crash of Navy Blimp L-8: 16 August 1942 | accessdate = 17 November 2008| publisher = Check-Six | authorlink = | date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The southeast door of blimp hangar at NAS Houma, Louisiana, was chained open due to a fault. A gust of wind carried three [[K-class blimp]]s, all of ZP-22, out into the night. ''K-56'' traveled 4.5 miles{{clarify| date=August 2012}}&lt;!--8km? Or 7.2? Being USN, I'd guess 8--&gt; before crashing into trees.

The '''Lizard''' ('''Curtis''' "'''Curt'''" '''Connors''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. In 2009, The Lizard was ranked [[IGN]]'s 62nd Greatest Comic Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/62.html Lizard is number 62] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194500/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/62.html |date=2013-10-29 }} [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories, Dr. Connors was a genetic biologist who researched the ability of certain reptiles to regrow missing limbs, partially to find a way to regenerate his right arm. After a test on himself, he transforms into a violent lizard monster. Though able to revert to his human form, he suffers occasional fits of his alter ego breaking free.

The character has appeared in numerous ''Spider-Man'' cartoons and video games, and is portrayed by [[Dylan Baker]] (whose version never transformed into The Lizard) in the 2004 film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and its 2007 sequel ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and by [[Rhys Ifans]] in the 2012 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and has been voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in various voice-over media.

==Publication history==
The Lizard first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #6 (November [[1963 in comics|1963]]), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 20|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= ''The Amazing Spider-Man''s sixth issue introduced the Lizard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falco p. 95"&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="issue #6"&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= Face-to-Face With...the Lizard!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 6|date= November 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kindersly"&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year = 2012|page = 20|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= ''The Amazing Spider-Man''s sixth issue introduced the Lizard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Curtis "Curt" Connors was born in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. He was a gifted surgeon who enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. He performed emergency battlefield surgery on wounded GIs. However his right arm was terribly injured in a wartime blast, resulting in its amputation.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #6"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Web of Spider-Man vol.2, #6"&gt;''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #6&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to civilian life as a research technologist, Connors became obsessed with uncovering the secrets of reptilian limb regeneration. Working from his home in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] with the help of war buddy [[Man-Thing|Ted Sallis]], he finally developed an experimental serum taken from [[reptile|reptilian]] [[DNA]].&lt;ref name="Web of Spider-Man vol.2, #6"/&gt; The serum successfully regrew the missing limb of a rabbit, so then Connors chose to test the serum on himself. He ingested the formula and his missing arm did indeed grow back.

However, the formula had a [[side effect]]. Connors was subsequently transformed into a [[reptilian humanoid]] monster. Spider-Man discovered this situation during a trip to Florida to investigate newspaper reports of the Lizard after his employer the ''Daily Bugle'' challenged him. After discovering the Lizard's true identity and origin, Spider-Man used Connors' notes to create an antidote to restore him to his human form and mentality.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #6"/&gt; Another attempt to develop this serum for safe use again resulted in Connors transforming into the Lizard, but on this occasion he was saved thanks to his former colleague [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] and his first team of [[X-Men]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] tracking the Lizard down in the swamps so that [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] could send him into hibernation long enough to develop a cure.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: First Class'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in New York===
Later, Curt Connors relocated to [[New York City]]. He was able to repay Spider-Man by developing a formula to save May Parker's life after Peter Parker had given his aunt his radioactive blood during a transfusion, unintentionally putting her in mortal peril.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #32–33&lt;/ref&gt; It later became clear that the success of Connors' apparent cure from the Lizard persona was short-lived. A repeating pattern occurred, with stress or a chemical reaction turning Connors into the Lizard, Spider-Man fighting him, and then forming some kind of temporary cure to reverse the transformation until the next time. A second personality had formed with the Lizard, one with the familiar goal shared by many villains of taking over the world. The Lizard envisioned a world where all humans had been transformed into (or replaced by) super-reptiles like himself. Despite the Lizard's overall hatred of humans, he was often shown to be unwilling to harm his wife [[Martha Connors|Martha]] or young son [[Billy Connors (comics)|Billy]].

As Connors, he aided Spider-Man in defeating the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] by developing a formula to dissolve the Rhino's bullet-proof hide, but accidentally transformed himself into the Lizard due to exposure to the chemicals needed to create the formula and was restored by Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #43–45&lt;/ref&gt; Connors was later kidnapped and forced to create a rejuvenation serum for [[Silvermane]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #73–74&lt;/ref&gt; However, the stress from this caused Connors to transform, the Lizard battled Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]], and was then restored to normal once again by Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #75–77&lt;/ref&gt;

During another encounter with Spider-Man after Peter's attempts to remove his powers resulted in him [[The Six Arms Saga|growing four extra arms]], a bite from [[Morbius the Living Vampire|Morbius]] endowed the Lizard with Connors' personality via the infection of a strange enzyme. Connors then synthesized an antidote for himself and Spider-Man using the Morbius enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #102&lt;/ref&gt; Curt Connors later aided Spider-Man, [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] against [[Stegron]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #19–20&lt;/ref&gt; After the apparent death of the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], Dr. Connors determined that Spider-Man was not a clone.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #150&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Lizard battled with Stegron and Spider-Man after Stegron kidnapped Billy Connors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #165–166&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Peter Parker worked as a teaching assistant to Dr. Connors at Empire State University, although Connors had no idea that Peter was actually Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mnyc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 32 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first of the [[Secret Wars]], the Lizard refused to participate on either side of the conflict. Although he was collected by the [[Beyonder]] along with other villains, he broke away from the main group after the first battle to settle in a swamp, where he befriended the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], who had helped him treat an injury he sustained in the first battle. After the Lizard was blasted by the magic of the [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]], he reverted to human form.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars''{{issue|date= April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Connors' return from this event, his wife took their son Billy and separated from Curt. The Lizard had apparently been affected by inter-dimensional teleportation so that Connors' mind presided over the Lizard, and battled the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]] alongside Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #127&lt;/ref&gt; However, mystical activity during the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|''Inferno'' crisis]] once again brought the Lizard's bestial nature to the fore, and Spider-Man cured him again.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #313&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1990s through 2007: ''Civil War''===
Connors then tried to straighten out his life and control the Lizard, with some degree of success. This ended when the villain [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]] used her voodoo magic to take control of the Lizard (during the [[Torment (comics)|''Torment'']] storyline) for her own purposes, reducing him to a mindless, savage state. After a series of bloody battles, the Lizard and Calypso were defeated by Spider-Man, and Spider-Man assumed that he perished under Calypso's spell.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt; Connors once again gained control of the Lizard's mind and body, although it was very weak. Curt carried out a plan to cure himself temporarily,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #365&lt;/ref&gt; after which he voluntarily submitted to incarceration in the supervillain prison the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #27&lt;/ref&gt; When Calypso forced the transformation and attempted to control the Lizard once again, the creature killed her and escaped from the Vault. After this escape, the Lizard fell into a [[quicksand]] pit during a battle with Spider-Man and the bounty hunter Warrant and was believed to have died.&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Spider-Man'' #109–111&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a huge bestial Lizard appeared,&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Super Special'' #1 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after Connors was called in to investigate Peter Parker's sudden sickness (the result of Peter's recently lost spider-powers returning). Spider-Man ([[Ben Reilly]]) realized that not only had the Lizard survived, but revealed later his new monstrous transformation seemed to be permanent and the personality of Curt Connors appeared completely lost. However, when this savage mindless Lizard later unexpectedly encountered Dr. Connors himself while Connors was helping Peter, Curt became the true Lizard once again and saved his family by killing the "Lizard-clone". It was revealed that the Lizard-clone was a scientific accident resulting from an experimental formula being tested on a piece of the original Lizard's tail, which had then grown into a fully formed second creature.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #237–239&lt;/ref&gt;

Although reunited after Curt's apparent death, Martha and Billy were diagnosed with cancer after being exposed to carcinogens from living near an industrial lab in Florida. Spider-Man assisted Curt in successfully forcing Monnano, the lab's owner, to admit culpability, but Martha died from her cancer.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man: Quality of Life'' #1–4&lt;/ref&gt; Billy recovered but remained bitter towards his father. Curt's guilt and internalized anger led him to become the Lizard once again, and once human, Curt attempted a bank robbery so he would be sent to prison.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #11–13&lt;/ref&gt; After a short-lived term, Connors was released and changed into the Lizard once more, this time due to a scheme by [[Norman Osborn]] to form the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]] to kill Spider-Man. The Sinister Twelve were defeated and captured by the combined forces of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #7–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lizard resurfaced to face Spider-Man with the aid of Billy Connors, who was changed into an adolescent Lizard by his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' #23–27&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Lizard and his son were captured and reverted. Billy's transformational ability has been ignored since. A new [[Sinister Six]] team, including new member Lizard, appeared during the superhero ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'', but it was stopped by [[Captain America]] and his [[Secret Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-''Civil War'', Curt Connors aided Spider-Man in developing a cure for the victims of [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] who were mutated with unstable versions of Spider-Man's powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' #35–37&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Connors has also monitored the progress of the hero [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], a female grad student who stole a sample of Connors' Lizard formula. She modified the formula for her own DNA to grow back her missing legs and to give herself reptilian powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Brand New Day'' (2008) and beyond===
Doctor Curt Connors appeared in the 2008 ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' storyline, where he experimented with animal [[stem cells]] as well as aiding forensic specialist [[Carlie Cooper]]. New villain [[Freak (Marvel Comics)|Freak]] (the third version) mistook Connors' stem cells experiment for drugs. Connors helped Spider-Man defeat Freak during their second encounter.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #553–558&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events of [[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|''The Gauntlet'']], Curt Connors is working for the pharmaceutical company Phelcorp under executive Brian King. Connors has lost custody of his son, Billy. The Lizard persona tries to goad Connors to give it control, and he relents when his assistant sleeps with King. When he changes, the Lizard devours King.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #630&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Parker decides to protect Billy and swings to his foster parents' home, where he finds that Billy was kidnapped and his new parents held hostage by [[Kraven the Hunter#Ana Tatiana Kravinoff|Ana Kravinoff]]. Ana has left Billy in an alley, where the Lizard eats him and destroys the Connors persona temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #631&lt;/ref&gt; The devouring of Billy causes the Lizard to gain a new form, sporting a leaner physique, long brown hair, spikes on its right forearm, human intelligence and the telepathic ability to communicate with the underdeveloped "lizard part" of human brains; he demonstrates the latter ability by hypnotizing Spider-Man into thinking that he has prey to stalk, causing the superhero to leave. Operating from the sewers, the Lizard hypnotizes several people into taking what they want.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #632&lt;/ref&gt; Away from the Lizard, Spider-Man ingests Connors' Lizard suppressant formula, which makes Spider-Man immune to the Lizard's mind controlling powers. Spider-Man then combats the Lizard, injects him with some of the formula and reveals he regrets what he has done: Connors' psyche is still in the Lizard's body. The Lizard disappears after the fight.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #633&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''Origin of the Species'', the Lizard joins [[Doctor Octopus]]'s supervillain team&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642&lt;/ref&gt; and steals [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s baby.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645&lt;/ref&gt; As Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man fight within the Lizard's hideout, the Lizard at first attacks Spider-Man, but then gladly returns the baby. He reveals that he already took a blood sample from the baby and found out that Norman Osborn is not the father; therefore, the baby is useless to him and all the villains. Doctor Octopus, angry about the Lizard's hypnotism obstructing his intellect, attacks him while Spider-Man escapes with the baby. Both Doctor Octopus and the Lizard would survive this fight.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646&lt;/ref&gt;

A short time later, while investigating kidnappings in New York, the [[X-Men]] find themselves working with Spider-Man after they discover that the abductor is the Lizard, who has been turning the victims into lizard people while maintaining his control over the city's reptile population.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 3 #8&lt;/ref&gt; The X-Men and Spider-Man discover that Lizard is being used by the [[Dark Beast]], who has given the Lizard his 'reptilian shift' abilities by using a machine.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 3 #9&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, Lizard shifts [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into lizard people, [[Emma Frost]] and Spider-Man escape the machine's effects, release the Lizard and use him to defeat Dark Beast, who is arrested while Lizard escapes.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 3 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Doctor [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] discovers the Lizard&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #679&lt;/ref&gt; had used DNA samples from Billy Connors' corpse to restore Curt Connors to humanity. Unfortunately, the Lizard's psyche is still present&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #688&lt;/ref&gt; and is pretending to be Connors so that he will be left alone. Lizard/Connors releases blood into the air supply to provoke Morbius into attacking other lab workers. Lizard/Connors then tries to recreate his original Lizard formula so he can change again, but Morbius' cure instead only allows him to regrow his missing arm. Lizard/Connors then injects [[Max Modell]] and other Horizon Lab personnel with his formula to discover how to "cure" himself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #689&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to appear to be the "normal" Connors, Lizard/Connors cuts off his regrown limb, but the Lizard begins to appreciate human life, to the point that when he finds the correct Lizard serum, he contemplates remaining human,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #690&lt;/ref&gt; but he takes the cure when Spider-Man arrives and threatens him with custody. This results in yet another streamlined, new form. A new cure is developed for the lab employees he changed, but this formula fails on Lizard's new form; he is instead knocked out and taken to the Raft. Visiting him in the Raft, Spider-Man is unaware that the serum restored Connors' psyche and Connors remains in prison willingly, as he feels he deserves it for his actions as the Lizard.&lt;ref name="asm691"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #691&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Parker (whose mind was trapped within Doctor Octopus' dying body) is freed from the Raft by Trapster, Hydro-Man, and Scorpion. Trapster offers to free the Lizard, but Connors declines.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #699"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699&lt;/ref&gt; When Morbius the Living Vampire manages to escape his cell, the Lizard points out that he still has nowhere to go. For unknown reasons, Morbius then frees the Lizard.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #699"/&gt;

The Lizard is seen back in his cell, being one of the few inmates left to be transported out of the decommissioned Raft.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Alistair Smythe]] attempts an escape from the Raft, he temporarily shuts down the Raft's power, letting the Lizard out of his cell.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; The Lizard protects [[J. Jonah Jameson]] from Scorpion, revealing that he has the mind of Curt Conners, and that he "will never let the monsters win again." Jameson defends the Lizard from the Raft's warden, calling him a hero, and protesting the use of a restraining device, though the Lizard himself prefers to be cautious. During Smythe's final escape attempt, the Lizard is impaled through the shoulder, but survives.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man'' #13&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event as part of the lead-up to the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Lizard is shown at the Andry Corrections Facility. He is escorted to the visitor's room and his restraints are removed. After the guards leave the visitor's room, Lizard meets the mysterious [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|red-suited man]] where he claims to have met Curt Connors before. Lizard detects familiar scents accompanying the man, scents that can not be there, and warns him not to toy with the Lizard. The red-suited man replies that he is not the Lizard, inside he is Curt Connors, a model prisoner who saved Mayor J. Jonah Jameson and various civilians before and is trapped in a monster's body. Lizard lashes out at him, demanding to know how can the people he is smelling be there. The man says that the Lizard has abilities he can use and if he escapes and joins him, he can give him anything. He snaps his fingers and Martha Connors and Billy Connors step forward where they are somehow alive. The red-suited man asks if they have a deal. The Lizard tearfully accepts his deal.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #4&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that the revived Martha Connors and Billy Connors are clones that the red-suited man had gathered to grow clones with false memories that span all the way to their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; The Lizard and a depowered Electro are later sprung from Andry Corrections Facility by Rhino on the red-suited man's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #10&lt;/ref&gt; Lizard worked with Jackal on a procedure that would repower Electro. The first time it was interrupted, Lizard was present when Jackal summons a somehow-revived Francine appears in order to convince Maxwell to go through with it. The second time it was interrupted was when Martha Connors informed everyone present about a fire in Edmond, Oklahoma that neither of them was responsible for.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #16&lt;/ref&gt; While escaping from New U Technologies, Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 quickly incapacitate Lizard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; When Doctor Octopus pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying, Lizard sees that Martha Connors and Billy Connors are affected.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing battle, Lizard escapes with Martha and Billy as he vows to find a way to keep them from dying.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; In the sewers of San Francisco, Lizard has saved Martha and Billy Connors from the Carrion Virus by injecting them with the Lizard formula, turning his wife and son into lizard people like him.&lt;ref&gt;''Clone Conspiracy Omega'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Connors is later shown having returned to Empire State University,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; now using a special chip implanted in the back of his neck to control his Lizard persona, with the chip acting as an inhibitor that stops him attacking humans. Teaching once again, Connors offers to support Peter Parker's efforts to re-apply for his doctorate after he was academically disgraced by accusations of plagiarism of Otto Octavius' thesis since Doctor Octopus' mind was in Peter's body at the time. The inhibitor proves a disadvantage when Connors' class is attacked by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] and he cannot defend himself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Dr. Curtis Connors gave himself superhuman powers as a result of exposure to the Lizard Formula, allowing him to transform into the Lizard. In human form, he has none of his superhuman powers, but he is highly intelligent and a well known scientist in fields of [[genetics]], [[physics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[herpetology]].

When Connors is transformed into the Lizard, his strength is increased to superhuman levels. Likewise, his speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are also raised to a level equivalent to that of Spider-Man. He can also scale walls using a combination of his sharp claws and micro-scales on his hands and feet that create molecular friction like those of a gecko. He is highly resistant to injury due to his thick scaly hide, allowing him to resist punctures and lacerations from ordinary weapons and lower-caliber firearms. In addition, the Lizard has highly enhanced healing abilities which allow him to quickly recover from grievous wounds, including regenerating lost limbs. He also has a powerful tail which he can whip at high speeds. The Lizard has razor-sharp teeth set in muscular jaws that can deal a lethal bite (the latter is established in the Lizard's later appearances; in his earlier appearances he seems to have no teeth at all). Like a reptile, he has [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] characteristics and is therefore sensitive to drops in temperature; a sufficiently cold environment will cause his metabolism to slow drastically and become dormant if he is exposed to cold temperatures for too long.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #45"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #45&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lizard can mentally communicate and command all reptiles within a mile of himself via limited [[telepathy]]. He has also on at least one occasion secreted powerful [[pheromone]]s which caused nearby humans to behave violently. Post-''Brand New Day'', a further enhancement of his telepathy granted him the power of telepathically compelling humans to act out their primal urges, by suppressing emotional control in their [[amygdala]] (the "lizard brain").{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Based on various physiological and environmental factors, the Lizard's intelligence can range from bestial and animalistic to normal human intelligence. The Lizard personality has most often manifested with human intelligence, capable of speech and higher reasoning, although some versions have been more feral than others. During the [[Secret Wars]] in particular, he appeared less ruthless than his normal portrayal, showing concern for [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]]&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; after they showed him kindness despite his usual disdain for humans. However, even when operating at the level of a human, the Lizard is rarely as intelligent as Dr. Connors, showing on many occasions an inability to understand his human self's work and use it to further his own ends despite his best efforts.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #45"/&gt;

The Lizard has apparently "destroyed" the Curt Connors persona, but has subsequently begun to display some of Connors's human emotions.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} In contrast to his previously feral nature, he has also shown sufficient intellectual capabilities to replicate Connors' work for himself, although he is still hampered by his inability to fully comprehend human emotions.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

==Continuity==
In a 2004 story arc entitled ''Lizard's Tale'', written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] in the ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' comic book, it was revealed that the Lizard persona was not a separate personality from Dr. Connors after all - Curt had been consciously controlling his reptilian alter ego all along. Furthermore, Connors was shown to know that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, despite the discovery of the secret identity never being explained or depicted. The story ended with Dr. Connors deliberately getting himself sent to prison and hoping the Lizard would not be unleashed again. The Lizard's next appearance after this was as a member of the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], where he showed no indication of being controlled by the mind of Dr. Connors. Although the idea of Connors controlling the Lizard was subsequently ignored, when the Lizard's mind was briefly trapped in Connors' human form, he attempted to mutate the staff of Horizon Labs into lizard people like himself, with none of the other lizards demonstrating the same hostility to humans as the Lizard, prompting Spider-Man to speculate that the Lizard's anti-human traits came from Connors' anger at the world for his lost arm and family rather than the Lizard being completely separate from Connors.&lt;ref name="asm691"/&gt;

Another [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]-related issue involves Connors' son Billy. Unlike many other Marvel Comics children, he has not appreciably grown up since the comics' stories of the 1960s. Billy's visible age also seems to waver back and forth between approximately eight and 13 years old, depending on the particular comic artist drawing the character.

==Other versions==

===''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows''===
In this reality based on the ''Secret Wars'' Warzone, Billy used the Lizard serum on himself and is mutated like his father (though he is not as in control of himself as Curt). Curt and Billy try breaking into high tech facilities in an attempt to find Regent's tech to turn Billy back to normal, but are thwarted by Spider-Man and his daughter Spiderling. After defeating the reptilian father and son at Oscorp, Spider-Man contacts the Fantastic Four for help in curing Billy's condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' vol. 2 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lizard ultimate.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ultimate Lizard appears in a dream sequence, as drawn by [[Mark Bagley]] in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #60.]]

The one comic storyline to date featuring the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe version of Lizard appeared in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' #10. The character has appeared in a few subsequent issues of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', but only in flashbacks and dream sequences. Lizard appears to be based on a [[Common basilisk|basilisk]] lizard in design and has been presented as being less intelligent than the original Marvel iteration.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #16"&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; '''Dr. Curt Conners''' is a noted geneticist who lost his right arm under unrevealed circumstances. He dedicated himself to finding a means of restoring lost limbs by studying the regenerative capabilities of reptiles. However, after five years without major breakthroughs, his sponsors were on the verge of cutting his funding. Drowning his disappointment with alcohol, a drunken Conners injected himself with an experimental serum in a desperate attempt to achieve results. The serum regenerated his right arm, but also transformed Conners into an inhuman reptilian creature. Seeking refuge in the sewers, he became an urban legend dubbed "the Lizard" by the press. A sympathetic [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] sought out Lizard who attacked the young hero until [[Man-Thing]] happened upon the scene and restored Conners to human form. Conners' restored right arm soon withered and died. However, his DNA remained irreparably damaged with dormant potential for further transformation. Conners cut himself off from his wife and son out of fear for their safety.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Conners also unintentionally created the Ultimate version of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] using [[DNA]] from Spider-Man and based on an analysis of his old friend [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]'s work on the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom suit]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #60-64&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ensuing chaos, he was arrested and [[Stark Industries]] canceled their financial support of his experiments, but his assistant [[Ben Reilly]] still had one sample of Spider-Man's DNA, setting the stage for the [[Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #61&lt;/ref&gt; He was last seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127, where Dr. Conners was pardoned and recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. where he and [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Tony Stark]] are at when the Triskellion was blown apart by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] during an escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127&lt;/ref&gt;

Early details of the character's history match his 616 counterpart, with him studying reptiles to fix his arm (the cause of this has yet to be revealed), and the condition of him leaving his wife and son (Doris and Timmy&lt;ref&gt;''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1-2''&lt;/ref&gt;) out of fear, thereby turning to [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #16"/&gt;

===''Howard the Human''===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the Battleworld domain of New Quack City has a version of Curt Connors in it. This Curt Connors is a tough, anthropomorphic lizard who is a bartender at a place that Howard the Human frequently visits.&lt;ref&gt;''Howard the Human'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exiles===
The reality-hopping heroic team, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], once found themselves on an alternate earth where Connors' experiment (in this world for a left arm rather than a right) had taken a different turn. Finding himself as the Lizard, Curt felt the need to "reproduce" by immediately injecting the Lizard formula into other people. He infected his family and they infected others, all feeling the urge to spread the transformation into lizard people. The forces of this particular world eventually managed to restrain the infected lizard people behind miles-long, man-made walls. When the Exiles visited this world, they discovered that Connors - having turned back into his human form a year ago - was intending to detonate a nuclear bomb in an abandoned submarine to wipe out the lizard people, but they were able to talk him down by arguing that the radioactive fallout would cause more damage, particularly since the lizard people were now mere herbivores (albeit partly because of the absence of other kinds of meat). Grief-stricken over what had become of his life, Connors subsequently killed himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Exiles'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Marvel 1602''===
In this reality, Curtis Connors is a philosopher who was infected with the [[bubonic plague]]. He created an elixir that transformed him into a reptilian creature that resembled a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', but retained his mind. He worked with Baron Victor Octavius to capture the Spider.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man 1602''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Marvel Noir''===
In the [[Marvel Noir]] reality, Curt Connors is an assistant to Dr. Otto Octavius.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; They operated in an abandoned hospital building on [[Ellis Island]], where they secretly used kidnapped African Americans as specimens by turning them into mindless slaves. It is unknown what happened to Connors after federal authorities raided the hospital, though he was presumably arrested along with Octavius' associates.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Marvel Zombies''===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', the Lizard, like almost every other hero and villain, has become a zombie. This particular incarnation of the Lizard is apparently destroyed when he is blasted apart by several cosmic-powered heroes while fighting (and eating) [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===''MC2''===
The Connors family appear in the first story of the ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man]]'' series, set in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. Mary Jane comforts a distraught Martha when Curt goes missing again, whilst Peter, now a parent to his infant daughter May ("Mayday"), is more hesitant than before to become Spider-Man. He is eventually encouraged by his wife to track down and prevent the Lizard's latest rampage.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #1, Oct 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spider-Gwen===
On Earth-65 where [[Gwen Stacy]] became Spider-Woman after being bitten by the spider,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=53261|title=Lowe, Hine &amp;amp; Latour Take Readers to the "Edge of Spider-Verse"|date=6 June 2014|website=Comicbookresources.com|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Parker attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him, becoming this universe's version of the Lizard. Gwen subdues him, but Peter ended up dying towards the end of the battle due to his use of the chemicals that transformed him. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an uproar for her arrest, led by J. Jonah Jameson, with Peter essentially becoming Gwen's [[Uncle Ben]], serving as inspiration of the need to use her powers to help others.&lt;ref&gt;''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

It is later revealed that Curt Connors was a teacher at Gwen's high school and was studying Lizard genetics,{{issue|date=October 2015}} possibly being involved in Peter's transformation into the Lizard and the recent sightings of multiple Lizard-people wreaking havoc on the city.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

===''Marvel Age''===
Lizard's history is the same in this reality. Spider-Man went to Florida to investigate the "Lizard Man" sightings. Spider-Man meets Martha Connors and learns that Lizard is her husband Dr. Curt Connors. After making an antidote, Spider-Man ensnares Lizard and uses the antidote to restore him to Curt Connors. Peter Parker later told J. Jonah Jameson that the "Lizard Man" was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Age: Spider-Man'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* Lizard appears in the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Gillie Fenwick]]. This version is referred to as '''Dr. Curt Conner'''. Depicted as having both of his arms in the episode "Where Crawls the Lizard", his serum is intended to cure "swamp fever". Conner later appears in the episode "Fountain of Terror" where he finds the [[Fountain of Youth]] and ends up held prisoner by someone that looks like [[Juan Ponce de León]] before Spider-Man appears and the Fountain of Youth is accidentally destroyed. Spider-Man manages to rescue him after defeating Harley Clivendon. In the episode "Conner's Reptiles", Lizard appears again. This time, it is not Conner but one of his experimental [[alligator]]s with increased intelligence that abducted him. The episode uses footage from "Where Crawls the Lizard", just changing the order of scenes and the voices.
* Lizard appears in the 1981 ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. This version is presented as a monster-villain with no mention of Curt Connors. In the episode "Lizards, Lizards, Everywhere", he ends up springing every reptile from the zoo in order to make Manhattan a reptile paradise. The Lizard is defeated by Spider-Man, leaving him webbed up in an empty zoo cage.

* Curt Connors/Lizard appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Joseph Campanella]]. This version was portrayed as possessing a genius-level intellect but also having the savage mindset from the comics. In his first appearance in the episode "[[Night of the Lizard]]", Dr. Connors transforms into the Lizard after using himself as a test subject with lizard DNA to regenerate his right arm. He then abducts his wife Margaret Connors and carried Margaret into the sewers in order to help complete his plan to turn New York into lizards, but he was defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and returned to his human form. Curt had many other appearances throughout this series as a supporting character. In the episodes "Tablet of Time" and "The Ravages of Time", Connors turned into the Lizard again during the point when [[Silvermane]] obtained the Tablet of Time. In the episode "The Final Nightmare", Connors objected to Farley Stillwell's destruction on the database, as he needs it for a cure at the time when Spider-Man was fighting [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. When Stillwell asks what cure, Connors turns into the Lizard and attacks Farley only to be knocked down by Spider-Man. In the episode "The Lizard King", some of Connors's chemicals mutated some sewer lizards into humanoid lizards that plot to abduct Connors. When Connors turns again, they make the Lizard their king, causing Margaret and [[Mary Jane Watson]] to turn to [[Debra Whitman]] to help create a cure. Mutated Lizard Gila did not want to go by the Lizard Men's goals anymore and was able to set off the device, restoring the Lizard and the Lizard Men to their true forms. In the three-part episode "Secret Wars", the [[Beyonder]] abducted the Lizard as one of the villains to be placed on a peaceful alien planet. When Spider-Man assembled the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the Lizard attacked the base and was repelled only for the Lizard to be attacked by the local giant sandworms. When the Lizard was rendered unconscious by the attack and the base was re-powered by Storm's lightning, Iron Man and [[Mister Fantastic]] managed to use a machine to activate the dormant part of Lizard's mind, enabling his human part of the mind to be awakened.
* Lizard appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'', voiced by rock musician/filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]]. This version of Curt Connors is more serious and colder than other versions, and lost his right arm as a result from a testing accident due to the Wide Area Explosive Fragmentation Round (aka WAFER), an [[Oscorp]] Industries weapon. Lizard's physical appearance in this series was much more animalistic and saurian than the comic book version. In the episode "Law of the Jungle", Dr. Connors is still bitter over his right arm's lost. When he transforms, the Lizard becomes aggressive and feral but maintains his ability to talk, at least when his serum is lowered. He goes to Oscorp out of proxy-revenge. During a battle with Spider-Man, the Lizard's arm is again cut off. At one point, Spider-Man dangles the Lizard from a web while attached to a helicopter. Spider-Man tries to reason with him but the Lizard strikes out, cutting the web and causing the reptilian menace to fall to his apparent death.

[[File:Lizard-tearing522.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Lizard in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''.]]
* Curt Connors appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', with [[Dee Bradley Baker]] reprising the role from the video games ''Spider-Man'' and ''Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro''. This version was portrayed as possessing a genius-level intellect but also having the savage mindset from the comics but one key difference from usual media is that Dr. Connors has a fully functioning, mechanical [[prosthetic]] arm. Curtis Connors lost his arm while working as a surgeon in the United States Army. He became so desperate on regrowing his arm, that he tested his reptile potion on himself. He later found work as a brilliant biologist at Empire State University, studying reptiles and cell regeneration. Connors's experiments with lizard DNA proved more than he could handle. The serum regrew his arm but also turned him into a giant green lizard-like creature known as the Lizard. Spider-Man, [[Eddie Brock]], [[Gwen Stacy]] and Martha Connors developed a formula that would turn the Lizard back. It worked, though Spider-Man took a picture of himself fighting the Lizard, they decided to keep his transformation a secret. But when Peter Parker then sold that picture to The ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', Martha felt she could not trust that Peter wouldn't reveal the secret if Peter would sell photos and ended the internship (but Peter was eventually rehired). Despite Eddie's firing due to the [[Symbiote (comics)|alien symbiote]]'s loss, the Connors later have [[Jackal (comics)|Miles Warren]] as support in scientific research at ESU labs with a grant from [[Norman Osborn]]. After Venom steals a vial of Curt's gene cleanser, control of the Connors' lab falls into Miles's hands. When Curt discovers Warren's amoral genetic research, he threatens to tell the school board. However, Warren retaliates by threatening to inform of Curt's own experiments on himself, and reveal how his human limb regeneration project turned him into the Lizard. Eventually, Curt and Martha decided to move to Florida.
* Curt Connors/Lizard appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' television series, voiced initially by [[Tom Kenny]] (in season one) and later by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] (for subsequent seasons). This version of Dr. Connors is a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] scientist and is introduced with both of his arms until season one's finale where his right arm is severely damaged (and later has to be amputated) because of the Green Goblin's attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]]. The Lizard appears in the season two. In his self-titled episode "The Lizard", Connors and Spider-Man investigate [[Doctor Octopus]]'s various animal DNA formulas (examples being lizard DNA, rhinoceros DNA, scorpion DNA and vulture DNA). Fascinated by their potential medical benefits, Connors injects himself with the lizard DNA in order to save Spider-Man from an Octobot. The first dose restores his right arm (albeit covered in green scales) but later doses eventually turn himself into the Lizard. As he gets less intelligent and more aggressive, the Lizard goes in search of Doctor Octopus for more formula with Spider-Man following him. After fighting both Doctor Octopus and the Lizard, Spider-Man uses Doctor Octopus's technology to make an antidote which successfully makes the Lizard human again. But in the episode "The Sinister Six", Doctor Octopus abducts Connors and forcefully turns him into the Lizard and controlled with a device planted on the back of his neck to be a member of the [[Sinister Six]] along with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]. When the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]] defeat the Sinister Six, the Lizard evades capture after breaking free from Doctor Octopus's device and escapes into the sewers. The Lizard later appears in the episode "Stan By Me". He steals equipment from Midtown High School when [[Phil Coulson]], Mary Jane Watson and [[Harry Osborn]] happen to be nearby, leading to a showdown with Spider-Man and [[Stan Lee|Stan the Janitor]]. The machine that the Lizard built enabled him to keep his human side dormant. The Lizard succeeds in rendering his human side dormant and escapes after being repelled by Spider-Man, Coulson, the students and Stan the Janitor. In season two's two-part finale, the character has a central role. The Lizard sports an armored attire thanks to stolen OsCorp technology. In the sewers, The Lizard fights Spider-Man and Iron Patriot. After the Lizard ends up fleeing, Spider-Man and Iron Patriot discover an antidote recipe that Lizard wrote. On Ryker's Island, the Lizard later accompanies Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven, Rhino and [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] as an armored Sinister Six that attacks Spider-Man. When the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees and Iron Patriot fight the Sinister Six, Spider-Man fights the Lizard within Ryker's Island and tries to get through to him. Eventually, Spider-Man successfully restores Connors, and he thanks Spider-Man for restoring him to normal. Afterwards, Connors (via Coulson) supplies Spider-Man with an antidote for the Goblin. After Spider-Man restores the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees with Conners's antidote and then defeats the Goblin, Connors determines that it'll take some time to revert the Goblin back to a human. The character makes minor appearances in ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors''; Connors provides Spider-Man with symbiote containment devices and discovers [[Flash Thompson]] is the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] parasite's permanent host (in the episode "Agent Venom") and tried to revert Rhino back to a human (in the episode "Rampaging Rhino") while Lizard made cameo appearances in occasional [[cutaway scene]]s. The Lizard returns in ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six'' while Curt Connors remains a background character. In the episode "Lizards", Doctor Octopus's [[Ben Reilly|spy]] injects Connors with the lizard serum when Spider-Man is in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy. While trying to cure himself, he gets turned into the Lizard in front of Spider-Man's group. This time, the Lizard has a bite that turns anyone that is bitten into Lizards as well. Using an atmospheric device in the lab of Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, Spider-Man was able to distribute the remaining lizard serum cure through the ventilation, which cured everyone. Connors also provides Iron Patriot of Harry's status after the [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] fight (in "Anti-Venom"), provides Spider-Man the key of his anti-[[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] device (in "The New Sinister Six" [Pt. 1]), and provided a mixed report on Flash's and Venom's recovery (in "Symbiote Saga" [Pt. 1]). The episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 1 featured an alternate version that lives on a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]-infested world where he is also a vampire known as the '''Lizard King'''. With [[List of Marvel Comics characters: B#Blood Spider|Blood Spider]] being the only opposition, the Lizard King collaborated with the Wolf Spider in a plot to obtain a [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] fragment to block out the sun so that vampires can rule the Earth. However, Spider-Man and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Kid Arachnid]] combined Blood Spider's cured blood sample with the Siege Perilous piece and a UV Light which was used to cure everyone. While the Lizard King was regressed back to his human form, Wolf Spider claimed the fragment that Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid was looking for causing three Spiders to move on to the next reality.
* Lizard appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/869243-marvels-animated-spider-man-voice-cast-and-premiere-date|title=Marvel's Animated Spider-Man Voice Cast and Premiere Date|date=14 July 2017|website=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Rise of Doc Ock Pt. 2|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=15|airdate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of Curt Connors is depicted as a scientist working for Oscorp. In the episode "The Rise of Doc Ock" Pt. 2, Connors comes across Oscorp's project that involves regrowing arms with reptilian DNA. When he takes an unimproved sample to use to regrow his lost arm, it turns him into Lizard where he targets Norman Osborn. After Lizard is subdued at Oscorp, Norman Osborn is secretly behind the cure as he wants to manipulate events to get Otto Octavius on his side. When Lizard "breaks free" and Otto Octavius uses a formula with tainted data on Lizard, it turns Lizard into a giant lizard monster. Upon isolating the DNA sample, Spider-Man and Spider-Man II were able to come up with a cure to use on the weak part of Lizard's head to restore him to normal.

===Films===
* Curt Connors appears in [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy]], played by [[Dylan Baker]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The character was first mentioned by name in ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002) during Peter Parker's lament after being fired for being late to work. Dr. Connors physically appeared in the sequels ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004) and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007) played by actor [[Dylan Baker]]; the character does not become the Lizard in this franchise, although he is missing his right arm as in the comics. In ''Spider-Man 2'', Connors is depicted as a [[Columbia University]] [[physics]] [[professor]] concerned for Peter's well-being and academic performance in his [[quantum mechanics]] course. He is also a friend of [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]]. In ''Spider-Man 3'', Peter turns to Connors to analyze a piece of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|alien symbiote]], which Connors later informs him that it heightens aggression, and warns Peter not to let it attach itself to him. In 2007, Raimi expressed interest in portraying Connors's transformation into his villainous Lizard alter-ego; Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Eric|last= Goldman | title = Exclusive: Lizard Leapin' Into Spidey 4? | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = January 23, 2007 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/757/757729p1.html | accessdate = 2007-05-29| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081230040122/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/757/757729p1.html |archivedate = December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean |last=Elliott |title=Exclusive Interview: 'Spider-Man 3' Producer Grant Curtis talks about villains for 'Spidey 4' + His own origins - Part 1 |work=iF Magazine |date=May 29, 2008 |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2127 |accessdate=May 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224542/http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2127 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raimivillains"&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry |last=Carroll |title=Sam Raimi May Not Helm 'Spider-Man 4'; Wants Carnage, Vulture As Villains If He Does |website=[[MTV.com]] |date=June 26, 2008 |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1563359/20070625/story.jhtml?rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/619utZMxs?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1563359/sam-raimi-might-not-direct-spidey-4.jhtml?rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As disagreements between Sony and Raimi threatened to push the film off the intended May 6, 2011 release date, Sony Pictures announced in January 2010 that plans for ''Spider-Man 4'' had been cancelled due to Raimi's withdrawal from the project, and the ''Spider-Man'' franchise was rebooted with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' in 2012.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The Lizard! | website=Thewrap.com | date=October 13, 2010 | accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, Dr. Curt Connors is a biologist for [[Oscorp]] and former partner of [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], whose research focused on [[Genetic Engineering|genetically combining]] animal traits with humans to improve health—including restoring Connors' own amputated right arm. Peter Parker starts a friendship with Connors after he finds his father's notes that contain an equation to make a critical breakthrough, and together they successfully formulate a serum. When Dr. Rajit Ratha, a representative of Norman Osborn, fires Connors after he refuses to rush into human trials, Connors injects the serum into himself and regenerates his arm. Learning that Dr. Ratha is on his way to the VA hospital, Connors goes to intercept him but it quickly becomes apparent that the serum is doing more than was intended, as he starts taking on reptilian features. By the time he gets to the traffic-jammed [[Williamsburg Bridge]], Connors has transformed into an enhanced humanoid lizard and begins wreaking havoc. Spider-Man then intervenes and manages to save the pedestrians caught in harm's way. The Lizard escapes into the sewers and transforms back into Connors, but it's clear that the chemicals have affected his mind, creating an obsession with his new abilities and seeing it as "perfection"; he continues to further experiment on himself in a makeshift lab. Spider-Man later confronts the Lizard in the sewers and barely escapes alive, while the Lizard inadvertently learns Spider-Man's real identity after finding a camera with "Property of Peter Parker" labeled on it. After only two injections, the Lizard has already developed a mind of its own, and begins speaking to Connors mentally. The Lizard convinces Connors to inject himself again, under the promise that he will "save" the city. Once Connors transforms, he loses complete control of himself and The Lizard's reptilian mind fully takes over. The Lizard follows Peter Parker and attacks him at school, but is forced to escape after the police arrive. The Lizard then carries out a plan to mutate all humans in New York into lizard-beings by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower. Following a fight with Spider-Man and mortally wounding police captain [[George Stacy]], his plan is thwarted when Spider-Man, along with assistance from [[Gwen Stacy]], disperses an antidote cloud restoring Connors and his victims to normal. With the Lizard gone, Connors regains his sanity, and saves Spider-Man from falling off the tower using what's left of his strength. Afterwards, he surrenders to the authorities and is arrested for his crimes. In a scene during the end credits, Connors is now placed in Beloit Psychiatric Hospital and speaks with a [[Gentleman (comics)|mysterious man]] who asks if Connors told Peter the truth about his father; Connors replies that he did not, and demands that Peter be left alone.
* In the [[viral marketing]] for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' Curt Connors is to be put on trial, with [[She-Venom|Anne Weying]] as his [[defense attorney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thedailybugle.tumblr.com/post/64888475045/by-ned-leeds-city-bureau-a-trial-date-has-been|title = Cold-Blooded Killer|publisher = Tumblr|date = 23 October 2013|website = thedailybugle.tumblr.com|accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connors is found guilty despite his plea that his actions were due to the influence of the serum which transformed him into the Lizard, and sent to Ryker's Island. However, Dr. [[Ashley Kafka]] argues that the Ravencroft Institute for the Criminally Insane was better suited for Connors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thedailybugle.tumblr.com/post/72509118182/by-joy-mercado-the-trial-of-dr-curt-connors-came|title = Connors Found Guilty|publisher = Tumblr|date = 6 January 2014|website = thedailybugle.tumblr.com|accessdate = 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connors does not appear in the film itself, but is mentioned several times throughout and there is a file on [[Norman Osborn]]'s computer is marked "Connors File".

===Video games===
* Lizard's first video game appearance was in the 1984 ''Spider-Man'' [[Questprobe]] game, where still graphics were added to an all-text adventure.
* Lizard appeared in the 1991 [[Sega]] ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game|Spider-Man]]'' [[beat-em-up]] [[arcade game]].
* In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (Game Boy)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' for the [[Game Boy]], Lizard pops out of the sewer to attack Spider-Man. He reappears in the [[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (1992 video game)|sequel]].
* In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]'', Lizard appears as a boss.
* In the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] video game ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man Animated Series]]'', Lizard is a boss of the sewers in every stage in the game (except the Brooklyn Bridge and Ravencroft Prison). He is optional and can be avoided to escape the sewers. When he is defeated, he transforms back into Dr. Connors, but an attack on Connors in the SNES version will cause him to change and become more powerful. In the Genesis version he will change back automatically after a short time, however he does not become invincible or stronger. He is also a mini boss in the final level of the SNES version where he can't be attacked after turning into Connors.
* Lizard was a boss in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] video game ''[[Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'' released exclusively in Japan.
* Lizard appeared in the first ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' 3-D environment video game by [[Neversoft]], voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. Lizard has a small role in the game, trapped behind a cage in the NYC sewers. Lizard reveals that Venom had taken control over a group of lizardmen that he created and imprisoned him. Here, Lizard is the only villain not fought against.
* Curt Connors/Lizard appears in the sequel to the 3-D Neversoft game ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'', again voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. Curt Connors was seen in the beginning of the game when Electro breaks into [[Empire State University|ESU]] to locate a device to amplify his powers: the Bio-Nexus Device. He shocks Connors and steals the device. Later on, Spider-Man tries to call Connors on the phone but to no avail. Lizard is a boss character. Resembling a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', the mindless Lizard rampages around his lab and must be defeated again by injecting him with a cure.
* Dr. Curt Connors made a minor appearance in ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' console game, voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]. Originally, Lizard was supposed to have been included in this particular video game and was even prominently featured in some promotional materials before being suddenly removed. However, there are some hints that the Lizard was still going to be in the game, such as the use of green (his alter ego's color) in his lab, Doctor Octopus breaking Dr. Connors arm, the reptile-like creatures that appear in the Fight Area, the hex editor containing a skin named Lizard. Lizard did appear as a level boss in the game's [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]] versions.
* Lizard appears as a mini-boss in the 2006 RPG video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. He is seen as a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. In the game, he appears alongside the Scorpion guarding a just-defeated [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]]. He and Scorpion have special dialogue with Spider-Man. A simulation disk has the heroes fighting Lizard, and notes the connection to Connors, but Lizard casually ignores the mention of his alter ego's name and attacks anyway.
* Lizard is a major character in the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, voiced by Nathan Carlson. In the game, he is created when Dr. Connors injects himself with an experimental serum to re-grow his lost arm. Like in the comics, the Lizard's goal seems to be to replace humanity with a race of reptiles. Kraven the Hunter believes that the Lizard would be a worthy trophy, but when he is about to slay him, Spider-Man in his black suit stops him. The Lizard tries to escape while Spider-Man and Kraven battle, but Calypso - who has provided Kraven with various potions to enhance his strength - drugs the Lizard in an attempt to make him more worthy prey, causing him to transform into a massive "Mega-Lizard" (in the Wii and PS2 versions, Conners becomes the mega-lizard by injecting himself with a larger amount of his serum after being mortally wounded by Kraven). After Kraven is defeated and trapped, Spider-Man manages to defeat the giant Lizard and he transforms back into Connors. Spider-Man would later ask Connors to analyze the black suit in return for him saving Connors' life. He and Spider-Man also retrieve a confused [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Dr. Michael Morbius]] and search for a cure for his vampiric condition and his wife [[Shriek (comics)|Francis Barrison]]. In the game's [[PS3]] and Xbox 360 versions, Connors and Spider-Man collaborate to disperse a gaseous antidote that will turn those people Connors mutated into lizards back into their human selves, as Connors's will help Spider-Man with his analysis on his black suit.
* Lizard appears as a playable ally in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Roger L. Jackson]]. Spider-Man encounters him at an oasis in Egypt as the Lizard is traveling the world in search of a cure where he is unable to find a mythical plant. He is portrayed as a much more heroic figure and does not hesitate to join Spider-Man on his mission after fending off a P.H.A.N.T.O.M. soldier.
* Lizard appears in the 2009 video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Marc Samuel]]. He is a boss exclusive to the game's Wii, NDS, PS2, and PSP versions. He appears as one of the villains controlled by the Fold. Lizard attacks the heroes at the portal that leads out of the Negative Zone Prison alongside Electro, [[Grey Gargoyle]], and [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]].
* Lizard appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. Spider-Man breaks Doctor Connors out of the local insane asylum called the Beloit Psychiatric Hospital. Spider-Man then brings Dr. Connors to an apartment he's house sitting for his Aunt May's [[Stan Lee|friend]] to create a cure for the cross species plague accidentally created by Oscorp using his research. In order to create the cure Connors needs his old research notes. After Spider-Man retrieves the notes, and after Connors pays for the needed lab equipment using Stan's credit card he determines that they need a blood sample from one of the cross species, [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], to complete the antidote. Spider-Man retrieves the blood and gives the cure to Doctor [[Alistair Smythe]], but an unknown flaw results in the "cure" crippling Smythe and driving him insane. When Spider-Man confronts Doctor Connors about the apparently failed cure, Connors realizes Spider-Man ''is'' the cure, being immune to the cross species virus due to his blood reflecting the perfect blend of human and animal. Using Spider-Man's blood, Connors makes a proper cure and Spider-Man gets it to [[Gwen Stacy]]. Unfortunately when Spider-Man gets back to Doctor Connors, he has been kidnapped by Alistair, and Spider-Man's subsequent attempt to rescue Connors results in him apparently losing his powers due to a nanite injection from Smythe. Left with no other choice, Connors transforms himself into the Lizard again and is able to remain in control of himself just long enough to destroy Smythe's [[Spider-Slayer|robots]], giving Spider-Man time to find a way to destroy the nanobots within him and thus restore his powers. Spider-Man then chases Connors through the sewers, and, after a long grueling battle, cures him again. Connors then goes back to the asylum he was locked up in earlier.

'''Lulu Mae Johnson''' ([[Circa|c.]] 1877 &amp;ndash; October 25, 1918), was a dance-hall performer and hotelier in [[Dawson City, Yukon]], Canada.&lt;ref name=dicbio&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=41600&amp;query= ''Lulu Mae Johnson'' at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson arrived in the Yukon in 1899 or 1900, probably from Alabama. She may have arrived with a dance troupe&lt;ref name=dicbio /&gt; or with a trumpet player.&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p-0r30o8x-MC&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;ots=SK_LYDRwS_&amp;dq=Murray%20Eads%20yukon&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Murray%20Eads%20yukon&amp;f=false Morgan, Lael, "Good Time Girls of the Alaska-Yukon Gold Rush"]&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson married her employer, [[Murray S. Eads]], in 1904 and went on to manage his dance-hall, the Flora Dora.&lt;ref name=nugget&gt;[http://www.hougengroup.com/yukonhistory/nuggets_year/2000s.aspx?nugget=1918 Who was Dan McGrew? A CKRW Yukon Nugget by Les McLaughlin]&lt;/ref&gt; Although she was once charged with "allowing women of loose, idle or suspicious character on the premises for the purpose of keeping company with men" she and her husband were well respected in Dawson City.&lt;ref name=nugget /&gt;

In 1918 the couple left Dawson City. They sold their business and traveled south.&lt;ref name=nugget /&gt; Both Lulu Mae and Murray Eads died on their journey when the ''[[SS Princess Sophia]]'' sank, killing all aboard.

[[File:Paul Gauguin - D'ou venons-nous.jpg|thumb|380px|''[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?]]'', one of [[Post-Impressionist]] [[Paul Gauguin]]'s most famous paintings]]

The '''meaning of life''', or the '''answer to the question "What is the meaning of life?"''', pertains to the [[intrinsic value (ethics)|significance]] of [[Life|living]] or [[existence]] in general. Many other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much [[philosophical]], [[scientific]], [[theological]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. 

The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about [[existence]], [[social ties]], [[consciousness]], and [[happiness]].  Many other issues are also involved, such as [[linguistic meaning|symbolic meaning]], [[ontology]], [[value (philosophy)|value]], [[Teleology|purpose]], [[ethics]], [[good and evil]], [[free will]], the [[Existence of God|existence of one or multiple gods]], [[conceptions of God]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the [[afterlife]]. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]]s about the [[universe]], exploring the context and parameters concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the [[positive psychology|pursuit of well-being]] and a related [[science of morality|conception of morality]]. An alternative, [[humanistic]] approach poses the question, "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"

These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from [[scientific]] theories, to [[philosophical]], [[theological]], and [[spirituality|spiritual]] explanations.

==Scientific inquiry and perspectives==
{{Further information|Eudaimonia#Eudaimonia and modern psychology|Meaningful Life}}
&lt;!--Please do not include single-scientific-theory specific entries in this section. Thank you.--&gt;

Many members of the [[scientific community]] and [[philosophy of science]] communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] to [[Terror management theory|death anxiety]]. Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various   aspects of [[life]] and [[reality]], such as the [[Big Bang]], [[Abiogenesis|the origin of life]], and [[evolution]], and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness.

===Psychological significance and value in life===
Researchers in [[positive psychology]] study empirical factors that lead to life satisfaction,&lt;ref&gt;E. Diener, J.J. Sapyta, E. Suh (1998). "Subjective Well-Being Is Essential to Well-Being." ''Psychological Inquiry'', Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; full [[flow (psychology)|engagement]] in activities,&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"&gt;Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. {{ISBN|0060920432}}.&lt;/ref&gt; making a fuller contribution by utilizing one's personal strengths,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Christopher; Seligman, Martin (2004). ''Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195167015}}. {{cite web |title=See brief summary |url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/psychology-research/list-of-personal-strengths.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meaning based on investing in something larger than the self.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2002). ''Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment.'' New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0743222970}} (Paperback edition, 2004, Free Press, {{ISBN|0743222989}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-data studies of [[flow (psychology)|flow]] experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks, and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task.  For example, flow experiences can be obtained by prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires.  A classic example&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"/&gt; is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory.  One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast she can make each unit, and achieves flow in the process.

[[Neuroscience]] describes [[reward system|reward]], [[pleasure]], and [[motivation]] in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the [[limbic system]] and the [[ventral tegmental area]] in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a [[science of morality]]—the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.

[[Experimental philosophy]] and [[neuroethics]] research collects data about human ethical decisions in controlled scenarios such as [[trolley problems]].  It has shown that many types of ethical judgment are universal across cultures, suggesting that they may be innate, whilst others are culture specific.  The findings show actual human ethical reasoning to be at odds with most logical philosophical theories, for example consistently showing distinctions between action by cause and action by omission which would be absent from utility based theories.   Cognitive science has theorized about differences between conservative and liberal ethics and how they may be based on different metaphors from family life such as strong fathers vs nurturing mother models.

[[Neurotheology]] is a controversial field which tries to find neural correlates and mechanisms of religious experience.  Some researchers have suggested that the human brain has innate mechanisms for such experiences and that living without using them for their evolved purposes may be a cause of imbalance.  Studies have reported conflicted results on correlating happiness with religious belief and it is difficult to find unbiased meta-analyses.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Sociology]] examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as [[Value theory#Sociology|value theory]], norms, [[anomie]], etc.   One value system suggested by [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychologists]], broadly called [[Terror Management Theory]], states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.

Emerging research shows that meaning in life predicts better physical health outcomes. Greater meaning has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boyle PA, Buchman AS, Barnes LL, Bennett DA. Effect of a purpose in life on risk of incident Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older persons. Archives of General Psychiatry. 2010;67:304–310.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced risk of heart attack among individuals with coronary heart disease,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kim E, Sun J, Park N, Kubzansky L, Peterson C. Purpose in life and reduced risk of myocardial infarction among older US adults with coronary heart disease: A two-year follow-up. Journal of Behavioral Medicine. (2):124–133.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced risk of stroke,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kim ES, Sun JK, Park N, Peterson C. Purpose in life and reduced incidence of stroke in older adults: The Health and Retirement Study. Journal of Psychosomatic Research. 2013;74(5):427–432.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased longevity in both American and Japanese samples.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle PA, Barnes LL, Buchman AS, Bennett DA. Purpose in life is associated with mortality among community-dwelling older persons. Psychosomatic Medicine. 2009;71:574–579.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the British [[National Health Service]] began recommending a five step plan for mental well-being based on meaningful lives, whose steps are:  (1) Connect with community and family; (2) Physical exercise; (3) Lifelong learning; (4) Giving to others; (5) [[Mindfulness]] of the world around you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/improve-mental-wellbeing.aspx|title=Five steps to mental wellbeing|work=www.nhs.uk|date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin and nature of biological life===
[[File:DNA Overview.png|thumb|left|[[DNA]], the molecule containing the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all known [[life|living organisms]].]]
The exact mechanisms of [[abiogenesis]] are unknown: notable hypotheses include the [[RNA world hypothesis]] (RNA-based replicators) and the [[iron-sulfur world hypothesis]] (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] is explained by [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, based upon insight gleaned from the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], biologists [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], [[Richard Dawkins]], and [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes.&lt;ref name="Dawkins selfish gene"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1976 |isbn=978-0198575191|title-link=The Selfish Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins river"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=River out of Eden |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |date=1995 |isbn=978-0465069903|title-link=River out of Eden }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has not achieved universal agreement; [[Jeremy Griffith]] is a notable exception, maintaining that the meaning of life is to be integrative.&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffith J. |year=2012 |chapter=What is the Meaning of Life? |title=The Book of Real Answers to Everything! |isbn=978-1741290073 |chapter-url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-life/ |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to an interview question from Richard Dawkins about "what it is all for", [[James Watson]] stated "I don't think we're ''for'' anything. We're just the products of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The God Delusion|last = Dawkins|first = Richard|publisher = Houghton Mifflin|date = 2006|isbn = 978-0618680009|location = |pages = 99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though scientists have intensively studied [[organism|life on Earth]], defining [[life]] in unequivocal terms is still a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |title=Complete Archive for Astrobiology Press Release, News Exclusive, News Briefs |work=Astrobiology Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013130816/http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |archivedate=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/97e.defLife.v3f.html|title=Defining Life, Explaining Emergence|work=nbi.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, one may say that life "feeds on [[negentropy|negative entropy]]"&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1944 |isbn=978-0521427081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0520220218}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal [[entropy]] at the expense of some form of [[energy]] taken in from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia – a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0192862181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |date=2003 |isbn=978-9812383990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are [[self-organization|self-organizing]] systems [[homeostasis|which regulate their internal environments as to maintain this organized state]], [[metabolism]] serves to provide energy, and [[reproduction]] causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |title=How to Define Life |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Davison |first=Paul G. |publisher=The University of North  Alabama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101024755/http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |archivedate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-cellular replicating agents, notably [[virus]]es, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some [[parasite]]s and [[endosymbiont]]s are also incapable of independent life. [[Astrobiology]] studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.

===Origins and ultimate fate of the universe===

Though the [[Big Bang]] theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Helge Kragh |title=Cosmology and Controversy |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current physics can only describe the early universe from 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of [[quantum gravity]] would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being.&lt;ref name="Prantzos &amp; Lyle"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Nikos Prantzos |author2=Stephen Lyle |title= Our Cosmic Future: Humanity's Fate in the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0521770989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the [[anthropic principle]], it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rem B. Edwards |title=What Caused the Big Bang? |publisher=Rodopi |date=2001 |isbn=978-9042014077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a [[Big Freeze]], [[Big Rip]], or [[Big Crunch]].

Theoretical [[cosmology]] studies many alternative speculative models for the origin and fate of the universe beyond the big bang theory.   A recent trend has been models of the creation of 'baby universes' inside [[black holes]], with our own [[big bang]] being a [[white hole]] on the inside of a [[black hole]] in another parent universe.&lt;ref name="Poplawski"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Radial motion into an Einstein-Rosen bridge, Physics Letters B | first=Nikodem J. |last=Poplawski |volume=687 | date=April 2010 |pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Multiverse]] theories claim that every possibility of [[quantum mechanics]] is played out in parallel universes.

===Scientific questions about the mind===
The nature and origin of [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] itself are also widely debated in science. The [[explanatory gap]] is generally equated with the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and the question of [[free will]] is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]] (e.g. the [[neuroscience of free will]]) and  [[philosophy of mind]], though some [[evolutionary biologist]]s and [[theoretical physicist]]s have also made several allusions to the subject.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Harvey Whitehouse |title=The Debated Mind: Evolutionary Psychology Versus Ethnography |publisher=Berg Publishers |date=2001 |isbn=978-1859734278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jeffrey Alan Gray |authorlink= Jeffrey Alan Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping Up on the Hard Problem |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0198520900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|thumb|[[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' depicts a tunnel of light and spiritual figures, often described in reports of [[near-death experience]]s.]]
[[Reductionistic]] and [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialistic]] approaches, for example the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the [[Human brain|brain]] and its [[neuron]]s, thus adhering to [[biological naturalism]].&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchland"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul M. Churchland |authorlink=Paul Churchland |title=A Neurocomputational Perspective: The Nature of Mind and the Structure of Science |publisher=MIT Press |date=1989 |isbn=978-0262531061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daniel Clement Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Consciousness Explained |publisher=Little, Brown and Co. |date=1991 |isbn=978-0316180665|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some scientists, like [[Andrei Linde]], have considered that [[consciousness]], like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.&lt;ref name="Barrow, Davies, Harper"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=John D.

Explaining the process of [[free will]] through [[quantum]] phenomena is a popular alternative to [[determinism]].

==== Parapsychology ====

Based on the premises of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a [[cosmic consciousness]], asserting that consciousness is actually the "ground of all being".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alexandra Bruce |title=Beyond the Bleep: The Definitive Unauthorized Guide to What the Bleep Do We Know!? |publisher=The Disinformation Company |date=2005 |isbn=978-1932857221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mae-Wan Ho |authorlink=Mae-Wan Ho |title=The Rainbow and the Worm: The Physics of Organisms |publisher=World Scientific |date=1998 |pages= 218–231 |isbn=978-9810234270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view cite accounts of [[paranormal]] phenomena, primarily [[extrasensory perception]]s and [[psychic]] powers, as evidence for an [[incorporeal]] [[higher consciousness]].

=== Nature of meaning in life ===

The most common{{quantify|date=May 2018}} definitions of meaning in life involve three components.{{cn|date=May 2018}} First, Reker and [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] define personal meaning as the "cognizance of order, coherence and purpose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment" (p.&amp;nbsp;221).&lt;ref&gt;Reker, G.T., &amp; Wong, P.T.P. (1988). Aging as an individual process: Towards a theory of personal meaning. In J.E. Birren, &amp; V.L. Bengston (Eds.), ''Emergent theories of aging'' (pp. 214-246). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Martela and Steger defined meaning as coherence, purpose, and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Martela, F., &amp; Steger, M.F. (2016). The three meanings of meaning in life: Distinguishing coherence, purpose, and significance. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology, 11''(5), 531-545.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] has proposed a four-component solution to the question of meaning in life,&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2011). Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life. ''Canadian Psychology, 52''(2), 69-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2012). From logotherapy to meaning-centered counseling and therapy. In P.T.P. Wong (Ed.), ''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications'' (2nd ed., pp. 619-647). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; with the four components purpose, understanding, responsibility, and enjoyment (PURE):

# You need to choose a worthy ''purpose'' or a significant life goal.
# You need to have sufficient ''understanding'' of who you are, what life demands of you, and how you can play a significant role in life.
# You and you alone are ''responsible'' for deciding what kind of life you want to live, and what constitutes a significant and worthwhile life goal. 
# You will ''enjoy'' a deep sense of significance and satisfaction only when you have exercised your responsibility for self-determination and actively pursue a worthy life-goal.
Thus, a sense of significance permeates every dimension of meaning, rather than stands as a separate factor.

Although most psychology researchers consider meaning in life as a subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Meaning in life|last= Metz|first= Thaddeus|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2013|isbn= 978-0199599318|location= Oxford|pages= |via= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal-striving and life as a whole is meaningful according to some objective [[Normative ethics| normative standard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Western philosophical perspectives==
The philosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato and Aristotle in ''[[The School of Athens]]'' fresco, by [[Raphael]]. Plato is pointing heavenwards to the sky, and Aristotle is gesturing to the world.]]

====Platonism====
{{Main article|Platonism}}
[[Plato]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers. His reputation comes from his [[philosophical idealism|idealism]] of believing in the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. His [[Theory of Forms]] proposes that universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the [[dialogue]] of ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', the character of [[Socrates]] describes the [[Form of the Good]]. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant to the question of the meaning of life.

In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the [[Platonic idealism|Idea]] ([[Platonic realism|Form]]) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.

====Aristotelianism====
{{Main article|Aristotelian ethics}}
[[Aristotle]], an apprentice of [[Plato]], was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge (such as [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]), but is ''general'' knowledge. Because it is not a [[theoretical]] discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become "good"; thus if the person were to become [[virtuous]], he could not simply study what virtue ''is'', he had to ''be'' virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous:
{{quote|Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor [...]&lt;br&gt;Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is "good".|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.1}}

Yet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B also would have a goal, goal C, and goal C also would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern, until something stopped its [[infinite regression]]. Aristotle's solution is the ''[[Summum bonum|Highest Good]]'', which is desirable for its own sake. It is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other "goods" desirable for its sake. This involves achieving ''[[eudaemonia]]'', usually translated as "happiness", "well-being", "flourishing", and "excellence".
{{quote|What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.4}}

====Cynicism====
{{Main article|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], first outlined the themes of Cynicism, stating that the purpose of life is living a life of [[Virtue]] which agrees with [[Nature]]. Happiness depends upon being self-sufficient and master of one's mental attitude; suffering is the consequence of false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]] and a concomitant vicious character.

The Cynical life rejects conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[power (sociology)|power]], [[health]], and [[celebrity|fame]], by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, I., "''Cynicism''," in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy.'' (ed. [[J.O. Urmson]] and [[Jonathan Rée]]), Routledge. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.A., "''The Socratic Tradition: Diogenes, Crates, and Hellenistic Ethics,''" in ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy.'' (ed. Branham and Goulet-Cazé), University of California Press, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to [[human]] beings. The [[world]] equally belongs to everyone, so [[suffering]] is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the [[tradition|customs]] and [[convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[society]].

====Cyrenaicism====
{{Main article|Cyrenaics}}
[[Aristippus of Cyrene]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], founded an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings—that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a [[hedonistic]] world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedonism.org|title=The Future Of Hardcore Hedonism|work=hedonism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epicureanism====
{{Main article|Epicureanism}}

[[Epicurus]], a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear ([[ataraxia]]) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain ([[aponia]]) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi-ascetic "abstention" from sex and the appetites:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;[[Epicurus]], "Letter to Menoeceus", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no [[afterlife]], yet, one need not fear death, because "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."&lt;ref name="Russel"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1946). ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|A History of Western Philosophy]]'', New York: Simon and Schuster; London: George Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoicism====
{{Main page|Stoicism}}
[[Zeno of Citium]], a pupil of [[Crates of Thebes]], established the school which teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal ''[[logos]]'', or reason, an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is "freedom from [[suffering]]" through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Gr: απαθεια), that is, being [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and having "clear judgement", ''not'' indifference.

Stoicism's prime directives are [[virtue]], [[reason]], and [[natural law]], abided to develop personal self-control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgement and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration.

The Stoic ethical foundation is that "good lies in the state of the soul", itself, exemplified in [[wisdom]] and self-control, thus improving one's spiritual well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' which is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt; The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy".&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;

===Enlightenment philosophy===
{{Further information|Enlightenment philosophy}}
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[colonialism|colonial era]] both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.

====Classical liberalism====
[[Classical liberalism]] is a set of ideas that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural [[individual rights|rights]] (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers [[individualism|individual]] [[liberty]] to be the most important goal,&lt;ref&gt;A: "'Liberalism' is defined as a social ethic that advocates liberty, and equality in general." —[[C.A.J. (Tony) Coady]] ''Distributive Justice'', A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p.440. B: "Liberty is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political end."  —[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]&lt;/ref&gt; because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.

There are many forms and derivations of liberalism, but their central conceptions of the meaning of life trace back to three main ideas. Early thinkers such as [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]] saw humankind beginning in the [[state of nature]], then finding meaning for existence through labor and property, and using [[social contracts]] to create an environment that supports those efforts.

====Kantianism====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].]]

[[Kantianism]] is a philosophy based on the [[ethical]], [[epistemological]], and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant is known for his [[Deontology|deontological]] theory where there is a single moral obligation, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]", derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative.

Simply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if it would still be possible to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a [[moral universalism|universal action]], no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).

Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

===19th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|19th-century philosophy}}

====Utilitarianism====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]

The origins of [[utilitarianism]] can be traced back as far as [[Epicurus]], but, as a school of thought, it is credited to [[Jeremy Bentham]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Frederick (2003). ''Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill''. Routledge, p. 28. {{ISBN|0415220947}} "It was Hume and Bentham who then reasserted most strongly the Epicurean doctrine concerning utility as the basis of justice."&lt;/ref&gt; who found that "nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure", then, from that moral insight, deriving the ''Rule of Utility'': "that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people". He defined the meaning of life as the "[[greatest happiness principle]]".

[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s foremost proponent was [[James Mill]], a significant philosopher in his day, and father of [[John Stuart Mill]]. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;Mill, John Stuart. ''On Liberty'', ed. Himmelfarb. Penguin Classics, 1974, Ed.'s introduction, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nihilism====
[[Nihilism]] suggests that life is without objective meaning.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of "the devaluing of the highest values".&lt;ref name="Bindé"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jérôme Bindé |title=The Future Of Values: 21st-Century Talks |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2004 |isbn=978-1571814425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that [[God is dead]], and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Reginster"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bernard Reginster |title=The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2006 |isbn=978-0674021990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Martin - The Great Day of His Wrath - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The End of the World (painting)|The End of the World]]'', by John Martin.]]
To [[Martin Heidegger]], nihilism is the movement whereby "[[being]]" is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value.&lt;ref name="Bindé"/&gt; Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so-called "[[God is dead|death of God]]" a potential source for nihilism:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;If God, as the supra-sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra-sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up-building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche," 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

The French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] asserts that the [[absurdity]] of the [[human condition]] is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none, and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value-nihilists such as [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|Meursault]],&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1946) ''L'Etranger''&lt;/ref&gt; but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be "heroic nihilists", living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with "secular saintliness", fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1955) ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|20th-century philosophy}}
The current era has seen radical changes in both formal and popular conceptions of human nature. The knowledge disclosed by modern science has effectively rewritten the relationship of humankind to the natural world. Advances in medicine and technology have freed humans from significant limitations and ailments of previous eras;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [[hygiene]], [[antibiotic]] and [[vaccination]].&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy—particularly following the [[linguistic turn]]—has altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other are conceived.  Questions about the meaning of life have also seen radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in [[#Pragmatism|pragmatism]] and [[#Logical positivism|logical positivism]]) to efforts to meta-theorize about [[meaning-making]] as a personal, individual-driven activity ([[#Existentialism|existentialism]], [[#Secular humanism|secular humanism]]).

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] originated in the late-19th-century US, concerning itself (mostly) with [[truth]], and positing that "only in struggling with the environment" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that ''consequences'', like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that ''anything'' useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be ''practically verifiable'', i.e. one should be able to predict and test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of humankind should guide human intellectual inquiry.

Pragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. [[William James]] argued that truth could be made, but not sought.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{Cite book |author=William James |authorlink=William James |title=The Meaning of Truth |publisher=Prometheus Books |date=1909 |isbn=978-1573921381}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corti"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walter Robert Corti |title=The Philosophy of William James |publisher=Meiner Verlag |date=1976 |isbn=978-3787303526}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience.

====Theism====
{{Main article|Philosophical theism}}
Theists believe God created the universe and that God had a purpose in doing so. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating.  Theists further hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value and purpose, then life would be absurd.&lt;ref name = "Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life"&gt;[http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~morourke/446-phil/05%20Spring/Handouts/Philosophical/Theistic%20Perspectives-MOL.htm Philosophy 446: Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life].

====Existentialism====
{{Main article|Meaning (existential)}}
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'', a representation of [[existential angst]].]]
According to existentialism, each man and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are ''action'', ''freedom'', and ''decision'', thus, existentialism opposes [[rationalism]] and [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]]. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]], felt in considering one's [[free will]], and the concomitant awareness of death. According to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[existence precedes essence]]; the ([[essence]]) of one's life arises ''only'' after one comes to [[existence]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] spoke about a "[[q:Søren Kierkegaard#Misattributed|leap]]", arguing that [[absurdism|life is full of absurdity]], and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite, and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Amy Laura Hall |title=Kierkegaard and the Treachery of Love |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0521893114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] answered: "What is the meaning of life?" by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref name="Jacquette"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dale Jacquette |title=Schopenhauer, Philosophy, and the Arts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0521473880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Durno Murray |title=Nietzsche's Affirmative Morality |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |date=1999 |isbn=978-3110166019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, [[perspectivism|all ideations take place from a particular perspective]].&lt;ref name="Reginster"/&gt;

====Absurdism====
{{Main article|Absurdism}}
{{Quote box |quote="''... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment. For to hope in the possibility of help, not to speak of help by virtue of the absurd, that for God all things are possible—no, that he will not do. And as for seeking help from any other—no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek help he would prefer to be himself—with all the tortures of hell, if so it must be.''" |source=[[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''&lt;ref name="KierkegaardSuD"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=1941|isbn=978-1448675029}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942):
* [[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option.
* [[Religious]] belief in a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] realm or being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution as "philosophical suicide".
* Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts and even embraces the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution (notably in his 1947 allegorical novel ''The Plague'' or ''La Peste''), while Kierkegaard regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |title=The Sickness Unto Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1941 |isbn=978-1448675029}}, Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secular humanism====

Per [[secular humanism]], the [[Human|human species]] came to be by reproducing successive generations in a progression of [[Evolution|unguided evolution]] as an integral expression of [[nature]], which is self-existing.&lt;ref name="humanifesto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto I |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |work=American Humanist Association |date=1933 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730070437/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |archivedate=30 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanifesto2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanist Manifesto II |work=American Humanist Association |date=1973 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809102124/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human knowledge comes from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the [[scientific method]]), and not from supernatural sources; the nature of the [[universe]] is what people discern it to be.&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; Likewise, "[[intrinsic value (ethics)|values]] and realities" are determined "by means of intelligent inquiry"&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; and "are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience", that is, by [[critical thinking|critical intelligence]].&lt;ref name="humanifesto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto III |work=American Humanist Association |date=2003 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809103515/http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |archivedate=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDSH"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Secular Humanist Declaration |work=Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (now the Council for Secular Humanism) |date=1980 |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=main&amp;page=declaration |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As far as we know, the total personality is [a function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context."&lt;ref name=humanifesto2/&gt;

People determine human purpose without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life. [[Secular humanism|Humanism]] seeks to develop and fulfill:&lt;ref name= humanifesto1/&gt; "Humanism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity".&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt; Humanism aims to promote [[enlightened self-interest]] and the [[common good]] for all people. It is based on the premises that the [[happiness]] of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well-being of all humanity, in part because humans are social animals who find meaning in [[interpersonal relationship|personal relations]] and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the [[culture]].&lt;ref name= humanifesto2/&gt;&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt;

The philosophical subgenres [[posthumanism]] and [[transhumanism]] (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of [[human race|humanity]] and of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]] to the greatest degree feasible and seek to reconcile [[Renaissance humanism]] with the 21st century's [[technoscientific]] culture. In this light, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social "meaning of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Bostrom |title=Transhumanist Values |work=[[Oxford University]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/values.html |accessdate=2007-07-28 |authorlink=Nick Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Secular humanism|humanism]]-psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Yalom, ''Existential Psychotherapy'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question.  For example, [[Viktor Frankl]] argues for "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as "What delusions am I under?"; "What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?"; "Why do I neglect loved-ones?".) ''See also: [[Existential Therapy]] and [[Irvin Yalom]]''

====Logical positivism====
[[Logical positivists]] ask: "What is the meaning of life?", "What is the meaning in asking?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Taylor |authorlink=Richard Taylor (philosopher) |title=Good and Evil |chapter= Chapter 5: The Meaning of Life |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |year=1970 |isbn=978-0026166904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohlgennant, Rudolph. (1981). "Has the Question about the Meaning of Life any Meaning?" (Chapter 4). In E. Morscher, ed., ''Philosophie als Wissenschaft''.&lt;/ref&gt; and "If there are no objective values, then, is life meaningless?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McNaughton |first=David |date=August 1988 |title=Moral Vision: An Introduction to Ethics |chapter=Section 1.5: Moral Freedom and the Meaning of Life |publisher=Oxford: Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0631159452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[logical positivists]] said:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} "Expressed in language, the question is meaningless"; because, ''in'' life the statement the "meaning of x", usually denotes the ''consequences'' of x, or the ''significance'' of x, or ''what is notable'' about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life concept equals "x", in the statement the "meaning of x", the statement becomes [[recursion|recursive]], and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in life.

The things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only ''in'' life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this:&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is "the Good," we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case—or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to "values"—that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects—lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to "values" lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1961). [http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html ''Science and Ethics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114144956/http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Postmodernism====
{{Further information|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernist thought—broadly speaking—sees human nature as constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing ''given'' meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a "meaning of life", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see [[awareness]] of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in [[deconstructionism]]) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in [[poststructuralism]]).

====Naturalistic pantheism====
According to [[naturalistic pantheism]], the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment.

====Embodied cognition====
[[Embodied cognition]] uses the neurological basis of emotion, speech, and cognition to understand the nature of thought. [[Cognitive neuropsychology]] has identified brain areas necessary for these abilities, and genetic studies show that the gene [[FOXP2]] affects neuroplasticity which underlies language fluency. 
[[George Lakoff]], a professor of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use [[logic programming]] to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained [[biological neural network]]. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.

===Mohism===
{{further information|Mohism}}
The Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial [[love]]. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring—a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name="philosophers"&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

===Confucianism===
{{further information|Confucianism}}
[[Confucianism]] recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because humankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar [[Tu Wei-Ming]]'s quote, "we can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Wei-Ming. ''Confucian Thought: Selfhood as Creative Transformation.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalism===
{{further information|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
The Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state.

==Religious perspectives==
The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the [[Charter for Compassion]] signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the [[golden rule]] of `treat others as you would have them treat you'.  The Charter's founder, [[Karen Armstrong]], quotes the ancient Rabbi [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] who suggested that `the rest is commentary'.   This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation and ritual are the means by which religious people [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] and  live the golden rule.
&lt;!--Note: the following two commented sections were commented out when I re-classified the sections. It is preserved here in case someone can make use of it later--&gt;
&lt;!--The rise of [[universal religion]]s marks a shift from concerns about personal potential and relationships to the natural world, to a focus on more profound forms of devotion and all-inclusive salvation.  In the Christian, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, this manifested as subjection to God: salvation was not a personal achievement, but rather a token of God's grace to be earned by the devout. Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism, likewise, moved from their primary focus on individual liberation to more abstract ideals of liberation for all. In all, this era magnified and generalized ideals of love, compassion, and relief of human suffering that had little or no place in earlier philosophy.--&gt;
&lt;!--Prior to the expansion of the major [[universal religion]]s—from the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE to the 6th century CE, depending on the faith—the meaning of life was investigated in terms of human potential and the relationship of individuals to the natural world. Devotion to a god or gods was an important aspect of some traditions, but was generally viewed in terms of personal development (as in the [[#Hindu views|Hindu]] relationship between ''atman'' and ''brahman'', or as a social relationship, as in the [[#jewish view|Jewish covenant]]). Other traditions relied heavily on reason, discipline, or the development of other human faculties, either as meaningful in their own right, or as tools to reach other decisions.--&gt;

====Zoroastrianism====
[[Zoroastrianism]] is the religion and philosophy named after its prophet [[Zoroaster]], which is believed to have influenced the beliefs of Judaism and its descendant religions. Zoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendental God, [[Ahura Mazda]], to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is ''[[asha]]'', truth and order, and it is in conflict with its [[antithesis]], ''druj'', falsehood and disorder. (See also [[Zoroastrian eschatology]]).

Since humanity possesses [[free will]], people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.

====Islam====
In [[Islam]], humanity's ultimate purpose is to discover their creator [[Allah]] ({{lang-en|God}}) through His signs, and be grateful to Him through sincere love and devotion. This is practically shown by following the Divine guidelines revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and the Tradition of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]. Earthly life is a test, determining one's position of closeness to [[Allah]] in the hereafter. A person will either be close to Him and His Love in ''[[Jannah]]'' (Paradise) or far away in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (Hell).

For Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets in Islam|messengers]], and in the "[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|4|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|285|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|136|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: "Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving" (Qur'an 67:1–2) and "And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah)." (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]] in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one ''acts'' (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell).&lt;ref&gt;In most English translations of Qur'an 51:56  translates the last word to "worship", but any Arabic (and Urdu) speaking person can confirm that "ABADON" means to follow the Will of Allah (NOT worship). This is relevant because the Will of Allah is not just to worship HIM; to be just and good with humanity is equally important.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, on the day of Judgement the final decision is of Allah alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iqra.net/Hadith/judgement.php The Day of Judgement].

The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: [[Shahadah]] (profession of faith); [[salat]] (ritual prayer); [[Zakah]] (charity); [[Sawm]] (fasting during [[Ramadan]]), and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pillars of Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive from the [[Hadith]] works, notably of [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]. The five pillars are not mentioned directly in the Quran.

Beliefs differ among the [[Kalam]]. The [[Sunni]] and the [[Ahmadiyya]] concept of pre-destination is [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]];&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Shi'a]] concept of pre-destination is [[Adalah|divine justice]]; in the [[esoteric]] view of the [[Sufi]]s, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize.

The Sufi view of the meaning of life stems from the [[hadith qudsi]] that states "I (God) was [[a Hidden Treasure]] and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation that I might be known."  One possible interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature, and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref name='Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."'&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahá|first=Abdu'l|title=Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan|work=Bahá'í Studies Bulletin|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn'Arabī]]'s Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam.&lt;ref name="SUMMARY OF THE FUSÛS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=The Imprint of the Bezels of the Wisdom|url=http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articlespdf/naqshalfusus.pdf|work=Ibn 'Arabi's Own Summary of the Fusûs|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |volume=Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bahaism}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Bahá'ís, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity.

====Judaism====
In the [[Judaism|Judaic]] world view, the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world ('Olam HaZeh') and prepare it for the world to come ('[[Jewish eschatology|Olam HaBa]]'), the [[Jewish messianism|messianic era]]. This is called [[Tikkun Olam]] ("Fixing the World"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is not focused on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world.

Judaism's most important feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], one, indivisible, [[God in Judaism|absolute Being]], who created and governs the universe. Closeness with the God of Israel is through study of His [[Torah]], and adherence to its [[mitzvot]] (divine laws). In traditional Judaism, God established a special [[Covenant (Israel)|covenant]] with a people, the people of Israel, at [[Mount Sinai]], giving the [[613 mitzvot|Jewish commandments]]. Torah comprises the written [[Pentateuch]] and the transcribed [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]], further developed through the generations. The Jewish people are intended as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:6&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[Light Unto the Nations|light to the Nations]]", influencing the other peoples to keep their own religio-ethical [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The messianic era is seen as the perfection of this dual path to God.

Jewish observances involve ethical and ritual, affirmative and prohibitive injunctions. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the nature, relevance and emphases of mitzvot. [[Jewish philosophy]] emphasises that God is not affected or benefited, but the individual and society benefit by drawing close to God. The rationalist [[Maimonides]] sees the ethical and ritual divine commandments as a necessary, but insufficient preparation for philosophical understanding of God, with its love and awe.&lt;ref&gt;''Maimonides' Confrontation with Mysticism'', Menachem Kellner, Littman Library; particularly the parable of the King's Palace in divine worship, in the [[Guide for the Perplexed]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among fundamental [[Jewish ethics|values]] in the Torah are pursuit of justice, compassion, peace, kindness, hard work, prosperity, humility, and education.&lt;ref name="Cohn-Sherbok"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dan Cohn-Sherbok |title=Judaism: History, Belief, and Practice |publisher=Routledge |date=2003 |isbn=978-0415236614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heschel"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Abraham Joshua Heschel |title=Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2005 |isbn=978-0826408020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world to come,&lt;ref name="Shuchat"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Wilfred Shuchat |title=The Garden of Eden &amp; the Struggle to Be Human: According to the Midrash Rabbah |publisher=Devora Publishing |date=2006 |isbn=978-1932687316}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared in the present, elevates man to an everlasting connection with God.&lt;ref name="Braham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Randolph L.

The [[Siddur|prayer book]] relates, "blessed is our God who created us for his honor...and planted within us everlasting life." Of this context, the [[Talmud]] states, "everything that God does is for the good," including suffering.

The Jewish mystical [[Kabbalah]] gives complimentary esoteric meanings of life. As well as Judaism providing an [[Divine immanence|immanent]] relationship with God (personal [[theism]]), in Kabbalah the spiritual and physical creation is a paradoxical manifestation of the immanent aspects of God's Being ([[panentheism]]), related to the [[Shekhinah]] (Divine feminine). Jewish observance unites the [[sephirot]] (Divine attributes) on high, restoring harmony to creation. In [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the meaning of life is the messianic rectification of the shattered sparks of God's persona, exiled in physical existence (the [[Kelipot]] shells), through the actions of Jewish observance.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press, chapter "Early modern era: Safed spirituality"&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, in [[Hasidic Judaism]] the ultimate essential "desire" of God is the revelation of the Omnipresent Divine essence through materiality, achieved by man from within his limited physical realm, when the body will give life to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Habad intellectual Hasidic thought: source text [[Tanya]] I: 36, 49; secondary text ''Heaven On Earth'', Faitel Levin, Kehot publications&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cristo Redentor - Rio.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue on [[Corcovado (Brazil)|Corcovado]] mountain in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is symbolic of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx The new Seven Wonders of the World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209062632/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx |date=9 February 2010 }}. Hindustan Times (2007-07-08). Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the concept of seeking [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through [[Jesus Christ]].]]

[[Christianity]] has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's [[ontology]]. Its central beliefs derive from the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as presented in the [[New Testament]]. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] through the grace of God and intercession of Christ ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11:26). The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's [[Atonement in Christianity|sins are forgiven]] (John 3:16–21; 2 Peter 3:9).

In the Christian view, humankind was made in the [[Image of God]] and perfect, but the [[Fall of Man]] caused the progeny of the [[Adam and Eve|first Parents]] to inherit [[Original Sin]] and its consequences. Christ's [[Passion of Jesus|passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] provide the means for transcending that impure state ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23). The good news that this restoration from sin is now possible is called the [[gospel]]. The specific process of appropriating salvation through Christ and maintaining a relationship with God varies between different [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] of Christians, but all rely on faith in Christ and the gospel as the fundamental starting point. Salvation through faith in God is found in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:8–9 – "&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;not as a result of works, that no one should boast" ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]; 1973). The gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, thereby allowing God to [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerate]] (change) the believer and instill in them a new heart after God's own will with the ability to live righteously before him. This is what the terms ''[[Born again]]'' or ''saved'' almost always refer to.

In the ''[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]'', the first question is: "What is the chief end of Man?" (that is, "What is Man's main purpose?"). The answer is: "Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever". God requires one to obey the revealed moral law, saying: "love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself".&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Westminster Shorter Catechism |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000717/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |archive-date=11 March 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Baltimore Catechism]]'' answers the question "Why did God make you?" by saying "God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Baltimore Catechism |url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/balt/balt1.htm |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apostle Paul also answers this question in his speech on the [[Areopagus]] in [[Athens]]: "And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bible]], [[Acts]] 17:26–27, [[NKJV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholicism]]'s way of thinking is better expressed through the Principle and Foundation of [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]]: "The human person is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord, and by doing so, to save his or her soul. All other things on the face of the earth are created for human beings in order to help them pursue the end for which they are created. It follows from this that one must use other created things, in so far as they help towards one's end, and free oneself from them, in so far as they are obstacles to one's end. To do this, we need to make ourselves indifferent to all created things, provided the matter is subject to our free choice and there is no other prohibition. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we should not want health more than illness, wealth more than poverty, fame more than disgrace, a long life more than a short one, and similarly for all the rest, but we should desire and choose only what helps us more towards the end for which we are created."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/prs/stign/ignatian_spirit.html St. Ignatius | Ignatian Spirituality].

[[Mormonism]] teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience and to have joy.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles|title=Gospel Principles|website=Lds.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"/&gt; The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise; rather, the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11#10 2 Nephi 2:11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.55#54 Moses 6:55].&lt;/ref&gt; Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138|title=Doctrine and Covenants 138|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.

A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|date=2012|url=http://christianhumanism.webs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  nonetheless, the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the [[Propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] of Jesus' death on the cross.

[[Hinduism]] is a religious category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time, before there was a need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive and tolerant in content.&lt;ref name="weightman"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Simon Weightman |date=1998 |title=The new Penguin handbook of living religions |editor=Hinnells, John |publisher=[[Penguin books]] |chapter=Hinduism |isbn=978-0140514803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most believe that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (spirit, soul)—the person's true ''self''—is eternal.&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Monier Monier-Williams |authorlink=Monier Monier-Williams |date=1974 |title=Brahmanism and Hinduism: Or, Religious Thought and Life in India, as Based on the Veda and Other Sacred Books of the Hindus |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5IBXA4UpT0C&amp;dq=isbn=1421265311 |accessdate= 2007-07-08 |series=Elibron Classics |isbn=978-1421265315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the ''[[purusharthas]]'' (ordered from least to greatest): (i)''[[Kāma]]'' (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii)''[[Artha]]'' (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii)''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness, duty, morality, [[virtue]], [[ethics]]), encompassing notions such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and [[satya]] (truth) and (iv)''[[Moksha]]'' (liberation, i.e. liberation from [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of [[reincarnation]]).&lt;ref&gt;For dharma, artha, and kama as "brahmanic householder values" see: Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Dharma Śāstras'' as discussing the "four main goals of life" (dharma, artha, {{IAST|kāma}}, and moksha) see: Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of the term पुरुष-अर्थ ({{IAST|puruṣa-artha}}) as "any of the four principal objects of human life, i.e. {{lang|sa|धर्म}}, {{lang|sa|अर्थ}}, {{lang|sa|काम}}, and {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}}" see: Apte, p. 626, middle column, compound #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of [[karma]] (causal action), [[sansara]] (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and [[moksha]] (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the ātman (similar to the western concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader [[yoga]]s (practices) or [[dharma]] (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which are manifestations of [[Ishvara]] (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.

In short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself.  This thought is conveyed in the [[Mahāvākyas]] ("[[Tat Tvam Asi]]" (thou art that),  "Aham Brahmāsmi", "Prajñānam Brahma" and "Ayam Ātmā Brahma" (the soul and the world are one)).

=====Advaita and Dvaita Hinduism=====
{{Further information|Advaita Vedanta|Dvaita Vedanta}}
Later schools reinterpreted the [[vedas]] to focus on [[Brahman]], "The One Without a Second",&lt;ref name="bhaskaranandaessential"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bhaskarananda |first=Swami |date=1994 |title=The Essentials of Hinduism: a comprehensive overview of the world's oldest religion |place=Seattle, WA |publisher=Viveka Press |isbn=978-1884852022}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a central God-like figure.

In [[monist]] Advaita Vedanta, ātman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (soul) is identical to [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vivekananda |first=Swami |authorlink=Swami Vivekananda |date=1987 |title=Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda |place=Calcutta |publisher=Advaita Ashrama |isbn=978-8185301754}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Upanishads]], whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom).&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Werner |first=Karel |date=1994 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism |place=Richmond, Surrey |editor=Hinnells, John (Ed.) |publisher=Curzon Press |chapter=Hinduism |isbn= 978-0700702794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the Vedic statement "ayam ātmā brahma" (This [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] is [[Brahman]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvaita Vedanta and other [[bhakti]] schools have a [[Theistic dualism|dualist]] interpretation. [[Brahman]] is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The ātman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through love of God and upon His grace.&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt;

=====Vaishnavism=====
[[Vaishnavism]] is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]] as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the [[Krishnaism|Krishna-centered]] traditions, such as [[Vallabha]], [[Nimbaraka]] and [[Gaudiya]], in which [[Krishna]] is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the [[Svayam Bhagavan|source of all avataras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as [[monotheism]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]], and the various [[Yoga]] systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Vishnu through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]], often including singing Vishnu's name's ([[bhajan]]), meditating upon his form ([[dharana]]) and performing [[deity]] worship ([[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as [[Pañcaratra]] and various [[Samhita (disambiguation)|Samhita]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html Tantric Literature And Gaudiya Vaishnavism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061446/http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html |date=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular school of thought, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], teaches the concept of [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna.

====Jainism====

{{Further information|Jainism|Jain philosophy}}

[[Jainism]] is a religion originating in [[Iron Age India|ancient India]], its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else. Through following the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Tirthankara|Jina]], a [[human]] achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|enlightenment (perfect knowledge)]]. Jainism divides the universe into living and non-living beings. Only when the living become attached to the non-living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self-conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Natubhai. ''Jainism: The World of Conquerors.'' Sussex Academic Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], ''[[jiva]]''. Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksha]]. The [[Karma in Jainism|Jain view of karma]] is that every action, every word, every thought produces, besides its visible, an invisible, transcendental effect on the soul.

Jainism includes strict adherence to [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (or ''ahinsā''), a form of [[nonviolence]] that goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to [[veganism]] due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude [[root vegetable]]s from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retoday.org.uk/pdfs/dre/viren.pdf |title=Viren, Jain |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher= RE Today|format=PDF}}, [http://www.retoday.org.uk/ RE Today] &lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====

===== Earlier Buddhism =====
Buddhists practice to embrace with mindfulness the ill-being (suffering) and well-being that is present in life. Buddhists practice to see the causes of ill-being and well-being in life. For example, one of the causes of suffering is unhealthy attachment to objects material or non-material. The Buddhist [[sūtras]] and [[tantras]] do not speak about "the meaning of life" or "the purpose of life", but about the potential of human life to end suffering, for example through embracing (not suppressing or denying) cravings and conceptual attachments. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means freedom from both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Four Noble Truths |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |publisher=Thebigview.com |accessdate=2009-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|left|The eight-spoked [[Dharmachakra]]]]
[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] is generally considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]), literally "Teaching of Analysis", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the [[Four Noble Truths]]. This is attained in the achievement of [[Nirvana]], or Unbinding which also ends the [[reincarnation|repeated cycle]] of birth, old age, sickness and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

=====Mahayana Buddhism=====
{{Further information|Mahayana}}
Mahayana Buddhist schools de-emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in [[Theravada]]) of the release from individual Suffering ([[Dukkha]]) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, [[omnipresent]] being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent [[Buddha-nature]], which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, such as [[zen|Chan/Zen]] and the [[vajrayana]] Tibetan and Shingon schools, explicitly teach that [[bodhisattva]]s should refrain from full liberation, allowing themselves to be reincarnated into the world until all beings achieve enlightenment. Devotional schools such as [[Pure Land]] Buddhism seek the aid of celestial buddhas—individuals who have spent lifetimes{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all.

====Sikhism====
[[File:Khanda.svg|thumb|The [[Khanda (religious symbol)|Khanda]], an important symbol of [[Sikhism]].]]

The monotheistic [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion was founded by [[Guru Nanak Dev]], the term "Sikh" means student, which denotes that followers will lead their lives forever learning. This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally "the counsel of the gurus") or the Sikh Dharma. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the ''[[Gurū Granth Sāhib]]'', which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds.

The Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: "The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him."&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daljeet Singh |title=Guru Tegh Bahadur |publisher=Language Dept., Punjab |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before [[Waheguru|God]].&lt;ref name="Mayled"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jon Mayled |title=Modern World Religions: Sikhism |publisher=Harcourt Heinemann |date=2002 |isbn=978-0435336264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhcoalition.org|title=The Sikh Coalition|work=sikhcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]] concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the [[Universe]] itself ([[pantheism]]). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual.   While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,&lt;ref name="p252"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |date=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=978-0871961297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart", of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name="p252"/&gt;

===East Asian religions===

====Taoism====
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|''[[Taijitu]]'' symbolizes the [[unity of opposites]] between yin and yang.]]

[[Taoist]] [[cosmogony]] emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all man to return to the ''primordial'' or to rejoin with the ''Oneness'' of the Universe by way of self-cultivation and self-realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth.

Taoists believe all things were originally from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] and [[Tao]], and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. "Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves."&lt;ref name="Ming-Dao"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ming-Dao Deng |title=Scholar Warrior: An Introduction to the Tao in Everyday Life |publisher=HarperCollins |date=1990 |isbn=978-0062502322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shinto====
[[File:Shinto torii vermillion.svg|thumb|Shinto [[torii]], a traditional Japanese gate]]

[[Shinto]] is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means "the path of the [[kami]]", but more specifically, it can be taken to mean "the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way". The "divine" crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of [[free will]], choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process.

Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{Cite book |author=J.W.T. Mason |title=The Meaning of Shinto |publisher=Trafford Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1412245517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New religions====
There are many [[new religious movements]] in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: [[Chondogyo]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Cao Đài]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a [[Joyous Life]] by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.

But all is positioned in such a way as to make the image of a [[human skull|skull]] appear, expressing ''[[memento mori]]'', that no matter how good she looks, it won't last, as death is inevitable.]]

The mystery of life and its true meaning is an often recurring subject in [[popular culture]], featured in [[mass media|entertainment media]] and [[the arts|various forms]] of [[art]].

In ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', there are several allusions to the meaning of life. At the end of the film, a character played by [[Michael Palin]] is handed an envelope containing "the meaning of life", which she opens and reads out to the audience: "Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations."&lt;ref name="useless website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_scripts/meanlife.asp|title=Monty Python's Completely Useless Web Site: Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life: Complete Script|work=intriguing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Terry Burnham |title=Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2005 |isbn=978-0471716952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Yolanda Fernandez |title=In Their Shoes: Examining the Issue of Empathy and Its Place in the Treatment of Offenders |publisher=Wood 'N' Barnes Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1885473486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Python sketches and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life ("[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]") and other meaning-of-life related questioning. John Cleese also had his sit-com character [[Basil Fawlty]] contemplating the futility of his own existence in [[Fawlty Towers]].

In [[Douglas Adams]]' popular comedy book, movie, television, and radio series ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] is given the numeric solution "[[42 (number)|42]]", after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant [[supercomputer]] called [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that "I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Fourth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|language=English|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-03-29|quote=I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based.

Deep Thought then constructs another computer—the Earth—to calculate what the Ultimate Question actually is. 
Later Ford and Arthur manage to extract the question as the Earth computer would have rendered it. That question turns out to be "what do you get if you multiply six by nine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Sixth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-04-12|quote=That’s it. Six by nine… forty-two! I always said there was something fundamentally wrong about the universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is realised that [[Garbage_in,_garbage_out|the program was ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans]] on Earth, and so the actual Ultimate Question Of Life, The Universe, And Everything remains unknown. While 6 x 9 would be written as 42 in the [[List_of_numeral_systems#Standard_positional_numeral_systems|tridecimal numeral system]], author Douglas Adams claimed that this was mere coincidence and completely serendipitous.

[[File:HamletSkullHCSealous.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamlet]] meditating upon [[Yorick]]'s skull has become the most lasting embodiment of the imagery of [[vanitas]], conveying the theme ''[[memento mori]]'' ('Remember you shall die'). Whatever the meaning of life, it (life) is fleeting.]]

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer the Heretic]]", a representation of God agrees to tell Homer what the meaning of life is, but the show's credits begin to roll just as he starts to say what it is.&lt;ref name="Pinsky"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark I. Pinsky |title=The Gospel According To The Simpsons: The Spiritual Life Of The World's Most Animated Family |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0664224196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' season 1 episode 1 the character Simmons asks Grif the question "Why are we here?" and is a major line in the series.

In ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', the characters are asked how we should live our lives, and reply with a version of the [[golden rule]] `be excellent to each other' followed by 'party on, dudes!'.

In [[Person of Interest (TV series)|''Person of Interest'']] season 5 episode 13, an artificial intelligence referred to as The Machine tells [[Harold Finch (Person of Interest)|Harold Finch]] that the secret of life is  ''"Everyone dies alone. But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all."'' This phrase is then repeated at the very end of the show to add emphasis to the finale.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Life has no meaning===
* Life or human existence has no real meaning or purpose because human existence occurred out of a random [[contingency (philosophy)|chance]] in nature, and anything that exists by chance has no intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* Life has no meaning, but as humans we try to associate a meaning or purpose so we can justify our existence.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* There is no point in life, and that is exactly what makes it so special.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;

===One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life===
* The answer to the meaning of life is too profound to be known and understood.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* The meaning of life is to forget about the search for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* Ultimately, a person should not ask what the meaning of their life is, but rather must recognize that it is they themselves who are asked. In a word, each person is questioned by life; and they can only answer to life by answering for their own life; to life they can only respond by being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''Man's Search for Meaning'', Viktor Frankl. Beacon Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0807014264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life is bad===
* Better never to have been. People will always experience pain (harm) which outweighs any pleasure. Not coming into existence means people will not experience pain, nor will they be disadvantaged by not experiencing pleasure as they do not exist. This is described as the asymmetry of pleasure and pain (see [[antinatalism]]).&lt;ref name="Benetar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink=David Benatar|title=Better Never to Have Been – The Harm of Coming into Existence|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199296422|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17034">'''The Newton County John Does''', also dubbed '''Adam and Brad''', or simply as '''Victims A and  B''' or '''Victims 3 and 4''', are two young unidentified males whose remains were discovered with those of two other men on October 18, 1983 in [[Lake Village, Indiana|Lake Village]], [[Newton County, Indiana|Newton County]], [[Indiana]] by mushroom foragers.&lt;ref name=penner/&gt; Their nicknames were given by Newton County coroner Scott McCord, elected in 2008, to remember that they were people. He learned that the "victims had never been identified, returned to any family or buried". He renewed the investigation, recruiting Stephen Nawrocki, a noted forensic [[anthropologist]] at the University of Indianapolis, to examine the remains and help develop descriptions of the victims.&lt;ref name=pros/&gt; Nawrocki also gained the assistance of the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]], whose experts drew portraits of the young men.

==Case==
All four of the victims were [[murder]]ed by [[Larry Eyler]], a [[serial killer]] of young men in the 1980s who maintained residences in Terre Haute and Chicago. The Newton County victims had each been bound, drugged, and stabbed more than twenty-four times. Their remains were buried lying face up near an abandoned barn.&lt;ref name=penner/&gt;&lt;ref name=pros/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four victims of a serial killer found together, two remain unidentified|url=http://blog.missingkids.org/post/104790255955/four-victims-of-a-serial-killer-found-together|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=11 December 2014}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the four victims found at the scene have since been identified by dental records as Michael Bauer and John Bartlett.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt;&lt;ref name=doenetb&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 999UMIN|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/999umin.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major reason why neither Adam nor Brad has been identified is because Eyler did not know who they were, unlike the rest of his victims. In addition, he was known to dispose of any identification that he would find on his victims.&lt;ref name=penner/&gt; Hoping to make a plea bargain, Eyler had made a list of his victims while awaiting execution in the 1990s for a 1984 murder in Chicago. He died of AIDS before his execution date.  

The two young men found in Newton County are possibly native to the Midwestern states of [[Indiana]], [[Wisconsin]] or [[Illinois]]. However, it is possible that they could have been from anywhere in the [[United States]], as Eyler also confessed to some killings in [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=under&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernsee|first1=Eric|title=Efforts under way to ID two unidentified victims of Eyler|url=http://www.bannergraphic.com/story/1812583.html|accessdate=14 August 2014|agency=Banner Graphic|date=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2014, neither has been buried, as the investigation is still being conducted. Their dental records and DNA are being stored in national databases.&lt;ref name=pros/&gt;

Eyler usually knew his murder victims to be [[homosexuality|gay]]. Adam and Brad may have been [[hitchhiker]]s or male [[prostitutes]] who had been disowned by their families, if, in fact, they were gay.&lt;ref name=penner/&gt; Besides these two, the [[Jasper County John Doe]], also unidentified in Indiana, is another victim of Eyler.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt;

The two victims' faces were [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstructed]] several times, twice by sketching and once digitally, by the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].&lt;ref name=aol&gt;{{cite news|title=Forensic Artist Gives Faces to Unidentified Victims|url=http://www.oakgov.com/sheriff/Documents/AOLNEWS_031710.pdf|accessdate=15 August 2014|agency=AOL News|publisher=AOL.com|date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facial reconstructions by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reportedly took approximately eighteen months to complete.&lt;ref name=penner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penner|first1=Diana|title=Indiana Unsolved: Identities sought for 2 victims of 'The Highway Killer' Larry Eyler|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2013/10/22/indiana-unsolved-identities-sought-for-2-victims-of-the-highway-killer-larry-eyler/3149123/|accessdate=14 August 2014|agency=Indy Star|date=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a public funeral for the victims was held with an additional unidentified victim in the county. The remains were interred inside of a mausoleum in Riverside Cemetery in Brook, Indiana.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite news |title=Two of serial killer Larry Eyler’s victims remain unidentified after 35 years |url=http://www.newsbug.info/newton_county_enterprise/news/crime/two-of-serial-killer-larry-eyler-s-victims-remain-unidentified/article_5bf6518e-94e4-52ca-ae31-b09ae129a80d.html?fbclid=IwAR25xZF3FjkFDKNa66oaZXST6Jreuo8odtq_FF6AUeqHA36D0v5JWCZLqC0 |work=Newton County Enterprise |date=30 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyler described the boy to be between fifteen and twenty years old and confirmed the suspicion that he had been picked up near [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] in July 1983.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Eyler had previously targeted hitchhikers after he had relationship troubles with his partner.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; Investigator Scott McCord believes that Adam was likely native to the region, perhaps from around [[Chicago]] or [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=pros&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cortopassi|first1=Ray|title=Prosecutor working to identify Highway Murderer's victims|url=http://www.latimes.com/wxin-larry-eyler-prosecutor-working-to-identify-highway-murderers-victims-20120228-column.html|accessdate=14 August 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also previously known as Victim 3, as he was one of four to be found at the burial site. 

McCord stated that he preferred to use names instead of numbers when he referred to the victims.&lt;ref name=penner/&gt;&lt;ref name=under/&gt; Like most of Larry Eyler's other victims, Adam had his pants pulled down to his ankles.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmadeke|first1=Steve|title=Indiana coroners press to identify 3 young men slain by 1980s Chicago serial killer|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-12/news/ct-met-serial-killer-bodies-20101011_1_larry-eyler-coroners-serial-killer|accessdate=14 August 2014|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a confession letter released by Larry Eyler's defense attorney [[Kathleen Zellner]], Eyler said that after an argument with his boyfriend, he drove toward Terre Haute, Indiana in the third week of July 1983.&lt;ref name=zambo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zambo|first1=Kristen|title=Newton County: Coroner hoping to identify 2 more|url=http://mloillinois.blogspot.com/2011/08/newton-county-coroner-hoping-to.html|accessdate=15 August 2014|date=11 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224041404/http://mloillinois.blogspot.com/2011/08/newton-county-coroner-hoping-to.html|archivedate=24 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While traveling through the town, he met a hitchhiker who matched Adam's description. Further in the document, it was described that the young man was offered seventy-five [[United States dollar|dollars]] to allow Eyler to "perform a sexual act" with him. After Eyler drugged the young man with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and an unspecified drug, he took him to the barn; the young man's body was later found buried nearby. Subsequently, he was bound, blindfolded and was eventually stabbed multiple times in his upper and lower midsection. According to Eyler, his last words to the victim were, "Okay, make your peace with God, nigger."&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; 

Eyler wrote that he buried Adam separately from the three other victims he had previously murdered. He said it was "not proper" to bury an African American with European Americans.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt;

Victim B, or Brad, was determined to have been a [[white American|white]] male and, like Adam, could have been a hitchhiker.&lt;ref name=under/&gt; He was between seventeen and twenty-three years old, and may have been a [[smoking|smoker]], due to staining on his teeth.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; He had two known [[tattoo]]s on his [[forearm]], which were later photographed after his body was cleaned and re-hydrated.&lt;ref name=cim/&gt; One was a cross with two circular marks, located on the underside of his arm, near his [[wrist]]. The other was a rectangular, or possibly a "U" shape, containing one circular mark, which was found on the other side of his arm.&lt;ref name=namusb/&gt;

[[File:Brad Doe tattoo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Reconstruction of Brad's tattoo]]

He wore mismatched [[sock]]s and jockey [[underwear|undershorts]], along with brown [[slacks]], which were partially removed, as was typical of other victims.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; Brad wore boots, which were ankle-high, [[hiking boots|hiking-style]], with brown [[Polar fleece|fleece]] interior. Metal eyelets were used to fasten them.&lt;ref name=namusb&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Report - NamUs UP # 6105|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/full_report/6105|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=15 August 2014|date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brad's boots are no longer available for examination.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; Because of the type of tattoos he had, he may have served time in [[jail]] or a [[juvenile detention]] center.&lt;ref name=zambo/&gt;

He was likely shorter than Adam, approximately five feet two inches to five feet ten inches tall; weighing around 130 to 160 pounds.&lt;ref name=penner/&gt; Some reports said that he could have been as old as twenty-eight and may have been as tall as six feet one inch.&lt;ref name=aol/&gt; He had wavy reddish hair, and some dental fillings. His death was estimated as between 1981 and 1983, although his tattoos were still preserved and recognizable. He had at one time fractured his nose and ankle, breaks described as somewhat severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Doe 1983|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1202842/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 1384UMIN|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/1384umin.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was found buried in the same grave as Bartlett and Bauer.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; Like Adam, he was given a more generic name in the past, as Victim 4.&lt;ref name=penner/&gt; 

Brad and Adam may have been from as far away as [[Canada]], which is another reason why they remain unidentified.&lt;ref name=under/&gt; DNA was obtained from one of Brad's bones, intended for testing in comparison to a family who could have been related to him.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; Larry Eyler did not remember where or when he met Brad.&lt;ref name=zambo/&gt;&lt;ref name=cim&gt;{{cite web|title=Brad Doe - 1983|url=http://canyouidentifyme.blogspot.com/2011/01/brad-doe-1983.html|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=15 August 2014|date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nonkilling Global Political Science''''' is a 2002 book written by [[political scientist]] [[Glenn D. Paige]]. In his book, Paige challenges the violence-accepting assumptions of the discipline of political science as a whole. Paige introduces the concept of [[Nonkilling]], which refers to the absence of killing, threats to kill, and conditions conducive to killing in human society.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn D. Paige, ''Nonkilling Global Political Science.'' Center for Global Nonkilling, 2002; 3rd ed. 2009, page 1.[http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009 the book was being translated into 34 languages [http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18] and had led to convening the First Global Nonkilling Leadership Forum in [[Honolulu]], Hawai‘i, 1–4 November 2007.&lt;ref name="GNKLconf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Nonkilling Leadership |year=2009 |url=http://www.nonkilling.org/pdf/forum1.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outrage porn''' refers to any type of media that is designed to evoke [[Outrage (emotion)|outrage]] for the purpose getting traffic or attention online. The term ''outrage porn'' was coined by political [[cartoonist]] and [[essay|essayist]] Tim Kreider of The ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="COINED1"&gt; Kreider, Tim [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/isnt-it-outrageous/?_r=0 Isn’t It Outrageous?] ''New York Times''.

September 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Coined in 2009, the term was later popularized by [[author]] and ''[[New York Observer|Observer]]'' media critic [[Ryan Holiday]].&lt;ref name="NYO1"&gt;Holiday, Ryan [http://observer.com/2014/02/outrage-porn-how-the-need-for-perpetual-indignation-manufactures-phony-offense/ Outrage Porn: How the Need For 'Perpetual Indignation' Manufactures Phony Offense] ''New York Observer''.

==Overview==
Outrage porn is a term used to explain media that is created not in order to generate sympathy, but rather to cause anger or outrage among its consumers. It is characterized by insincere rage, umbrage and indignation.&lt;ref name="NYO1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leibovich, Mark [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/fake-outrage-in-the-kentucky-senate-race.html?_r=0 Fake Outrage in Kentucky] ''New York Times''. September 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Media outlets are often incentivized to feign outrage because it specifically triggers many of the most lucrative online behaviors, including leaving comments, repeat pageviews and social sharing, which the outlets capitalize on.&lt;ref&gt;Holiday, Ryan [http://observer.com/2014/10/rage-profiteers-how-blogs-harness-our-anger-for-their-own-gain/ Rage Profiteers: How Bloggers Harness Our Anger For Their Own Gain] ''New York Observer''. September 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salon (website)|Salon]], [[Gawker]] and affiliated websites [[Valleywag]] and [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] have been noted for abusing the tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Daum, Meghan [http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-daum-jezebel-effect-feminism-college-assault-20150601-story.html 'Jezebel Effect' poisons conversations on gender and sexual violence] ''Los Angeles Times''. September 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Cathy [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/07/19/gawker__the_lefts_selective_outrage_127443.html Gawker &amp; the Left's Selective Outrage] ''Real Clear Politics]''. September 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYO1" /&gt;

Jonah Berger, a professor of marketing at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] conducted a study on the spreadability of emotions via social media and concluded that, "Anger is a high-arousal emotion, which drives people to take action...It makes you feel fired up, which makes you more likely to pass things on.”&lt;ref&gt;Shaer, Matthew [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-emotion-goes-viral-fastest-180950182/?no-ist What Emotion Goes Viral the Fastest?] ''Smithsonian Magazine'', September 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, online audiences may be susceptible to outrage porn in part because of their feeling of powerlessness to managers, politicians, creditors and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Geoff [http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/03/rooney_mara_pan_tiger_lily_outrage_native_americans.html Rooney Mara to play Tiger Lily in new 'Pan' movie? Outrage is all the rage nowadays] ''Syracuse Post-Standard''. September 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Kreider makes a distinction between authentic outrage and outrage porn by stating, "I’m not saying that all outrage is inherently irrational, that we should all just calm down, that It’s All Good. All is not good...Outrage is healthy to the extent that it causes us to act against injustice.&lt;ref name="COINED1" /&gt;

'''''Petz: Crazy Monkeyz''''' (sometimes called simply '''''Crazy Monkeyz''''') is a [[sim game]] developed and published by [[Ubisoft]] and released for the [[Wii]] on February 13, 2009.

==Gameplay==
''Crazy Monkeyz'' is a [[sim game]] designed for 1 player and revolving around caring for a monkey.

To start you can choose from two species of monkey (others can be unlocked later), each has three coat types to choose from but you will be unable to see the other two. From there you can feed your monkey, play with it, dress it up, breed it, or turn on the TV for it (plays a non-stop commercial for the game).

==Reception==

}}
The game has received largely negative reviews. There is little to do in the game besides feeding and dressing up the monkey. Balls and other toys will fall through the monkeys hands and in the backyard area of the game you cannot interact with your monkey. Also, in the adoption center when you go to choose your monkey, you get the choice to choose a color, but it does not tell you what you are choosing.

'''Posthuman''' or '''post-human''' is a concept originating in the fields of [[science fiction]], [[futurology]], [[contemporary art]], and [[philosophy]] that literally means a person or entity that exists in a state beyond being human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=posthumanism|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/posthumanism|website=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept addresses questions of ethics and justice, language and trans-species communication, social systems, and the intellectual aspirations of interdisciplinarity.

[[Posthumanism]] is not to be confused with [[transhumanism]] (the nanobiotechnological enhancement of human beings) and narrow definitions of the posthuman as the hoped-for transcendence of materiality.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrando, Francesca [https://www.academia.edu/10395183/_THE_BODY_IN_POST-_AND_TRANSHUMANISM_-_Printed_Version "The Body"] in ''Post- and Transhumanism: an Introduction.'' [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], Frankfurt: 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the posthuman comes up both in [[posthumanism]] as well as [[transhumanism]], but it has a special meaning in each tradition. In 2017, [[Penn State University Press]] in cooperation with [[Stefan Lorenz Sorgner]] and [[James Hughes (sociologist)]] established the "Journal of Posthuman Studies"&lt;ref&gt;The term "Posthuman Studies" was coined by Francesca Ferrando in her article [http://www.tijdschriftframe.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Frame-25_01-Ferrando.pdf "Towards a Posthumanist Methodology. A Statement"] (2012) which begins by stating: "In the emerging field of Posthuman Studies, extensive debate has been formulated on what is Posthumanism" (p. 9). In: Frame, Journal For Literary Studies, Issue "Narrating Posthumanism" 25 no.1 (May 2012): 9-18, Utrecht University {{ISSN|0924-7750}}. Ferrando serves on the Editorial Board of the "Journal of Posthuman Studies."&lt;/ref&gt; in which all aspects of the concept "posthuman" can be analysed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psupress.org/Journals/jnls_JPHS.html | title=Journal of Posthuman Studies: Philosophy, Technology, Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumanism==
{{Main article|Posthumanism}}
In [[critical theory]], the posthuman is a speculative being that represents or seeks to re-conceive the [[human]]. It is the object of posthumanist criticism, which critically questions [[humanism]], a branch of humanist philosophy which claims that [[human nature]] is a universal state from which the human [[being]] emerges; human nature is autonomous, rational, capable of [[free will]], and unified in itself as the apex of [[existence]]. Thus, the posthuman position recognizes imperfectability and disunity within him or herself, and understands the world through heterogeneous [[perspectivism|perspectives]] while seeking to maintain [[intellectual rigour]] and a dedication to objective observations.  Key to this posthuman practice is the ability to fluidly change perspectives and manifest oneself through different [[identity (philosophy)|identities]]. The posthuman, for critical theorists of the subject, has an [[emergentism|emergent]] [[ontology]] rather than a stable one; in other words, the posthuman is not a singular, defined [[individual]], but rather one who can "become" or embody different identities and understand the world from multiple, heterogeneous perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Haraway, Donna J, "Situated Knowledges" in ''Simians, Cyborgs, and Women.''  [[Routledge]], New York: 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical discourses surrounding posthumanism are not homogeneous, but in fact present a series of often contradictory ideas, and the term itself is contested, with one of the foremost authors associated with posthumanism, [[Manuel de Landa]], decrying the term as "very silly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=383 CTheory.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Covering the ideas of, for example, Robert Pepperell's ''The Posthuman Condition'', and [[N. Katherine Hayles|Hayles's]] ''How We Became Posthuman'' under a single term is distinctly problematic due to these contradictions.

The posthuman is roughly synonymous with the "[[cyborg]]" of ''[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]'' by [[Donna Haraway]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} Haraway's conception of the cyborg is an ironic take on traditional conceptions of the cyborg that inverts the traditional [[trope (literature)|trope]] of the cyborg whose presence questions the salient line between humans and [[robot]]s. Haraway's cyborg is in many ways the "beta" version of the posthuman, as her [[cyborg theory]] prompted the issue to be taken up in critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Haraway, Donna J, ''Simians, Cyborgs, and Women.''  Routledge, New York: 1991.  "A Cyborg Manifesto" originally appeared in ''Socialist Review'' in 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Haraway, Hayles, whose work grounds much of the critical posthuman discourse, asserts that liberal humanism—[[Mind-body dichotomy|which separates the mind from the body]] and thus portrays the body as a "shell" or vehicle for the mind—becomes increasingly complicated in the late 20th and 21st centuries because [[information technology]] puts the [[human body]] in question. Hayles maintains that we must be conscious of information technology advancements while understanding information as "disembodied," that is, something which cannot fundamentally replace the human body but can only be incorporated into it and human life practices.&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[N.

===Post-posthumanism and post-cyborg ethics===
The idea of post-posthumanism (post-cyborgism) has recently been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Steve. "The post-cyborg path to deconism." CTheory (2003): 2-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bredenoord, Annelien L., Rieke van der Graaf, and Johannes JM van Delden. "Toward a "Post-Posthuman Dignity Area" in Evaluating Emerging Enhancement Technologies."

Journal of Architectural Education 67, no. 2 (2013): 264-269.&lt;/ref&gt;
This body of work outlines the after-effects of long-term adaptation to cyborg technologies and their subsequent removal, e.g., what happens after 20 years of constantly wearing computer-mediating eyeglass technologies and subsequently removing them, and of long-term adaptation to virtual worlds followed by return to "reality."&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Steve.

Posthuman political and natural rights have been framed on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Woody Evans]], 2015. "Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds". Revista Teknokultura 12(2). [http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310]&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumanism broadens the scope of what it means to be a valued life form and to be treated as such (in contrast to certain life forms being seen as less-than and being taken advantage of or killed off); it “calls for a more inclusive definition of life, and a greater moral-ethical response, and responsibility, to non-human life forms in the age of species blurring and species mixing.  … [I]t interrogates the hierarchic ordering – and subsequently exploitation and even eradication – of life forms.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Posthumanism|last=Nayar|first=Pramod K.|publisher=Polity|year=2014|isbn=978-0745662411|location=Cambridge|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transhumanism==
{{main article|Transhumanism}}

===Definition===
{{further|topic=an intermediate form between human and posthuman|Transhuman}}

According to [[transhumanist]] thinkers, a posthuman is a hypothetical [[future]] being "whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously [[human]] by our current standards."&lt;ref name="transhumanistfaq"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://humanityplus.org/philosophy/transhumanist-faq/ |title=Transhumanist FAQ |website=[[Humanity+]] |date=c. 2016 |orig-year=Version 1.0 published c. 1998 |version=Version 3.0 |access-date=2018-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231225013/http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf |archive-date=2006-12-31 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumans primarily focus on cybernetics, the posthuman consequent and the relationship to digital technology. The emphasis is on systems. Transhumanism does not focus on either of these. Instead, transhumanism focuses on the modification of the human species via any kind of emerging science, including genetic engineering, digital technology, and bioengineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between posthumanism and transhumanism?|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/lagrandeur20140729|website=Institute for Ethics and Transforming Technologies|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods===
{{Further|Human enhancement}}
Posthumans could be completely synthetic artificial intelligences, or a symbiosis of human and [[artificial intelligence]], or [[mind uploading|uploaded consciousnesses]], or the result of making many smaller but cumulatively profound technological augmentations to a biological human, i.e. a [[cyborg]].  Some examples of the latter are redesigning the human organism using [[molecular nanotechnology|advanced nanotechnology]] or radical enhancement using some combination of technologies such as [[human genetic engineering|genetic engineering]], [[psychopharmacology]], [[life extension]] therapies, [[brain-computer interface|neural interface]]s, advanced [[internet bot|information management tools]], [[nootropic|memory enhancing drugs]], [[wearable computer|wearable]] or implanted computers, and [[cognitive science|cognitive]] techniques.&lt;ref name="transhumanistfaq" /&gt;

===Posthuman future===
As used in this article, "posthuman" does not necessarily refer to a conjectured [[future]] where [[Human extinction|humans are extinct]] or otherwise absent from the [[Earth]]. As with other species who [[speciation|speciate]] from one another, both humans and posthumans could continue to exist. However, the [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] scenario appears to be a viewpoint shared among a minority of transhumanists such as [[Marvin Minsky]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} and [[Hans Moravec]], who could be considered [[misanthrope]]s, at least in regard to humanity in its current state. Alternatively, others such as [[Kevin Warwick]] argue for the likelihood that both humans and posthumans will continue to exist but the latter will predominate in society over the former because of their abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K: “I, Cyborg”, University of Illinois Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, scholars have begun to speculate that posthumanism provides an alternative analysis of apocalyptic cinema and fiction, often casting vampires, werewolves and even zombies as potential evolutions of the human form and being.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro, ed. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0oZIlm84F2oC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=romero+zombie+ghouls&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OqDhPx6I3m&amp;sig=fBKmtkH_PBGVm7rpADZ0bwR3_lI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SpuITqGXF8TI0QWFk4XlDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=romero%20&amp;f=false Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human]. Fordham Univ Press. p. 169. {{ISBN|0-8232-3447-9}}, 9780823234479&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[science fiction author]]s, such as [[Greg Egan]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Greg Bear]], [[Charles Stross]], [[Neal Asher]], [[Ken MacLeod]], [[Peter F. Hamilton]] and authors of the [[Orion's Arm|Orion's Arm Universe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-topic/492d76d2f173e Orion's Arm - Encyclopedia Galactica - Archailects&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; have written works set in posthuman futures.

===Posthuman god===
A variation on the posthuman theme is the notion of a "posthuman god"; the idea that posthumans, being no longer confined to the parameters of [[human nature]], might grow physically and mentally so powerful as to appear possibly [[Deity|god]]-like by present-day human standards.&lt;ref name="transhumanistfaq" /&gt; This notion should not be interpreted as being related to the idea portrayed in some [[science fiction]] that a sufficiently advanced species may "ascend" to a higher [[parallel universe (fiction)|plane of existence]]—rather, it merely means that some posthuman beings may become so exceedingly intelligent and technologically sophisticated that their behaviour would not possibly be comprehensible to modern humans, purely by reason of their limited intelligence and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer]].

'''Princess Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma''' (Marie Louise Pia Theresa Anna Ferdinanda Francisca Antonia Margaret Josepha Carolina Blanche Lucia Apollonia;17 January 1870 – 31 January 1899) was the eldest daughter of Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma. She became [[Princess-consort]] of [[Bulgaria]] upon her marriage to [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]], the then [[prince-regnant]] (who became [[Tsar]] after her death). She was the mother of Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria]].

==Early life==
Marie Louise was born in Rome in 1870 as ''Maria Luisa Pia Teresa Anna Ferdinanda Francesca Antonietta Margherita Giuseppina Carolina Bianca Lucia Apollonia di Borbone-Parma'', the eldest daughter of [[Robert I of Parma|Robert I, Duke of Parma]] and his first wife, [[Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1849–1882)|Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]]. The couple produced eleven more children before Maria Pia died in childbirth in 1882. Several of these twelve were born with severe mental retardation. Later, Duke Roberto remarried [[Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal]] and had twelve more children. Marie Louise, who was twelve at the time of her mother's death, was brought up in [[Biarritz]] and [[Switzerland]] under the care of English governesses. Fluent in five languages, she liked painting and music. Her talents playing the guitar and the piano were judged to be well above the average. She was also well read and knew a lot of [[Dante]] and [[Leopardi]] by heart.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Marriage==

In 1892, her father arranged her marriage to the then [[reign]]ing Prince of Bulgaria, Ferdinand of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. The negotiations were conducted between Duke Robert and Ferdinand's mother, Princess [[Clémentine of Orléans]]. The engagement was celebrated at the Castle of Schwartzau, the residence of the Bourbon-Parma family in [[Austria]]. Marie-Louise and Ferdinand had never met prior to that day. Princess Clémentine, who was present on that occasion, described her future daughter-in-law in a letter to [[Queen Victoria]] as "Unhappily not very pretty, it is the only thing which is lacking, since she is charming, good, very witty, intelligent and very likable". The wedding took place on 20 April 1893 at the Villa Pianore in [[Lucca, Italy]], the residence of Duke Roberto in Italy. Marie Louise was twenty three, nine years younger than Ferdinand. The couple wasted no time producing an heir, with son Boris born nine months and ten days later. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Princess of Bulgaria==
[[File:Portrait of Knyaginya Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma of Bulgaria - oil painting.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait by [[Philip de László]]]]
Marie Louise was not loved by her husband. However, he made sure that in order to secure his lineage on the Bulgarian throne, she would bear him children. Under pressure from his subjects and looking to be recognized as Bulgaria's sovereign by the Russian emperor, Ferdinand wanted to have their eldest son, Boris, converted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church in the summer of 1895. Marie Louise, pregnant, argued bitterly against her husband's actions, with the support of her father and her mother-in-law.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The second child received baptism with Roman Catholic rites. However, unable to avoid Boris's conversion, Marie Louise, who had threatened to leave the country, left Sofia that same day for [[Beaulieu-sur-Mer|Beaulieu]]. In May 1896 Marie Louise returned to Bulgaria. In the summer, she went to [[London]] with her husband for [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]], giving birth the following January to Princess Eudoxia. In July 1898 with her husband and their four-year-old, Boris, they visited [[St Petersburg]] at the invitation of [[Nicholas II of Russia]], and Marie Louise made a success of the visit. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Death==
Disillusionment in her private life and bearing four children in five years affected her frail health. Suffering from [[pneumonia]], Marie Louise died in [[Sofia]], twenty four hours after giving birth to her fourth child. Aged just 29, she was buried in the Roman Catholic [[Cathedral of St Louis of France]] in [[Plovdiv]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

{{distinguish|Tintin (character){{!}}Tintin|The Adventures of Tintin}}

'''Rin Tin Tin''' (often hyphenated as '''Rin-Tin-Tin'''; September 1918 – August 10, 1932) was a male [[German Shepherd]] that was an international star in motion pictures. He was rescued from a [[World War I]] battlefield by an American soldier, Lee Duncan, who nicknamed him "'''Rinty'''". Duncan trained Rin Tin Tin and obtained [[silent film]] work for the dog. Rin Tin Tin was an immediate box-office success and went on to appear in 27 Hollywood films, gaining worldwide fame. Along with the earlier canine film star [[Strongheart]], Rin Tin Tin was responsible for greatly increasing the popularity of German Shepherd dogs as family pets. The immense profitability of his films contributed to the success of [[Warner Bros.]] studios and helped advance the career of [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. 

After Rin Tin Tin died in 1932, the name was given to several related German Shepherd dogs featured in fictional stories on film, radio, and television. '''Rin Tin Tin Jr.''' appeared in some serialized films, but was not as talented as his father. '''Rin Tin Tin III''', said to be Rin Tin Tin's grandson, but probably only distantly related, helped promote the military use of dogs during [[World War II]]. Rin Tin Tin III also appeared in a film with child actor [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] in 1947. 

Duncan groomed '''Rin Tin Tin IV''' for the 1950s television series ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', but the dog performed poorly in a screen test and was replaced in the TV show by trainer Frank Barnes's dogs, primarily one named '''Flame Jr.''', called JR, with the public led to believe otherwise. Instead of shooting episodes, Rin Tin Tin IV stayed at home in [[Riverside, California]]. The TV show ''Rin Tin Tin'' was nominated for a [[PATSY Award]] in 1958 and in 1959, but did not win.

After Duncan died in 1960, the screen property of Rin Tin Tin passed to TV producer Herbert B. "Bert" Leonard, who worked on further adaptations such as the 1988–1993 Canadian-made TV show ''[[Katts and Dog]]'' which was called ''Rin Tin Tin: K-9 Cop'' in the US and ''Rintintin Junior'' in France. After Leonard died in 2006, Leonard's lawyer James Tierney made the 2007 children's film ''[[Finding Rin Tin Tin]]'', an American–Bulgarian production based on Duncan's discovery of the dog in France. Meanwhile, a Rin Tin Tin memorabilia collection was being amassed by Texas resident Jannettia Propps Brodsgaard, who had purchased several direct descendant dogs from Duncan beginning with Rinty Tin Tin Brodsgaard in 1957. Brodsgaard bred the dogs to keep the bloodline. Brodsgaard's granddaughter, Daphne Hereford, continued to build on the tradition and bloodline of Rin Tin Tin from 1988 to 2011; she was the first to trademark the name Rin Tin Tin in 1993 (Duncan had never done so) and she bought the [[domain name]]s rintintin.com and rintintin.net to establish a website. Hereford also opened a short-lived Rin Tin Tin museum in [[Latexo, Texas]]. Hereford passed the tradition to her daughter, Dorothy Yanchak, in 2011. The current Rin Tin Tin XII dog owned by Yanchak takes part in public events to represent the Rin Tin Tin legacy.

==Origins==
[[File:135th Aero Squadron Group.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Officers and men of the 135th Aero Squadron with their mascot "Rin Tin Tin" shortly after his rescue as a puppy in 1918.]]
Following advances made by American forces during the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]], Corporal Lee Duncan, an aerial gunner of the [[United States Army Air Service|U.S. Army Air Service]], was sent forward on September 15, 1918, to the small French village of [[Flirey]] to see if it would make a suitable flying field for his unit, the [[135th Aero Squadron]].{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=21}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=28}} The area had been subject to bombs and artillery, and Duncan found a severely damaged kennel which had once supplied the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] with German Shepherd dogs. The only dogs left alive in the kennel were a starving mother with a litter of five nursing puppies, their eyes still shut because they were less than a week old.&lt;ref name=DogStar&gt;{{cite news |last=Orlean |first=Susan |title=The Dog Star |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/29/110829fa_fact_orlean |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |newspaper=The New Yorker |date=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan rescued the dogs and brought them back to his unit. 

When the puppies were weaned, he gave the mother to an officer and three of the litter to other soldiers, but he kept a male and a female. He felt that these two dogs were symbols of his good luck. He called them Rin Tin Tin and Nanette after a pair of good luck charms called Rintintin and Nénette that French children often gave to the American soldiers. Duncan sensed that Nanette was the smarter of the two puppies.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=32}} (The soldiers were usually told that Rintintin and Nénette were lucky lovers which had survived a bombing attack, but the original dolls had been designed by [[Francisque Poulbot]] before the war in late 1913 to look like Paris street urchins. Contrary to popular usage, Poulbot said that Rintintin was the girl doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poupendol.com/poulbot-dolls.html |title=Les Poupées du Poulbot |publisher=Poupendol.com |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malraux.org/index.php/motsclefs/870-nenette.html |title=Nénette et Rintintin&amp;nbsp;– notice |publisher=Malraux.org |author=Présence d'André Malraux sur la Toile |language=French |date=September 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608091247/http://www.malraux.org/index.php/motsclefs/870-nenette.html# |archive-date=2012-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In July 1919, Duncan managed to bundle the dogs aboard a ship taking him back to the US at the end of the war. When he got to [[Long Island, New York]], for re-entry processing, he put his dogs in the care of a [[Hempstead, New York|Hempstead]] breeder named Mrs. Leo Wanner, who raised police dogs. Nanette was diagnosed with pneumonia; as a replacement, the breeder gave Duncan another female German Shepherd puppy. Duncan headed to California by rail with his dogs. While Duncan was traveling by train, Nanette died in Hempstead. As a memorial, Duncan named his new puppy Nanette II, but he called her Nanette.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=43}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=44}} Duncan, Rin Tin Tin, and Nanette II settled at his home in Los Angeles. Rin Tin Tin was a dark sable color and had very dark eyes. Nanette II was much lighter in color.

An athletic silent film actor named [[Eugene Pallette]] was one of Duncan's friends. The two men enjoyed the outdoors; they took the dogs to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]], where Pallette liked to hunt while Duncan taught Rin Tin Tin various tricks. Duncan thought that his dog might win a few awards at dog shows and thus be a valuable source of puppy sales, bred with Nanette. In 1922, Duncan was a founding member of the Shepherd Dog Club of California, based in Los Angeles. At the club's first show, Rin Tin Tin showed his agility, but also demonstrated an aggressive temper, growling, barking and snapping. It was a very poor performance, but the worst moment came afterward when Duncan was walking home. A heavy bundle of newspapers was thrown off of a delivery truck and it landed on the dog, breaking his left front leg. Duncan had the injured limb set in plaster and he nursed the dog back to health for nine months.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=46}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=47}}

Ten months after the break, the leg was healed and Rin Tin Tin was entered in a show for German Shepherd dogs in Los Angeles. Rin Tin Tin had learned to leap great heights. At the dog show while making a winning leap of {{convert|11|ft|9|in|m|2}}, he was filmed by Duncan's acquaintance Charley Jones, who had just developed a slow-motion camera.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=49}} Seeing his dog being filmed, Duncan became convinced Rin Tin Tin could become the next Strongheart, a successful film dog that lived in his own full-sized stucco [[California bungalow|bungalow]] with its own street address in the [[Hollywood Hills]], separate from the mansion of his owners, who lived a block away next to [[Roy Rogers]].{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=64}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=65}} Duncan later wrote, "I was so excited over the motion-picture idea that I found myself thinking of it night and day."&lt;ref name=DogStar/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Where the North Begins 1923.jpg|thumb|Poster for Rin Tin Tin's star debut, ''[[Where the North Begins]]'' (1923)]]
Duncan walked his dog up and down [[Poverty Row]], talking to anyone in a position to put Rin Tin Tin in film, however modest the role. The dog's first break came when he was asked to replace a camera-shy wolf in ''[[The Man from Hell's River]]'' (1922) featuring [[Wallace Beery]]. The wolf was not performing properly for the director, but under the guidance of Duncan's voice commands, Rin Tin Tin was very easy to work with. When the film was completed, the dog was billed as "Rin Tan".&lt;ref name=Schluesser/&gt; Rin Tin Tin would be cast as a wolf or wolf-hybrid many times in his career because it was much more convenient for filmmakers to work with a trained dog. In another 1922 film titled ''My Dad'', Rin Tin Tin picked up a small part as a household dog. The credits read: "Rin Tin Tin&amp;nbsp;– Played by himself".{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=68}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=69}}

Rin Tin Tin's first starring role was in ''[[Where the North Begins]]'' (1923), playing alongside silent screen actress [[Claire Adams]]. This film was a huge success and has often been credited with saving [[Warner Bros.]] from bankruptcy. It was followed by 24 more screen appearances. Each of these films was very popular, making such a profit for Warner Bros. that Rin Tin Tin was called "the mortgage lifter" by studio insiders.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=81}} A young screenwriter named [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] was involved in creating stories for Rin Tin Tin; the success of the films raised him to the position of respected film producer.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=78-80}} In New York City, Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] gave Rin Tin Tin a key to the city.&lt;ref name=DogStar/&gt;

Rin Tin Tin was much sought after and was signed for endorsement deals. He was featured in ads for Ken-L Ration, Ken-L-Biskit, and Pup-E-Crumbles.&lt;ref name=DogStar/&gt; Warner Bros. got thousands of requests for publicity photographs of Rinty, which were signed with a paw print and a line written by Duncan: "Most faithfully, Rin Tin Tin."&lt;ref name=DogStar/&gt; In the 1920s, Rin Tin Tin's success for Warner Bros. inspired several imitations from other studios looking to cash in on his popularity, notably [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]'s [[Ace the Wonder Dog]], also a German Shepherd dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Basinger |first=Jeanine |authorlink=Jeanine Basinger |chapter=Rin Tin Tin |pages=451–466 |title=Silent Stars |year=1999 |location=Hanover, New Hampshire |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=0-8195-6451-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world, Rin Tin Tin was extremely popular, because as a dog, he was equally well understood by all viewers. At the time, silent films were easily adapted for various countries by simply changing the language of the [[intertitle]]s. Rin Tin Tin's films were widely distributed. By 1927, Rin Tin Tin was the most popular actor with the very sophisticated film audience in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horak |first=Jan-Christopher |title=Rin-Tin-Tin in Berlin or American cinema in Weimar |page=60 |jstor=3815109 |journal=Film History |volume=5 |number=1 |date=March 1993 |publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Susan Orlean]] investigated the Hollywood legend that Rin Tin Tin received the most votes for Best Actor at the first [[Academy Award]] competition in 1929.&lt;ref name=DogStar/&gt; Orlean says that the Academy wished to appear more serious, that they determined to have a human actor win the award. Rin Tin Tin was removed as a choice and the votes were cast once more: German actor [[Emil Jannings]] won the Best Actor award.&lt;ref name=Schluesser&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/books/review/rin-tin-tin-by-susan-orlean-book-review.html |title=Rin Tin Tin: American Hero |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |date=October 20, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although primarily a star of silent films, Rin Tin Tin did appear in four sound features, including the 12-part Mascot Studios chapter-play ''[[The Lightning Warrior]]'' (1931), co-starring with [[Frankie Darro]]. In these films, vocal commands would have been picked up by the microphones, so Duncan likely guided Rin Tin Tin by hand signals.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=104}} Rin Tin Tin and the rest of the crew filmed much of the outdoor action footage for ''The Lightning Warrior'' on the [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California]], known for its huge sandstone boulders and widely recognized as the most heavily filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of the movies.

Rin Tin Tin and Nanette produced at least 48 puppies; Duncan kept two of them, selling the rest or giving them as gifts. [[Greta Garbo]], [[W.K. Kellogg]], and [[Jean Harlow]] each owned one of Rin Tin Tin's descendants.&lt;ref name=DogStar/&gt;

On August 10, 1932, Rin Tin Tin died at Duncan's home on Club View Drive in Los Angeles. Duncan wrote about the death in his unpublished memoir: He heard Rin Tin Tin bark in a peculiar fashion so he went to see what was wrong. He found the dog lying on the ground, moments away from death. Newspapers across the nation carried obituaries. Magazine articles were written about his life, and a special [[Movietone News]] feature was shown to movie audiences. In the press, the death was given a wide variety of fabrications such as Rin Tin Tin dying on the set of the film ''Pride of the Legion'' (where Rin Tin Tin Jr. was working), dying at night, and dying at home on the front lawn in the arms of actress Jean Harlow, who lived on the same street. In a private ceremony, Duncan buried Rin Tin Tin in a bronze casket in his own backyard with a plain wooden cross to mark the location.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=109-112}} Duncan was suffering the financial effects of the [[Great Depression]] and could not afford a finer burial, nor even his own expensive house. He sold his house and quietly arranged to have the dog's body returned to his country of birth for reburial in the [[Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques]], the famous [[pet cemetery]] in the Parisian suburb of [[Asnières-sur-Seine]].&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web |last=Holmes|first=Linda |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/09/24/140746523/rin-tin-tin-from-battlefield-to-hollywood-a-story-of-friendship?ps=cprs |title=Rin Tin Tin: From Battlefield To Hollywood, A Story Of Friendship: Monkey See |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=Monkey See|date=2011-09-24 |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
Between 1930 and 1955, Rin Tin Tin was cast in three different radio series, beginning April 5, 1930 with ''The Wonder Dog'', in which the original Rin Tin Tin performed some of the sound effects until his death in 1932. (Most of the dog noises were performed live on radio by a man named Bob Barker).{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=94}} This 15-minute program was broadcast Saturdays on the [[Blue Network]] at 8:15&amp;nbsp;pm until March 1931 when it moved to Thursdays.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (writer) |title=On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=578 |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-507678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Story lines were often highly unlikely, with Rin Tin Tin saving a group of space-exploring scientists from giant Martians in one episode.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=94}}

In September 1930, the title changed from ''The Wonder Dog'' to ''Rin Tin Tin''. [[Don Ameche]] and Junior McLain starred in the series, which ended June 8, 1933. With [[Ken-L Ration]] as a sponsor, the series continued on CBS from October 5, 1933 until May 20, 1934, airing Sundays at 7:45&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;

The final radio series was broadcast on [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] from January 2, 1955 to December 25, 1955 a 30-minute program heard Sunday evenings. Sponsored by [[Nabisco|National Biscuit]] for [[Shredded Wheat]] and [[Milk-Bone]], the series featured Rin Tin Tin's adventures with the 101st Cavalry in the same manner as the concurrent TV show: ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]''. The radio show also starred [[Lee Aaker]] (born 1943) as Rusty, [[James Brown (Rin Tin Tin)|James Brown]] (1920–1992) as [[Lieutenant]] Ripley "Rip" Masters and [[Joe Sawyer]] (1906–1982) as [[Sergeant]] Biff O'Hara.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;

==Television==
[[File:James Brown fan postcard 1955.jpg|thumb|right|upright||Jim Brown as Lt. Masters in the TV series ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'']]
''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series, ran from October 1954 to May 1959. Duncan's Rin Tin Tin IV was nominally the lead dog, but nearly all of the screen work was performed by a dog named Flame Jr., nicknamed JR (pronounced Jay Are), owned by trainer Frank Barnes. Other dogs that sometimes played TV's Rin Tin Tin included Barnes's dog Blaze and Duncan's dog Hey You from the Rin Tin Tin bloodline. Hey You had suffered an eye injury during his youth; he was used as a stunt dog and for fight scenes.

Her granddaughter, Daphne Hereford, continued the lineage and the legacy of Rin Tin Tin following her grandmother's death on December 17, 1988. Hereford passed the tradition to her daughter, Dorothy Yanchak in July 2011. The current Rin Tin Tin is twelfth in line from the original silent film star and makes personal appearances across the country to promote responsible pet ownership. Rin Tin Tin was the recipient of the 2011 [[American Humane Association]] Legacy award and was honored by the Academy of Arts and Sciences in a special program, ''Hollywood Dogs: From Rin Tin Tin to Uggie'', on June 6, 2012, at the Samuel Goldwin Theatre. Rin Tin Tin continues to make personal appearances across the country and works in film and other ventures.

The Rin Tin Tin bloodline dogs are also trained as [[service dog]]s to provide assistance to special needs children.

==Cultural references==
In 1976, a film was produced loosely based on Rin Tin Tin's debut: ''[[Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9D02E0DB173EE334BC4F51DFB366838D669EDE Eder, Richard. "Review," ''The New York Times''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Producer David V. Picker offered a fee to Herbert B. Leonard but Leonard disagreed with the basic premise of a film ridiculing the famous dog. Leonard sued the filmmakers for infringement on the Rin Tin Tin legacy and lost.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=276}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=277}}

Originally co-produced by Leonard, the 1988–93 Canadian TV series ''[[Katts and Dog]]'' featured the adventures of a police officer and his canine partner. The series was titled ''Rin Tin Tin: K9 Cop'' for its American showings, and in France it was presented as ''Rintintin Junior''. Leonard was funded by the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] whose founder, televangelist [[Pat Robertson]], had been enthusiastic for the idea. Leonard was criticized by his fellow producers for staying with his new wife in Los Angeles rather than helping with the show on location in Canada. Partway through the first season, Robertson said that some of his viewers were deeply concerned that the plot involved a widowed mother who was living unmarried in the same house with the brother of her late husband. Robertson recommended the mother character be killed off to stop the complaints, but Leonard protested such a change. After Leonard quit the show the problematic character was killed off. Though separated from the show, Leonard continued to receive a fee for the screen rights to Rin Tin Tin.{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=284}}{{sfn|Orlean|2011|p=285}}

In 2007, a children's film was produced—''[[Finding Rin Tin Tin]]''—based on the story of Lee Duncan finding Rin Tin Tin on a battlefield in France and making a star of him in Hollywood. The film was the subject of a lawsuit brought in October 2008 by Daphne Hereford who asked a federal court in [[Houston]], Texas, to protect her rights to the Rin Tin Tin trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Mary. "[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6043745.html A pooch to protect]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. October 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled in favor of the filmmakers, declaring the use of the name in the film to be [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Mary.

November 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fictionalized account of Lee Duncan finding and raising Rin Tin Tin is a major part of the novel ''[[Sunnyside (novel)|Sunnyside]]'' by [[Glen David Gold]].

Rin Tin Tin has been featured as a character in many fiction works, including a children's book in which Rin Tin Tin and the other animal characters are able to talk to one another but are unable to talk to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=P.T. |title=Rin Tin Tin and the Lost King |year=2012 |isbn=978-0615651910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, author [[Susan Orlean]] published ''[[Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend]]'', a non-fiction account of Rin Tin Tin.

In October 2011 at the first annual [[American Humane Association]] Hero Dog Awards in Beverly Hills, Rin Tin Tin was honored with the first Hero Dog Legacy Award. [[Mickey Rooney]] narrated a memorial tribute film about Rin Tin Tin. A twelfth-generation Rin Tin Tin legacy dog was there to receive the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.northcountrygazette.org/2011/11/11/hero_dogs/ |title=Hero Dog Awards Airs Tonight |date=November 11, 2011 |newspaper=North Country Gazette |accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rin Tin Tin finds mention in [[Anne Frank]]'s diary in her second entry on June 14, 1942. Frank wishes she had a dog like Rin Tin Tin. She also wrote about the 1924 Rin Tin Tin silent film ''[[The Lighthouse by the Sea]]'' which she and her school friends watched together in her house for her birthday party. According to her the movie was a big hit with her friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frank |first=Anne |authorlink=Anne Frank |title=[[The Diary of a Young Girl]] |publisher=Doubleday |date=1952 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedy singer [[Ray Stevens]] mentions Rin Tin Tin in a re-recorded version of his single ''[[It's Me Again, Margaret]]'', where Stevens replaces the line "I bet you can't guess what I'm doing" with "Wanna hear me bark like Rin Tin Tin??". The revised version of the song turned out to be a hit in 1984.

[[Image:Aardbei muizenschade.jpg|thumb|right|A [[strawberry]] [[aggregate fruit|aggregate]] [[accessory fruit]] damaged by a [[mouse]] eating the seeds ([[achene]]s).]]

'''Seed predation''', often referred to as '''granivory''', is a type of plant-animal interaction in which granivores ('''seed predators''') feed on the [[seeds]] of [[plants]] as a main or exclusive food source,&lt;ref name=hulme&gt;Hulme, P.E. and Benkman, C.W. (2002) "Granivory", pp. 132–154 in ''Plant animal Interactions: An Evolutionary Approach'', ed. C.M. Herrera and O. Pellmyr. Oxford: Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0-632-05267-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in many cases leaving the seeds damaged and not viable. Granivores are found across many families of [[vertebrates]] (especially [[mammals]] and [[birds]]) as well as [[invertebrates]] (mainly [[insects]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.02.110171.002341|title=Seed Predation by Animals|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=2|pages=465|year=1971|last1=Janzen|first1=D H}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, seed predation occurs in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems. Seed predation is commonly divided into two distinctive temporal categories, pre-dispersal and post-dispersal predation, which may involve different strategies and requirements and have different implications at the individual and population level. Nevertheless, regardless of timing, seed predation has great implications for plant population dynamics. To counterbalance effects of predation, plants have evolved defenses such as seed morphology (size, shape, toughness) and chemical defenses ([[secondary compounds]] such as [[tannins]] and [[alkaloids]]) to defend against their seed predators. However, as plants have adapted defenses to seed predation (e.g., chemical compounds), so have seed predators adapted to plant defenses (e.g., ability to detoxify chemical compounds). Thus, many interesting examples of [[coevolution]] arise from this dynamic relationship.

== Seeds and their defenses  ==
[[File:Mouse eating seeds.jpg|thumb|[[House mouse|Mouse]] eating seeds]]
{{further|Plant defense against herbivory|Anti-predator adaptation}}

Plant seeds are important sources of nutrition for animals across most ecosystems. Seeds contain food storage organs (e.g., [[endosperm]]) that provide nutrients to the developing plant embryo ([[cotyledon]]). This makes seeds an attractive food source for animals because they are a highly concentrated and localized nutrient source in relation to other plant parts. 

Seeds of many plants have evolved a variety of [[anti-predator adaptation|defenses to deter predation]] from seed predators. Plants may allocate resources toward physical or chemical defenses. Seeds are often contained inside protective structures or fruit pulp that encapsulate seeds until they are ripe. Other physical defenses include spines, hairs, fibrous seed coats and hard endosperm. Seeds, especially in arid areas, may have a [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] seed coat that can glue soil to seed hiding it from granivores.&lt;ref name="Tiansawat Davis Berhow Zalamea p=e99691"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tiansawat | first=Pimonrat | last2=Davis | first2=Adam S. | last3=Berhow | first3=Mark A. | last4=Zalamea | first4=Paul-Camilo | last5=Dalling | first5=James W. | editor-last=Chen | editor-first=Jin | title=Investment in Seed Physical Defence Is Associated with Species' Light Requirement for Regeneration and Seed Persistence: Evidence from Macaranga Species in Borneo | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=9 | issue=6 | date=2014-06-13 | issn=1932-6203 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099691 | page=e99691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some seeds have evolved strong anti-herbivore chemical compounds. In contrast to physical defenses, chemical defenses in seeds to deter consumption by seed predators by using chemicals that are toxic to granivores or inhibit the digestibility of the seed. These chemicals include toxic non-protein [[amino acid]]s, [[cyanogenic glycoside]]s, [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease]] and amylase inhibitors, and [[hemaglutinin|phytohemaglutinins]].&lt;ref name=hulme/&gt; Seeds face trade-offs between allocation toward defenses and the size and number of seeds produced.  Additionally plants have trade-offs in seed defense allocation between deterring seed predators and attracting seed dispersers.

Plants may reduce the severity of seed predation by making seeds spatially or temporally scarce to granivores. Seed dispersal away from the parent plant is hypothesized to reduce the severity of seed predation.&lt;ref name=jansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=connell/&gt; Seed masting is an example of how plant populations are able to temporally regulate the severity of seed predation.  Masting refers to a concerted abundance of seed production followed by a period of paucity. This strategy has the potential to regulate the size of the population of seed predators.

== Pre- and post-dispersal ==

Seed predation can occur both before and after seed dispersal.&lt;ref name=FedrianiManzoneda2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fedriani, J. M.; Manzoneda, A. |title=Pre- and post-dispersal seed predation by rodents: balance of food and safety |journal=Behavioral Ecology |year=2005 |volume=16 |issue=6 |page=1018 |doi=10.1093/beheco/ari082}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Pre-dispersal===

Pre-dispersal seed predation takes place when seeds are removed from the parent plant before dispersal, and it has been most often reported in invertebrates, birds, and in granivorous rodents that clip fruits directly from trees and herbaceous plants. Post-dispersal seed predation arises once seeds have been released from the parent plant. Birds, rodents, and ants are known to be among the most pervasive postdispersal seed predators. Furthermore, postdispersal seed predation can take place at two contrasting stages: predation on the "seed rain" and predation on the "seed bank". Whereas predation on the seed rain occurs when animals prey on released seeds usually flush with the ground surface, predation on the seed bank takes place after seeds have been incorporated deeply into the soil.&lt;ref name=hulme/&gt; Nevertheless, there are important vertebrate pre-dispersal predators, especially birds and small mammals.
 
===Post-dispersal===

Post-dispersal seed predation is extremely common in virtually all ecosystems. Given the heterogeneity in both resource type (seeds from different species), quality (seeds of different ages and/or different status of integrity or decomposition) and location (seeds are scattered and hidden in the environment), most post-dispersal predators have generalist habits.&lt;ref name=hulme/&gt; These predators belong to a diverse array of animals, such as ants, beetles, crabs, fish, rodents and birds. The assemblage of post-dispersal seed predators varies considerably among ecosystems.&lt;ref name=hulme/&gt;

===Differences===

Both pre- and post-dispersal seed predation are common. Pre-dispersal predators differ from post-dispersal predators in most often being specialists, adapted to clustered resources (on the plant). They use specific cues like plant chemistry (volatile compounds), color, and size to locate seeds, and their short life cycles often match the production of seeds by the host plant. Insect groups containing many pre-dispersal seed predators are [[Coleoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Hymenoptera]] and [[Lepidoptera]].&lt;ref name=hulme/&gt;

== Effects on plant demography ==
{{further|Janzen-Connell hypothesis}}

The complex relationship between seed predation and plant demography is an important topic of plant-animal interactive studies. Plant population structure and size over time is closely associated with the effectiveness at which seed predators locate, consume, and disperse seeds. In many cases this relationship is dependent upon the type of seed predator (specialist vs. generalist) or the particular habitat in which the interaction is taking place. The role of seed predation on plant demography may be either detrimental or in particular cases actually beneficial to plant populations. 

The [[Janzen-Connell hypothesis |Janzen-Connell model]] concerns how seed density and survival respond to distance from the parent tree and differential rates of seed predation. Seed density is hypothesized to decrease as distance from the parent tree increases. Where seeds are most abundant under the parent tree, seed predation is predicted to be at its highest. As distance from the parent tree increases, seed abundance and thus seed predation are predicted to decrease as seed survival increases.&lt;ref name=jansen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Janzen, D. H. |year=1970 |title= Herbivores and the number of tree species in tropical foresets |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=104 |issue=940 |pages=592–595 |url=http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/courses/Classics-2003/ReadingsPDFs/9_Nov6_Dispersal/PDFs/Janzen%201970.pdf |doi=10.1086/282687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=connell&gt;Connell, J.H. (1971) "On the role of natural enemies in preventing competitive excusion in some marine animals and in rainforest trees", pp. 298–312 in ''Dynamics of Populations'', ed. P.J. den Boer and G.R. Gradwell. Wageningen: Center for Agricultural Publishing and Documentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which seed predation influences plant populations may vary by whether a plant species is safe site limited or seed limited. If a population is safe site limited it is likely that seed predation will have little impact to the success of the population. In safe site limited populations increased seed abundance does not translate into increased seedling recruitment. However, if a population is seed limited, seed predation has a better chance of negatively affecting the plant population by decreasing seedling recruitment. Maron and Simms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s004420050210 |title=Effect of seed predation on seed bank size and seedling recruitment of bush lupine (''Lupinus arboreus'') |journal=Oecologia |volume=111 |pages=76 |year=1997 |last1=Maron |first1=John L. |last2=Simms |first2=Ellen L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; found both safe site limited and seed limited populations depending on the habitat in which the seed predation was taking place. In dune habitats seed predators (deer mice) were limiting seedling recruitment in the population, thus negatively affecting the population. However, in grassland habitat the seed predator had little effect on the plant population because it was safe site limited.  

In many cases seed predators support plant populations by dispersing seeds away from the parent plant, in effect supporting gene flow between populations. Other seed predators collect seeds and then store or cache them for later consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, J. L. (1977) ''Population Biology of Plants'', New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case that the seed predator is unable to locate the buried or hidden seed there is a chance that it will later germinate and grow, supporting the species dispersal. Generalist (vertebrate) seed predators may also aid the plant in other indirect ways, for instance by inducing top-down control on host-specific seed predators (termed "intra-guild predation"), and as such negating Janzen-Connell type effects and so benefiting the plant in competition with other plant species.&lt;ref name="VisserMuller-Landau2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visser |first1=Marco D. |last2=Muller-Landau |first2=Helene C. |last3=Wright |first3=S.

'''Simulation governance''' is a managerial function concerned with assurance of reliability of information generated by [[numerical simulation]].  The term was introduced in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;Szabó B. and Actis R. Simulation governance: New technical requirements for software tools in computational solid mechanics International Workshop on Verification and Validation in Computational Science University of Notre Dame 17–19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and specific technical requirements were addressed from the perspective of mechanical design in 2012 &lt;ref&gt;Szabó B. and Actis R. Simulation governance: Technical requirements for mechanical design. Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 249–252 158–168, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Its strategic importance was addressed in 2015 &lt;ref&gt;Meintjes K.  [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/bm_jan_15_1/ Simulation Governance: Managing Simulation as a Strategic Capability]. NAFEMS Benchmark Magazine, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imbert J-F.  [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/nwc15_100/ Simulation Governance - Building confidence, a key dimension of simulation strategy]. NAFEMS World Congress NWC15 San Diego, June 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;.  At the [https://www.nafems.org/congress/ 2017 NAFEMS World Congress] in Stockholm simulation governance was identified as the first of eight “[https://www.nafems.org/congress/thebigissues/ big issues]” in [[numerical simulation]].

Simulation governance is concerned with (a) selection and adoption of the best available simulation technology, (b) formulation of [[mathematical models]], (c) management of experimental data, (d) data and solution [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models#Verification|verification]] procedures, and (e) revision of mathematical models in the light of new information collected from physical experiments and field observations &lt;ref&gt;Oberkampf WL and Pilch M. [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/r0121/ Simulation Verification and Validation for Managers]. NAFEMS, 2017. {{ISBN|978-1-910643-33-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A plan for simulation governance has to be tailored to fit the mission of each organization or department within an organization: If that mission is to apply established rules of design and [[certification]] then emphasis is on solution verification and [[standardization]]. If, on the other hand, that mission is to formulate design rules, or make condition-based maintenance decisions, then [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models|verification, validation]] and [[uncertainty quantification]] must be part of the plan.

'''Abbott Vaughn Meader''' (March 20, 1936 – October 29, 2004) was an American comedian, [[impersonator]], musician, and film actor.

Meader began his career as a musician but later found fame in the early 1960s after the release of the 1962 comedy record ''[[The First Family (album)|The First Family]]''. The album spoofed President [[John F. Kennedy]] – who was played by Meader – and became the fastest selling album in history {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} and went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1963. At the peak of his popularity, he performed his Kennedy impersonation on variety shows and in nightclubs around the country and was profiled in several magazines.

Meader's career success came to an abrupt end after President Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated in November 1963]]. ''The First Family'' was quickly pulled from stores and Meader’s bookings were canceled. He attempted to take his career in a different direction by performing non-Kennedy related comedy and released a new comedy album, ''Have Some Nuts!!!'', in early 1964. However, sales for the album were low 
as public interest in Meader had waned. His career never rebounded as he was [[Typecasting (acting)|too closely associated]] with President Kennedy. Meader eventually returned to his native Maine where he resumed performing music and managed a pub.

==Early life==
Meader was born in [[Waterville, Maine]] during one of the worst floods ever to hit [[New England]]: he often said he was born on "the night the West Bridge washed out". He was the only child of Charles Vaughn Meader, a millworker, and Mary Ellen Abbott. After his father broke his neck and drowned in a diving accident when Meader was only eighteen months old, his mother moved to Boston to work as a cocktail waitress, leaving Meader behind with relatives. A sometimes unruly and troubled child, Meader was sent to live with his mother in Boston at the age of five but she had become an alcoholic, and placed him in a children's home.

After shuttling among several schools in Massachusetts and Maine, Meader eventually graduated from [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] High School in 1953. He [[military service|enlisted]] in the [[United States Army]], and while stationed in [[Mannheim]], [[West Germany]] as a laboratory technician formed a country music band – the Rhine Rangers – with fellow soldiers, later adding impressions of popular singers to his repertoire. Meader married the German-born Vera Heller in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Drobnicki, Meader, (Abbott) Vaughn," in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, Thematic Series: The 1960s'' (Scribner's, 2003), Vol. 2, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Meader began his career in entertainment as a singer and piano player. Upon his return from Germany, he began a comedy act in New York City, where he discovered his skill at impersonating Kennedy. With his New England [[regional accents of English speakers|accent]] naturally close to Kennedy's familiar, and often parodied, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] accent, he needed to adjust his voice only slightly to sound like the President. Meader also mastered the facial expressions that allowed him to bear a passable resemblance to Kennedy.

===''The First Family''===

On October 22, 1962, Meader joined writers Bob Booker and Earle Doud and a small cast of entertainers to record ''The First Family''. The album poked fun at Kennedy's [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]] history; the [[rocking chair]]s he used for his [[back pain]]; the Kennedy family's well-known athleticism, [[American football|football]] games and family togetherness; children in the [[White House]]; and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Kennedy]]'s soft-spoken nature and her redecoration of the White House. ''The First Family'' became the fastest-selling record in the history of the United States. It sold 1.2&amp;nbsp;million copies during the first two weeks of its release, and ultimately sold 7.5&amp;nbsp;million copies.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/30/national/30meader.html|title=Vaughn Meader, Star as Kennedy Mimicker, Dies at 68|last=Fox|first=Margailt|date=October 30, 2004|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy himself was said to have given copies of the album as Christmas gifts, and once greeted a [[Democratic National Committee]] group by saying, "Vaughn Meader was busy tonight, so I came myself."&lt;ref name="WAPost"&gt;{{cite news | title= Vaughn Meader, Satirist of Kennedy Family, Dies |  url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A14717-2004Oct31.html | accessdate=April 3, 2006 | date=November 1, 2004 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one press conference, Kennedy was asked if the album had produced "annoyment {{sic}} or enjoyment." He jokingly responded, "I listened to Mr. Meader's record and, frankly, I thought it sounded more like [[Ted Kennedy|Teddy]] than it did me. So, now ''he's'' annoyed."&lt;ref&gt;Clip from ''JFK: As It Happened,'' broadcast on the A&amp;E network November 22, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy told [[Benjamin Bradlee]] that "parts of it were amusing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradlee|first=Benjamin| title=Conversations with Kennedy| year=1975| publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.| isbn=0-393-08722-0|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, such as Thomas C. Reeves' ''A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy'', state that President Kennedy was upset with the parodies, and that First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] was furious, even demanding that the President keep Meader off radio and television.

Still in his 20s, Meader was suddenly famous, rich, and in constant demand. He was profiled in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazines, appeared on network television variety shows such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]],'' ''[[The Jack Paar Program]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'' and ''[[Hootenanny]]''.  Though a series of tour dates in early 1963 were notably unsuccessful (''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] '' reported that he "bombed" in Pittsburgh, and only 742 people showed up in Philadelphia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rolontz|first1=Bob|title=The ‘First Family’ Story - WOW!|journal=Billboard|date=February 2, 1963|volume=75|issue=5|page=12|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=P0UEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; he still played to packed houses in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. ''The First Family'' won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1963. That March, Meader recorded a follow-up album, ''The First Family Volume Two'', a combination of spoken comedy and songs performed by actors and comedians portraying members of the President's family and White House staff. The sequel was released in the spring of 1963, and while not as successful as the first volume, still sold hundreds of thousands of copies.

In July 1963, Meader left Cadence Records and Booker/Dowd to sign with [[MGM Records]]. Meader planned to record general satire and abandon his JFK impersonations.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgsEAAAAMBAJ|page=6|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination aftermath===
In November 1963, Meader was busy recording a new comedy record, written by a different group of writers and not involving his Kennedy impersonation. On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated in Dallas, Texas]], and Kennedy's death effectively ended Meader's career. Copies of ''The First Family'' were pulled from stores and a JFK-related Christmas single by Meader that had been released by MGM's [[Verve Records]] shortly before the assassination was quickly withdrawn. Appearances that were already booked were canceled, including one for the [[Grammy Awards]] ceremony. An episode of ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'' was also pulled, which Meader filmed one week before the assassination. The episode was never aired and was reportedly destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Comedy/JoeyBishopShow.htm|title=The Joey Bishop Show (1961–62)|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Jacob |title=Spoken Word: Postwar American Phonograph Cultures|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-26703-6|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meader reportedly first learned of President Kennedy's assassination after hailing a taxicab in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The driver, recognizing his celebrity passenger, asked "Did you hear about Kennedy?" Meader thought the driver was telling a joke and responded "No, how does it go?" The driver then informed him of the sad news, and from the taxi's radio Meader heard the breaking news bulletins for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/66030/surprising-story-famed-jfk-impersonator-vaughn-meader-and-why-youve-never-heard-him&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several sources, standup comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] went on with his November 22 nightclub show as scheduled. Just hours after Kennedy's death, Bruce walked onstage, stood silently for several moments, then said sadly, "Boy, is Vaughn Meader fucked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlfjXproBIEC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=vaughan+meader+lenny+bruce+fucked&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8eD_a03Mav&amp;sig=7S-ZO5KsdZV6GiIx1jlwCOfdbe4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XsenTcT7MYi4sQPX4_H5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | work=autobiography | first=Joe | last=Queenan | date=April 20, 1997 | title=Closing Time: A Memoir}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joke proved true. Meader discovered that he was so completely [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a Kennedy impersonator that he could not find anyone willing to hire him for any of his other talents.

His non-Kennedy album for Verve Records, ''Have Some Nuts!!!'', came out to minimal attention in early 1964. A similar follow-up ''If The Shoe Fits...'' was released in late 1964, and included [[sketch comedy|sketches]] on almost everything except the Kennedys, but sales were meager at best. Meader's income evaporated, new-found friends and associates stopped calling, and by 1965 Meader was virtually broke. Sinking into depression, he became addicted to alcohol and drugs, and was forced to take whatever work he could find.

He reunited with Earle Doud in 1971 for an album called ''The Second Coming'', a comedic look at what life would be like for Jesus if he had returned to earth around the time of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', but airplay and sales were virtually nonexistent.

==Later years==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Meader tried several times to revive his career, but achieved only moderate success, and then mostly outside of show business. He appeared briefly in the 1975 movie ''[[Linda Lovelace for President]]'' and has a very brief cameo on the 1981 [[Rich Little]] comedy album, ''The First Family Rides Again'', which both parodied [[Ronald Reagan]] and paid homage to the original ''The First Family'' album. Both the Kennedy and Reagan ''First Family'' albums were produced by Earle Doud.

Eventually, Meader resumed a career in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], becoming a popular local performer in his native Maine. During the mid-1970s, he performed in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], mostly at a small tavern known as the Storefront Congregation, under the name "Abbott Meader and the Honky-Tonk Angels." Meader sang and played piano.

==Personal life and death==
Meader was married four times. He married his fourth wife, Sheila Colbath, in 1984. They remained married until his death.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

On October 29, 2004, Meader died of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] at the age of 68.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

==Legacy==
After Meader's death, he has been credited for having broken new ground in the area of political humor, particularly in impersonations of the President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mocking of the President|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/presidential%20satire |website=The Attic|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D6163DF932A35751C0A961948260 |title=Cabaret: Jim Morris'S Impressions |work=New York Times |date=February 1, 1987 |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, nearly two years after Meader's death, the independent documentary ''First Impersonator'' premiered at the [[Maine International Film Festival]] in Waterville, Maine, Meader's birth town.&lt;ref name="firstimpersonator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstimpersonator.com/Main.html |title=''First Impersonator'' website |publisher=firstimpersonator.com|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film chronicled Meader's life and death, his rise to fame and equally famous fall, and his influence on today's political impersonators.

'''Walter John de la Mare''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OM|CH}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ə|ˌ|m|ɛər}};&lt;ref&gt;Alec Guinness, ''Blessings in Disguise'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 25 April 1873 – 22 June 1956) was a British poet, short story writer and novelist. He is probably best remembered for his [[children's literature|works for children]], for his poem "The Listeners",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Reid-Walsh |first=Jacqueline |year=1988 |title=The Burning-Glass: A Developmental Study of Walter de la Mare's Poetry  |publisher=McGill University |pages=51–56 |URL=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/thesisfile75903.pdf |place=Montreal |format=PDF}} Includes the poem itself and analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; and for a highly acclaimed selection of subtle psychological horror stories, amongst them "Seaton's Aunt" and "All Hallows".

In  1921, his novel ''[[Memoirs of a Midget]]'' won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/events/tait-black/winners/fiction "Fiction winners"]. James Tait Black Prizes: Previous Winners. The University of Edinburgh. Retrieved 11 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and his post-war ''[[Collected Stories for Children]]'' won the 1947 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for British children's books.&lt;ref name=medal1947/&gt;

==Life==

De la Mare was born in Kent at 83 Maryon Road, [[Charlton, Greenwich|Charlton]]&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Whistler, "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=32771&amp;back= Mare, Walter John de la (1873–1956)]", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct. 2006. Retrieved 2 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (now part of the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]]), partly descended from a family of French [[Huguenot]]s, and was educated at [[St Paul's Cathedral School]]. He was born to James Edward de la Mare, a principal at the [[Bank of England]], and Lucy Sophia Browning (James's second wife), daughter of Scottish [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]] and author Dr Colin Arrott Browning. The suggestion that Lucy was related to poet [[Robert Browning]] has been found to be incorrect. He had two brothers, Francis Arthur Edward and James Herbert, and four sisters Florence Mary, Constance Eliza, Ethel (who died in infancy), and Ada Mary. De la Mare preferred to be known as 'Jack' by his family and friends as he disliked the name Walter.

He worked from 1890 in the statistics department of the London office of [[Standard Oil]] for eighteen years to support his family, but nevertheless found time to write. In 1908, through the efforts of Sir [[Henry Newbolt]] he received a [[Civil List]] pension which enabled him to concentrate on writing.

In 1892, de la Mare joined the Esperanza Amateur Dramatics Club, where he met and fell in love with Elfrida Ingpen, the leading lady, who was ten years older than he. They were married on 4 August 1899, and they went on to have four children: Richard Herbert Ingpen, Colin, Florence and Lucy Elfrida de la Mare. The new family lived in [[Beckenham]] and [[Anerley]] from 1899 till 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Beckenham heritage, "[http://www.beckenhamheritagegroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Walter-de-la-Mare.pdf= Beckenham period]"&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Beckenham at Mackenzie Road that the children were born; his first book of poems, ''Songs of Childhood'', published (under the name Walter Ramal); and ''Henry Brocken'' written. Their house at Anerley in south London was the scene of many parties, notable for imaginative games of [[charades]].&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Denton, "[http://www.norwoodsociety.co.uk/book-reviews/179-walter-de-la-mare-poet-of-anerley-and-south-east-london.html Walter de la Mare – Poet of Anerley and South East London]", The Norwood Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, his wife Elfrida was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] and spent the rest of her life as an invalid, eventually dying in 1943. From 1940 until his death, de la Mare lived in [[South End House, Montpelier Row]], [[Twickenham]], the same street on which [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] had lived a century earlier. For the ''Collected Stories for Children'' (Faber &amp; Faber, 1947), he won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].&lt;ref name=medal1947/&gt; It was the first collection to win the award.

De la Mare suffered from a [[coronary thrombosis]] in 1947 and died of another in 1956. He spent his final year mostly bed-ridden, being cared for by a nurse whom he loved but never had a physical relationship with.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;James Campbell, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/10/booksforchildrenandteenagers.featuresreviews A kind of magic], ''The Guardian'', 10 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes are buried in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], where he had once been a choirboy.

De la Mare described two distinct "types" of imagination – although "aspects" might be a better term: the childlike and the boylike. It was at the border between the two that [[Shakespeare]], [[Dante]], and the rest of the great poets lay.

De la Mare claimed that all children fall into the category of having a childlike imagination at first, which is usually replaced at some point in their lives. He explained in the lecture "[[Rupert Brooke]] and the Intellectual Imagination"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = de la Mare | first1 = Walter | title = Rupert Brooke and the Intellectual Imagination | publisher = Sidgwick &amp; Jackson | year = 1919 | location = London | url = https://archive.org/details/rupertbrookethei00delauoft | accessdate = 29 January 2014 | archiveurl = https://archive.org/details/rupertbrookethei00delauoft | archivedate= 29 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=intellectual}} that children "are not bound in by their groping senses. Facts to them are the liveliest of chameleons. ... They are contemplatives, solitaries, [[fakir]]s, who sink again and again out of the noise and fever of existence and into a waking vision."  His biographer Doris Ross McCrosson summarises this passage, "Children are, in short, visionaries." This visionary view of life can be seen as either vital creativity and ingenuity, or fatal disconnection from reality (or, in a limited sense, both).

The increasing intrusions of the external world upon the mind, however, frighten the childlike imagination, which "retires like a shocked snail into its shell". From then onward the boyish imagination flourishes, the "intellectual, analytical type".

By adulthood (de la Mare proposed), the childlike imagination has either retreated for ever or grown bold enough to face the real world. Thus emerge the two extremes of the [[spectrum]] of adult minds: the mind moulded by the boylike is "[[logical]]" and "[[deductive]]". That shaped by the childlike becomes "[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]". For de la Mare, "The one knows that beauty is truth, the other reveals that truth is beauty." Yet another way he puts it is that the visionary's source of poetry is within, while the intellectual's sources are without – external – in "action, knowledge of things, and experience" (McCrosson's terms). De la Mare hastens to add that this does not make the intellectual's poetry any less good, but it is clear where his own preference lies.{{efn |name=intellectual}}

==''Come Hither''==
''Come Hither'' was an anthology, edited by de la Mare, mostly of poetry with some prose. It has a [[frame story]], and can be read on several levels. It was first published in 1923, and was a success; further editions followed. Alongside children's literature it includes a selection of the leading [[Georgian poets]] (from de la Mare's perspective).

==Supernaturalism==
Walter de la Mare was also a notable writer of [[ghost story|ghost stories]]. His collections ''[[Eight Tales]]'', ''The Riddle and Other Stories'', ''The Connoisseur and Other Stories'', ''On the Edge'' and ''The Wind Blows Over'' contain several ghost stories each.

De la Mare's supernatural horror writings were a favourite of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], who in his classic study ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]'' remarked that "he is able to put into his occasional fear-studies a keen potency which only a rare master can achieve",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/shil.aspx essays at hplovecraft.com]&lt;/ref&gt; especially praising de la Mare's novel ''The Return'' and his stories "Seaton's Aunt", "The Tree", "Out of the Deep", "Mr Kempe", "A Recluse" and "All Hallows". [[Gary William Crawford]] has described de la Mare's supernatural fiction for adults as being "among the finest to appear in the first half of this century", whilst noting the disparity between the high quality and low quantity of de la Mare's mature horror stories.&lt;ref name="gwc"&gt;Gary William Crawford, "On the Edge: the Ghost Stories of Walter de la Mare" in [[Darrell Schweitzer]], ed., ''Discovering Classic Horror Fiction I'', Wildside Press, 1992, pp. 53–56. {{ISBN|1-58715-002-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable de la Mare ghost stories are "A:B:O", "Crewe", "The Green Room", "Winter", "The House", "Strangers &amp; Pilgrims" and "An Anniversary".

Several later writers of supernatural fiction, including [[Robert Aickman]], [[Ramsey Campbell]],&lt;ref name="gwc" /&gt; [[David A. McIntee]] and [[Reggie Oliver]], have cited de la Mare's ghost stories as highly inspirational. The horror scholar [[S. T. Joshi]] has said that de la Mare's supernatural fiction "should always have an audience that will shudder apprehensively at its horror and be moved to somber reflection by its pensive philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nE6cFX-iE0sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Return, Walter De la Mare, at books.google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

For children, de la Mare wrote the fairy tale ''The Three Mulla Mulgars'' (1910, AKA ''The Three Royal Monkeys''), praised by the literary historian Julia Briggs as a "neglected masterpiece"&lt;ref&gt;Julia Briggs, "Transitions", in [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]], ed., ''Children's literature: an illustrated history'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 181. {{ISBN|0-19-212320-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the critic [[Brian Stableford]] as a "classic animal fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;"De la Mare, Walter" in Brian Stableford,
''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature''. Scarecrow Press, 2005, pp. 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Adams]] said it was his favorite novel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n3quw/i_am_richard_adams_author_of_watership_down/ccf3r28 Reddit AMA, Sept. 25, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Joan Aiken]] cited some of his short stories, such as "The Almond Tree" and "Sambo and the Snow Mountains", for their sometimes unexplained quality, which she also employed in her own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Writers, Critics, and Children |author=Joan Aiken |editor= Geoff Fox |editor2= Graham Hammond |editor3= Terry Jones |editor4= Frederic Smith |editor5= Kenneth Sterck |year=1976 |publisher=Agathon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-87586-054-0 |pages=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=November 2012 |how does this fit here?}}

De la Mare also wrote two supernatural novels, ''Henry Brocken'' (1904) and ''The Return'' (1910). His poem "The Ghost Chase" appeared in [[Punch magazine|''Punch'']] magazine for 26 March 1941 and was illustrated by [[Rowland Emett]].

==References in other works==

De la Mare's play ''Crossings'' has an important role in [[Robertson Davies]]' novel ''[[The Manticore]]''. In 1944, when the protagonist David Staunton is sixteen, de la Mare's play is produced by the pupils of his sister's school in Toronto, Canada. Staunton falls deeply in love with the girl playing the main role – a first love which would have a profound effect on the rest of his life.

==Notes==
{{notelist |25em |notes=

{{efn |name=intellectual |1=
In the lecture "Rupert Brooke and the Intellectual Imagination", de la Mare used the term "imagination" for both the intellectual and the visionary. To simplify and clarify his language, de la Mare generally used the more conventional "[[reason]]" and "imagination" when discussing the same idea elsewhere.}}
