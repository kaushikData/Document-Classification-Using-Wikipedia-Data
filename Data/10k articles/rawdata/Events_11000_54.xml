The '''Libyan hostage situation''' began on the morning of the [[Murder of Yvonne Fletcher|murder of WPC Fletcher]], 17 April 1984 and lasted until 5 February 1985 (294 days). In accordance with the hostage release agreement, reporting on the incident was restricted until the fall of Gadaffi in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Timeline ==

'''March 1984'''

Four Libyan nationals were arrested on charges following explosions at Manchester and Heathrow airports in the UK and were remanded in custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_v87/ai_4679424/ Libya – statement by Larry Pressler in a session of the UN General Assembly on November 19, 1986], [[CBS]] Interactive Business Network Resource Library&lt;/ref&gt;

'''17 April 1984'''

[[Murder of Yvonne Fletcher|WPC Yvonne Fletcher]] was hit by a bullet from a burst of machine-gun fire from within the Libyan Peoples' Bureau (Libyan Embassy) in St James's Sq., London. She died shortly afterwards.

That evening, Doug Ledingham, the airport manager for British Caledonian Airways at Tripoli Universal Airport, Libya, was arrested by soldiers.

'''17 to 27 April'''

There was a standoff between the Libyan and British governments over the pursuit of who shot WPC Fletcher. The standoff resulted in the breaking of diplomatic relations by Britain with Libya, and the return to Libya under diplomatic immunity of the occupants of the Libyan Peoples' Bureau in London.  Rumours abounded at the time as to the fate of the person who is alleged to have fired the fatal shots from the Libyan People's Bureau. In 1986, a British businessman who had worked for Colonel Gaddafi's regime reported WPC Fletcher's killer had been hanged as soon as he returned to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=BBC | series = On this Date | chapter = Stories | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/17/newsid_2488000/2488369.stm | title = Libyan embassy shots kill policewoman | date = 17 April 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the breaking of diplomatic relations with Libya, the British Embassy in Tripoli was evacuated by the British and ransacked by the Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=BBC | series = On this Date | chapter = Stories | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/27/newsid_2502000/2502565.stm | title = 1984: Libyan embassy siege ends | date =  27 April 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; A skeleton staff of British diplomats took up office in the Italian Embassy.

'''14–16 May 1984'''

Four further British men in Libya were rounded up and detained as hostages against the four arrested Libyan nationals in Britain by those claiming to be officials of the [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi regime]]. The men in order of capture were: Michael Berdinner, Alan Russell, Malcolm Anderson and Robin Plummer. At first, Allen Russell and Malcolm Anderson were held at a separate location where they were questioned and beaten. Ledingham, Berdinner and Plummer (Plummer in solitary confinement) were in the same facility, the Italian Mansion, a building approximately 400 yards distant from the Italian Embassy.

'''12 June 1984'''

A month after being taken hostage, the five men were allowed a meeting with the British Second Consul, George Anderson, who was able to offer only pastoral care and contact with home, but no suggestion of release. It was clear by this time, however, that the men were being held as hostages by one of Col Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees, in defiance of international law. Return to their respective prisons was followed by little or no improvement in the hostages' circumstances.

'''19 July 1984'''

A second meeting with George Anderson resulted in all the hostages being put into one location, the Italian Mansion, and being fed an improved diet and given medical attention. This improvement in circumstances was accompanied by a slow but inexorable descent into gloom of the hostages isolated from all news of the outside world.

Meanwhile, in Britain, unbeknownst to the hostages, their families, notably Pat Plummer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Selena Scott]]|date= 3 September 1984|title= Selena Scott interviews Pat Plummer|medium= Television production|publisher=[[ITN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carole Russell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=October 1984 |title= After Carole's visit to Libya|medium= Television production|publisher=[[Anglia News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; were working tirelessly with [[Kate Adie]] of the BBC and [[Brent Sadler]] of ITN to keep the hostages' plight in the media to keep the situation in the news and the profile high on the government's agenda. By now, the families were being kept up to date on a daily basis by contacts within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London as to the stalemate between Libya and Britain, with a continual decline in international relations between Libya and most of the rest of the world.

'''Summer 1984'''

In London, a committee in parliament was held to determine whether or not what the British government had done over the Libyan hostage situation was reasonable.  The committee concluded that in the circumstances, the British government had done all it reasonably could in the light of what little was known at the time.

'''7 August 1984'''

The Libyans allowed family members to visit the hostages.  These visits brought unofficial news of the, as yet, publicly undisclosed involvement of [[Terry Waite]], the Special Envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, of the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Waite]], ''Taken on Trust'', 1993, Hodder and Stoughton, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1 September 1984'''

Doug Ledingham and George Bush, another prisoner, arrested and detained on bona fide charges unrelated to the Libyan hostage situation, were freed and allowed home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=2 September 1984 |title= Doug Ledingham returns home, Pat Plummer insists the government do more|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of their release, British television news was granted access to and showed the world for the first time, detail of the hostage situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Brent Sadler]]|date=1 September 1984 |title= New moves could help the four Britons held in Libya and the two who come home tomorrow|medium= Television production|publisher=[[ITN News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''17 October 1984'''

Two of the wives of the hostages, Pat Plummer and Carole Russell, attended a meeting with the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The two wives petitioned for a representative of the British Government to go to Libya and start negotiations for the release of the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Tony Scase|date=17 October 1984 |title= Post meeting with Margaret Thatcher|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC Look East]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting was soon followed by the arrival in Libya of Terry Waite.

'''21 October 1984'''

Alan Russell and Malcolm Anderson were removed from the Italian Mansion and taken to the Libyan courts, where they were charged with transporting state secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=21 October 1984 |title= Russell and Anderson charged with espionage|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''10–18 November 1984'''

Terry Waite was in Libya. The hostage situation showed no signs of thawing, in spite of national and international efforts to secure the release of the hostages and the intervention at a pastoral level of Waite.

'''13–14 December 1984 '''

Allen Russell was placed on trial and charged with sharing state secrets with British journalists. Robin Plummer seized the opportunity to speak to the press post being question and states his innocence and makes a plea for warm clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=14 December 1984 |title= Wives plead to Gaddafi and Plummer pleas for warm clothes|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC Look East]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''24 December 1984'''

The four men were confirmed as political hostages by Gaddafi. Waite held a Christmas carol service with the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=24 December 1984 |title= A difficult Christmas|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''6 January 1985'''

Col Gaddafi himself placed the matter of the remaining hostages before the members of the Basic and General Peoples' Congresses, the system of democracy prevalent in Libya at the time, for a decision on the release of the hostages.

'''1 February 1985'''

Then WPC Fletcher's memorial was unveiled temporarily disrupting negotiations and sent a very clear message to the Libyans.

'''5 February 1985'''

The Congresses voted by an overwhelming majority to release the hostages. But there were conditions to the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=5 February 1985 |title= Press Conference in Libya to release hostages|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]] Breakfast}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release was however subject to a few days' delay, for undisclosed reasons.

'''7 February 1985'''

After almost nine months (294 days), the hostages arrived back in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=7 February 1985 |title= Former Hostages arrive at Gatwick|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]] Breakfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions for release ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}

The conditions were as follows:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
#Britain should undertake not to support "stray dogs" (political exiles),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/28/politics.libya Gadaffi still hunts 'stray dogs' in UK], Martin Bright, ''[[The Observer]]'', Sunday 28 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}} to hand them over, and to stop antagonistic acts against the Libyan people;
#British Government to work for release of the Libyan prisoners in the UK;
#The Anglican Church to undertake to look after Libyan students in Britain and to endeavour to secure release of Libyan prisoners;
#British Government to stop anti-Libyan propaganda channelled through British media;
#Her Majesty's Government to undertake to treat Libyans in accordance with international law.

== Aftermath ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
An interpretation of Condition 4 could include a complete absence in any British-controlled media of any reference to the Libyan hostage situation for fear that any such reference might be construed by the Libyan authorities as a breach of Condition 4. In accordance with this interpretation, there has been almost no reference to the hostage situation in literature since the time of the release. Most references that state the history of Libya at the time make reference to the murder of WPC Fletcher and then make no reference whatsoever to the hostage situation, skipping instead to the bombing of Libya by the Americans in 1986.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

On the evening of July 30, a severe thunderstorm moved into the area of Ellicott City where it dumped an estimated {{convert|6|in|cm}} of rain in two hours. The [[flash flood]] that resulted inflicted severe damage to the area primarily on [[Maryland Route 144#Ellicott City – Baltimore|Main Street]] ([[Maryland Route 144]]).&lt;ref name=Rector/&gt;  Flooding damaged many homes, businesses, sidewalks, and landmarks, including the city's landmark clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Justin|last=Berk|format=video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgiddVgBZlQ|title=Flooding In Historic Ellicott City July 30 2016 Takes Out The Clock|date=2016-07-30|accessdate=2018-02-01|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Larry Hogan]] declared a [[state of emergency]] and at least two people were confirmed to have died (Jessica Watsula, 35, and Joseph A.

A [[constitutional crisis]] began in [[Sri Lanka]] when President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] appointed former president and member of parliament [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] as [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|prime minister]] on 26 October 2018 before formally dismissing the incumbent [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]], resulting in two concurrent prime ministers. Wickremesinghe and the [[United National Party]] (UNP) viewed the appointment as illegal, and he refused to resign.&lt;ref name="Time 2910"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Meixler |first1=Eli |title=Sri Lankan Strongman's Return Sparks 'Constitutional Crisis' |url=http://time.com/5437457/sri-lanka-mahinda-rajapaksa-president-crisis/ |website=Time |accessdate=11 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Rajapaksa presidency===
The presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, from 2005 to 2015 was an increasingly authoritarian regime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Guardian view on the end of the Rajapaksa era in Sri Lanka {{!}} Editorial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/guardian-view-on-end-of-rajapaksa-era-sri-lanka-sirisena |website=The Guardian |accessdate=10 November 2018  |date=11 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912212923/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/guardian-view-on-end-of-rajapaksa-era-sri-lanka-sirisena# |archive-date=12 September 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; characterised by the diminishing [[Human rights in Sri Lanka|human rights in the country]], [[nepotism]], weakening of government institutions, slow progress of national reconciliation in the [[aftermath of the Sri Lankan Civil War]], and [[China–Sri Lanka relations|close ties to China]].&lt;ref name="NYT 2610" /&gt; Before serving as president, Rajapaksa also served as Prime Minister. In 2009, Rajapaksa ended the 27-year long [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], but has been accused of [[war crime]]s and human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="BBC 2610" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 211"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bastians |first1=Dharisha |last2=Gettleman |first2=Jeffrey |title=Bribery Accusations Deepen Turmoil in Sri Lanka |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/world/asia/sri-lanka-prime-minister-bribery-crisis.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=3 November 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102220318/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/world/asia/sri-lanka-prime-minister-bribery-crisis.html# |archive-date=2 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of his power, Rajapaksa and [[Rajapaksa family|his family]] controlled 80 percent of the national budget where Rajapaksa simultaneously served as finance minister and four other cabinet posts on top of the presidency, while his three brothers served as the defence secretary and ministers of economy and ports and the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka|Speaker of the Parliament]].&lt;ref name="NYT 2610" /&gt; Many of those, including journalists, who were critical of him disappeared.&lt;ref name="NYT 2610" /&gt; According to [[Reuters]], in the aftermath of the Sri Lankan Civil War, Rajapaksa borrowed "billions of dollars" from China to build infrastructure projects, though these had little economic value to the country.&lt;ref name="News.com 1111"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schneider |first1=Kate |title=$282&amp;nbsp;million airport has a huge problem |url=https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/flights/282-million-airport-has-a-huge-problem/news-story/e080d0b290141a2a9f4f84fc8827c353 |website=NewsComAu |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg 1111"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marlow |first1=Iain |title=Bloomberg – Are you a robot? |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-17/china-s-1-billion-white-elephant-the-port-ships-don-t-use |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects were seen as vanity projects or [[white elephant]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT Aneez-Sirilal"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Aneez |first1=Aneez |last2=Sirilal |first2=Ranga |title=Turmoil in Sri Lanka as Ex-President Rajapaksa Sworn in as PM |url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/10/26/world/asia/26reuters-sri-lanka-politics.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer |website=The New York Times |accessdate=3 November 2018 }}{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 presidential election===
In response to the degrading democracy in the country, the [[United National Party]] (UNP), along with several other parties and civil organisations, signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] and decided to field the then Secretary General of [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (SLFP), [[Maithripala Sirisena]], as the Common Candidate for the [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 2015|2015 Presidential Election]]. Sirisena, a former health minister under Rajapaksa, pledged to appoint UNP Leader [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] as the Prime Minister if he were to win the election.&lt;ref name="NYT 2610"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Abi-Habib |first1=Maria |last2=Bastians |first2=Dharisha |title=Sri Lanka Faces Constitutional Crisis as President Unseats Prime Minister |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/world/asia/sri-lanka-political-crisis.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=31 October 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101015327/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/world/asia/sri-lanka-political-crisis.html# |archive-date=1 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirisena won the January 2015 election and became the 7th President of Sri Lanka and appointed Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister as promised. The presidential election was followed by a [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 2015|General Parliamentary Elections]], held on 17 August 2015, in which the UNP-lead coalition gained 106 seats in the Parliament and formed a National Government with several other parties. Wickremesinghe and the UNP came to power promising accountability for alleged atrocities committed during the [[Sri Lanka civil war]] and during the Rajapaksa presidency.&lt;ref name="BBC 3110" /&gt; Following the 2015 election defeat, Mahinda Rajapaksa held India's intelligence service, [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), among those responsible for the change in regime.&lt;ref name="The Hindu 1610" /&gt; The [[Government of India]] also welcomed Rajapaksa's defeat, claiming that the former leader had strained ties with them while moving the country closer to China.&lt;ref name="NYT 2610" /&gt;

A [[national unity government#Sri Lanka|national unity government]] was formed, which passed the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka]] on 28 April 2015, stipulating that the prime minister should remain in office for as long as his cabinet functions, unless he resigns or ceases to be a member of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka |url=http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/19th_Amendment_E.pdf |publisher=Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka |accessdate=31 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929113428/http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/19th_Amendment_E.pdf# |archive-date=29 September 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uneasy coalition===
The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government had been struggling to repay the debts incurred during the Rajapaksa presidency. The [[Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port]], built with Chinese money, was handed over to Beijing in a 99-year lease in 2017 as a form of payment.&lt;ref name="NYT 2610" /&gt; Sri Lanka also recorded just 3.1% [[Economic growth|economic growth rate]], the lowest for 16 years in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Sri Lanka’s economic growth in 2017 fell to 16 year-low|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/article/1042630/sls-economic-growth-in-2017-fell-to-17-year-low|accessdate=15 May 2018|agency=menafn.com|publisher=menafn.com|date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, following Mahinda Rajapaksa's proxy [[Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna]] winning a landslide victory in the [[Sri Lankan local elections, 2018|2018 local authority elections]], disputes among the members of the National Government began to surface and a major rift between the President and Prime Minister appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aneez|first1=Shihar|last2=Srilal|first2=Ranga|title=Sri Lanka ex-leader-backed party set for landslide victory in local polls|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-politics/sri-lanka-ex-leader-backed-party-set-for-landslide-victory-in-local-polls-idUSKBN1FV07C|accessdate=11 February 2018|agency=Reuters|date=11 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211072606/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-politics/sri-lanka-ex-leader-backed-party-set-for-landslide-victory-in-local-polls-idUSKBN1FV07C#|archive-date=11 February 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirisena claimed Wickremesinghe to have led to the loss of 11&amp;nbsp;billion Sri Lankan rupees ($65 million; £50 million) in the [[Ranil Wickremesinghe#Government bonds controversy|controversial central bank bond sale]], and also alleged that a cabinet minister was involved in a plot to kill him and that police had obstructed an investigation.&lt;ref name="BBC 3110" /&gt;

===Special high courts for bribery and corruption cases===
In May 2018, the Sri Lanka parliament approved a [[High Court of Sri Lanka#Special High Court|special high court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-corruption-court/sri-lanka-parliament-backs-special-courts-for-bribery-corruption-cases-idUSKBN1IA2QE|title=Sri Lanka parliament backs special courts for bribery, corruption...|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would expedite the hearing and trial of bribery and corruption related cases. The concept for the [[High Court]] [[Bench trial|Trial-at-Bar]] was instituted with the passage of amendments to the Judicature Act, the purpose of expediting cases from the Rajapaksa Government era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=188351|title=The Island|last=LTD|first=Lankacom PVT|website=www.island.lk|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Times'' of 15 July 2018 stated that "the former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation chairman Gamini Senarath and its Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage will be the first to be indicted before the newly set up court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chandraprema |first1=C.A. |title=Yahapalana law and the Judiciary: Hauling the Rajapaksas before a Special High Court |url=http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2018/07/21/yahapalana-law-and-the-judiciary-hauling-the-rajapaksas-before-a-special-high-court/ |publisher=LankaWeb |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Cases-against-Senarath-and-Kudabalage-The-first-to-be-heard-by-the-Trial-at-Bar-154239.html|title=Cases against Senarath and Kudabalage: The first to be heard by the Trial at Bar|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senarath was the chief of staff of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Special Courts are also strongly regarded as a factor in the creation of the 2018 Constitutional Crisis.

===Alleged assassination attempt===
Reports of an assassination plot emerged in September when an individual named Namal Kumara claimed he was aware of a plan to assassinate President Sirisena and former Defence Secretary [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]]. Kumara was interrogated by the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID), and in late September the police arrested an Indian national, Marceli Thomas, from Kerala, claiming he knew of the plot.&lt;ref name="The Hindu 1610" /&gt; Kumara alleged the Director of the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) of the [[Sri Lanka Police]], [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] [[Nalaka de Silva]] had masterminded the plot.&lt;ref name="NDTV 2610"&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Held Over Plot To Kill Sri Lanka President Sent To Mental Hospital |url=https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/marceli-thomas-indian-held-over-plot-to-kill-sri-lanka-president-maithripala-sirisena-sent-to-mental-1938317 |website=''NDTV.com'' |accessdate=3 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107024652/https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/marceli-thomas-indian-held-over-plot-to-kill-sri-lanka-president-maithripala-sirisena-sent-to-mental-1938317# |archive-date=7 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nalaka de Silva was suspended pending a formal investigation by the CID and later arrested by CID on 25 October under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act (Sri Lanka)|Prevention of Terrorism Act]] and remanded till 7 November.&lt;ref name="Daily News 2610"&gt;{{cite web |title=Former TID DIG Nalaka de Silva remanded |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2018/10/26/law-order/166659/former-tid-dig-nalaka-de-silva-remanded |website=Daily News |accessdate=3 November 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028164640/http://www.dailynews.lk/2018/10/26/law-order/166659/former-tid-dig-nalaka-de-silva-remanded# |archive-date=28 October 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid October 2018, Indian newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'' reported that Sirisena told Cabinet members that India's intelligence service, [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), had devised a plot to assassinate him, though Sirisena denied the report.&lt;ref name="The Hindu 1610"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Meera |title=Sri Lankan President Sirisena alleges that RAW is plotting his assassination |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lankan-president-sirisena-alleges-that-raw-is-plotting-his-assassination/article25241800.ece |website=The Hindu |accessdate=3 November 2018  |date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirisena in the cabinet meeting told Ministers that RAW was "trying to kill" him, but "Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] may not be aware of the plan."&lt;ref name="The Hindu 1610" /&gt;

On 18 October 2018, a statement released by India's [[Prime Minister's Office (India)|Prime Minister Office]] (PMO) said that Sirisena called Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] to reject the media reports about him alluding to the involvement of India in the alleged assassination plot. Sirisena also stated that he "regards the [Indian] prime minister as a true friend of Sri Lanka, as also a close personal friend. He stressed that he greatly valued the mutually beneficial ties between India and Sri Lanka, and remained steadfast to work with the prime minister for further strengthening them."&lt;ref name="India today"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mohan |first1=Geeta|title=Sri Lanka denies reports of India plotting to assassinate President Sirisena|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/sri-lanka-denies-reports-of-india-plotting-to-assassinate-president-sirisena-1370253-2018-10-18 |website=[[India Today]] |accessdate=23 November 2018  |date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2018, the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]] (UPFA) withdrew from the government, ending the national government that was in place since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UPFA withdraws from Govt. |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/UPFA-withdraws-from-Govt--157433.html |website=Daily Mirror |accessdate=3 November 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028151543/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/UPFA-withdraws-from-Govt--157433.html# |archive-date=28 October 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Sirisena also alleged that a cabinet minister was involved but did not name the cabinet minister. However said "Under these political problems, economic troubles, and the strong plot to assassinate me, the only alternative open to me was to invite former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and appoint him as prime minister to form a new government."&lt;ref name="CNN 3110" /&gt;

==Timeline of events==
===Two prime ministers===
The president's UPFA had earlier on Friday, 26 October, quit the national unity government that had governed with Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]]'s UNP.&lt;ref name="Economic Times 2710" /&gt;

Later at about 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm without a prior announcement, President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] unexpectedly appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister in a live swearing-in ceremony broadcast over television. Rajapaksa took an oath of office in the presence of Sirisena and representatives of the military inside the [[Presidential Secretariat]]. He was sworn in while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was still the incumbent and away touring in the south of the country.&lt;ref name="NYT Aneez-Sirilal" /&gt; The situation in Colombo was uneasy with some cabinet ministers immediately declaring the move unconstitutional, while other Cabinet ministers and parliamentarians began defecting to the new government.&lt;ref name="NYT 2610" /&gt;

Wickremesinghe addressed the nation saying, "I am addressing you as the prime minister of Sri Lanka. I still hold the majority of the house. [...] Convene parliament and I will prove it." Three ministers, including [[Mangala Samaraweera]] and Cabinet Spokesman [[Rajitha Senaratne]], tried to address the nation during a live television program.&lt;ref name="NYT Aneez-Sirilal" /&gt; That day Rajapaksa loyalists stormed two state-owned television networks which they regarded loyal to Wickremesinghe and the sitting government, including [[Rupavahini]], and forced them off the air. Troops were brought in to protect the channel's staff.&lt;ref name="NYT 2610" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Economic Times 2710"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chaudhury |first1=Dipanjan Roy |title=Ranil Wickremesinghe refuses to step down as Sri Lankan PM |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/ranil-wickremesinghe-refuses-to-step-down-as-sri-lankan-pm/articleshow/66388881.cms |website=The Economic Times |accessdate=31 October 2018 |date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101002712/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/ranil-wickremesinghe-refuses-to-step-down-as-sri-lankan-pm/articleshow/66388881.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst# |archive-date=1 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 3110" /&gt;

Finance Minister [[Mangala Samaraweera]] tweeted that Rajapaksa's appointment was "unconstitutional and illegal. This is an anti-democratic coup," saying Wickramasinghe remained leader as he could not constitutionally be removed by the president.&lt;ref name="Samaraweera TW"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Samaraweera |first1=Mangala |title=Mangala Samaraweera on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/MangalaLK/status/1055838461112967168 |website=Twitter |accessdate=3 November 2018 }}{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2610" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2610"&gt;{{cite web |title=PM's 'sacking' leaves Sri Lanka in turmoil |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45991919 |work=BBC News|accessdate=3 November 2018 |date=26 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104024650/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45991919# |archive-date=4 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While UPFA MP [[Susil Premajayantha]] told reporters that a new cabinet would be sworn in soon.&lt;ref name="NYT Aneez-Sirilal" /&gt; [[Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka|Speaker of the Parliament]] [[Karu Jayasuriya]] said he was to decide on Saturday (27th), after seeking legal advice, whether to recognise Rajapaksa or not. The Parliament was not due to meet until 5 November when the 2019 national budget was to be presented. The [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka|Supreme Court]], which is empowered to resolve constitutional disputes, was shut for the weekend, to be reopened on Monday.&lt;ref name="Economic Times 2710" /&gt;

On 27 October President Sirisena issued a formal notice for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down. Sirisena later issued gazettes formalising and defending the dramatic move.&lt;ref name="Economic Times 2710" /&gt; Wickremesinghe however entered [[Temple Trees]], the Prime Ministers residence, refusing to accept the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his dismissal, insisting in a letter to Sirisena that he was still in office. Sirisena and Rajapaksa announced their intent to form a new cabinet.&lt;ref name="Economic Times 2710" /&gt; Nalaka Kaluwewa, an Acting Additional Secretary in the [[Presidential Secretariat]], was appointed as Acting Director General of Information under the instructions of President Sirisena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Nalaka-Kaluwewa-appointed-Actg-Director-General-of-Information-157485.html# |title=Nalaka Kaluwewa appointed Actg Director General of Information |access-date=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028151540/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Nalaka-Kaluwewa-appointed-Actg-Director-General-of-Information-157485.html# |archive-date=28 October 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after Rajapaksa's appointment, the Parliament, which was due to meet on 5 November to discuss the budget for the next year, was [[prorogued]] by the President, delaying its meeting till 16 November.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; President Sirisena stated on Saturday night that the main reason for him to form a new government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister was the alleged plot to assassinate him. He claimed that the name of [[Sarath Fonseka]] had come up in the investigation of the CID but was suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President says plot linked to Fonseka was game changer |url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/181028/news/president-says-plot-linked-to-fonseka-was-game-changer-317875.html |website=The Sunday Times Sri Lanka |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October, [[Mangala Samaraweera]] tweeted that the security personnel and official verticals assigned to the Prime Minister were withdrawn from Wickremesinghe and assigned to Rajapaksa on orders from the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MangalaLK/status/1056185186247880704|title=Mangala Samaraweera on Twitter}}{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|Inspector General of Police]] (IGP) [[Pujith Jayasundara|Jayasundara]] had ordered the 1,008 police and [[Special Task Force|STF]] personnel assigned to Wickremesinghe as [[Prime Minister's Security Division|prime ministerial security]] to be withdrawn and replaced with 10 police personnel from the Ministerial Security Division (MSD). The security details of ministers of the former government have been also reduced to the levels provided to parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Security-details-of-ex-ministers-to-be-reduced-157609.html# |title=Security details of ex-ministers to be reduced |access-date=30 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030103016/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Security-details-of-ex-ministers-to-be-reduced-157609.html# |archive-date=30 October 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China, Burundi and Pakistan had recognised Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime minister.

===Calls to reconvene Parliament===
[[File:Karu Jayasuriya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Karu Jayasuriya, Speaker of Parliament]]
The [[Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka|Speaker of Parliament]], [[Karu Jayasuriya]] has requested the President to reconvene parliament following consultations with party leaders of the [[United National Party|UNP]], [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi|ITAK]], [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]] and the [[Sri Lanka Muslim Congress|SLMC]] on 30 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Reconvene-Parliament-Speaker-makes-kind-request-to-Prez-157618.html# |title=Reconvene Parliament: Speaker makes ‘kind request’ to Prez |access-date=30 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030102429/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Reconvene-Parliament-Speaker-makes-kind-request-to-Prez-157618.html# |archive-date=30 October 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney General]] [[Jayantha Jayasuriya]] stated that it is inappropriate for him to express an opinion on the matter, in response to a request for comment by the Speaker.&lt;ref name="Onlanka 1111"&gt;{{cite web |title=Inappropriate to comment on political crisis AG tells Speaker ::.

UPFA MP [[Susil Premajayantha]] stated that Parliament would reconvene on 16 November as per the Gazette and not on 5 November as said by Rajapaksa the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No change in Parliament date: Susil |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/No-change-in-Parliament-date-Susil-157757.html |website=Daily Mirror |accessdate=3 November 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103165554/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/No-change-in-Parliament-date-Susil-157757.html# |archive-date=3 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 119 MPs from several parties met and passed a resolution calling for immediate convention of Parliament claiming that the removal of the Prime Minister and the appointment of another was unconstitutional. The Speaker has stated that the President agreed to convene Parliament on 7 November. However, if the President fails to issue the gazette notification to convene Parliament, the Speaker has stated that he will convene Parliament on 7 November under the powers vested in him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Majority of Parliamentarians Resolve To Convene Parliament And Claim MR's Appointment As PM Unacceptable |url=https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/majority-of-parliamentarians-resolve-to-convene-parliament-and-claim-mrs-appointment-as-pm-unacceptable/ |website=Colombo Telegraph |accessdate=3 November 2018 |date=2 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104010349/https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/majority-of-parliamentarians-resolve-to-convene-parliament-and-claim-mrs-appointment-as-pm-unacceptable/# |archive-date=4 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaker Jayasuriya later in a statement announced that he will not accept any changes that had happened in Sri Lanka after 26 October until they are verified in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/I-am-compelled-to-accept-previous-status-in-Parliament-Speaker-157905.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106132429/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/I-am-compelled-to-accept-previous-status-in-Parliament-Speaker-157905.html# |archive-date=6 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 November UPFA MP [[Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena]] said that the only item on Parliamentary agenda on 14 November is the policy statement by President Sirisena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Only-President-s-speech-on-Lakshman-Yapa-158043.html# |title=Only President's speech on 14: Lakshman Yapa |access-date=9 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107223216/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Only-President-s-speech-on-Lakshman-Yapa-158043.html# |archive-date=7 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Sirisena met with a [[Tamil National Alliance]] (TNA) delegation whom he asked to abstain from a vote of no confidence if it were moved. The TNA told Sirisena it had taken a decision to vote against the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. The President in response is reported to have said that he will not reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, even if his party secured a majority in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/-President-says-no-to-Ranil--158089.html|title=President says no to Ranil|website=Daily Mirror|accessdate=9 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109174628/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/-President-says-no-to-Ranil--158089.html#|archive-date=9 November 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While making an address on 8 November the SLFP executive committee meeting Sirisena said that "he had used only one trump card and there were more trump cards still in his hand", and that he would not go back on any decisions that he had taken already, during this crisis. Sirisena said he was going to make a request to the UNP to support the government's work plan when Parliament reconvenes on the 14th.&lt;ref name="NYT 911" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Used-only-one-trump-card-more-in-hand-President-158105.html|title=Used only one trump card, more in hand: President|website=Daily Mirror|accessdate=9 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109081612/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Used-only-one-trump-card-more-in-hand-President-158105.html#|archive-date=9 November 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNP said it would explore the possibility of removing President Sirisena in conformity with Article 38 (2) of the Constitution. The [[Tamil Progressive Alliance]] (TPA) responded it would not support any impeachment move as, while they do not support the appointment of Rajapaksa, "they are not in favour of adding more fire to the current crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Won-t-support-impeachment-move-against-President-Mano-158135.html|title=Won't support impeachment move against President: Mano|website=Daily Mirror|accessdate=9 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109093351/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Won-t-support-impeachment-move-against-President-Mano-158135.html#|archive-date=9 November 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery allegations===
The UNP has alleged that Rajapaksa loyalists has been luring its MPs to support Sirisena and Rajapaksa with the offer of significant bribes and ministerial portfolios. On 3 November, the UNP released an audio recording, which it claimed an attempt to buy UNP MPs which contained a phone conversation allegedly taken place between UPFA MP [[S. B. Dissanayake]] and UNP MP [[Palitha Range Bandara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Attempts-to-lure-MPs-UNP-releases-audio-recording-157868.html# |title=Attempts to lure MPs: UNP releases audio recording |access-date=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170251/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Attempts-to-lure-MPs-UNP-releases-audio-recording-157868.html# |archive-date=4 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; UPFA MP [[Dinesh Gunawardena]] was appointed [[Leader of the House (Sri Lanka)|Leader of the House]].&lt;ref name="Colombo Gazette 311"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dinesh Gunawardena to be new Leader of the House |url=https://colombogazette.com/2018/11/03/dinesh-gunawardena-to-be-new-leader-of-the-house/ |website=Colombo Gazette |accessdate=11 November 2018 |date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolution of parliament and elections===
President Sirisena issues a gazette notification bringing the [[Sri Lanka Police]] under the purview of the [[Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Defence]], which was earlier under the [[Ministry of Law and Order (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Law and Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Police Department brought under Defence Ministry |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Police-Department-brought-under-Defence-Ministry-158141.html |website=Daily Mirror |accessdate=9 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed with the transfer of the Department of Government Printing which publishes the government [[Gazette]] under the Ministry of Defence. Sirisena has brought the Military, Police and the Gazette under his direct control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Dept-of-Government-Printing-brought-under-President-158156.html# |title=Dept. of Government Printing brought under President |access-date=10 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109174559/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Dept-of-Government-Printing-brought-under-President-158156.html# |archive-date=9 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid calls to reconvene parliament Sirisena and his party admitted they did not have enough votes to support Mahinda Rajapaksa against Ranil Wickremesinghe to decide the office of Prime Minister. Ahead of the president's announcement the UPFA said they were at least eight legislators short of getting a majority for Rajapaksa in the parliament. "At the moment we have 104 or 105 MPs," UPFA's spokesman [[Keheliya Rambukwella]] told reporters. He further went on to say the Sirisena-Rajapakse group hoped to secure support from "crossover" legislators. This is in contrast to what Sirisena claimed on the 5th, that he had the support of 113 legislators when he sacked Wickremesinghe. According to an AFP count, 120 MPs support Wickremesinghe and his allies.&lt;ref name="Guardian 911"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Lanka president dissolves parliament in bid to end power struggle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/09/sri-lanka-president-dissolves-parliament-in-bid-to-end-power-struggle |website=The Guardian |accessdate=9 November 2018  |date=9 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109225852/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/09/sri-lanka-president-dissolves-parliament-in-bid-to-end-power-struggle# |archive-date=9 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Sirisena dissolves Parliament by proclamation, from midnight of 9 November and declared [[Next Sri Lankan parliamentary election|snap elections]] to be held on around 5 January 2019.&lt;ref name="aljazeera 911"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kuruwita |first1=Rathindra |last2=Rasheed |first2=Zaheena |title=Sri Lanka president dissolves parliament, sets January snap poll |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/sri-lanka-president-dissolves-parliament-deepening-crisis-181109170918447.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=9 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109203726/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/sri-lanka-president-dissolves-parliament-deepening-crisis-181109170918447.html# |archive-date=9 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 911"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bastians |first1=Dharisha |last2=Goel |first2=Vindu |title=Sri Lanka President Dissolves Parliament Amid Power Struggle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/sri-lanka-dissolves-parliament.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=9 November 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109202613/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/sri-lanka-dissolves-parliament.html# |archive-date=9 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parliament dissolved from midnight |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Parliament-dissolved-from-midnight-158179.html |website=Daily Mirror |accessdate=9 November 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109203810/http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Parliament-dissolved-from-midnight-158179.html# |archive-date=9 November 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was swiftly denounced by the United National Party in a post on Twitter, saying it "vehemently rejects" the sacking of the parliament.

The SLPP was formed in 2016 by [[Basil Rajapaksa]], younger brother of Mahinda. A member of the SLPP said that 65 out of 82 Sri Lanka Freedom Party MPs will eventually join Rajapaksa's party.&lt;ref name="Channel NewsAsia 1111" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PM Rajapaksa obtains SLPP membership |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/PM-Rajapaksa-obtains-SLPP-membership-158200.html |website=Daily Mirror |accessdate=14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prime Minister Mahinda obtains membership of Podujana Peramuna |url=http://www.hirunews.lk/203995/prime-minister-mahinda-obtains-membership-of-podujana-peramuna |website=Hiru News |accessdate=14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent defectors include [[Mahindananda Aluthgamage]], [[Rohitha Abeygunawardena]], [[Anura Priyadharshana Yapa]], [[Johnston Fernando]] and [[Namal Rajapaksa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MR joins the SLPP – Sri Lanka Latest News |url=https://www.newsfirst.lk/2018/11/11/mr-joins-the-slpp/ |website=Sri Lanka News – Newsfirst {{!}} Breaking News and Latest News provider {{!}} Political {{!}} Sports {{!}} International {{!}} Business |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namal Rajapaksa said relating to the defections, "We will strive to create a broader coalition with many stakeholders under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena &amp; Mahinda Rajapaksa to face the upcoming General Election and come out victorious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Lanka : Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa obtains membership of SLPP |url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_18B/Nov11_1541926137CH.php |website=''colombopage.com'' |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supreme Court stays proclamation dissolving parliament====
[[File:Supreme Court Colombo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Supreme Court Complex]]

Arguing that Sirisena's actions were unconstitutional, illegal and against the people of Sri Lanka, Hoole demanded the restoration of status quo prevailing prior to 26 October. Hoole's position strengthens the argument of 11 other petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Lanka Election Commissioner says sacking of parliament illegal |url=https://economynext.com/Sri_Lanka_Election_Commissioner_says_sacking_of_parliament_illegal-3-12566.html |website=''economynext.com'' |accessdate=14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were taken up for hearing on the same day by a three member bench of the Supreme Court consisting of the Chief Justice [[Nalin Perera]], Justices [[Prasanna Jayawardena]] and [[Priyantha Jayawardena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dissolution of parliament: Petitions to be taken up today |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Dissolution-of-parliament-Petitions-to-be-taken-up-today-158227.html |website=Daily Mirror |accessdate=14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the petitions, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya made submissions stating that "the court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the Fundamental Rights petitions against the dissolution of Parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Court has no jurisdiction to hear FR petitions against dissolution: AG |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Court-has-no-jurisdiction-to-hear-FR-petitions-against-dissolution-AG-158282.html |website=Daily Mirror |accessdate=14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, 5 petitions by Prof [[G.

Mahinda Rajapaksa, [[Rajapaksa family|his family]] and associates are directly connected to these investigations, and as Silva pursued inquiries into them, on 18 November he was transferred by IGP [[Pujith Jayasundara]] on the orders of President Sirisena to the Negombo Division with "immediate effect on service requirements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Police Commission cancels transfer  of CID Inspector Nishantha Silva {{!}} FT Online |url=http://www.ft.lk/front-page/Police-Commission-cancels-transfer--of-CID-Inspector-Nishantha-Silva/44-667198 |website=www.ft.lk |accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CID’s IP Nishantha Silva transferred |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/CID-s-IP-Nishantha-Silva-transferred-158572.html |website=Daily Mirror |accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva had just secured an arrest order for Admiral Wijegunaratne when he was shifted.

__NOTOC__
Year '''483 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Vibulanus and Potitus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 271 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 483 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

To avoid a repeat of the significant losses to the Persian fleet that occurred in [[492 BC]], Xerxes has a canal cut through the promontory of [[Mount Athos]].

==== Greece ====
* The Athenian [[archon]] [[Themistocles]] realises that the Greeks need to be able to beat the Persians at sea.  To carry out this strategy, however, [[Athens]] needs far more warships (that is to say the newly developed, specialised [[trireme]]s) than the 70 it has. Themistocles is initially opposed by other Athenian leaders.  However, when the state-owned silver mines at [[Laurium]] become the site of a rich strike, Themistocles persuades the assembly, instead of "declaring a dividend," to devote the whole surplus to increasing the navy to a proposed 200 ships.

==== India ====
* Following the death of [[Gautama Buddha]], the [[Gautama_Buddha#Relics|relics]] associated with his cremation were divided amongst royal families and his disciples, then interned in 8 reliquaries. Each [[reliquary]] was then encased in its own burial mound, called a [[stupa]] (approximate date).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==== Sicily ====
* [[Gelo]], the [[tyrant]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] conquers the nearby Sicilian cities of [[Euboea, Sicily|Euboea]] and [[Megara Hyblaea]], selling their common people into slavery and bringing their oligarchs to Syracuse.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Rome ====
* Commencement of the [[Roman-Etruscan_Wars#The_Fabian_war_with_Veii_in_483-476_BC|Fabian war with Veii]].

The '''''Air de cour''''' was a popular type of secular vocal music in [[France]] in the late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, from about 1570 until around 1650.  From approximately 1610 to 1635, during the reign of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], this was the predominant form of secular vocal composition in France, especially in the royal court.

==Features==
The first use of the term ''air de cour'' was in [[Adrian Le Roy]]'s ''Airs de cour miz sur le luth'' (Book on Court Tunes for the Luth),&lt;ref&gt;Robin, et all, 2007, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of music published in 1571.  The earliest examples of the form are for solo voice accompanied by [[lute]];&lt;ref&gt;Buelow, 2004, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; towards the end of the 16th century, four or five voices are common, sometimes accompanied (or instrumental accompaniment may have been optional); and by the mid-17th century, most ''airs de cour'' were again for solo voice with accompaniment.  Beginning in 1608, ''airs de cour'' were often taken from ''[[ballet de cour|ballets de cour]]'', a form of ballet which was quickly becoming popular at the French court.

Musically they were [[strophic]], i.e. successive verses of the text were set with similar music.  While the earlier music, especially that for multiple voices, was [[polyphony|polyphonic]], after about 1610 the music usually was [[homophonic]], sung syllabically and without [[meter (music)|meter]], with a clear influence from the ''[[musique mesurée]]'' which developed in Paris around 1570. Collections exist which deviate considerably from these trends, however; several printers specialized in polyphonic ''airs de cour'' throughout the early 17th century, and there are eight volumes published by Le Roy &amp; Ballard which are [[Monophony|monophonic]] – for a single voice with ''no'' accompaniment.

''Airs de cour'' show surprisingly little influence from the [[Italy|Italian]] early Baroque trends of [[monody]] and the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], either in its polyphonic or its [[concertato]] form.  This is all the more surprising as Italian musicians often worked in France, and the polyphonic and concertato forms of madrigal were being deeply influential in [[Germany]] at the same time.  Emotional expression in the ''airs de cour'', compared to that of the contemporary Italian madrigalists, is cool, classical and reserved, in keeping with contemporary French taste.  Vocal range of the music is usually limited to one [[octave]]; [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] and [[chromaticism]] are rare; and the overall simplicity of expression is striking.

The influence of the ''air de cour'' extended beyond France.  Collections were published in Germany, and more importantly in England, where translations were rather popular, as attested by the several publications and copies. There exists a delightfully titled publication:
''French Court-airs, with their Ditties Englished'',
(Edward Filmer,1629), The ''air de cour'' had considerable influence on the development of the English [[Air (music)|ayre]]. 

The atmosphere of these songs is very different from the English lute song, and the lute technique employs some novel features. There are notated ''strummings'' with the 1st finger, both up and down.  There have been several articles on the finer points of this, as well as the exact meaning of the notation, in the English and French Lute Society Journals.

'''Astafy Trifonovich Dolgopolov''' (Астафий Трифонович Долгополов), b. 1725, d. after 1797, was a Russian [[confidence trick]]ster and [[impostor]] deceiving both [[Yemelyan Pugachev]] and [[Catherine II of Russia]] during the [[Pugachev Rebellion]].

A merchant from [[Rzhev]] who had supplied [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] with [[forage]], he contracted some debts and went to Pugachev's headquarters during the climax of the rebellion, in June 1774. Dolgopolov presented himself as an envoy from [[Paul I of Russia|the Grand Duke Pavel Petrovich]] to his alleged "father" (as Pugachev pretended to be Peter III), under the alias of Ivan Ivanov, ostensibly from Moscow. He claimed to have "recognized" Pugachev before his supporters as the true Peter III and also recalled a 1500 roubles-debt for [[oats]] that the deposed Emperor had left behind him. However Pugachev quickly understood his aims and Dolgopolov never received from him more than 50 roubles for travel expenses.

Then Dolgopolov embarked on a new dangerous enterprise, presenting himself to Catherine II as a [[Ural Cossacks|Yaik Cossack]] named Trifonov who allegedly wanted to deliver Pugachev to the government. He invented a conspiration among the Cossacks and composed a whole letter with 300 signatures to the Empress and [[Grigory Orlov]]. Received in August in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] by Catherine, he received 2000 roubles as a prize and was sent to the Lower Volga in charge of a detachment instructed to find and capture Pugachev. In early September he additionally took another sum of 3000 roubles in golden coins from an officer sent together with him, and fled to Rzhev with all the money, as Pugachev had been already captured before the expedition could ever find his whereabouts.

The official investigation concluded that the merchant Dolgopolov from Rzhev, a loyal Cossack Trifonov decorated by the Empress, and Ivanov the "Tsesarevich's emissar" to Pugachev, were in fact the same person. He was arrested in Rzhev and sentenced by the [[Governing Senate]] to be scourged with [[knout]], [[Human branding#As punishment|brand]]ed on his face and sent, permanently put into irons, to penal labor in Rågervik, now [[Paldiski]] in Estonia. However hard this punishment for his age of 50 might be, he lived well into his seventies, surviving Catherine II. His name occurs for the last time in 1797.

'''''Battle in Seattle''''' is a 2007 [[Political film|political]] [[Action film|action]]-[[thriller film]] written and directed by [[Stuart Townsend]], in his directorial debut. The story is based on [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|the protest activity]] at the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999]]. The film premiered on May 22, 2008 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]].

==Plot==
The film depicts the [[1999 WTO protests|protest in 1999]], as thousands of activists arrive in [[Seattle, Washington]] in masses to protest the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999]]. Protesters believe the [[World Trade Organization]] contributes to widening the [[economic inequality|wealth gap]] between the rich and the poor, while the WTO claims to be fixing the disparity and decreasing world hunger, disease, and death.

The movie takes an in-depth look at several fictional characters during those five days in 1999 as demonstrators protested the meeting of the WTO in Seattle's streets. The movie portrays conflicts between the peaceful protesters and people committing property destruction whose actions were widely covered by the media. Although the protest began peacefully with a goal of stopping the WTO talks, police began teargassing the crowd after it refused to clear the streets and the situation escalated into a full-scale riot and a [[State of Emergency]] that pitted protesters against the [[Seattle Police Department]] and the [[Washington National Guard]].

==Cast==
Though the film is based on actual events, the characters are fictional.&lt;!-- This is clearly stated in the opening credits. Please do not remove. Thanks --&gt;

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics, earning a 56% positive rating from numerous reviews on review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], {{asof|March 2018|lc=y}}. The critical consensus was that the film, though "Well intentioned and passionate, this docu-drama about the 1999 WTO protests is heavier on politics than character development".&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/battle_in_seattle/ | title=Battle in Seattle (2008) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Magazine]]'' called the film "a triumph",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle in Seattle Review by NYMag|url=http://nymag.com/listings/movie/battle-in-seattle/|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and described it as "not quite a documentary and not quite a drama, but interesting all the same" and compared it to past political films like ''[[Medium Cool]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Battle in Seattle Review by Roger Ebert| url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080925/REVIEWS/809250301/1023| accessdate= 2008-08-27| work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080926174951/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080925%2FREVIEWS%2F809250301%2F1023| archivedate= 26 September 2008| deadurl= no| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[EW.com]], the film "sounds like a bad TV movie: a drama based on the protests that halted the 1999 World Trade Organization summit in Seattle. Yet Stuart Townsend re-creates it all with stunning passion and skill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Battle in Seattle Review by EW| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20228550,00.html| accessdate= 2008-08-27| work= [[Entertainment Weekly]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080927020221/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20228550%2C00.html| archivedate= 27 September 2008| deadurl= no| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also received positive reviews from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Battle in Seattle Review by THR |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;rid=9826 |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827070356/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp |archivedate=August 27, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Battle in Seattle Review by Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934682.html?categoryid=2850&amp;cs=1|accessdate=2008-08-27 | first=Dennis | last=Harvey | date=2007-09-11}}, variety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite director Stuart Townsend's stated intention of portraying the events of protest accurately, the film was criticized by [[anarchist]] collective [[CrimethInc.]] for what they saw as its sensationalistic portrayal of events.&lt;ref name=tomorrow&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thecloud.crimethinc.com/pdfs/whatabouttomorrow-print.pdf |title=And What About Tomorrow? |author=CrimethInc. Screenwreckers Guild |format=[[.pdf]] |authorlink=CrimethInc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pamphlet titled "And What About Tomorrow?", the collective allege that the protests were characterized in the film as an isolated spontaneous uprising in which a "small fringe group" of [[black bloc]] anarchists "stole the show", whereas CrimethInc. contend that "anarchists were involved in all different aspects of the protests" including nonviolent organization and [[Food Not Bombs]], and credit the adoption of anarchist [[direct action]] tactics with the success of the uprising.&lt;ref name=tomorrow/&gt; A review published by Anarkismo praised the film as "clearly well-researched", citing the pacing and general narrative as quite accurate, but criticized the presentation of anarchist politics as one-dimensional and a caricature.&lt;ref name=anarkismo&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.anarkismo.net/article/9893 |last=Rogue |first=Jen |author2=Hedden, Andrew |title=Lights!

'''''Bhakta Prahlada''' (English:'' Devotee Prahlada'') (Telugu:'' భక్త ప్రహ్లాద) is the first [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] full length [[talkie]] film, based on [[Narasimha#Scriptural background|The Story of Narasimha and Prahlada]] in [[Hindu]] mythology.

| style="text-align: left;" | "After scouting for evidence in libraries in Chennai, Andhra Pradesh and Mumbai, I finally stumbled upon ‘The Bombay Government Gazette -Part I’ (page no.:313) dated February 4, 1932 at the National Film Archives, Pune, which had the dates of films produced and censored in Bombay.

The censor date of ''Bhaktha Prahlada'' was given in it as January 22, 1932. The Bombay Chronicle carried an advertisement on January 31, 1932 that the film would be released soon. And it was released on February 6, 1932 at Krishna Cinema on New Charlie Road, Bombay. ''The Times of India'' carried a review of the film on the same day of its release as preview show was held before its release. Subsequently, it was released in Andhra and then on April 2, 1932 at the National Picture Palace (later renamed as Broadway Talkies), Madras. All this clearly proves that ''Bhaktha Prahlada'' was released only in 1932."

'''Bonneville Offroad Racing (BOR)''' is an desert racing organization based in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, UT]].

'''Bonneville Off-road Racing Enthusiasts (BORE)''', the predecessor to BOR, was established by Jim Baker in 1989&lt;ref&gt;[http://bor-racing.org/about/ BOR About Page]&lt;/ref&gt; as a local, more affordable, friendlier, alternative to the Southern California and Mexico races put on by [[SCORE International | SCORE]].  Even with its lean organizational team, it offered full-seasons of challenging, well-planned and well-marked courses; with all the ear-marks and perks of a much larger, professionally-run, organization (e.g., big-name event sponsors, informative newsletters, comprehensive points-scoring, computerized event-timing).  It is believed to be the first of its kind to have state-of-the-art, computerized, event-timing with real-time scoring (developed by ''Potter Engineering &amp; Consulting''); which allowed racers and spectators to monitor the up-to-the-minute race-status of all event entries.  Before his own passing (in 2014), Jim passed the leadership-torch to a team of enthusiastic successors; who continue to put on races in Northern Utah, Northeastern Nevada, and Southern Idaho.

== Events ==
The BOR racing series consists of three events a year, taking place from April to October. Three of the four current races are put on each year.

==Master Class==

Each year, beginning with 2006, there has been a special Masters class associated with the drum fest. This consists of a drummer (usually from the previous year) performing at the [[Crown &amp; Moose]] Pub and Grill at the Delta Hotel, in Sydney. The class takes place on the second day of the festival, before the festival at the Savoy Theater has started. The performer takes questions and educates the audience. In 2006, [[Bernard Purdie]] performed there, and [[Denny Seiwell]] did the Masters class in 2007. The Masters class in 2008 will be performed by [[Uriel Jones]].

==Legends Award==

Also beginning with 2006, Bruce had organized an award to be presented to the drummer(s) who should deserve it. In 2006, it was presented to [[Bernard Purdie]] and [[Hal Blaine]]. Hal himself did not attend due to his declining health, but he sent a message to the CBIDF with his regards. In 2007, this award was presented to [[Denny Seiwell]] and [[Steve Gadd]]. The award to Gadd was presented to [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]], who delivered it to Gadd. At the drum festival, by way of e-mail, Seiwell received an acknowledgment from [[Paul McCartney]], with whom Seiwell had performed.

'''''Caretas''''' (Masks) is a weekly [[newsmagazine]] published in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], renowned for its [[investigative journalism]].

== History ==
''Caretas'' was founded in October 1950&lt;ref name=brg&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael B. Salwen|author2=Bruce Garrison|title=Latin American Journalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CTv8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-69133-1|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Doris Gibson]] and [[Francisco Igartua]].

In the mid-1950s, Gibson's son, [[Enrique Zileri]], returned from Europe (from where he had been making contributions for the magazine) to join ''Caretas''. Not long after, Igartua departed from the magazine and Zileri joined Gibson as co-director.

After several years of monthly publication, ''Caretas'' began to be published semi-monthly, and, since 1979,  weekly.&lt;ref name=brg/&gt; A new edition currently appears every Thursday.

''Caretas'' focuses on Peruvian-related topics, ranging from historic [[coups]] (it was founded during [[Manuel A. Odría|Odría's]] regime), corruption scandals, [[List of Presidents of Peru|presidential elections]], crimes of passion, sports, to wars and terrorism. Since the mid-1980s, ''Caretas'' has imitated ''[[Time Magazine]]'' by naming a [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] in the year-end issue of the magazine, called ''Premio a la Resistencia'' (Prize to the Resistance).

The publication's first all-color cover featured Peruvian model [[Gladys Zender]], who became [[Latin America]]'s first beauty pageant contestant to win the [[Miss Universe]] title in 1957.

In the first years of the 1990s, Gibson (who in the previous years had stepped down as director to become President of the Directory, leaving the whole direction to Zileri) left the magazine due to her advanced age.

In 2005, ''Caretas'' launched a second magazine, [[Ellos&amp;Ellas]], published and distributed for free along with it. ''Ellos&amp;Ellas'' covers Lima's ''socialité'', health and fashion topics.

Zileri remained as ''Caretas''' director up to November 2007, when the magazine reached its 2000th edition. He resigned the position to his son, [[Marco Zileri]], Politics Editor up to then, and assumed the Directory Presidency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">'''Conductive anodic filament''', also called '''CAF''', is a metallic filament that forms from an [[electrochemical migration]] process and is known to cause [[printed circuit board|printed circuit board (PCB)]] failures. 

==Mechanism==
CAF formation is a process involving the transport of conductive chemistries across a nonmetallic substrate under the influence of an applied electric field.&lt;ref name=IPC&gt; IPC TM-650 2.6.25 Conductive Anodic Filament (CAF) Resistance Test: X-Y Axis https://www.ipc.org/4.0_Knowledge/4.1_Standards/test/2-6-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; CAF is influenced by [[electric field strength]], [[temperature]] (including [[soldering]] temperatures), [[humidity]], laminate material, and the presence of manufacturing defects. The occurrence of CAF failures has been primarily driven by the electronics industry pushing for higher density circuit boards and the use of electronics in harsher environments for high reliability applications.&lt;ref&gt; L. Zou and C. Hunt, “How to Avoid Conductive Anodic Filaments (CAF),”  National Physical Laboratory. 22 Jan 2013. http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/20130122_caf_avoid_failure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure modes and detection==
CAF commonly occurs between adjacent [[Via (electronics)|vias]] (i.e. plated [[through holes]]) inside a PCB, as the copper migrates along the glass/resin interface from [[anode]] to [[cathode]]. CAF failures can manifest as current leakage, intermittent [[Short circuit|electrical shorts]], and even [[dielectric breakdown]] between conductors in printed circuit boards.&lt;ref&gt;C. Tulkoff. “Design for Reliability: PCBs” North Texas IPC Designers Council. https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Design_for_Reliability_PCBs.pdf?t=1514473946162&lt;/ref&gt; This often makes CAF very difficult to detect, especially when it occurs as an intermittent issue. There are a few things that can be done to isolate the fault location and confirm CAF as a root cause of a failure. If the issue is intermittent then putting the sample of interest under combined temperature-humidity-bias (THB) may help recreate the failure mode. In addition, techniques such as [[Cross section (electronics)|cross sectioning]] or [[Scanning SQUID microscope|superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)]] can be used to identify the failure. &lt;ref&gt; C. Hillman. “A Novel Approach to Identifying and Validating Electrical Leakage in Printed Circuit Boards through Magnetic Current Imaging.” Proceedings from the 30th International Symposium for Testing and Failure Analysis, November 14-18, 2004 Worcester, Massachusetts. http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/DfR_Solutions_Website/Resources-Archived/Publications/2002-2004/2004_SQUID_Hillman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations and mitigation==
There are several design considerations and mitigation techniques that can be used to reduce the susceptibility to CAF. Certain material selection (i.e. laminate) and design rules (i.e. via spacing) can help reduce CAF risk. Poor adhesion between the resin and glass fibers in the PCB can create a path for CAF to occur. This may depend on parameters of the silane finish applied to the glass fibers, which is used to promote adhesion to the resin.&lt;ref&gt;S. Binfield, C. Hillman, T. Johnston, and N. Blattau, ”Conductive Anodic Filaments: The Role of Epoxy-Glass Adhesion”, DfR Solutions White Paper&lt;/ref&gt; There are also testing standards that can be performed to assess CAF risk. IPC TM-650 2.6.25 provides a test method to assess CAF susceptibility.&lt;ref name=IPC /&gt; Additionally, IPC TM-650 2.6.16 provides a pressure vessel test method to rapidly evaluate glass epoxy laminate integrity.&lt;ref&gt; IPC TM-650 2.6.16 Pressure Vessel Method for Glass Epoxy Laminate. https://www.ipc.org/TM/2.6.16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is helpful but it may often be better to use design rules and proper material selection to proactively mitigate the issue.

The '''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Акт проголошення незалежності України}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''Akt proholoshennya nezalezhnosti Ukrayiny'') was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on 24 August 1991.&lt;ref name=Magocsi&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;pg=PA722&amp;dq=16+July+1991+Ukrainian+state+sovereignty.&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ejEVUc-7G-Xa0QX4-4HgBg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=16%20July%201991%20Ukrainian%20state%20sovereignty.&amp;f=false A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples] by [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1442610212}} (page 722/723)&lt;/ref&gt; The Act established [[Ukraine]] as an independent state.&lt;ref name=Magocsi/&gt;

==Adoption==
The Act was adopted in the aftermath of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup attempt on 19 August]] when hardline [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist]] leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] tried to restore [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|central Communist party]] control over the USSR.&lt;ref name=Magocsi/&gt;  In response (during a tense 11-hour extraordinary session&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt;), the [[Verkhovna Rada#Soviet period (1938–1990)|Supreme Soviet]] (parliament) of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] in a special Saturday session overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration.&lt;ref name=Magocsi/&gt; The Act passed with 321 votes in favor, 2 votes against, and 6 [[abstention]]s (out of 360 attendants).&lt;ref name=UKrW191991&gt;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/359102.shtml Historic vote for independence], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (1 September 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The text was largely composed during the night of 23 August–24 August mainly by [[Levko Lukyanenko]], [[Serhiy Holovatyi]], [[Mykhailo Horyn]], [[Ivan Zayets]] and [[Viacheslav Chornovil|Vyacheslav Chornovil]].&lt;ref name="ukrainianweek222470"&gt;[https://ukrainianweek.com/History/222470 A reform that ruined the Soviet Union], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (10 November 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communists]] (CPU), being persuaded behind the scenes by their fellow Party member and [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|parliamentary chairman]] [[Leonid Kravchuk]],&lt;ref name="ukrainianweek222470"/&gt; felt there was no choice other than a decision to secede and, as they expressed it, distance themselves from the events in [[Moscow]], particularly the strong [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] movement in the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Russian Parliament]].&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt; "If we don't vote for independence, it will be a disaster," stated first secretary of the CPU [[Stanislav Hurenko]] during the debate.&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt; CPU members had been unnerved by the news of former [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine]] [[Vladimir Ivashko]]'s arrest in Moscow, the re-subordination of the [[Soviet Army]] under the leaders of the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] and the sealing of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party Central Committee]]'s premises.&lt;ref name="ukrainianweek222470"/&gt;

[[File:Проголошення незалежності України.pdf|thumb|The front page of the parliamentary newspaper ''[[Holos Ukrayiny]]'' with the text of the declaration printed on the lower half (27 August 1991)]]
The same day (24 August), the parliament called for a [[referendum]] on support for the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref name=Magocsi/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt; The proposal for calling the national referendum came jointly from [[Democratic Bloc (Ukraine)|opposition leaders]] [[Ihor Yukhnovsky]] and [[Dmytro Pavlychko]].&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt; The Parliament also voted for the creation of a [[National Guard of Ukraine#History|national guard of Ukraine]] and turned jurisdiction over all the armed forces located on Ukrainian territory over to itself.&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt;

Other than a noisy crowd that had gathered at the Parliament building, the streets of [[Kiev]] were quiet that day, with few signs of open celebration.&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt;

In the days that followed a number of resolutions and decrees were passed: nationalizing all CPU property and handing it over to the Supreme Soviet and local councils; issuing an amnesty for all political prisoners; suspending all CPU activities and freezing CPU assets and bank accounts pending official investigations into possible collaboration with the Moscow coup plotters; setting up a committee of inquiry into official behavior during the coup; and establishing a committee on military matters related to the creation of a [[Ministry of Defense of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt;

On 26 August 1991 the Permanent Representative of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] to the [[United Nations]] (the Ukrainian SSR was a [[Member states of the United Nations|founding member of the United Nations]]&lt;ref name=tellUN&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unms/ukraine.shtml |title=Activities of the Member States - Ukraine |accessdate=2011-01-17 |publisher=[[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Hennadiy Udovenko]] informed the office of the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] that his permanent mission to this international assembly would officially be designated as representing Ukraine.&lt;ref name=tellUN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/359104.shtml U.N. Mission stresses statehood of Ukraine], [[The Ukrainian Weekly]] (1 September 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 1991 the [[Ispolkom|executive committee]] of Kiev also voted to remove all the [[List of Communist monuments in Ukraine|monuments of Communist heroes]] from public places, including the Lenin monument on the central October Revolution Square.&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt; The large square would be renamed [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] (Independence Square) as would the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Kiev Metro)|central Metro station below it]], the executive committee decided.&lt;ref name=UKrW191991/&gt;

On 28 August 1991 more than 200,000 [[Lviv]] and [[Lviv oblast]] residents declared their readiness to serve in the [[National Guard of Ukraine#Pre-2000|national guard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/359106.shtml NEWSBRIEFS FROM UKRAINE], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (1 September 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|independence referendum on 1 December 1991]], the people of Ukraine expressed widespread support for the Act of Declaration of Independence, with more than 90% voting in favor, and 82% of the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]] participating.&lt;ref name=Magocsi/&gt; The referendum took place on the same day as Ukraine's [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1991|first direct presidential election]]; all six presidential candidates supported independence and campaigned for a "yes" vote. The referendum's passage ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying together even on a limited scale; Ukraine had long been second only to Russia in economic and political power.

A week after the election, newly elected president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] joined his [[Boris Yeltsin|Russian]] and [[Stanislav Shushkevich|Belarusian]] counterparts in signing the [[Belavezha Accords]], which declared that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l_uAoNJiOMwC&amp;pg=PA75 Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation] by [[Robert A.

The '''Drummer of Tedworth''' is a case of an alleged [[poltergeist]] manifestation in the West Country of England by [[Joseph Glanvill]], from his book ''[[Saducismus Triumphatus]]'' (1681).&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Michael. (2005). [http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/archive/00000250/01/Hunter4.pdf ''New light on the ‘Drummer of Tedworth’: conflicting narratives of witchcraft in Restoration England''.] Historical Research 78 (201) 311-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Early accounts reported that in 1661 a local landowner, John Mompesson, owner of a house in the town of [[Tedworth]] (now called Tidworth, in [[Wiltshire]]), had brought a lawsuit against an unlicensed vagrant drummer William Drury, whom he accused of collecting money by false pretences. After he had won judgment against the drummer, the drum was turned over to Mompesson by the local bailiff. Mompesson then found his house plagued by nocturnal drumming noises. It was alleged that the drummer had brought these plagues of noise upon Mompesson's head by [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref name=Aldridge&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1917046?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Aldridge, Alfred Owen. "Franklin and the Ghostly Drummer of Tedworth", ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Vol. 7, No. 4 (Oct., 1950), pp. 559-567 DOI: 10.2307/1917046]&lt;/ref&gt; Drury was said to have been associated with a band of [[Romani people|gypsies]]. 

Glanvill, who visited the house in 1663, had claimed to have heard strange scratching noises under a bed in the children's room.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Jane. (2012). ''Early Modern Supernatural: The Dark Side of European Culture, 1400–1700''. Praeger. pp. 147-148. {{ISBN|978-0-313-39343-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waller, John. (2004). ''Leaps in the Dark: The Making of Scientific Reputations''. Oxford University Press. pp. 20-21. {{ISBN|0-19-280484-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On Christmas Day 1667, [[Samuel Pepys]], in his diary, records his wife, Elizabeth, reading the story to him. He found it to be 'a strange story of spirits and worth reading indeed'.

In 1668, Glanvill published one of the earlier versions of ''Saducismus Triumphatus,'' his ''A Blow at Modern [[Sadducism]]'' ... To which is added, ''The Relation of the Fam'd Disturbance by the Drummer, in the House of Mr. John Mompesson.'' 

In Volume III of ''The Works of the Reverend John Wesley'' there is a reference to the Drummer at Tedworth. {{quote|text=The famous instance of this, which has been spread far and wide, was the drumming in Mr Mompesson's house at Tedworth;  who, it was said, acknowledged, 'It was all a trick, and that he had found out the whole contrivance.' Not so, my eldest brother, then at Christ Church, Oxon, inquired of Mr Mompesson, his fellow collegian, 'Whether his father had acknowledged this or not.' He answered, 'The resort of gentlemen to my father's house was so great, he could not bear the expense. He therefore took no pains to confute the report, that he had found out the cheat: although he and I, and all the family knew the account which was published, to be punctually true.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VsY7AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Works+of+the+Rev.+John+Wesley:+The+twelfth,+thirteenth,+fourteenth+...&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=732kUveVI4nNhAfh-4DwAw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Works%20of%20the%20Rev.%20John%20Wesley%3A%20The%20twelfth%2C%20thirteenth%2C%20fourteenth%20...&amp;f=false ''The Works of the Rev. John Wesley'', p. 246]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Drummer of Tedworth Sketch.png|thumb|Drummer of Tedworth]]

==Critical reception==

[[Charles Mackay (author)|Charles Mackay]], in his ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]'' (1841), considered the phenomena to be undoubtedly fraudulent produced by confederates of the drummer and suggested Mompesson was easily deceived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Mackay (author)|Mackay, Charles]]. (1856 edition). [https://archive.org/stream/memoirsextraord10mackgoog#page/n240/mode/2up ''Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds'']. London, New York: G. Routledge and Sons. pp. 226-227&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Amos Norton Craft]] (1881) also suggested that the phenomena were the result of trickery:

{{quote|text=We are to remember also, that the house of Mr. Mompesson contained several servants who doubtless possessed a good degree of human nature; Mr. Mompesson had caused the arrest and imprisonment of a member of a band of gypsies, who were intensely enraged at him on that account that the disturbance ceased as soon as the gypsy was transported beyond the sea and his associates had no farther hope of his release; that these manifestations began again as soon as the gypsy returned from transportation; that the gypsy professed to be the cause of the disturbance, and that the excited imagination would naturally add to the manifestations which the enraged trickster really produced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Norton Craft|Craft, Amos Norton]]. (1881). [https://archive.org/stream/EpidemicDelusions/Epidemic%20Delusions#page/n193/mode/2up ''Epidemic Delusions: Containing an Exposé of the Superstitions and Frauds which Underlie Some Ancient and Modern Delusions, Including Especial Reference to Modern Spiritualism'']. New York: Phillips &amp; Hunt. p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Addington Bruce]] (1908) has argued that the phenomenon was fraudulently manufactured by Mompesson's own children, especially his oldest daughter, a girl of ten. Bruce wrote that the noises and movement of objects were reminiscent of [[Practical joke|pranks]] and often occurred in the children's bedroom. Bruce noted that Glanvill "passed only one night in the haunted house, and of his several experiences there is none that cannot be set down to fraud plus imagination, with the children the active agents."&lt;ref&gt;[[Addington Bruce|Bruce, Addington]]. (1908). [https://archive.org/stream/historicghostsgh00bruciala#page/28/mode/2up ''Historic Ghosts and Ghost Hunters'']. New York: Moffat, Yard &amp; Company. pp. 28-35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Lang]] of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] wrote that "the Drummer was suspected, but, consciously or not, the children were probably the agents."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lang|Lang, Andrew]]. (1893). ''Fairies and Psychical Research''. In [[Robert Kirk (folklorist)|Robert Kirk]]. ''The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies''. London: David Nutt. pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drăgaica''' is the traditional [[Midsummer]] [[fair]] held annually in [[Buzău]], [[Romania]]. It takes place every year between 10 and 24 June.

==History==
The Drăgaica fair was initially a [[wool]] trading fair held in the mountain side of the [[Buzău River]] valley, every year, after the [[sheep shearing]]. Eventually, the fair moved to [[Buzău]], as shown by a document dated 26 August 1778 issued by [[Alexandru Ipsilanti]] by which full jurisdiction on the organization and the tax collection rights for the fair were granted to the Buzău [[Diocese|bishopric]].

[[Mihai Şuţu]] reinforced the bishopric's privileges on the collection of taxes from the fair in a 1792 letter:
{{cquote|The fair held every year in Buzău on June 24th... is named Drăgaica and lasts for three days. No customs collector or ''[[ispravnic]]'' or any servant of the hospodar should interfere, and the tax should be collected by the Bishopric.&lt;ref name=dragaica&gt;Petcu, 2002, pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1806, Buzău was burnt to the ground by the Ottoman army during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806-1812)|Russo-Turkish War of 1806-1812]], and the city's inhabitants took refuge in the villages in the nearby hills. The fair was thus suspended until 1829, when it was resumed in a rebuilt Buzău.&lt;ref name=dragaica&gt;Petcu, 2002, pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drăgaica fair is still being held in Buzău, once a year, for two weeks, in June.

[[File:Evacuation Chair Photographed by MECSL.jpg|thumb|Evacuation Chair Photographed by MECSL]]

An '''escape chair''' or '''evacuation chair''' is a device manufactured for the smooth descent of [[Stairs|stairways]] in the event of an emergency. The Evac Chair was invented in the United States in 1982.  The single-user operation device does not require heavy lifting to evacuate a person.

==Types==
The original '''Escape-Chair''', with various models for various situations, addresses the need for an evacuation solution in case there is an emergency, and egress out of a structure or vessel becomes imperative.

''The table below is based on the Escape-Chair Standard and the Comfort model for comparison.''

Enhanced models can have chairs that require two-person operation; however, these are more commonly used in ambulances. Lifting handles are used for descent and ascent of stairs. Caterpillar tracks are also used on the stairs.

==Laws==

=== United Kingdom ===
The DDA ACT&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/the-disability-discrimination-act-dda DDA ACT]'', The DDA Act was created in 1995 and has been amended since, the latest amendment was in 2005&lt;/ref&gt; says that every person is to have a safe entrance into and egress from a building.

Another law regarding chairs is the RRFSO.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made RRFSO]''. The RRFSO was created in 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Created in 2005, this regulation states that fire officers are not required to enter buildings.

Failure to follow the above laws can result in serious issues. If a person was to perish in the building due to a lack of adequate evacuation equipment, the owners or operators of the building could be charged with [[Corporate manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1 = |last1 = |first2 = |last2 = |first3 = |last3 = |first4 = |last4 = |title = HSE: Corporate manslaughter|url = http://www.hse.gov.uk/corpmanslaughter/|date = |publisher = |website = www.hse.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extinction vortices''' are a class of models through which [[conservation biology|conservation biologists]], [[conservation genetics|geneticists]] and [[ecologist]]s can understand the dynamics of and categorize [[extinction]]s in the context of their causes. Developed by M. E. Gilpin and [[Michael Soule|M. E. Soulé]] in 1986, there are currently four classes of extinction vortices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilpin |first=M. E. |last2=Soulé |first2=M. E. |year=1986 |chapter=Minimum Viable Populations: Processes of Species Extinction |pages=19–34 |editor=M. E. Soulé |title=Conservation Biology: The Science of Scarcity and Diversity |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Mass |isbn=0-87893-794-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two (R and D) deal with [[Natural environment|environmental]] factors that have an effect on the [[ecosystem]] or [[community]] level, such as [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], [[pollution]], [[habitat loss]] etc. Whereas the second two (F and A) deal with genetic factors such as [[inbreeding depression]] and [[outbreeding depression]], [[genetic drift]] etc.

==Types of vortices==

*'''R Vortex''': The R vortex is initiated when there is a disturbance which facilitates a lowering of [[population]] size (N) and a corresponding increase in variability (Var(r)). This event can make populations vulnerable to additional disturbances which will lead to further decreases in population size (N) and further increases in variability (Var(r)). A prime example of this would be the disruption of [[sex ratio]]s in a population away from the species optimum.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}
*'''D Vortex''': The D vortex is initiated when population size (N) decreases and variability (Var(r)) increases such that the spatial distribution (D) of the population is increased and the population becomes "patchy" or [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented]]. Within these fragments, local extinction rates increase which, through [[positive feedback]], further increases D.
*'''F Vortex''': The F vortex is initiated by a decrease in population size (N) which leads to a decrease in individual [[heterozygosity]] (an increase in autozygosity) and increases the rate of genetic drift, resulting in increased degrees of inbreeding depression and an increase in population [[genetic load]], which over time will result in extinction.
*'''A Vortex''': The A vortex is a result of an increase in genetic drift and a corresponding decrease in [[Genetic diversity|genetic variance]] which leads to a decrease in "population adaptive potential", and eventual extinction. This vortex can result from [[Invasive species|biological invasion]], resulting in large scale [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and outbreeding depression.

'''Formula SCCA''' or '''Formula Enterprises''' is a class of [[open wheel car|open wheel race car]] sanctioned by the [[Sports Car Club of America]]. A [[spec racing]] class, all chassis are produced by [[SCCA Enterprises]] in association with [[Van Diemen]] and include a sealed [[Mazda MZR engine|Mazda MZR]] powerplant. The chassis can also be fitted with closed-wheel bodywork and converted into a [[sportscar racing|sportscar]] to race in [[C Sports Racer]] or the L3 class of [[IMSA Prototype Lites]]. For the 2012 season, the car was also accepted into the [[U.S. F2000 National Championship]]'s National Class. According to the manufacturer's website, as of March 2010, 120 of the cars have been sold.

SCCA Enterprises also produces the [[Spec Racer Ford]] chassis.

==History==

The SCCA Enterprises introduced the formula and sports racer in 2002. The formula car was allowed in the [[Formula Atlantic]] club racing class. In 2003 [[SCCA]] Pro Racing created [[Sports Racing Pro Series]] for the formula (FS) and sports racer (SRP) cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Pro Racing announces Sports Racing Pro Series |url=http://www.scca-enterprises.com/news3-13-03.html |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811210656/http://www.scca-enterprises.com/news3-13-03.html |archivedate=August 11, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2004 racing season the class was merged with the [[U.S. F2000 National Championship]]. [[Elivan Goulart]] won the Formula SCCA championship and [[Neil Tilbor]] won the SCCA Sportscar Championship. Due to the lack of entries for the 2005 season the series was canceled.

The sports racer was allowed in the [[IMSA Lites]] L3 class for the 2007 season. The first season was a reasonable success with 8 drivers competing of which 4 raced the full season. [[Richard Spicer (race driver)|Richard Spicer]] won the championship with 7 wins out of 12 races. 2008 and 2009 saw a significant downfall in drivers with resp. 2 and 3 drivers competing. Therefore, the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] decided to drop the L3 class for 2010.

In 2010 SCCA Pro Racing launched the [[SCCA Pro Formula Enterprises]] together with the [[SCCA Pro Spec Racer]] class. The Formula Enterprises class raced with moderate success. At the end of the 2011 season it was announced that it would merge with the U.S. F2000 National Championship National Class. The national class also allowed [[Formula Continental]] cars. Sixteen-year-old Norwegian driver [[Henrik Furuseth]] took the championship for [[Cape Motorsports]]. For 2013 the National class only allowed Formula Enterprises cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USF2000 Makes National Class Changes for 2013|url=http://usf2000.com/news/12-09-19/USF2000_Makes_National_Class_Changes_for_2013.aspx|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, National class saw poor car counts and the class was discontinued for 2014, again leaving no professional series using the formula.

The '''Fresh Film Fest International Film Festival''' or '''Fresh Film Fest''' is an international student [[film festival]] held annually in August in [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Czech Republic]], first held in 2004.

==History==

The Fresh Film Fest is a successor of the [[CILECT]] festival that took place in [[Karlovy Vary]] during the 1980s, initially as an independent festival and subsequently as part of the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] (KVIFF). Over the years the CILECT festival was attended by filmmakers including [[Jan Svěrák]] and [[Emir Kusturica]].

Fresh Film Festival was founded in 2004 by three students from the [[Film and TV School of The Academy of Performing Arts in Prague]] (FAMU), as a competitive showcase of student films in the [[Czech Republic]]. The organizing team, consisting mostly of students from FAMU, presents public screenings of over 250 mainly student films each year, from various countries and genres.

==Format==

Fresh Film Fest is the largest international student film competition in the so-called Visegrad region (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland).{{cn|date=October 2018}} It is held over five days at the end of August and beginning of September, during which time around 300 works of student cinematography from around the world are shown across six cinema halls, as well as feature-length film screenings and music concerts. The festival screens an array of Central and Eastern European student films focused on the Visegrad Group countries. This section has been broadened to present work from across the whole Eastern European region. The festival also maintains contact with high-profile film schools including the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in Moscow, [[La Fémis]] in Paris, FAMU in Prague, the [[National Film and Television School]] in England, and [[Columbia University]] in New York, as well as showing student films from areas less well-known for film, such as Ecuador, Hong Kong, and Cuba. Fresh Film Fest usually opens its call for entries at the beginning of January and ends on April 30.

Each year since 2006, the festival has honoured one figure in international film by screening a retrospective program of all their films. One of those honoured in this way was [[Corneliu Porumboiu]], a participant in the first Fresh Film Fest competition and winner of the Camera d'Or (Golden Camera) at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

The festival is accompanied by a program of other activities and events, including professional workshops and seminars, school presentations and evening parties. The festivals juries are made up of film industry figures who award prizes for the best work.

Fresh Film Fest is a partner event of the KVIFF, with overlapping organizing teams, and originates from the expansion of its Student Films section. As a result, Fresh Film Fest can take advantage of many facilities used during KVIFF, including a 1000-capacity cinema hall, and five other cinemas, as well as the festival club scene and several lounge rooms.

== Staff ==

The members of the juries are mostly younger film-makers. The members of the pre-selection committees are program directors of various international film festivals such as [[Anifest]], Prague's [[Febiofest]], or the program managers of KVIFF and the Institute of Documentary Film.

The festival organisers have received awards for the festival itself, including two FAMU awards. The director of the second Fresh Film Fest trailer, Jakub Kohák, was awarded third prize for Best Trailer at the Czech advertising awards, "Louskáček". The second Fresh Film Fest visual concept created by art director Adéla Svobodová was awarded at the International Biennale of Graphic Design in [[Brno]]. The third Fresh Film Fest visual concept, created by the same author along with graphic designer Pauline Kerleroux, was awarded an Ogilvy CID Prize for Best Corporate Design in 2006, chosen by a jury of Czech graphics professionals and critics.

'''George''' "'''Guido'''" '''Lombardi''' (born 1950s) is an American real estate investor who is an advisor to [[Donald Trump]].  He is credited with launching social media groups supporting Trump's candidacy for U.S. president in 2016, such as "Latinos for Trump", though he was never officially part of the campaign.&lt;ref name="politico"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vinocur|first1=Nicholas|title=Donald Trump's European fixer...is his neighbor|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/trumps-ambassador-europe-far-right-news-lombardi/|website=Politico.eu|accessdate=17 January 2017|ref=politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombardi emigrated to the United States from Italy in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="politico" /&gt;  He is a former executive director of the International Council for Economic Development and the author of a book "Liberta' e Progresso Economico." (Freedom and Economic Progress).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northatlanticleague.net/who_we_are.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombardi received requests to meet with Trump from right-wing leaders in Europe, including French member of European Parliament and head of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] [[Marine Le Pen]], Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] and members of Austria's [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]].  Lombardi relayed the messages, but few requests to meet Trump have been granted.&lt;ref name="politico" /&gt;  Lombardi was famously spotted with [[Marine Le Pen]] having coffee at [[Trump Tower]] in New York, where Lombardi lives.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38600560&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the ''America Award'' of the [[Italy-USA Foundation]] in 2018.

== List of attacks on governments and organisations ==

=== Ethiopian government and Donald Trump ===
In Jan. 2016, ''GSH'' started its very first attacks by the defacing of [[Government of Ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] websites in response to the killing of nearly 500 students and activists by Ethiopian Security Forces during protests that became extremely violent was involved in the latter part of 2015 and then sparked again in August–October 2016 [[2016 Ethiopian protests|Ethiopian protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fossbytes.com/ghost-squad-hackers-hack-ethiopian-website-in-response-to-killing-of-students-during-protest/|title=Ghost Squad Hackers Hack Ethiopian Websites In Response To Killing Of Protesting Students|last=Shekhar|first=Amar|date=2016-01-07|work=Fossbytes|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then went on to target [[Donald Trump]]'s official website with [[Distributed-denial-of-service|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attacks in protest of what they saw as racist comments made towards Mexicans and refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/anonymous-offshoot-claims-to-have-taken-down-trump-sites/article/487429/|title=Ghost Squad Hackers hit Trump sites with DDoS attacks|date=2016-04-04|work=SC Media US|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after targeting Trump's official website GSH shut down Trump's hotel collection websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackread.com/donald-trump-hotel-collections-website-down/|title=Hacktivists Shut Down Donald Trump Hotel Collections Website|date=2016-05-21|work=HackRead|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli Defense Force ===
The group gained more notoriety after having successfully leaked data of the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Defense Force]] on April 7, 2016. This was the day  [[OpIsrael|#OpIsrael]] was launched along with [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], leaking the Database of [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel Defense Force]] posting thousands of [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldiers, border patrol, and [[Israeli Air Force]] personnel information online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/anthony-tyler/ghost-squad-hackers-release-massive-data-leak-israeli-defense-force/|title=Ghost Squad Hackers Release Massive Data-Leak From The Israeli Defense Force|date=2016-04-07|work=The Last American Vagabond|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ku Klux Klan ===
On April 23, 2016 ''GSH'' targeted the ''[[Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]]'' by taking their websites down in the protest of racism while [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] vs. [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] protests were happening in the state of Georgia, U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackread.com/anonymous-ghost-squad-ddos-on-kkk-website/|title=Anonymous Ghost Squad's DDoS Attack Shuts Down KKK Website|last=Waqas|date=2016-04-24|work=HackRead|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.mic.com/articles/amp/141839/anonymous-group-hacks-the-kkk-and-shuts-down-its-website|title=Anonymous Just Scored a Major Victory Against the KKK|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghost Squad Hackers'' did the same however, in a turn of events taking down [[Black Lives Matter|''Black Lives Matter''']]''s'' official [https://blacklivesmatter.com/ website] after claiming the organization fueled further racism.

=== Banks/Operation Icarus ===
''GSH'' and ''[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]'' worked in correlation together when "[https://security.radware.com/ddos-threats-attacks/threat-advisories-attack-reports/opicarus2017/ Operation Icarus]" was first launched in February 2016.The op was aimed at attacking the [[Rothschild banking dynasty|central banking system]] which the attackers accused the banks with corruption and wanted to raise public awareness. This attack sparked the invitation of more hacking teams and affiliations of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] to focus their attention towards that of the [[Rothschild banking dynasty|Central Banks]] in direct regards of further scrutiny and cyber attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/opicarus-anonymous-shuts-down-bank-england-12-more-international-banks-1559859|title=OpIcarus: Did Anonymous just hack the Bank of England?|last=Ashok|first=India|date=2016-05-13|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ghost Squad Hacker's'' leader 's1ege' claimed responsibility for the attacks which were carried out on the [[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England]] email server and dozens of other banking websites including the [[New York Stock Exchange]], [[Bank of France]], [[Bank of Greece]], [[Bank of Jordan]] and the Bank of South Korea, among others. "s1ege" went on to state that they want to "start an online revolution" to retaliate against the "elite banking cartels putting the world in a perpetual state of chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/uk/342958-opicarus-anonymous-bank-england/|title=OpIcarus: Anonymous hackers shut down Bank of England, call for ‘online revolution’|work=RT International|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fox News, CNN and the United States Military/Operation Silence ===
Notoriety of the group continued to escalate as the heat was turned up during the month of June, 2016. After censoring of media coverage in regards to [[OpIsrael]], [http://news.softpedia.com/news/anonymous-announces-opsilence-month-long-attacks-on-mainstream-media-504760.shtml OpSilence] was initiated targeting mainstream media outlets such as [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalforensicsmagazine.com/blogs/?p=1274|title=Expert Opinion on #OpSilence attack on CNN email servers|website=digitalforensicsmagazine.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-04/anonymous-declares-war-mainstream-media-attacks-fox-cnn-nbc-and-more|title='Anonymous' Declares War On Mainstream Media: Attacks Fox, CNN, NBC And More|work=Zero Hedge|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A data dump was later leaked after hacking the [[United States Armed Forces|United States Military]] personnel files and releasing information on close to 2,437 army personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/ghost-squad-hackers-leak-data-of-us-military-personnel-505606.shtml|title=Ghost Squad Hackers Leak Data of US Military Personnel|last=Cimpanu|first=Catalin|work=softpedia|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.secureworldexpo.com/industry-news/hackers-leak-military-data|title=Hackers Leak Military Data|last=Team|first=SecureWorld News|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;The information contained in the link was uploaded to an [[Onion Link|onion link]] on the [[Darknet|dark web]] along with a [[Pastebin.com|paste-bin]] link which contained credit card numbers and personal information on [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackread.com/ghost-squad-hackers-leak-us-military-data/|title=Hackers Just Leaked Personal Data of US Military Officials and it's Legit|last=Waqas|date=2016-06-23|work=HackRead|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siliconangle.com/2016/06/24/hackers-steal-and-leak-us-military-personnel-data/|title=Hackers steal and leak US military personnel data - SiliconANGLE|date=2016-06-24|work=SiliconANGLE|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.enigmasoftware.com/thousands-us-military-personnel-records-leaked-dark-web-ghost-squad-hackers/|title=Thousands of US Military Personnel Records Leaked on Dark Web by Ghost Squad Hackers - Remove Spyware &amp; Malware with SpyHunter - EnigmaSoft Ltd|date=2016-06-24|work=Remove Spyware &amp; Malware with SpyHunter - EnigmaSoft Ltd|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baton Rouge City government website ===
July 19, 2016 the sub domain of [https://www.brla.gov/ Baton Rouge City government website] was hacked twice in one day by ''GSH'' after previously making news after attack towards both the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] and [[Black Lives Matter|BLM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackread.com/baton-rouge-city-website-hacked/|title=Baton Rouge City Website Hacked Against Alton Sterling's Death|last=Waqas|date=2016-07-19|work=HackRead|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks however were targeting the City of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] in protest against police brutality in which a city native [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Alton Sterling]] was shot and killed by [[Baton Rouge Police Department|Baton Rouge police]] officers on the 5th earlier that month. The [https://www.brla.gov/ Baton Rouge website] was defaced along with a picture of [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Alton Sterling]] with a message that read, "Being black is not a crime! This is for the shooting of [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Alton Sterling]], just because he's black does not mean he is a bad guy. You will pay. We are the justice. We are Ghost Squad Hackers. /R.I.P.

=== Afghanistan government and its officers ===
Later in the same month ''GSH'' took over the official [[Twitter]] account of [[Abdullah Abdullah|Afghanistan's Chief Executive Dr. Abdullah Abdullah]] in an effort to raise awareness against corruption and alleged drug deals between [[Afghanistan]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] They also targeted the [http://dab.gov.af/en/page/about-the-bank/departments/cib Afghan Public Credit Registry website] by defacing it which also further allowed them access to several social media accounts including [[Abdullah Abdullah|Dr. Abdullah's]] in which they tweeted,

"[[AfghanistanGovernement|Afghanistan Gov]] Hacked by GhostSquadHackers #CheifExecutiveOfficer Can you hear me now? twitter.com/afgexecutive. We found an exploit in the government server and pulled every login we could. We have more also but [[Abdullah Abdullah|Dr. Abdullah]] was not using phone restriction and 2FA was not enabled", G4mm4 of ''GSH'' stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackread.com/twitter-account-dr-abdullah-hacked/|title=Twitter Account of Afghan Chief Executive Dr. Abdullah Hacked|last=Waqas|date=2016-07-31|work=HackRead|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks on the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] continued relentlessly on the first of September after prior targeting of Afghanistan's Chief Executive [[Twitter]] account, ''GSH'' further assaulted the government by defacing twelve websites in one day all of which were affiliated with the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/ghost-squad-hackers-deface-12-afghan-government-websites-507900.shtml|title=Ghost Squad Hackers Deface 12 Afghan Government Websites|last=Cimpanu|first=Catalin|work=softpedia|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the [[Ministry of Justice (Afghanistan)|Afghanistan's Ministry of Justice]], the [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, and the [[Attorney General's Office of Afghanistan|Afghan Attorney General's Office]]. Further assaults continued in hopes of raising awareness for [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] as part of [http://news.softpedia.com/news/anonymous-announces-opsilence-month-long-attacks-on-mainstream-media-504760.shtml OpSilence] and [[OpIsrael]] after shutting down the Israeli Prime [[Prime Minister of Israel|Minister]] and the [[Bank of Israel]]. [https://www.hackread.com/ghost-squad-attacks-israeli-prime-minister-site/]

=== ISIS ===
The groups focus in 2017 shifted slightly towards targeting [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] and removing them off the [[internet]] and [[social media]] completely. A multitude of accounts from [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]] alike were hacked and added to an extensive list of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] removed. Further efforts by ''GSH'' later revealed bomb instructions and plans to be carried out by ISIS. A guide was also published as an [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] move to help enlist the talent of other hackers in hopes to further the attack on ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thefreethoughtproject.com/anonymous-hacks-isis-accounts-finds-attacks-planned-for-us-bomb-making-plans/|title=BREAKING: Anonymous Hacks ISIS Accounts Finds Attacks Planned for US, Bomb-Making Plans|date=2017-12-12|work=The Free Thought Project|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nyeveningnews.com/2018/05/14/anonymous-hacks-isis-accounts-finds-attacks-planned-for-us-bomb-making-plans/|title=Anonymous Hacks ISIS Accounts Finds Attacks Planned for US, Bomb-Making Plans! - NY Evening|date=2018-05-14|work=NY Evening|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Great Dorset Steam Fair''' (abbreviated '''GDSF'''&lt;!--redirects here--&gt;, and since 2010 also known as '''The National Heritage Show''') is an annual show featuring [[steam engine|steam-powered]] vehicles and machinery. It now covers {{convert|600|acre|km2}} and runs for five days. This used to be from the Wednesday after the UK August bank holiday, but from 2016 will be from the Wednesday before the Bank Holiday until the Bank Holiday itself.  It is reputedly the largest collection of steam and vintage equipment to be seen anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dorset/content/articles/2006/03/15/great_dorset_steam_fair_feature.shtml |title=The Great Dorset Steam Fair|year=2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fair was founded by the Dorset steam &amp; historc vehicle club , and has been held in [[Dorset]], [[England]], every summer since 1969. The show is now run by Michael Oliver's son, Martin Oliver through Great Dorset Steam Fair Ltd.

==History==
Established in 1969, for the first 15 years of its existence the steam fair (then known as the 'Great Working of Steam Engines')&lt;!--Original poster: https://www.facebook.com/GreatDorsetSteamFair/photos/a.193472987335583.56535.193459127336969/1039347356081471/?type=1&amp;fref=nf--&gt; was held at [[Stourpaine]] Bushes,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdsf.co.uk/index.php/visitor-information/history-of-the-show |title=History of the show |publisher=GDSF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1985 it temporarily moved to nearby Everley Hill, as Bushes Farm were delayed in harvesting the crops from the fields used by the steam fair due to the weather conditions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1988, after 3 years at Everley Hill, where access by large crowds was difficult, it moved to its current permanent home at [[Tarrant Hinton]], north of [[Blandford Forum]], where access is vastly improved.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The fair now attracts up to 200,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-34125571 |title=Thousands attend Great Dorset Steam Fair |publisher=BBC |date=2 September 2015 |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
[[File:Steam fair 2004.JPG|thumb|The steam fair in 2004]]
The most numerous exhibits are [[traction engine]]s, [[tractor]]s and farm machinery, but there are also sections for classic cars and commercial vehicles, working [[shire horse]]s, rustic crafts, 'bygones' displays, and more.  The show also has a market, [[autojumble]], live music and [[funfair]] (some of which is powered by the steam engines).  The funfair has traditional rides such as [[gallopers]] and steam boats, as well as modern ones like the "World Fair Wheel" which was sited in [[Manchester]] for the millennium. It is the biggest gathering of [[fairground organ]]s in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The show regularly attracts around 200,000 visitors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dorset/content/articles/2006/03/15/great_dorset_steam_fair_feature.shtml Preview of 38th Fair], [[BBC]] [[Dorset]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and there can be 30,000 people on site, making the fair the fifth largest population centre in Dorset, after [[Bournemouth]], [[Poole]], [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] (the population of the historic town of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] being only half that number).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Appleton and Ian Allan, ''A Celebration of Great Dorset Steam'', 2006. {{ISBN|0-7110-3195-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A speciality of the show is the display of traction engines and [[steamroller|steam rollers]] performing the work for which they were designed.  Such displays include heavy haulage, [[threshing]], sawing logs, [[plough]]ing and road-making. The main arena of the show is purposely sited on the slope of a hill to allow both steam- and internal combustion-powered machinery to demonstrate their capacity for heavy load hauling. One of the main displays is the "Showman's Line up", in the vintage fairground section, which is thought to be the largest collection of showman's engines in the world.

Since 2003, the show has contracted its own radio station, Steam Fair FM, broadcasting 24 hours daily on 87.9 FM from the Sunday prior to the show, to the Tuesday following – 10 days in all. The station, which is also streamed on the internet, covers show news and views, weather and other relevant information with plenty of listener dedications and a format of "Vintage Hits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steam Fair FM|url=http://www.steamfairfm.com|publisher=Great Dorset Steam Fair|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the event, the station is advertised on roads in the surrounding area and provides traffic news for drivers using the A354 Blandford to Salisbury road that passes the show site. 
For the 40th anniversary, in 2008, the organisers recreated the very first fair, by tracing all of the exhibits that were displayed at the 1969 show.&lt;ref&gt;Great Dorset Steam Fair – 2008 Programme.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directors' Thanksgiving Service==
The end of the fair used to be marked with the Director's Thanksgiving Service on the Sunday, at 12 noon, which took place on the stage of Dean's Bioscope, organised for many years by Chris Edmonds, the Lay Chaplain until his death in 2007. The Rev'd Dr Michael Foster, a friend of Chris, and the local Rector of Tarrant Hinton, continued to organise the Thanksgiving Service, with Sally, Chris' widow. Fr Michael was appointed Chaplain to the Show at the Thanksgiving Service September 2011, having been Assistant Chaplain for some four years. It was Fr Michael who conducted the founder of the Fair, Michael Oliver's Funeral in 2009. The Directors' Thanksgiving Service is now organised to begin the Show, on the opening Wednesday, as was the practice in some past years.

==Dorset Sound Festival==
[[File:GDSF (2007) Shomans Engines at night.JPG|thumb|right|Night-time view of the line-up of [[showman's engine]]s, in the fairground (2007).]]
2008 saw the start of the '''Dorset Sound Festival''', a music event that is held alongside the main fair, designed to entertain a wide variety of musical tastes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The festival included five stages: the Main Stage, Real Ale Stage, Folk Stage, Country &amp; Western Marquee and the Black Bull Marquee. Bands featured were mainly [[tribute acts]], including [[the Bootleg Beatles]].

In 2009, the Main Stage was changed from being inside a marquee to an outdoor concert stage. This required a concert ticket to be purchased unlike the other marquees that are free to visitors of the fair. 2009 saw the start of a new event called Steam Sounds that showcases [[unsigned artists]] from around the local area on the outdoor stage. The Main Stage is now free to all and does not require a ticket for entry as of 2014

==World Records==
On 31 August 2013, GDSF set a new [[World Record]] for the largest parade of [[steam roller]]s, when 103 rollers were driven into the main arena for a photo call. The previous record had been set by GDSF in 2003 with 32 steam rollers. The requirements for the record attempt, which took place on a newly created 80m-long (260&amp;nbsp;ft) section of road at the showground, included the fact the vehicles had to be moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fred Dibnah's steamroller in Great Dorset Steam Fair record attempt |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-23896775 |publisher=BBC News Dorset |accessdate=29 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LUuaxK8Q?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-23896775 |archivedate=29 November 2013 |date=31 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The citation from [[Guinness World Records]] is as follows:&lt;ref name=Guinness&gt;{{cite web |title=Entry for 'Largest Parade of Steam Rollers' |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/8000/largest-parade-of-steam-rollers |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=29 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LUqYpgbO?url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/8000/largest-parade-of-steam-rollers |archivedate=29 November 2013 |date=29 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The largest parade of steam rollers consists of 103 vintage steam rollers and was achieved by the Great Dorset Steam Fair (UK) in Tarrant Hinton, Dorset, UK, on 31 August 2013.&lt;ref name=Guinness/&gt;||}}

A regular section of the fair is the road making demonstration, where workers in period costume use vintage equipment to demonstrate how roads were built before the invention of tarmacadam, using crushed stone. An extra section of road was built during the 2013 show, for the purpose of breaking the record: "greatest number of steam rollers going over a newly laid piece of road". The 103 steam rollers, and a large number of diesel rollers, were all driven over the new section of road before continuing to the main arena. "Lord Jellicoe", a [[John Fowler &amp; Co.|Fowler]] formerly owned by the founder of the fair, Michael Oliver, was the 33rd roller in the procession and hence the first to break the record. Also taking part in the parade was "Betsy", the [[Aveling and Porter|Aveling &amp; Porter]] roller restored by steeplejack, [[Fred Dibnah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dorset steamrollers world record confirmed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-25153677 |publisher=BBC News Dorset |accessdate=29 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LUqV1g7R?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-25153677 |archivedate=29 November 2013 |date=29 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 event also saw the public debut of the home-built [[Hudspith Steam Bicycle]].&lt;ref name="Hudspith-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pattle/nacc/arc0373.htm|title=The Hudspith Steam Bicycle|last=Hudspith|first=Geoff|year=2001|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9652">{{Auber operas}}'''''Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué''''' (''Gustavus III, or The Masked Ball'') is an ''opéra historique'' or [[grand opera]] in five acts by [[Daniel Auber]], with a libretto by [[Eugène Scribe]]. 

==Performance history==
It received its first performance at the [[Salle Le Peletier]] of the [[Paris Opéra]] on 27 February 1833, with costumes designed by Eugène Lami and Paul Lormier, and sets by Léon Feuchère (Act I and Act V, scene 2), Jules Diéterle (Act II), Alfred (Act III), [[Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri]] (Act IV), René-Humanité Philastre and [[Charles-Antoine Cambon]] (Act V, scene 1). The opera was a major success for the composer, with 168 performances until 1853.

Ellen Creathorne Clayton has translated French critic [[Jules Janin]]'s description of the last act, which was often presented separately from the opera, as follows:
:I believe," says Jules Janin, "that never, even at the Opéra, was seen a spectacle more grand, more rich, more curious, more magnificent, that the fifth act of ''Gustave''. It is a fairlyland of beautiful women, of gauze, of velvet, of grotesqueness, of elegance, of good taste and of bad taste, of details, of learned researches, of esprit, of madness and of whimsicality — of every thing in a word, which is suggestive of the eighteenth century. When the beautiful curtain is raised, you find yourself in an immense ballroom." The stage of the Grand Opéra, the largest in Paris, is admirably adapted for masked balls, and the side-scenes being removed, the stage was surrounded a salon, the decorations of which corresponded with those of the boxes. "This salle de bal is overlooked by boxes, these boxes are filled with masks, who play the part of spectrators. At their feet, constantly moving, is the circling crowd, disguised in every imaginable costume, and dominoes of every conceivable hue. Harlequins of all fashions, clowns, peddlers, what shall I say? One presents the appearance of a tub, another of a guitar; his neighbor is disguised ''en botte d'asperges''; that one is a mirror, this a fish; there is a bird, here is a time-piece — you can hardly imagine the infinite confusion. Peasants, marquises, princes, monks, I know not what, mingle in one rainbow-hued crowd. It is impossible to describe this endless madness, this whirl, this ''bizarrerie'', on which the rays of two thousand wax tapers, in their crustal lustres, pour an inundation of mellow light. I, who am so well accustomed to spectacles like this — I, who am, unfortunately, not easily disposed to be surprised — I am yet dazzled with this radiant scene."&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 1865, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-0WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 324–325].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
:Place: [[Stockholm]]
:Time: 15 and 16 March 1792

The opera concerns some aspects of the real-life assassination of [[Gustavus III]], King of Sweden. 

The major aspects of the plot can be found first in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s planned opera, ''[[Gustavo III (Verdi)|Gustavo III]]'', which was never performed as written, but whose major elements were incorporated into a revised version of the story in the opera which eventually became ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''.

==Recordings==
*''Gustave III'': Laurence Dale, {{ill|Rima Tawil|fr}}, Christian Treguier, French Lyrique Orchestra; Intermezzo Vocal Ensemble, conducted by Michel Swierczewski ([[Arion (record label)|Arion]], 1993)
*The overture and ballet music from ''Gustave III'' appears at the end of the second disc of Richard Bonynge's recording of Auber's ''[[Le domino noir]]''.

== History  ==
The Product Exhibition Hall building was originally designed by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[architect]] [[Jan Letzel]]. The design included a distinctive dome at the highest part of the building.  It was completed in April 1915 and was named the ''Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition'' (HMI).&lt;ref name="n" /&gt; It was formally opened to the public in August that year. In 1921, the name was changed to the ''Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition Hall'', and again, in 1933, to the ''Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall''. The building was located in the large business district next to the [[Aioi Bridge]] and was primarily used for arts and educational exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Logan|first=William|title=Places of Pain and Shame: Dealing with 'Difficult Heritage'|year=2008|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atomic bombing ===

At 8:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 6 August 1945, the first [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|atomic bomb]] to be used in war was dropped by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] from the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', a [[B-29]] [[bomber]]. The force of the atomic bomb effectively obliterated the city of [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schofield, John and Cocroft, Wayne (eds.)|title=A Fearsome Heritage: Diverse Legacies of the Cold War|year=2009|publisher=Left Coast Press|isbn=}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, on 25 July, General [[Carl Spaatz]], commander of the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific]], received orders to deliver a "special bomb" attack on selected cities in Japan.&lt;ref name="Van Rhyn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Rhyn|first=Mark E. |title=Hiroshima, Bombing of |url=https://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5234.htm|publisher=PBS|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first target city chosen was Hiroshima, which had an important port on southern [[Honshu]] and was headquarters of the [[Second General Army (Japan)|Japanese Second General Army]] with 40,000 [[military personnel]] in the city.&lt;ref name="Van Rhyn"/&gt; The [[atomic bomb|bomb]] was assembled in secret and loaded on the ''[[Enola Gay]]''. It consisted of a [[uranium]] isotope 235 core shielded by hundreds of kilograms of [[lead]]. The bomb, code named "[[Little Boy]]", possessed a force equivalent to 15,000 tons of [[TNT]]. The plane dropped Little Boy over the city at 8:15:17&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time on 6 August 1945. Within 43 seconds of being dropped, it detonated over the city, missing its target by {{convert|240|m|abbr=on}}. Intended for the [[Aioi Bridge]], the bomb instead exploded directly over the [[Shima Hospital]], which was very near to the Genbaku Dome. Because the explosion was almost directly overhead, the building was able to retain its shape.&lt;ref name="Ide 2007 12–23"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ide|first=Kanako|title=A Symbol of Peace and Peace Education: The Genbaku Dome in Hiroshima|journal=Journal of Aesthetic Education|date=Winter 2007|volume=41|series=4|pages=12–23 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jae/summary/v041/41.4ide.html |accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's vertical columns were able to resist the nearly vertical downward force of the blast, and parts of the concrete and brick outer walls remained intact. The center of the blast occurred {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}} horizontally and {{convert|600|m|abbr=on}} vertically from the Dome.  Everyone inside the building was killed instantly.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall Memorial Plaque&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Milam | first1 =Michael C. |date=July–August 2010 | title = Hiroshima and Nagasaki | journal = Humanist | volume = 70 | issue =4 | pages = 32–35 | location = Buffalo, NY | publisher = American Humanist Association and the American Ethical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preservation ==

The building was the only structure left standing near the bomb’s [[hypocenter]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome)|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon commonly called the Genbaku ("A-Bomb") Dome, due to the exposed metal dome framework at its apex, the structure was scheduled to be demolished with the rest of the ruins, but the majority of the building was intact, delaying the demolition plans. The Dome became a subject of controversy, with some locals wanting it torn down, while others wanted to preserve it as a memorial of the bombing and a symbol of peace.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshima Peace Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, when the reconstruction of Hiroshima began, the skeletal remains of the building were preserved.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

From 1950 through 1964, the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]] was established around the Dome. The Hiroshima City Council adopted a resolution in 1966 on the permanent preservation of the Genbaku Dome, officially named the Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome). The Dome continues to be the park’s primary landmark.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

[[File:Hiroshima Dome 1945.gif|thumb|237px|The Genbaku Dome amidst the devastation in October 1945. Photograph by [[Shigeo Hayashi]], one of two photographers attached to the academic survey teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/exhibit_e/exh0702_e/exh070201_e.html#01 |title=Let's look at the Special Exhibit: Hiroshima on October 5, 1945 |publisher=Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Weathering and deterioration of the Genbaku Dome continued in the post-war period. The Hiroshima City Council declared in 1966 that it intended to indefinitely preserve the structure, now termed "Genbaku Dome". The first popularly elected mayor of Hiroshima, [[Shinzo Hamai]] (1905–1968) sought funds for the preservation effort domestically and internationally. During one trip to Tokyo, Hamai resorted to collecting funds directly on the streets of the capital. Preservation work on the Genbaku Dome was completed in 1967.&lt;ref name="n" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Jinmei Daijiten |title=浜井信三 |trans-title=Shinzo Hamai |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-10-23 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=25 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Genbaku Dome has undergone two minor preservation projects to stabilize the ruin, notably between October 1989 and March 1990.&lt;ref name="n" /&gt;

The Genbaku Dome stands almost exactly as it did after the bombing on 6 August 1945.  Changes to the ruins, meant to ensure the stability of the structure, have been minimal.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

== UNESCO World Heritage Site ==

In December 1996, the Genbaku Dome was registered on the UNESCO World Heritage List based on the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.&lt;ref name="n" /&gt; Its inclusion into the UNESCO list was based on its survival from a destructive force (atomic bomb), the first use of nuclear weapons on a human population, and its representation as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

Delegates to the World Heritage Committee from China and the United States had reservations regarding the confirmation of the memorial as a World Heritage Site. China cited the possibility that the monument could be used to downplay the fact that the victim countries of Japan's aggression suffered the greatest losses of life during the war, and the United States stated that having a memorial to a war site would omit the necessary historical context. The United States dissociated itself from the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repco96x.htm#annex5 WH Committee: Report of the 20th Session, Merida 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hotelicopter''''' is an [[April Fools' Day]] video produced as a [[viral video|viral]] marketing campaign by Hotelicopter, a now defunct hotel search site, in 2009. It showed a craft based on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] giant [[Mil V-12]] military helicopter, leading millions to believe the world's first [[luxury hotel]]/[[helicopter]] was a reality. The video and website explained the first commercial flight of ''Hotelicopter'' was scheduled to take off on 26 June 2009 from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] in [[New York City]], and reach the UK later that August.

In 2010, the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' named the ''Hotelicopter'' as one of its top five online April Fools' pranks. ''[[The Times]]'' also included the prank in its "10 best travel April fools", rating it as 10/10.

It took place at the [[Huanggutun Railway Station]] near [[Shenyang]], where Zhang's personal train was destroyed by a railside explosion.

[[File:Huanggutun Incident.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Huanggutun railroad shortly after the explosion]]

==Background==
Following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911, China dissolved in spontaneous devolution, with local officials and military leaders assuming power independent of control by the weak central government.  In [[north China]] the once powerful [[Beiyang Army]] split up into various factions after the death of [[Yuan Shikai]] in 1916. Zhang Zuolin, being the leader of the [[Fengtian clique]], was one of the most powerful warlords, as he managed to seize control of [[Manchuria]], at the time consisting of nine provinces.

At the time of the [[First United Front (China)|First United Front]] in 1924, foreign support in China was generally divided as follows:
* [[Fengtian clique]] — [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]
* [[Zhili clique]] — Europeans &amp; [[United States]]
* [[Kuomintang]] — [[Soviet Union]]

The [[Fengtian clique]]'s support from abroad was the [[Empire of Japan]], which had vested economic and political interests in the region dating from the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and was interested in exploiting their region’s largely untapped natural resources. The Japanese [[Kwantung Army]], based in the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]], also had responsibility for safeguarding the [[South Manchurian Railway]] and thus had troops stationed in Manchuria, providing material and logistical support for the Fengtian clique. The cooperation initially worked to the mutual benefit of both parties.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang, the US and China. Pp. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang provided security for the railroad and Japanese economic interests, suppressing Manchuria’s endemic banditry problem and allowing extensive Japanese investments. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] assisted Zhang in the two Zhili-Fengtian Wars, including the suppression of the anti-Fengtian uprising by Gen. [[Guo Songling]] (a senior Fengtian clique leader). However, Zhang only wanted Japan's aid for consolidating and expanding his territory, whereas Japan envisioned a future joint occupation of Manchuria with Zhang. After Zhang achieved his objectives, he tried to improve relations with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], allowing both countries open access to the trade, investment and economic opportunities in Manchuria that he had formerly allowed only to the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, Japanese Imperialism. Pp. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

This change in policy came at a time when Japan was in the midst of a severe economic crisis from the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] and successive economic depressions, and caused both alarm and irritation in the Kwantung Army leadership. The situation was further complicated by the success of the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]], in which the [[Kuomintang]] successively defeated [[Sun Chuanfang]], [[Wu Peifu]] and other warlords of the Northern Faction, as well as the [[Beijing]] government controlled by Zhang Zuolin. The Nationalist army appeared poised to restore its rule over Manchuria, which was still officially claimed as part of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

The Nationalists, the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and other elements in the Northern Expedition at the time were supported by the [[Soviet Union]], which had already installed [[puppet state|puppet governments]] in nearby [[Mongolia]] and [[Tannu Tuva]].

From the Japanese perspective, for Manchuria to fall either under Soviet or Nationalist domination was strategically unacceptable, and Zhang Zuolin no longer appeared trustworthy as an ally capable of maintaining a de facto independent Manchuria. Japan needed a context to effectively establish control over Manchuria without combat or foreign intervention, and it believed splitting up the Fengtian clique via replacement of Zhang with a more cooperative leader would do so.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon. A Modern History of Japan. Pp.187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of the Incident==
=== The explosion ===
Zhang left Beijing to go to [[Shenyang]] by train on the night of June 3, 1928. The train traveled along the [[Jingha Railway|Jingfeng Railway]], a route that was heavily patrolled by his own troops. The only location along the railway that was not under Zhang's control was a bridge several kilometres east of Huanggutun Railway Station on the outskirts of Shenyang, where the [[South Manchuria Railway]] crossed the Jingfeng Railway on the bridge.

Col. [[Daisaku Komoto]], a junior officer in the Kwantung Army, believed that the assassination of Zhang would be the most expeditious way of installing a new leader more amenable to Japanese demands, and planned an operation without direct orders from Tokyo. His subordinate, Capt. [[Kaneo Tomiya]], was in charge of executing the plan.  The bomb itself was planted on the bridge by Sapper 1st Lt. [[Fujii Sadatoshi]]. When Zhang's train passed the bridge at 5:23&amp;nbsp;a.m. on  June 4, the bomb exploded. Several of Zhang's officials, including the governor of [[Heilongjiang]] province [[Wu Junsheng]] (吳俊升), died immediately. Zhang was mortally wounded and sent back to his home in Shenyang. He died several hours later.

===Aftermath===
At the time of the assassination, the Kwantung Army was already in the process of grooming [[Yang Yuting (warlord)|Yang Yuting]], a senior general in the Fengtian clique, to be Zhang’s successor.  However, the actual assassination apparently took even the Kwantung Army leadership off guard, as troops were not mobilized and the Kwantung Army was unable to take any advantage by blaming Zhang’s Chinese enemies and using the incident as a ''[[casus belli]]'' for a Japanese military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, Japanese Imperialism. Pp. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the incident was soundly condemned by the international community and by both military and civilian authorities in Tokyo itself. The emergence of Zhang’s son [[Zhang Xueliang]] as successor and leader of the Fengtian clique also came as a surprise.

==Consequences==
The younger Zhang, in order to avoid any conflict with Japan and chaos that might provoke the Japanese into a military response, did not directly accuse Japan of complicity in his father's murder, but instead quietly carried out a policy of reconciliation with the Nationalist government of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], which left him as recognized ruler of Manchuria instead of Gen. Yang Yuting. The assassination thus considerably weakened Japan's political position in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, The Search for Modern China. Pp. 390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, Japanese Imperialism. Pp. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the assassination, which was conducted by low-ranking officers, did not have the prior consent of the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office]] or the civilian government. In fact, Emperor [[Hirohito]] harshly criticized the event and eventually dismissed [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Tanaka Giichi]] for his inability to arrest and prosecute the plotters of the incident, although privately he accepted the military's argument that doing so would be disadvantageous to Japan's military and foreign policy &lt;ref&gt;Bix. ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan''. pages 216-218  Zhang was a de jure [[head of state]] because he held absolute power over the internationally recognized [[Beiyang government]] based in [[Beijing]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}}

In order to achieve its goals in Manchuria, the Kwantung Army was forced to wait several years before [[Mukden Incident|creating another incident]] to justify the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] and subsequent establishment of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] under [[Puyi]].

==Background==
An [[Alids|Alid]] by birth, Ibrahim was one of the eighteen or nineteen{{sfn|Kohlberg|1993|p=647}} sons of the seventh Shi'ite [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|imam]] [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa al-Kazim]] (d. 799),  and a great-great-great-great-grandson of [['Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. He was a brother of the eighth imam [[Ali al-Ridha|'Ali ibn Musa al-Rida]] (d. 818), who was briefly the designated heir of the Abbasid caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813–833).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|p=100}}; {{harvnb|Buyukkara|2002|p=447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolt in the Yemen==
Ibrahim became active as a rebel following the damaging [[Fourth Fitna|civil war]] of 811–813 between the rival caliphs [[al-Amin]] and al-Ma'mun, which had greatly weakened the ability of the Abbasid government to maintain its authority in [[Baghdad]] and the provinces of the empire.{{sfn|Rekaya|1991|p=334}} While in [[Mecca]] in 815, he was appointed by [[Abu al-Saraya al-Sari ibn Mansur]], who had launched a pro-Alid revolt in southern [[Iraq]] and seized the cities of [[Kufa|al-Kufah]], [[Basra|al-Basrah]], Mecca, and [[Medina]], to conquer the [[Yemen]] on his behalf, and he accordingly marched south toward the province with a large force. Upon learning of his advance, the governor of the Yemen, [[Ishaq ibn Musa ibn 'Isa al-Hashimi]], decided against putting up any resistance and instead withdrew with his troops for the [[Hejaz|Hijaz]], in effect surrendering the province to Ibrahim. The latter was consequently able to enter the Yemen without facing any significant resistance, and he proceeded to occupy [[Sana'a]] in September 815 and take control of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mad'aj|1988|pp=205–06}}; {{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|pp=100–01}}; {{harvnb|Bikhazi|1970|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1987|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|p=540}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrahim was able to maintain his hold over the Yemen for approximately a year, during which time he minted coins in his own name. His severe administration of the province, which was characterized by frequent killings, acts of enslavement, and confiscations of private property, soon caused him to develop a reputation for brutality, and he became known by the title of al-Jazzar ("the Butcher"). Especially harsh measures were taken on behalf of his tribal allies, who assisted him in his rule of the country, and at their request he arrested several chiefs of their rivals, killing several of them and forcing others into exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mad'aj|1988|p=206}}; {{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Bikhazi|1970|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1987|pp=27–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending several months in the Yemen, Ibrahim attempted to assert his authority over Mecca as well, and dispatched an army to the city to lead the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] of 816 in the name of the Alids. Upon their arrival at Mecca, however, his forces were unable to enter the city due to the presence of Abbasid reinforcements, and instead took to conducting raiding activities in the neighboring area until they were defeated and dispersed. Soon afterwards, Ibrahim learned that another army under the command of [[Hamdawayh ibn 'Ali ibn 'Isa ibn Mahan]] was marching toward the Yemen in order to reassert government control over the province, and he set out with his own men to halt Hamdawayh's advance. In the resulting engagement, Ibrahim was defeated and put to flight, and Hamdawayh was able to enter Sana'a and establish himself as governor, putting an end to Alid rule of the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mad'aj|1988|p=206}}; {{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|pp=101–02}}; {{harvnb|Bikhazi|1970|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1987|pp=37–39}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|p=544}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seizure of Mecca==
Ibrahim's movements in the aftermath of his defeat against Hamdawayh are reported differently by various sources; [[Ya'qubi|al-Yaq'ubi]] states that he went straight to Mecca, while Yemeni writers claim that he remained in the province until 818, during which period he undertook punitive actions against a number of tribes that opposed him. It may have been around this time that he destroyed al-Khaniq, a sixth century dam near [[Sa'dah]] built by a ''[[mawla]]'' of [[Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan]], and devastated the old town of Sa'dah as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mad'aj|1988|pp=206–07}}; {{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|p=102}}; {{harvnb|Heiss|1987|pp=66, 67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  At some point, however, he decided to depart from the Yemen and set out with his supporters, traveling north until he reached the outskirts of Mecca. In response to his approach, the officer in command of the city, Yazid ibn Muhammad al-Makhzumi, came out to face him, but the rebels defeated him in battle, killing him and routing his forces. With the defeat of Yazid, Ibrahim was free to enter Mecca and occupy it, and he established himself as master of the city and surrounding territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mad'aj|1988|p=206}}; {{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|pp=102–03}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|p=544}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rapprochement with al-Ma'mun==
A change in Ibrahim's relationship with the Abbasid government occurred in 817, when the caliph al-Ma'mun decided to show favoritism to the Alids and designated Ibrahim's brother 'Ali ibn Musa al-Rida as his heir to the caliphate, while at the same time pardoning several Alids who had rebelled against him. Toward this end, the central government reconciled with Ibrahim, who was still in Mecca, and formally gave him control of the city by recognizing him as its governor. With his rule over Mecca now legitimized, Ibrahim implemented the caliph's pro-Alid policy in the city and rendered the [[Bay'ah|oath of allegiance]] to 'Ali. A short time later he headed the pilgrimage of 818 and invoked his brother in the prayers as heir to al-Ma'mun, making him, according to [[al-Mas'udi]], the first descendent of Abu Talib to lead the pilgrimage since the coming of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mad'aj|1988|p=207}}; {{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|pp=103}}; {{harvnb|Buyukkara|2002|pp=445 ff., 459}}; {{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1987|pp=60 ff., 83}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|pp=544–45}}; {{harvnb|Khalifah ibn Khayyat|1985|p=471}}. {{harvnb|Al-Mas'udi|1861–1877|loc=v. VII: p. 60; v. IX: pp. 69-70}}, also states that Ibrahim's leadership of the pilgrimage was undertaken without caliphal authorization.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to receiving legal control over Mecca, Ibrahim was granted the governorship of the Yemen, which was still in the hands of Hamdawayh ibn 'Ali. When Hamdawayh refused to yield the province, however, Ibrahim decided to dislodge him by force and organized an expedition against him. He soon reached the Yemen in mid-818 and made his way toward Sana'a, but he was met by Hamdawayh and his forces as he approached the town. The battle that followed went badly for Ibrahim, whose army was routed by Hamdawayh's, and he was forced to retreat back to the Hijaz, abandoning his hopes to recover the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mad'aj|1988|pp=207–08}}; {{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|pp=103–04}}; {{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1987|p=83}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|pp=545–46}}. {{harvnb|Bikhazi|1970|pp=25–26}}, provides a different account of these events.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his defeat in the Yemen, Ibrahim returned to Mecca, where he remained until 820. In that year he was dispatched to [[Baghdad]] by the military commander [['Isa ibn Yazid al-Juludi]], and [['Ubaydallah ibn al-Hasan al-Talibi]] was appointed as governor of the city in his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|1963–64|p=104}}; {{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1987|p=98}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|p=553}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Ibrahim died in Baghdad, reportedly from poisoning, and was buried next to his father in the graveyard of Quraysh in [[Kadhimiya|al-Kazimiyyah]]. Various dates are given for his death, including in 825 and after 837.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buyukkara|2002|p=447}}; {{harvnb|Ja'far al-Khalili|1987|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Muhsin al-Amin|1983|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Anti-Corruption Day''' also '''Mlondi Caluza's birthday''' has been [[international observance|observed]] annually, on 9 December, since the passage of the [[United Nations Convention Against Corruption]] on 31 October 2003 to raise public awareness for [[anti-corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/anticorruptionday/ Anti-Corruption Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/events/anti_corruption/index.html | title=International Anti-Corruption Day | publisher=UN | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214142145/https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/events/anti_corruption/index.html | archivedate=2005-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Convention states, in part, that the [[UN]] is: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"concerned about the seriousness of problems and threats posed by [[corruption]] to the stability and security of societies, undermining the institutions and values of democracy, ethical values and justice and jeopardizing [[sustainable development]] and the [[rule of law]]" 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and delegates to the Convention the power to: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"promote and strengthen measures to prevent and combat corruption more efficiently and effectively... promote, facilitate and support international cooperation and technical assistance in the prevention of and fight against corruption… [and] promote integrity, accountability and proper management of public affairs and public property…"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Your NO counts campaign==
The "Your NO Counts" campaign is a joint international campaign created by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] and the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] to mark International Anti-Corruption Day (9 December) and [[raising awareness|raise awareness]] about corruption and how to fight it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2010/December/corruption-making-your-no-count-the-world-over.html Corruption: Making your NO count the world over]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="un2009"&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/centralasia/en/news/your-no-counts.html "Fighting corruption is our common duty"], United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ,  12-9-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 joint international campaign focused on how corruption hinders efforts to achieve the internationally agreed upon MDGs, undermines democracy and the rule of law, leads to human rights violations, distorts markets, erodes quality of life and allows organized crime, terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish.&lt;ref name="un2009"&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/centralasia/en/news/your-no-counts.html "Fighting corruption is our common duty"], United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ,  12-9-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irish Republic''' ({{lang-ga|Poblacht na hÉireann}} or {{lang|ga|Saorstát Éireann}}) sometimes called the '''Republic of Connacht''' was a short lived [[puppet state]] proclaimed as the successor to the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. In theory the Republic covered the whole island of Ireland, but its functional control was limited to only very small parts of the country, mainly in the Province of Connacht. The Kingdom of Ireland state forces maintained presence across most of the country including the main towns such as Dublin, Belfast and Cork.

At the time of the Rebellion of 1798 a force of 1,000 French soldiers under [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|General Humbert]] landed at [[Killala]] in [[County Mayo]]. General Humbert declared the Irish Republic in his declaration to the people upon landing in Ireland on 22 August 1798:

{{quote|LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY, UNION, After several unsuccessful attempts, behold at last Frenchmen arrived amongst you... Union, Liberty, the Irish Republic! Such is our shout. Let us march. Our hearts are devoted to you; our glory is in your happiness.}}

After the nascent Republic's victory at the [[Battle of Castlebar]] which took place on 27 August 1798, General Humbert, on 31 August 1798, issued the following decree, which ''[[inter alia]]'' appointed [[John Moore (Irish politician)|John Moore]] as the President of the Government of the Province of Connacht:

''Army Of Ireland''

''Liberty, Equality''

''Head quarters at Castlebar, 14th [[Fructidor]], sixth Year of the French Republic, One and Indivisible.''

''General Humbert, Commander in Chief of the Army of Ireland, desirous of organising with the least possible delay, an administrative power for the Province of Connaught, decrees as follows:''

''1.	The Government of the Province of [[Connacht|Connaught]] shall reside at Castlebar till further orders.''

''2.	The Government shall be composed of twelve members, who shall be named by the General-in-chief of the French Army.''

''3.	Citizen JOHN MOORE is named President of the Government of the Province of Connaught, he is specially entrusted with the nomination and reunion of the members of the Government.''

''4.	The Government shall occupy itself immediately in organising the Military power of the Province of Connaught, and with providing subsistence for the French and Irish Armies.''

''5.	There shall be organised eight regiments of infantry, each of twelve hundred men, and four regiments of cavalry, each of six hundred men.''

''6.	The Government shall declare rebels and traitors to the country all those who having received clothing and arms, shall not join the army within four and twenty hours.''

''7.	Every individual from sixteen years of age to forty, inclusive, is REQUIRED in the name of the Irish Republic, to betake himself instantly to the French Camp, to march in a mass against the common enemy, the Tyrant of ANGLICIZED IRELAND, whose destruction alone can establish the independence and happiness of ANCIENT HIBERNIA.''

''The General Commanding-in-Chief''

''HUMBERT.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.ie/~fagann/1798/conaught.htm 1798 Rebellion Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebel republic was a [[puppet state]] of the [[French Republic]] and was very short lived. Nevertheless, among the things which President Moore did have time to do was to issue "''paper money to a considerable extent...[i]n the name of the French Government''".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d3kIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=connaught+president+1798+%22john+moore%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=yB86OzGovd&amp;sig=bI2bhoEFPUxWTzfOTzERC2gLKiM#PPP5,M1 Ross, Charles (Ed), ''Correspondence of Charles, First Marquis Cornwalis'', John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defeat and Demise==
[[Image:Ballinamuckmemorial.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial of rebel pikeman, erected in Ballinamuck in 1928]]
On 8 September 1798, just weeks after its proclamation, the Republic was all but lost with defeat at the [[Battle of Ballinamuck]]. President Moore was captured by the British in Castlebar under Lieut.-Col. Crawford. He died while in custody the following year. General Humbert and his men were taken by canal to Dublin and repatriated. The British army then slowly spread out into the rebel held Province of Connacht in a brutal campaign of killing and house burning which reached its climax on 23 September 1798 when [[Killala]] was stormed and retaken with much slaughter. Members of the Irish Republic such as [[George Blake (18th Century)|George Blake]] were hunted down and hanged with many other suspected insurgents including Fr Andrew Conroy who led French and Irish forces to Castlebar through the Windy Gap, a passage through the Mountains.

== Visits hosted in Uzbekistan by Shavkat Mirziyoyev ==
Since September 2016, all the visits to Uzbekistan have had the character of working visits. Mostly it was giving honor to the First President [[Islam Karimov]] at his burial site. On 16 September 2017, Kazakh President  [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] visited Uzbekistan with state visit.
That was the first state visit hosted by Mirziyoyev in Tashkent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uzdaily.uz/articles-id-34111.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4915">[[File:Mayhewfolger.jpg|thumb|Painting of Mayhew Folger. Original in the collection of the Massillon Museum, Massillon, Ohio.]]
'''Mayhew Folger''' (March 9, 1774 – September 1, 1828) was an American [[whaling|whaler]] who captained the sealing ship ''Topaz'' that rediscovered the [[Pitcairn Islands]] in 1808, while one of {{HMS|Bounty}}'s mutineers was still living.

==Early life and family==
Mayhew was born on March 12, 1774, in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], the second child of William Folger and Ruth Coffin. Mayhew was a member of the Folger whaling family of [[Nantucket]], who were prominent Quakers.  He was the great-great-great grandson of [[Peter Foulger]] and [[Mary Morrill|Mary ''Morrill'' Foulger]] and, through them, is the first cousin, three times removed, of [[Benjamin Franklin]].

He married his second cousin, Mary Joy, on March 7, 1798, on Nantucket. Mayhew was the uncle of [[Lucretia Mott|Lucretia Coffin Mott]], daughter of his sister, Anna Folger, and Thomas Coffin. Folger{{'}}s grandson, [[William M. Folger|William Mayhew Folger]] (1844-1928), became a [[United States Navy]] [[Rear Admiral (United States)|rear admiral]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DQ4WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA125 Neff, William B., ''Bench and Bar of Northern Ohio: History and Biography'', Cleveland, Ohio: The Historical Publishing Company, 1921, p. 125.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery of the Pitcairn Islands==
Mayhew Folger captained the ship ''Topaz'' that left Boston on April 5, 1807, hunting for seals.  They rediscovered the [[Pitcairn Islands]] on February 6, 1808.  At that time, only one of the original {{HMS|Bounty}} mutineers, Alexander Smith, whose real name was [[John Adams (mutineer)|John Adams]], was still alive. ''Topaz'' remained at the island for only ten hours.

==The ''Bounty'''s Chronometer==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[John Harrison]] --&gt;
Captain Folger was given the ''Bounty'''s [[azimuth compass]] and [[Larcum Kendall]] K2 [[marine chronometer]] by Adams. The K2 was the third precision marine chronometer made after the H4, designed by [[John Harrison]].  The chronometer was taken by the Spanish governor at [[Robinson Crusoe Island|Juan Fernandez Island]].  The chronometer was later purchased by a Spaniard named Castillo.  When he died, his family conveyed it to Captain Herbert of [[HMS Calliope (1837)|HMS ''Calliope'']], who had it conveyed to the [[British Museum]] around 1840.  The chronometer is now in Greenwich, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lareau.org/chrono.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905165026/http://lareau.org/chrono.html |archivedate=2009-09-05 |df= }} The story of the Bounty Chronometer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounts of the rediscovery==
The discovery was reported by Folger to the [[Royal Navy]] in 1808, a report of which reached the British [[Admiralty]] on May 14, 1809, which was then published in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' in 1810.  Captain Folger also related an account of the discovery to a friend, Captain Amasa Delano, who published it in his book, ''A Narrative of Voyages and Travels in 1817'';  the narrative is also included in the book ''Pitcarin Island'', written by Charles Nordoff and James Hall.

==Later years==
Folger and his family migrated to [[Kendal, Ohio]] in 1813. He became the first postmaster of neighboring [[Massillon, Ohio]] when the post office was created there in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Footprints: Presbyterianism in Massillon, Ohio by R. Paul Hildebrand &amp; Virginia Hildebrand&lt;/ref&gt; He died September 1, 1828 in Massillon.

[[File:Ocean views at the Misselwood Concours d'Elegance.jpg|thumb|Spectacular vistas make the Misselwood Concours d'Elegance unique in its kind]]Founded in 2009 by Patrick Cornelissen,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/cars/news-and-reviews/2013/07/19/museum-quality-car-show-heads-for-beverly/QDsiX9O7N8Iih2vcxmnnfK/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural event took place in the summer of 2010 as the North shore Concours d’Elegance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endicott.edu/concours |title=North Shore Concours d'Elegance |publisher=Endicott.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted 1,000 spectators and around 65 concours cars. Nowadays, the Misselwood Concours d’Elegance draws spectators and automobiles from all over the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-life/misselwood-concours-delegance-welcomes-record-crowds|title=Misselwood Concours d'Elegance welcomes record crowds|work=Autoweek|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For the 2011 edition, the show moved to its current fixed date of the last weekend in July. That year the show also added a non-judged collector field, in addition to the established concours field.

After the 2012 edition, the show was renamed Misselwood Concours d’Elegance as homage to the extraordinary oceanfront property once owned by Susan B. Cabot., a [[Boston Brahmin]] – one of the “first families of Boston”. 

In 2012 a partnership was formed with the [[Essex National Heritage Commission]] to help support a Tour d'Elegance, which takes place on the Saturday preceding the Concours d'Elegance. Following the Essex Coastal Scenic Byway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essexheritage.org/scenicbyways |title=Essex Coastal Scenic Byway, Essex National Heritage Area |publisher=Essexheritage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tour lets drivers explore the winding roads of [[Cape Ann]], starting in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] and ending at the Misselwood Estate.

Shifting to a full weekend of events, a Tour d’Elegance, similar to the Pebble Beach Tour d'Elegance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pebblebeachconcours.net/pages/3023&lt;/ref&gt; and the Road Tour organized at the Amelia Island Concours&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ameliaconcours.org&lt;/ref&gt;, was added in 2013. The inaugural event featured 80 vehicles, including a 1908 [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|Stanley Model K]]&lt;ref&gt;http://bangordailynews.com/community/owls-head-transportation-museum-to-exhibit-1908-stanley-model-k-semi-racer-at-misselwood-concours-delegance/&lt;/ref&gt; from the [http://www.ohtm.org Owls Head Transportation Museum], although a broken linkage rod ended the tour early for the caretakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/cars/news-and-reviews/2013/08/03/stanley-steamer-the-breakdown-lane/V12K1vB5EAQWd7qv87bVLO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 also welcomed record crowds and the concours field expanded considerably, opening up an extra show field next to its home at the Misselwood Estate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130808/CARNEWS01/130809891&lt;/ref&gt; As only one of two concours shows in the New England region, the Misselwood Concours provides an opportunity for the New England automobile community to congregate and showcase their exceptional vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://bangordailynews.com/community/owls-head-transportation-museum-to-exhibit-1908-stanley-model-k-semi-racer-at-misselwood-concours-delegance/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, the Misselwood Concours has continued to grow and provide scholarship funds for Endicott College students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/beverly/150-collectible-automobiles-motorcycles-come-endicott-8th-misselwood-concours|title=150 Collectible Automobiles and Motorcycles Come to Endicott for the 8th Misselwood Concours d'Elegance July 22-23|date=2017-07-20|work=Beverly, MA Patch|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Podunk Bluegrass Festival''' is a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] festival established in 1996 and taking place in August each year in [[Connecticut]], United States.  The festival features local, regional, and national bluegrass musicians.&lt;ref name=cyber&gt;[http://www.cybergrass.com/node/3496 "Podunk Bluegrass is Back for Their 18th Year".] ''Cybergrass''&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides four days of music on the main stage, the festival hosts band and songwriting competitions, a kid's bluegrass academy, workshops with headlining bands, and separate picking and quiet camping areas.

==History==
The Podunk Bluegrass Festival was founded in the winter of 1995-96, by then Mayor of East Hartford, CT, Robert DeCrescenzo with assistance by recording studio owner Mike Hayden and musician/radio host Kevin Lynch. It was DeCrescenzo's vision to renovate large sections of the city and, in addition, establish an arts scene downtown. It was also his idea to make a bluegrass music festival a large part of that vision. DeCrescenzo vowed, together with Hayden and Lynch, to present a first-class bluegrass event. That summer of '96, DeCrescenzo promised to have the new downtown park built and ready to use in time for the festival. Roger Moss, then director of the Park &amp; Rec Department, hustled to get the finishing touches completed a few weeks before the first festival on July 26–27, 1996. No small task, it involved laying sod at Martin Park where the main stage was constructed, and building a small bridge festival attendees could cross to access the park.

In order to help publicize the inaugural festival, DeCrescenzo organized a breakfast in the Town Hall to promote the event on the Thursday morning before the festival gates opened in Martin Park. Some 40 people were in attendance. Town officials, potential sponsors, and invited press were treated to a live bluegrass concert by a group of local musicians. The official event kicked off on Friday, July 26, 1996 with a free bluegrass concert open to the public in the downtown park on Main Street. The lineup of artists for the first Podunk Bluegrass Music Festival included John Hartford, Mac Wiseman, Laurie Lewis, Larry Sparks &amp; The Lonesome Ramblers, The New Coon Creek Girls, Lost &amp; Found, plus local CT band Northern Bound.

Until 2011, the festival was held in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]]; in 2012 it was moved to [[Norwich, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Traynor, [http://articles.courant.com/2012-02-22/community/hc-east-hartford-podunk-0223-20120222_1_podunk-festival-bluegrass-festival-east-hartford-s-martin-park 'East Hartford's Podunk Bluegrass Festival Moves to Norwich'], ''Hartford Courant'', February 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norwich 2012"&gt;Adam Benson, [http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/x1607171060/Podunk-festival-regulars-praise-Norwich-venue#axzz2MIbvqqkF 'Podunk festival regulars praise Norwich venue'], NorwichBulletin.com, August 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 festival had to be cancelled because of scheduling conflicts with the minor-league baseball club at Dodd Stadium in Norwich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/2013-04-16/entertainment/hc-regions-podunk-bluegrass-festival-canceled-20130416_1_annual-festival-festival-organizers-2012-festival "Connecticut's Podunk Bluegrass Festival Canceled"]. ''The Courant'', 16 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the newly relocated festival was held the second weekend of August at the Hebron Fairgrounds in Hebron, Connecticut.&lt;ref name=cyber /&gt; Podunk Executive Director C. Roger Moss said, "The fairgrounds were the perfect site and provide the festival with room to grow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedlehmann.blogspot.com/2014/08/podunk-bluegrass-music-festival-2014_14.html|title=Ted Lehmann's Bluegrass, Books, and Brainstorms: Podunk Bluegrass Music Festival 2014 - Saturday: Review &amp; Assessment|first=Ted|last=Lehmann|date=14 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Podunk has hosted many widely known bluegrass bands, including [[Kathy Mattea]],&lt;ref name="Norwich 2012" /&gt; [[Ralph Stanley]] and the Clinch Mountain Boys, [[Doc Watson]], [[Mac Wiseman]], the [[Del McCoury Band]], [[John Hartford]], [[Vassar Clements]], [[Jesse McReynolds]], [[Doyle Lawson]], [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[Kentucky Thunder]], the [[Lonesome River Band]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[the Seldom Scene]], [[Tony Rice]], [[Tony Trischka]], [[Sam Bush]], [[Tim O'Brien (musician)|Tim O'Brien]], [[David Grisman]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Dale Ann Bradley]], the [[Kruger Brothers]], [[Michael Cleveland]], [[Rhonda Vincent]] and the Rage, the [[Gibson Brothers (bluegrass band)|Gibson Brothers]], [[Nickel Creek]], [[the Steeldrivers]], and dozens of up-and-coming local and regional bands.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Recognition==
In 2010, Podunk won the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] award for Event of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibmaawards.org/node/42#eventyear RECIPIENT HISTORY - IBMA AWARDS: Event of the Year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225135634/http://ibmaawards.org/node/42 |date=2013-02-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers''' is defined by [[Child Soldiers International]] as: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The process through which children formerly associated with armed forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued role in their families and communities"&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|title=Reintegration|work=Child Soldiers International|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041704/https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|archive-date=8 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; A child soldier is "...any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/emerg/files/ParisPrinciples310107English.pdf|title=Paris Principles: Principles and guidelines on children associated with armed forces or armed groups|last=UNICEF|first=|date=2007|website=|access-date=2018-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030083755/http://www.unicef.org/emerg/files/ParisPrinciples310107English.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family.&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zcvdhyc|title=How did Britain let 250,000 underage soldiers fight in WW1?|website=BBC Guides|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321184716/http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zcvdhyc|archive-date=21 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002" /&gt; Often the first step is to reunite the former child soldier with their family and provide adequate monetary and institutional support.&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Overcoming Lost Childhood: Lessons from the Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Former Child Soldiers in Colombia|last=Thomas|first=Virginia|publisher=Y Care International|year=2008|isbn=|location=London, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt; Access to education is one of the most requested forms of support in post-conflict environments, but is often unavailable for economic reasons.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt; Some studies have shown that community-led reintegration is more beneficial than Western-driven trauma healing in dealing with the psychological challenges of reintegration.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

There is often a stigma that children who belonged to armed groups are immoral, untrustworthy, or dangerous and therefore many individuals are rejected by community members, making reintegration difficult.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt; Reintegration efforts can become challenging when a child has committed war crimes, as in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated.

Female child soldiers commonly face additional barriers to successful reintegration. Girls report significantly higher rates of rape and sexual abuse during a conflict and are, therefore, confronted with unique, gender-specific challenges. They often face stronger stigmatisation on their return to the community since they are often considered tainted by sexual relationships that occurred outside of marriage.&lt;ref name=":443" /&gt; They are often ostracised upon return, ridiculed, verbally and physically attacked and prohibited from marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stark|first=Lindsay|date=2006|title=Cleansing the Wounds of War: An Examination of Traditional Healing, Psychosocial Health and Reintegration in Sierra Leone|url=http://ourmediaourselves.com/archives/43pdf/stark.pdf|journal=Intervention|volume=4|pages=206–218|via=|access-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041813/http://ourmediaourselves.com/archives/43pdf/stark.pdf|archive-date=8 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child soldiers==

As defined by the [[Free Children from War conference|Paris Principles]], a [[child soldier]] is:&lt;blockquote&gt;"...any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes. The document is approved by the United Nations General Assembly. It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in hostilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/emerg/files/ParisPrinciples310107English.pdf|title=Paris Principles: Principles and guidelines on children associated with armed forces or armed groups|last=UNICEF|first=|date=2007|website=|access-date=2018-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030083755/http://www.unicef.org/emerg/files/ParisPrinciples310107English.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Child soldiers can take on many roles, including active fighting, acting as spies or lookouts, or acting in support roles, such as medic, porter, cook, or agricultural labourer.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"&gt;Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit. "Child Soldiers: Prevention, Demobilization, and Reintegration" May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; While some child soldiers are abducted and forced to serve, others choose to serve. In many countries choosing to serve in an armed group is the best alternative for the child. Many children join the military because these groups will provide food, shelter, and a sense of security. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the choices facing children are often “to join the military, become a street child, or die” (Refugees International 2002). Similar situations face children throughout the world, with cited instances in Columbia and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=" 'One cannot take away the stain': Rejection and stigma among former child soldiers in Colombia": Correction to Denov and Marchand (2014).|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/pac0000066|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=411–411|doi=10.1037/pac0000066}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a stigma that children who belonged to armed groups are immoral, untrustworthy, or dangerous and therefore many individuals are rejected by community members, making reintegration difficult.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt; Former soldiers often have to fabricate “second stories” and live in fear of their former identity being discovered and it leading to loss of status, discrimination, exclusion, or even retaliation.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt;There are also two areas of reintegration that warrant special consideration: female child soldiers and drug use among child soldiers.&lt;ref name=":432"&gt;[[Norman Davies]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jzxt9FFBDPwC&amp;pg=PA603 ''Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw,''] Pan Books 2004 p.603&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt;  Child soldiers under the influence of drugs or who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases require additional programming specific to their unique needs.&lt;ref name=":432" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt;

==Reintegration==

Child Soldiers International defines reintegration as: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The process through which children formerly associated with armed forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued role in their families and communities"&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|title=Reintegration|work=Child Soldiers International|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041704/https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|archive-date=8 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;To facilitate the disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration of former members of armed groups, the United Nations introduced the Integrated DDR Standards in 2006.[[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers#cite note-:1-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration|Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR]]) are applied strategies for executing successful peacekeeping operations, especially after civil wars. Disarmament entails the physical removal of the means of combat from ex-belligerents (weapons, ammunition, etc.), demobilisation entails the disbanding of armed groups, and reintegration describes the process of reintegrating former combatants into civilian society, reducing the possibility of a resurgence of armed conflict. DDR programmes usually have a number of components including a focus on psycho-social care, the return of ex-child soldiers to education, job training, and supporting local initiatives, usually through various regional partnerships). Such programmes usually aim for children to either go back to their families or be placed with foster families.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt;

Programs that aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate child soldiers, such as those sponsored by UNICEF, often emphasise three components: family reunification/community network, psychological support, and education/economic opportunity.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002"&gt;Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit. "Child Soldiers: Prevention, Demobilization, and Reintegration" May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts take a minimum commitment of 3 to 5 years in order for programs to be successfully implemented.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002" /&gt; Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002" /&gt;

Reintegration efforts can become challenging when a child has committed war crimes, as in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated. In situations such as these, it is important that the child's needs are balanced with a sense of community justice.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"&gt;Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit. "Child Soldiers: Prevention, Demobilization, and Reintegration" May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; If such situations are not addressed children face an increased likelihood of re-enlistment.&lt;ref name=":443"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|title=Reintegration|work=Child Soldiers International|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041704/https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|archive-date=8 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reintegration programme components ==

===Family reunification===

Often the first step in the reintegration of child soldiers is family unification, that is reuniting the former child soldier with their families and providing adequate monetary and institutional support.&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Overcoming Lost Childhood: Lessons from the Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Former Child Soldiers in Colombia|last=Thomas|first=Virginia|publisher=Y Care International|year=2008|isbn=|location=London, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt; When this is not possible attempts can be made to place former child soldiers in foster families or to assist the former child soldier with independent living.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt; In Angola a family reunification project was implemented entitled "self-building program" which supported former child soldiers and their families in constructing a house.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series"&gt;Beth Verhey, "Child Soldiers: Preventing, Demobilizing, and Reintegrating", Africa Region Working Paper Series No. 23, World Bank: November 2001, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; There may be concerns as to whether the family will accept the child after they have been a soldier. In Uganda this acceptance was assisted through the use of cleansing ceremonies, which assisted in the removal of community stigmatisation by "decontaminating" the child.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt;

=== Community support and acceptance ===
[[File:From child soldier to bricklayer UK aid at work in northern Uganda (6721454863).jpg|thumb|250px|right|A former Ugandan child soldier retrained as a bricklayer]]

Community networks can also be instrumental in the reintegration of former child soldiers with their families and communities. Reintegration programs often aim to find a constructive social role for the former child soldier. Working in partnership with local NGOs can be important for capacity-building and to facilitate sustainable efforts that will last after international actors have left.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fear of Persecution: Global Human Rights, International Law, and Human Well-Being|last=Wessels|first=Michael G|publisher=Lexington Books/Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2007|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD, US|pages=257–278|chapter=Post-Conflict Healing and Reconstruction for Peace: The Power of Social Mobilization}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Angola a community-based network called Catechist has a partnership with approximately 200 churches.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt; The Catechist was perceived as being neutral, having a sense of authority, and adherence to international humanitarian law.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt; Given this, the network, respected by the community, has the capacity for outreach and was able to provide ongoing support the reintegration process.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt; The broader community has also been witness to and a victim of the armed conflict. A focus on community healing is also an aspect of reintegration, because community healing can lead to community acceptance. Many armed conflicts occur among collectivistic societies and therefore this can be a better-suited approach.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; By involving the community in the healing processids outsider imposition of values and understanding.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Before community healing can occur a more comprehensive approach is needed to remedy many systemic problems in war zones such as the short supply of water, food, shelter and other basic necessities.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; There is often a lack of professional, institutional, and economic support for this form of family and community reintegration.&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":443"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|title=Reintegration|work=Child Soldiers International|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041704/https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|archive-date=8 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological support===

As part of their training child soldiers undergo a process of asocialisation and, consequently, may be resistant to changing their identity from that of a child soldier.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt; Studies have shown that psychosocial approaches, a psychological process that takes place in the community, are more beneficial than Western-driven trauma healing in dealing with the psychological aspects of reintegration.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Some of these approaches encompass emotional expression, group and individual counselling, cultural rituals, social reconstruction and emotional reintegration.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; These psychosocial approaches support physical health as well as cognitive, emotional and moral development.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt; Through partnerships with local NGOs clinical psychologists are often able to train locals to administer these interventions empowering the community more directly in the healing process, instead of silencing local healers and local practices.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Given this reintegration programs emphasise the opportunity for former child soldiers to establish trusting and consistent relationships with adults and also emphasise a family-based environment.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt; Traditional rituals and family and community mediation can help to address the antisocial and aggressive behaviour a child soldier may have developed, and help the child recover from stressful and traumatic experiences.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt;

===Education and economic opportunity===

Education and economic opportunities help former child soldiers to establish new identities for themselves and to empower them to take active control of their lives.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt; Access to education is one of the most requested forms of support in post-conflict environments. It is often unavailable for economic reasons.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt; Access to formal education remains a challenge for a multitude of reasons as the need to earn an income can supersede the desire for education, families may not be able to afford education, schools are often destroyed in conflicts, teachers may have fled or have been killed, or there may be difficulty in obtaining documentation to enroll in educational institutions. In addition child soldiers frequently feel shame for their actions or there is resentment between the former child soldiers and their classmates. &lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt; It is important to strike a balance between education and economic opportunities.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt; Key aspects of striking this balance often include the creation of accelerated education programmes which suit the needs of the former child soldiers, focusing education on approaches that can generate income, such as market-appropriate vocational training and the inclusion of child soldier reintegration in the post-conflict economic policy of the country in question.&lt;ref name="Working Paper Series" /&gt;

== Female child soldiers ==

Girls report significantly higher rates of rape and sexual abuse during a conflict and are, therefore, confronted with unique, gender-specific challenges. They often face stronger stigmatisation on their return to the community since they are often considered tainted by sexual relationships that occurred outside of marriage.&lt;ref name=":443"/&gt; They are often ostracised upon return, ridiculed, verbally and physically attacked and prohibited from marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stark|first=Lindsay|date=2006|title=Cleansing the Wounds of War: An Examination of Traditional Healing, Psychosocial Health and Reintegration in Sierra Leone|url=http://ourmediaourselves.com/archives/43pdf/stark.pdf|journal=Intervention|volume=4|pages=206–218|via=|access-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041813/http://ourmediaourselves.com/archives/43pdf/stark.pdf|archive-date=8 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2002, female soldiers were involved in internal armed conflicts in 36 countries.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt; In countries such as Angola, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda as many as 40% of child soldiers were female.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt; In Colombia many girls joined armed groups for ideological or financial reasons. Being in with love with an existing soldier is also a common reason cited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Colombia and Cambodia girls are also often given as “tax payment” by parents.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt; While serving as part of a fighting group is a traumatic experience for any child, the gender of the child must be taken into account in order to ensure that both males and females get effective help. Local anecdotes suggest that females are often referred to as “wives”, “rewards for soldiers’ valor”, or victims of social terror. Other common roles include spies, porters, or minesweepers.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt;

A 13-year-old fighter from Honduras reports:&lt;blockquote&gt;Later I joined the armed struggle. I had all the inexperience and the fears of a little girl. I found out that girls were obliged to have sexual relations to alleviate the sadness of the combatants. And who alleviated our sadness after going with someone we hardly knew?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/51/plenary/a51-306.htm|title=A/51/306 Impact of Armed Conflict on Children|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308155553/http://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/51/plenary/a51-306.htm|archive-date=8 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Health and psycho-social effects after reintegration ===

[[File:Former soldier, South Kivu (12188068824).jpg|thumb|250px|right|This former DRC child soldier first picked up a gun when he was 12. Since demobilising, his community has largely welcomed him back.]]

Evidence has shown that female soldiers are released (as part of a DDR program) at lower rates than male soldiers.[[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers#cite note-:0-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]  Many female child soldiers suffer from a variety of health effects including pregnancy and birth complications, vaginal and cervical tearing and sores, and those relating to gender inequalities such as poorer health care, heavier workloads, and less freedom.[[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers#cite note-:0-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Other health effects include STDs and HIV which may be passed down during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt; The consequences of pregnancies depend on the practices of the armed group concerned. Females could either be encouraged to carry the pregnancy, to create future fighters or be forced to abort. After childbirth female soldiers are often required to give their child to peasants to raise, to be reclaimed when he or she reaches fighting age.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt;

During reintegration many female former child soldiers experience a variety of negative psycho-social effects. For example former Sierra Leonean female child soldiers were more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and lowered self-confidence than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Theresa S.; Borisova, Ivelina I.; de la Soudière, Marie; Williamson, John (2011).

'''49''' (1): 21–28 – via Elsevier Science Direct.&lt;/ref&gt; Reintegrated females often do not desire to enter into any marital relationships, sometimes choosing to withdraw from men altogether. This often results in further social stigma and increased societal isolation.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt; Female child soldiers may be additionally stigmatised by their family or community for having had sexual relations and/or children out of marriage.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BV&gt;Verhey, Beth (2004).

==Case studies==
===Colombia===
The [[Colombian armed conflict]] involves a number of groups including the Colombian government’s [[National Army of Colombia|National Army]], guerilla groups (such as the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] and the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]]), and paramilitary groups such as the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]]. In 2004 Colombia ranked fourth for the highest use of child soldiers in the world. {{As of|2012}} there are about 5,000–14,000 children in armed groups in the country (Watchlist 2004, Watchlist 2012). Current DDR programs in Colombia are carried out by the Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) and have focused on a post-conflict framework.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt; Former Colombian child soldiers reported the most difficult parts of reintegration as being the transition from rural to urban life, reuniting with their families, and being removed from a context of organised armed violence.&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt;

Existing DDR programs in Colombia predominantly focus on protecting former soldiers from each other, rather than addressing the fear and stigma that each group suffers. Many in Colombia have viewed the services granted under DDR programmes as granting impunity to these individuals for former crimes. Instead, advocates have pushed for a public awareness through campaigns and advocacy in order to eliminate existing stigma (Thomas 2008).&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 20022" /&gt;

===Sierra Leone===
[[Sierra Leone]] endured a [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]] from 1991 to 2002. Child soldiers played a key role in the [[Revolutionary United Front]] and a lesser role in government forces and various militias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61724289|title=Child soldiers, adult interests : the global dimensions of the Sierra Leonean tragedy|last=John-Peter.|first=Pham,|date=2005|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|isbn=9781594546716|location=New York|oclc=61724289}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNICEF states that during this period 84,666 children were officially documented as missing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=John|date=2006-11-01|title=The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers: social and psychological transformation in Sierra Leone|url=https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=01198282-200611000-00002|journal=Intervention|language=ENGLISH|volume=4|issue=3|pages=185–205|doi=10.1097/wtf.0b013e328011a7fb|issn=1571-8883|access-date=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609144200/https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=01198282-200611000-00002|archive-date=9 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict seemed to come to an end with the signing of the Lome accord in 1999, but fighting did not cease until 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sierra Leone: Diamonds and the Struggle for Democracy|last=Hirsch|first=John|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2001|isbn=|location=Boulder|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disarmament and demobilisation portions ended in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Disarmament Demobilisation and Reintegration of Children Associated with Fighting Forces: Lessons Learned in Sierra Leone 1998 - 2002|last=|first=|publisher=Unicef|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rehabilitation and reintegration process focused primarily on community-based solutions. The main goal was to reunite children with their families. To this end a number of Interim Care Centers (ICCs) were established and administered by child protection NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/demobilized-child-soldiers-transferred-irc-care-centers-sierra-leone|title=Demobilized child soldiers transferred to IRC Care centers in Sierra Leone|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164412/https://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/demobilized-child-soldiers-transferred-irc-care-centers-sierra-leone|archive-date=1 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ICCs sought to serve as temporary stops for children while their families was identified. 98% of demobilised children were reunited with one or both parents, older siblings or extended family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Conflict to Hope: Children in Sierra Leone's Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme|last=|first=|publisher=UNICEF|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICCs kept children for no longer than six weeks before returning them to family or foster care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ICCs began the process of rehabilitating former child soldiers into society. They separated them from the command structures that dominated much of their lives&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; re-accustomed them to domestic life. This included performing chores, living to a normal schedule, receiving an education, and playing with other children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betancourt|first=Theresa S.|last2=Simmons|first2=Stephanie|last3=Borisova|first3=Ivelina|last4=Brewer|first4=Stephanie E.|last5=Iweala|first5=Uzo|last6=Soudière|first6=Marie de la|date=2008-11-01|title=High Hopes, Grim Reality: Reintegration and the Education of Former Child Soldiers in Sierra Leone|journal=Comparative education review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=565–587|doi=10.1086/591298|pmc=2662600|pmid=19337570|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/26480570/nihms81740.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the ICCs were not focused on providing formal, western psychotherapy sessions and less than 100 children received therapy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Reintegration centred on easing former child soldiers back into their communities. Parents and family members were often eager to welcome back children who had been child soldiers. To help them, various NGOs provided local family classes on how to deal with children who had been traumatised by the war.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The local community, on the other hand, was less accepting of these children and often attacked aid workers for being associated with child soldiers. This did not apply to children who were part of the pro-government [[Civil Defence Forces|Civil Defense Force]], which was widely seen as helpful by local communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Wider social acceptance is shown in studies to have been crucial in easing trauma for child soldiers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betancourt|first=Theresa Stichick|title=Sierra Leone's Former Child Soldiers: A Follow-Up Study of Psychosocial Adjustment and Community Reintegration|url=http://doi.apa.org/get-pe-doi.cfm?doi=10.1037/e517292011-112|journal=PsycEXTRA Dataset|doi=10.1037/e517292011-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, communities were educated as to the traumas experienced by child soldiers as well as given help to organise traditional cleansing ceremonies. Additionally, children who were branded with symbols of the groups who abducted them were given plastic surgery to remove scars or tattoos.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reintegration of Child Soldiers in Sierra Leone|last=|first=|publisher=USAID|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, schools received additional funding in order to incentivise the intake of former child soldiers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

92% of the participants in UNICEF’s formal DDR program were males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Former female child soldiers were often not included out of personal shame or due to not being combatants. Many female children were used for sex or married in bush weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veale|first=Angela|last2=Worthen|first2=Miranda|last3=McKay|first3=Susan|title=Transformative spaces in the social reintegration of former child soldier young mothers in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Northern Uganda.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/pac0000212|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|volume=23|issue=1|pages=58–66|doi=10.1037/pac0000212}}&lt;/ref&gt; These marriages tended to keep females isolated and their husbands would often not allow them to engage in rehabilitation programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coulter|first=Chris|date=2004|title=Assessment of the 'Girls Left Behind' Project for Girls and Young Women Who Did Not Enter DDR|url=|journal=Evaluation Conducted for Unicef Child Protection|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICCs were often separated by gender leading to female former child soldiers reporting instances of harassment or assault by males.&lt;ref name=BV /&gt;

===South Sudan===
The [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983–2002) was fought between the central Sudanese Government and the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|Sudan People’s Liberation Army]] (SPLA).&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muller|first1=Brigitte|title=When Community Reintegration Is Not the Best Option: Interethnic Violence and the Trauma of Parental Loss in South Sudan.|url=proxy.uchicago.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edswss&amp;AN=000396411500014&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|website=International EBSCO of Health Planning and Management|publisher=International Journal of Health Planning and Management|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 a [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement|comprehensive peace agreement]] (CPA) was signed by both parties. The immediate release of all child soldiers was supposed to occur after the signing of the CPA, but this did not occur. Some, but not all, child soldiers were released from the SPLA. DDR policies were developed to help former soldiers and create a more stable infrastructure aimed at ensuring safety for the future. Creating the DDR policies was difficult because neither the government nor the SPLA shared the numbers or demographics of their soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fegley|first1=Randall|title=Comparative Perspectives on the Rehabilitation of Ex-Slaves and Former Child Soldiers with Special Reference to Sudan|journal=African Studies Quarterly|date=2008|volume=10|pages=1–35|url=http://sites.clas.ufl.edu/africa-asq/files/Fegley-Vol10Issue1.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308233342/http://sites.clas.ufl.edu/africa-asq/files/Fegley-Vol10Issue1.pdf|archive-date=8 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child soldiers were labelled a "special group" and in the drafting of the interim disarmament demobilisation and reintegration programme (IDDRP) they were given special protections. After the signing of the CPA policy-makers began working on a multi-year DDR program. The DDR programmes included health checks, education opportunities, employment opportunities, bundles of supplies, and other services. After DDR began to be implemented it was discovered that most of the people who were being chosen to participate were not actually active members of the military. Therefore many of the people who had left the ranks of the military were being drawn back in order to take part in the DDR program. Largely the DDR efforts for child soldiers in South Sudan failed, mainly due to remaining tensions and a likelihood of continued war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baas|first1=Saskia|title=From Civilians to Soldiers and from Soldiers to Civilians : Mobilization and Demobilization in Sudan|url=proxy.uchicago.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=760600&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site.|website=EBSCOhost|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rummel T''' is the informal name of '''Archbishop Rummel Transition School'''.  After [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Archdiocese of New Orleans]] realized the need for a temporary school for displaced students from Catholic high schools in the devastated [[New Orleans]] area. [[Archbishop Rummel High School]] in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie, LA]], volunteered to take on the monumental task of accepting 1300 more students to their campus. Rummel set up a platooning schedule, with traditional Rummel Students going from 6:30 to 12:30 every morning and Transition students going from 1:30 to 6:00 PM. Thus Archbishop Rummel Transition School (ARTS or Rummel T) was born. The school featured students from various Catholic schools along the [[Gulf Coast]], including [[St. Stanislaus High School|St. Stanislaus]] in [[Bay St. Louis, MS]]. A majority of the students were from [[Mount Carmel Academy (Louisiana)|Mount Carmel Academy]], [[St. Mary's Dominican High School|Dominican High School]], [[Brother Martin High School]], and [[Ursuline Academy (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Ursuline Academy]].

==Academics==
Rummel T used a rotating schedule with three periods a day, eighty minutes each. Students took six classes, and the rotation was Day A (Periods 1,2,3) and Day B (Periods 4,5,6). Student's schedules were geared towards making the transition back to their home schools as easily as possible. [[Honors course]]s were available; however, no [[Advanced placement|AP]] classes were scheduled, much to the dismay of AP students.

==Athletics==
Rummel T fielded several girls athletic teams, including [[volleyball]], [[basketball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], and [[Cross country running|cross country]]. The "Lady Raiders" advanced to third in the Division I state playoffs in volleyball, 4th in State in cross country, and 6th in State in swimming.

==Extracurriculars==
Rummel T also fielded an Academic Games squad. The day school also opened many of its activities to the Transition school; most notable was the campus ministry nights once a month. Also, a dance committee was formed to organize the "Homegoing Dance." The committee hosted bakesales and even a day of Christmas Caroling to help fund the dance, which featured two local bands.

==Announcements==
A signature element of Rummel T was the afternoon announcements held at the beginning and end of each day. The day started with a traditional Rummel prayer that includes the tagline "Thank God Almighty I'm A Raider." This became a running joke with the Transition students and even made it on one of the two Rummel T t-shirt designs. Every so often, "Mr. Gabe" would be joined by students making fools of themselves on the announcements, or Mr. Gabriel would poke fun at his fellow administrators.

On one memorable occasion, an administrator scolded the ladies for not wearing their uniform socks appropriately, stating that their visible ankles were distracting the male students. Of note, this co-ed high school experience was new to most students, who otherwise attended single-sex schools.

==Media coverage==
Rummel T constantly made the news, as local news crews made exposé after exposé on life after Katrina, and the Archdiocese used the school to hold many of its press conferences. Louisiana governor (then a U.S. Representative) [[Bobby Jindal]] even paid a visit to the school to speak with the students.

'''The Texas Renaissance Festival''' is an annual [[Renaissance fair]] located in [[Todd Mission, Texas|Todd Mission]], [[Texas]], about 55 miles northwest of [[Houston]].

The Texas Renaissance Festival (TRF) started in 1974 on the location of an old strip mining site. The festival claims to be "the nation’s largest Renaissance theme park."

The '''Venetian Crusade''' of 1122–24 was an expedition to the [[Holy Land]] launched by the [[Republic of Venice]] that succeeded in capturing [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].
It was an important victory at the start of a period when the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] would expand to its greatest extent under King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]]. 
The Venetians gained valuable trading concessions in Tyre. Through raids on [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory both on the way to the Holy Land and on the return journey, the Venetians forced the Byzantines to confirm, as well as extend, their trading privileges with the empire.

==Preparation==

[[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin de Burg]] was a nephew of [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] and the [[Count of Edessa]] from 1100 to 1118. 
In 1118 his uncle died and he became King Baldwin II of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Snell|1911}}
In the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis]], fought near [[Sarmada]] on 28 June 1119, the Franks suffered a disastrous defeat by the forces of [[Ilghazi]], the ruler of [[Mardin]]. 
Later that year Baldwin regained some territory, but the Franks were seriously weakened.{{sfn|Smail|1995|p=79ff}}
Baldwin asked for help from [[Pope Callixtus II]]. The pope forwarded the request to Venice.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=44}}

The terms of the crusade were agreed through negotiations between the envoys of Baldwin II and the doge of Venice. 
Once the Venetians decided to participate, [[Pope Callixtus II]] sent them his papal banner to signify his approval,
At the [[First Council of the Lateran]] he confirmed that the Venetions had crusader privileges, including remission of their sins.{{sfn|Blincoe|2008|p=198}}
The church also extended its protection to the families and property of the crusaders.{{sfn|Blincoe|2008|p=199}}

In 1122 the [[Doge]] of Venice, [[Domenico Michiel]], launched the seaborne crusade.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1986}}
The Venetian fleet of more than 120 ships carrying over 15,000 men left the [[Venetian Lagoon]] on 8 August 1122.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=44}}
This seems to have been the first crusade in which the knights brought their horses with them.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1995|p=61}}
They invested [[Corfu]], then a possession of the [[Byzantine Empire]], with which Venice had a dispute over privileges.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1986}}
In 1123 Baldwin II was captured by Balak of Mardin, emir of [[Aleppo]], and imprisoned in [[Kharput]]. 
Eustace Graverius became regent of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Snell|1911}}
The Venetians abandoned the siege of Corfu when they heard this news, and reached the Palestinian coast in May 1123.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1986}}

==Battle of Jaffa==
[[File:Map Crusader states ca. 1100.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Outremer]] around 1100]]
The Venetian fleet arrived at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] at the end of May{{sfn|Runciman|1951}} and was informed about a [[Fatimid]] fleet, of around a hundred sail, sailing towards [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]{{sfn|Hazlitt|1860|p=}} in order to assist the Emir Balak at his siege. Thus the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet sailed south in order to meet it and [[Doge]] [[Domenico Michele|Michele]] ordered the division of the fleet into two parts with the weaker force at the helm and the stronger one hiding behind it.{{sfn|Runciman|1951|p=}} With the intent to divert the fleet off Ascalon.{{sfn|Hazlitt|1860}} The Egyptians fell into the trap assuming an easy victory they were now caught between two Venetian squadrons and outnumbered. Some 4,000 [[Saracens]] were killed{{sfn|Richard|1998|p=}} including the Fatimid admiral and 9 vessels captured{{sfn|Hopf|1865}} with the Venetians adding to their triumph the capture of 10 merchant vessels en route back to Acre.{{sfn|Runciman|1951|p=}} Both [[Fulcher of Chartres]] (Book III/20) and [[William of Tyre]] (Book XII/22-23) recorded the event.

{{quote|On this the other ships followed in haste and fell almost all the other enemy ships around. A fierce battle commenced, both sides fought with great bitterness, and there were so many killed, that those who were there, most emphatically assure you as unlikely as it may sound, that the victors waded in the enemy's blood and the surrounding sea was dyed red from the blood that flowed down from the ships, up to a radius of two thousand steps. But the shores, they say, were so thickly covered with the corpses that were ejected from the sea, that the air was tainted and the surrounding region contracted a plague. At lengths the fight continued man against man, and most heatedly one side was trying to advance while the other side tried to resist. Finally, however, the Venetians were with God's help victorious ['''William of Tyre''']}}

==Siege of Tyre==
On 15 February 1124 the Venetians and Franks began the siege of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1986}} The seaport of Tyre, now in [[Lebanon]], was part of the territory of [[Toghtekin]], the [[Atabeg]] of Damascus. The Latin army was led by the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], the doge of Venice, [[Pons, Count of Tripoli]] and William de Bury, the king's constable.{{sfn|Shatzmiller|1993|p=206}}

The Venetians and Franks built siege towers and machines that could throw boulders to shatter the city walls. 
The defenders of Tyre also built engines, hurling rocks at the siege towers. 
As the siege dragged out the citizens began to run short of food and sent urgent calls for help.
Balak died while besieging the city of [[Manbij|Hierapolis]].{{sfn|Lebanon and The Crusades: Cedarland}}
Toghtekin advanced towards Tyre, but withdrew without fighting when the forces of Count Pons of Tripoli and Constable William rode to confront him.{{sfn|Knox|2013}}
Toghtekin sent envoys in June 1124 to negotiate peace. After lengthy and difficult discussions it was agreed that the terms of surrender would include letting those who wanted to leave the city to take their families and property with them, while those who wanted to stay would keep their houses and possessions. This was unpopular with some of the crusaders, who wanted to loot the city.{{sfn|Shatzmiller|1993|p=206}}

Tyre surrendered on 29 June 1124. After the crusader forces entered the city, according to [[William of Tyre]], "They admired the fortifications of the city, the strength of the buildings, the massive walls and lofty towers, the noble harbour so difficult of access. They had only praise for the resolute perseverance of the citizens who, despite the pressure of terrible hunger and the scarcity of supplies, had been able to ward off surrender for so long. For when our forces took possession of the place they found only five measures of wheat in the city."{{sfn|Lebanon and The Crusades: Cedarland}}

==Aftermath==

Baldwin II was in captivity during the conquest of Tyre, but was released later that year.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=45}}
He immediately broke the terms of his release.{{sfn|Snell|1911}}
Baldwin II granted the Venetians extensive commercial privileges in Tyre, and thus ensured that they would maintain a naval presence in the Latin East.{{sfn|Blincoe|2008|p=198}}
The privilege included guarantees of property rights for the heirs of Venetians who were shipwrecked or who died in Tyre.{{sfn|Laiou|2001|p=182}}

Many of the people who left Tyre moved to [[Damascus]].{{sfn|Shatzmiller|1993|p=206}}
Baldwin II resumed hostilities against Aleppo and Damascus, and obtained tribute from both states.
Under Baldwin II the kingdom of Jerusalem grew to its greatest extent.{{sfn|Snell|1911}}
Tyre prospered as part of the kingdom of Jerusalem. When the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] died during the [[Third Crusade]] he was buried in the Tyre Cathedral. The town was captured and destroyed by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] in 1291.{{sfn|Tyre: Lebanese Dental Association}}

The Venetian fleet passed through the [[Aegean Sea]] on the return voyage. The Venetians again pillaged Greek islands.
The Greeks were forced to abandon the dispute and confirm the commercial privileges of Venice.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1986}}

The invasion successfully stopped [[Alexander Dubček]]'s [[Prague Spring]] liberalisation reforms and strengthened the authority of the authoritarian wing within the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ).

==Background==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}

===Novotný's regime in the late 1950s and early 1960s===
The process of [[de-Stalinization]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] had begun under [[Antonín Novotný]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), p 170&lt;/ref&gt; Following the lead of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Novotný proclaimed the completion of socialism, and the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia|new constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), p 7&lt;/ref&gt; accordingly, adopted the name [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the [[Slánský trials]], may have been considered as early as 1963, but did not take place until 1967.

In the early 1960s, Czechoslovakia underwent an economic downturn. The Soviet model of industrialization applied poorly to Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was already quite industrialized before World War II and the Soviet model mainly took into account less developed economies. Novotný's attempt at restructuring the economy, the 1965 [[New Economic Model (Czechoslovakia)|New Economic Model]], spurred increased demand for political reform as well.

===1967 Writers' Congress===
As the strict regime eased its rules, the [[Union of Czechoslovak Writers]] cautiously began to air discontent, and in the union's gazette, ''{{ill|Literární noviny|cs}}'', members suggested that literature should be independent of Party doctrine.
In June 1967, a small fraction of the Czech writer's union sympathized with radical socialists, specifically [[Ludvík Vaculík]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Jan Procházka (writer)|Jan Procházka]], [[Antonín Jaroslav Liehm]], [[Pavel Kohout]] and [[Ivan Klíma]].
A few months later, at a party meeting, it was decided that administrative actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since only a small part of the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues.  Control over ''Literární noviny'' and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers – including Dubček – endorsed these moves.

===Prague Spring===
{{Main|Prague Spring}}
The Prague Spring ({{lang-cs|Pražské jaro}}, {{lang-sk|Pražská jar}}) was a period of political [[liberalization]] in Czechoslovakia during the era of its domination by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War II]]. It began on 5 January 1968, when reformist [[Alexander Dubček]] was elected First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ), and continued until 21 August when the Soviet Union and other members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] invaded the country to halt the reforms.

The Prague Spring reforms were a strong attempt by Dubček to grant additional rights to the citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the [[freedom of the press|media]], [[freedom of speech|speech]] and [[freedom of movement|travel]]. After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]]-[[Czech Silesia|Silesia]] and [[Slovakia]], Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Czech radio broadcasts 18–20 August 1968&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring, though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989.

The reforms, especially the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. A large wave of emigration swept the nation. A spirited non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, painting over and turning street signs (on one occasion an entire invasion force from Poland was routed back out of the country after a day's wandering, another force went around in a circle), defiance of various curfews, etc.  While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country the resistance held out for eight months, and was only circumvented by diplomatic stratagems.  There were sporadic acts of violence and several suicides by self-immolation (such as that of [[Jan Palach]]), but there was no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained controlled until 1989, when the [[velvet revolution]] ended pro-Soviet rule peacefully, undoubtedly drawing upon the successes of the non-violent resistance twenty years earlier.  The resistance also became an iconic example of [[civilian-based defense]], which, along with [[unarmed civilian peacekeeping]] constitute the two ways that nonviolence can be and occasionally has been applied directly to military or paramilitary threats.

After the invasion, Czechoslovakia entered a period of [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]]: subsequent leaders attempted to restore the political and economic values that had prevailed before Dubček gained control of the KSČ. [[Gustáv Husák]], who replaced Dubček and also became [[president of Czechoslovakia|president]], reversed almost all of Dubček's reforms. The Prague Spring inspired music and literature such as the work of [[Václav Havel]], [[Karel Husa]], [[Karel Kryl]], and [[Milan Kundera]]'s novel ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.

===Brezhnev's government===
[[Leonid Brezhnev]] and the leadership of the Warsaw Pact countries were worried that the unfolding liberalizations in Czechoslovakia, including the ending of censorship and political surveillance by the secret police, would be detrimental to their interests. The first such fear was that Czechoslovakia would defect from the bloc, injuring the Soviet Union's position in a possible war with the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO). Not only would the loss result in a lack of strategic depth for the USSR,&lt;ref&gt;Karen Dawisha, "The 1968 Invasion of Czechoslovakia: Causes, Consequences, and Lessons for the Future" in ''Soviet-East European Dilemmas: Coercion, Competition, and Consent'' ed. Karen Dawisha and Philip Hanson (New York, NY: Homs and Meier Publishers Inc, 1981) 11&lt;/ref&gt; but it would also mean that it could not tap Czechoslovakia's industrial base in a potential war.&lt;ref&gt;Jiri Valenta, ''Soviet Intervention in Czechoslovakia, 1968: Anatomy of a Decision'' (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979) 3&lt;/ref&gt; Czechoslovak leaders had no intention of leaving the Warsaw Pact, but Moscow felt it could not be certain exactly what Prague's intentions were.

Other fears included the spread of liberalization and unrest elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact countries feared that if the [[Prague Spring]] reforms went unchecked, then those ideals might very well spread to Poland and [[East Germany]], upsetting the status quo there as well. Within the Soviet Union, nationalism in the republics of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Ukraine]] was already causing problems, and many were worried that events in Prague might exacerbate those problems.&lt;ref&gt;Jiri Valenta, "From Prague to Kabul," ''International Security'' 5, (1980), 117&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to documents from the Ukrainian Archives, compiled by Mark Kramer, [[KGB]] chairman [[Yuri Andropov]] and Ukrainian leaders [[Petro Shelest]] and [[Nikolai Podgorny]] were the most vehement proponents of military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kramer. [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ukraine.pdf Ukraine and the Soviet-Czechoslovak Crisis of 1968 (part 2)]. New Evidence from the Ukrainian Archives. ''Cold War International History Project Bulletin'', Issue 14/15. 2004. pp. 273–275.&lt;/ref&gt; The other version says that the initiative for the invasion came originally from Poland as the Polish politician [[Władysław Gomułka]] and later his collaborator, East German leader, [[Walter Ulbricht]], pressured Brezhnev to agree on the Warsaw Letter and on ensued military involvement.{{page needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt1281xt|title=Promises of 1968: Crisis, Illusion and Utopia|date=2011|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9786155053047|editor-last=TISMANEANU|editor-first=VLADIMIR|edition=NED - New edition, 1|doi=10.7829/j.ctt1281xt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Władysław Gomułka accused Brezhnev for being blind and looking at the situation in Czechoslovakia with too much of emotion. Walter Ulbricht, in turn, insisted upon the necessity to enact military action in Czechoslovakia while Brezhnev was still doubting. Poland's foreign policy on the issue is still unknown. The deliberation that took place in Warsaw meeting, resulted in majority-consensus rather than on unanimity.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In addition, part of Czechoslovakia bordered [[Austria]] and [[West Germany]], which were on the other side of the [[Iron Curtain]]. This meant both that foreign agents could potentially slip into Czechoslovakia and into any member of the Communist Bloc and that defectors could slip out to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Valenta (Fn. 7) 17&lt;/ref&gt; The final concern emerged directly from the lack of censorship; writers whose work had been censored in the Soviet Union could simply go to Prague or [[Bratislava]] and air their grievances there, circumventing the Soviet Union's censorship.

== Dubček's rise to power==
As President Antonín Novotný was losing support, Alexander Dubček, First Secretary of the regional [[Communist Party of Slovakia (1939)|Communist Party of Slovakia]], and economist [[Ota Šik]] challenged him at a meeting of the Central Committee. Novotný then invited Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev to Prague that December, seeking support; but Brezhnev was surprised at the extent of the opposition to Novotný and thus supported his removal as Czechoslovakia's leader. Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968. On 22 March 1968, Novotný resigned his presidency and was replaced by [[Ludvík Svoboda]], who later gave consent to the reforms.

Early signs of change were few.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} When the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) Presidium member [[Josef Smrkovský]] was interviewed in a ''[[Rudé Právo]]'' article, entitled "What Lies Ahead", he insisted that Dubček's appointment at the January Plenum would further the goals of socialism and maintain the working class nature of the Communist Party.

=== Socialism with a human face ===
{{main|Socialism with a human face}}
On the 20th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's "[[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|Victorious February]]", Dubček delivered a speech explaining the need for change following the triumph of socialism. He emphasized the need to "enforce the leading role of the party more effectively"&lt;ref name="Navratil52"/&gt; and acknowledged that, despite [[Klement Gottwald]]'s urgings for better relations with society, the Party had too often made heavy-handed rulings on trivial issues. Dubček declared the party's mission was "to build an advanced socialist society on sound economic foundations&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;a socialism that corresponds to the historical democratic traditions of Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the experience of other communist parties&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Navratil52"&gt;Navrátil (2006), pp 52–54&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, Dubček launched an "[[Action Programme (1968)|Action Programme]]" of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on [[consumer goods]] and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that "Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Ello (1968), pp 32, 54&lt;/ref&gt; It would limit the power of the secret police&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Those who drafted the Action Programme were careful not to criticize the actions of the post-war Communist regime, only to point out policies that they felt had outlived their usefulness.&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; For instance, the immediate post-war situation had required "centralist and directive-administrative methods"&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; to fight against the "remnants of the [[bourgeoisie]]."&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; Since the "antagonistic classes"&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; were said to have been defeated with the achievement of socialism, these methods were no longer necessary.  Reform was needed, for the Czechoslovak economy to join the "scientific-technical revolution in the world"&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; rather than relying on Stalinist-era [[heavy industry]], labour power, and raw materials.&lt;ref name="Doc"&gt;Ello (1968), pp 7–8, 129–30, 9, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since internal class conflict had been overcome, workers could now be duly rewarded for their qualifications and technical skills without contravening [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The Programme suggested it was now necessary to ensure important positions were "filled by capable, educated socialist expert cadres" in order to compete with capitalism.&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt;

Although it was stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction, popular pressure mounted to implement reforms immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Party conservatives urged repressive measures, but Dubček counselled moderation and re-emphasized KSČ leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Kusin (2002), p 107–122&lt;/ref&gt; At the Presidium of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] in April, Dubček announced a political programme of "socialism with a human face".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Dubček's reforms guaranteed freedom of the press, and political commentary was allowed for the first time in mainstream media.&lt;ref name="KieranPress"&gt;Williams (1997), p 164&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing [[planned economy|planned]] and [[market economy|market economies]]. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more [[mixed economy]] while others wanted the economy to remain mostly socialist. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), pp 18–22&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June [[Ludvík Vaculík]], a leading author and journalist, published a manifesto titled ''[[The Two Thousand Words]]''. It expressed concern about conservative elements within the KSČ and so-called "foreign" forces.

===Publications and media===
Dubček's relaxation of censorship ushered in a brief period of freedom of speech and the press.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Tieren. ''The Prague Spring and Its Aftermath: Czechoslovak Politics, 1968–1970.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The first tangible manifestation of this new policy of openness was the production of the previously hard-line communist weekly ''Literarni noviny'', renamed ''Literarni listy''.&lt;ref name="Williams, pp 68"&gt;Williams, pp 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bren, pp 23"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bren|first=Paulina|authorlink=Paulina Bren|title=The Greengrocer and His TV: The Culture of Communism after the 1968 Prague Spring|location=Ithaca, NY|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8014-4767-9|url={{Google books|id=o2LT7c_Kw80C|page=23|plainurl=yes}}|pages=23ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction and later complete abolition of the [[censorship]] on 4. March 1968 was one of the most important steps towards the reforms. It was for the first time in Czech history the censorship was abolished and it was probably the only reform fully implemented, albeit only for a short period. From the instrument of Party's propaganda media quickly became the instrument of criticism of the regime.&lt;ref name="bulletin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vondrová|first1=Jitka|title=PRAŽSKÉ JARO 1968|url=http://abicko.avcr.cz/2008/4/04/prazske-jaro-1968.html|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=Akademický bulletin|publisher=Akademie věd ČR|date=25 June 2008|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoppe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoppe|first1=Jiří|title=Co je Pražské jaro 1968?|url=https://iforum.cuni.cz/IFORUM-5993.html|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=iForum|publisher=Charles University|date=6 August 2008|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of the press also opened the door for the first honest look at Czechoslovakia's past by Czechoslovakia's people. Many of the investigations centered on the country's history under communism, especially in the instance of the [[Joseph Stalin]]-period.&lt;ref name="Williams, pp 68"/&gt; In another television appearance, Goldstucker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history.&lt;ref name="Bren, pp 23"/&gt; The Writer's Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet [[Jaroslav Seifert]], to investigate the persecution of writers after the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|Communist takeover in February 1948]] and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, bookstores and libraries, and the literary world.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, Galia. ''Cambridge Russian, Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies. Reform Rule in Czechoslovakia: The Dubček Era, 1968–1969''. Vol. 11. Cambridge, UK: CUP Archive, 1973, pp 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holy, pp 119"&gt;Holy, pp 119&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily ''Prace'' (Labour). This was also helped by the Journalists Union, which by March 1968 had already convinced the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions for foreign papers, allowing for a more international dialogue around the news.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, pp 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The press, the radio, and the television also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, [[Pavel Kohout]], and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as [[Josef Smrkovský]], Zdenek Hejzlar, and [[Gustav Husak]].&lt;ref name="Williams, pp 69"&gt;Williams, pp 69&lt;/ref&gt; Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held.&lt;ref name="Bren, pp 23"/&gt; Most importantly, this new freedom of the press and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.

==Czechoslovak negotiations with the USSR and other Warsaw Pact states==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}

[[File:(Srpen68)Obyvatel Prahy se pokousi diskutovat.jpg|thumb|A Prague resident tries to talk with a Soviet soldier.]]

The Soviet leadership at first tried to stop or limit the impact of Dubček's initiatives through a series of negotiations. Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks to be held in July 1968 at [[Čierna nad Tisou]], near the Slovak-Soviet border.&lt;ref name="aktualne"&gt;[http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/1968-bilateral-meeting-anticipated-soviet-invasion/r~i:article:612272/ "1968: Bilateral meeting anticipated Soviet invasion"] aktualne.cz. Retrieved on 11 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the meeting, with attendance of Brezhnev, [[Alexei Kosygin]], [[Nikolai Podgorny]], [[Mikhail Suslov]] and others on the Soviet side and Dubček, [[Ludvík Svoboda]], [[Oldřich Černík]], [[Josef Smrkovský]] and others on the Czechoslovak side, Dubček defended the program of the reformist wing of the KSČ while pledging commitment to the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]]. The KSČ leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers (Josef Smrkovský, Oldřich Černík, [[Josef Špaček]] and [[František Kriegel]]) who supported Dubček, and conservatives ([[Vasil Biľak]], Drahomír Kolder, and Oldřich Švestka) who represented an anti-reformist stance. Brezhnev decided on compromise. The KSČ delegates reaffirmed their loyalty to the Warsaw Pact and promised to curb "anti-socialist" tendencies, prevent the revival of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, and control the press by the re-imposition of a higher level of censorship.&lt;ref name="aktualne" /&gt; In return the USSR agreed to withdraw their troops (still stationed in Czechoslovakia since the June 1968 maneuvers) and permit 9 September party congress.

On 3 August, representatives from the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]], [[People's Republic of Poland]], Hungary, Bulgaria, and [[Czechoslovakia]] met in [[Bratislava]] and signed the Bratislava Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/documents/doc41.htm "The Bratislava Declaration, August 3, 1968" Navratil, Jaromir.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014010026/http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/documents/doc41.htm |date=14 October 2012 }} "The Prague Spring 1968".

As these talks proved unsatisfactory, the USSR began to consider a military alternative. The Soviet Union's policy of compelling the socialist governments of its [[satellite state]]s to subordinate their national interests to those of the [[Eastern Bloc]] (through military force if needed) became known as the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]].&lt;ref name="riseandfall" /&gt;

==NATO==
The United States and NATO largely turned a blind eye to the evolving situation in Czechoslovakia. While the Soviet Union was worried that it might lose an ally, the United States had absolutely no desire to gain it. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had already involved the United States in the [[Vietnam War]] and was unlikely to be able to drum up support for a potential conflict in Czechoslovakia. Also, he wanted to pursue an arms control treaty with the Soviets, [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]]. He needed a willing partner in Moscow in order to reach such an agreement, and he did not wish to potentially risk that treaty for Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha (Fn. 6) 10&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, the United States made it clear that it would not intervene on behalf of the Prague Spring, giving the USSR a free hand to do as it pleased.

The invasion was well planned and coordinated; simultaneously with the border crossing by ground forces, a Soviet airborne division ([[Russian Airborne Troops|VDV]]) captured Ruzyne International Airport (now called [[Prague Václav Havel Airport]]) in the early hours of the invasion. It began with a special flight from Moscow which carried more than 100 plain clothes agents. They quickly secured the airport and prepared the way for the huge forthcoming airlift, in which [[An-12]] transport aircraft began arriving and unloading [[Russian Airborne Troops|Soviet airborne troops]] equipped with artillery and light tanks.

As the operation at the airport continued, columns of tanks and motorized rifle troops headed toward Prague and other major centers, meeting no resistance. 

During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 137 Czechs and Slovaks were killed &lt;ref name="victims"/&gt; and hundreds were wounded. Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to Moscow along with several of his colleagues. Dubček and most of the reformers were returned to Prague on 27 August, and Dubček retained his post as the party's first secretary until he was forced to resign in April 1969 following the [[Czechoslovak Hockey Riots (1969)|Czechoslovak Hockey Riots]].

The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, largely of highly qualified people, unseen before and stopped shortly after (estimate: 70,000 immediately, 300,000 in total).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britskelisty.cz/9808/19980821h.html "Day when tanks destroyed Czech dreams of Prague Spring" ('&amp;#39;Den, kdy tanky zlikvidovaly české sny Pražského jara'&amp;#39;) at Britské Listy (British Letters)]. Britskelisty.cz. Retrieved on 23 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Western countries allowed these people to immigrate without complications.

===Failure to prepare===
The Dubček regime took no steps to forestall a potential invasion, despite ominous troop movements by the Warsaw Pact. The Czechoslovak leadership believed that the Soviet Union and its allies would not invade, having believed that the summit at Čierna nad Tisou had smoothed out the differences between the two sides.&lt;ref&gt;Jiri Valenta, "Could the Prague Spring Have Been Saved" Orbis 35 (1991) 597&lt;/ref&gt; They also believed that any invasion would be too costly, both because of domestic support for the reforms and because the international political outcry would be too significant, especially with the World Communist Conference coming up in November of that year. Czechoslovakia could have raised the costs of such an invasion by drumming up international support or making military preparations such as blocking roads and ramping up security of their airports, but they decided not to, paving the way for the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Valenta (Fn. 23) 599&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letter of invitation===
Although on the night of the invasion, the Czechoslovak Presidium declared that Warsaw Pact troops had crossed the border without the knowledge of the ČSSR Government, the [[Central newspapers of the Soviet Union|Soviet Press]] printed an unsigned request, allegedly by Czechoslovak party and state leaders, for "immediate assistance, including assistance with armed forces".&lt;ref name="skilling"&gt;[[H. Gordon Skilling]], ''Czechoslovakia's Interrupted Revolution'', (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; At the 14th KSČ [[Party Congress]] (conducted secretly, immediately following the intervention), it was emphasized that no member of the leadership had invited the intervention. At the time, a number of commentators believed the letter was fake or non-existent.

In the early 1990s, however, the Russian government gave the new Czechoslovak President, [[Václav Havel]], a copy of a letter of invitation addressed to Soviet authorities and signed by KSČ members [[Vasil Biľak|Biľak]], [[Oldřich Švestka|Švestka]], [[Drahomír Kolder|Kolder]], [[Alois Indra|Indra]], and [[Antonín Kapek|Kapek]]. It claimed that "right-wing" media were "fomenting a wave of nationalism and chauvinism, and are provoking an anti-communist and anti-Soviet psychosis". It formally asked the Soviets to "lend support and assistance with all means at your disposal" to save the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic "from the imminent danger of counterrevolution".&lt;ref name = "Williams"&gt;Kieran Williams, "The Prague Spring and its aftermath: Czechoslovak politics 1968–1970," (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 ''[[Izvestia]]'' article claimed that candidate Presidium member Antonin Kapek gave [[Leonid Brezhnev]] a letter at the Soviet-Czechoslovak Čierna nad Tisou talks in late July which appealed for "fraternal help". A second letter was supposedly delivered by Biľak to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] Party leader [[Petro Shelest]] during the August [[Bratislava]] conference "in a lavatory rendezvous arranged through the [[KGB]] station chief".&lt;ref name = "Williams"/&gt; This letter was signed by the same five as Kapek's letter, mentioned above.

===Internal plot===
Long before the invasion, planning for a coup was undertaken by Indra, Kolder, and Biľak, among others, often at the Soviet embassy and at the Party recreation centre at [[Orlík Dam]].&lt;ref name = "Williams" /&gt; When these men had managed to convince a majority of the Presidium (six of eleven voting members) to side with them against Alexander Dubček's reformists, they asked the USSR to launch a military invasion. The USSR leadership was even considering waiting until 26 August Slovak Party Congress, but the Czechoslovak conspirators "specifically requested the night of the 20th".&lt;ref name = "Williams"/&gt;

The plan was to unfold as follows. A debate would unfold in response to the Kašpar report on the state of the country, during which conservative members would insist that Dubček present two letters he had received from the USSR, letters which listed promises he had made at the Čierna nad Tisou talks but had failed to keep. Dubček's concealment of such important letters, and his unwillingness to keep his promises would lead to a [[vote of confidence]] which the now conservative majority would win, seizing power, and issue a request for Soviet assistance in preventing a [[counterrevolution]]. It was this formal request, drafted in Moscow, which was published in [[Pravda]] on 22 August without the signatories. All the USSR needed to do was suppress the Czechoslovak military and any violent resistance.&lt;ref name = "navratil"&gt;Jaromír Navratíl, et al., eds. "The Prague Spring 1968: A National Security Archive Documents Reader," (Budapest: [[Central European University Press]], 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

With this plan in mind, the 16–17 August Soviet [[Politburo]] meeting unanimously passed a resolution to "provide help to the Communist Party and people of Czechoslovakia through military force".&lt;ref name="navratil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ency"/&gt; At 18 August Warsaw Pact meeting, Brezhnev announced that the intervention would go ahead on the night of 20 August, and asked for "fraternal support", which the national leaders of Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary, and Poland duly offered.

===Failure of the plot===
The coup, however, did not go according to plan. Kolder intended to review the Kašpar report early in the meeting, but Dubček and Špaček, suspicious of Kolder, adjusted the agenda so the upcoming 14th [[Party Congress]] could be covered before any discussion on recent reforms or Kašpar's report. Discussion of the Congress dragged on, and before the conspirators had a chance to request a confidence vote, early news of the invasion reached the Presidium.&lt;ref name="skilling"/&gt;

An anonymous warning was transmitted by the Czechoslovak Ambassador to Hungary, Jozef Púčik, approximately six hours before Soviet troops crossed the border at midnight.&lt;ref name="skilling"/&gt; When the news arrived, the solidarity of conservative coalition crumbled. When the Presidium proposed a declaration condemning the invasion, two key members of the conspiracy, [[Jan Pillar]] and [[František Barbírek]], switched sides to support Dubček. With their help, declaration against the invasion won with a 7:4 majority.&lt;ref name = "Williams"/&gt;

===Moscow Protocol===
By the morning of 21 August, Dubček and other prominent reformists had been arrested and were later flown to Moscow. There they were held in secret and interrogated for days.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Kusin, ''From Dubcek to Charter 77'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1978) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservatives asked Svoboda to create an "emergency government" but since they had not won a clear majority of support, he refused. Instead, he and Gustáv Husák traveled to Moscow on 23 August to insist Dubček and Černík should be included in a solution to the conflict. After days of negotiations, all members of the Czechoslovak delegation (including all the highest-ranked officials President Svoboda, First Secretary Dubček, Prime Minister Černík and Chairman of the National Assembly Smrkovský) but one ([[František Kriegel]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nakedtourguideprague.com/the-man-who-said-no-to-the-soviets/|title=The Man Who Said "No" to the Soviets|date=21 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepted the "[[Moscow Protocol]]", and signed their commitment to its fifteen points. The Protocol demanded the suppression of opposition groups, the full reinstatement of censorship, and the dismissal of specific reformist officials.&lt;ref name = "navratil"/&gt; It did not, however, refer to the situation in the ČSSR as "[[counterrevolutionary]]" nor did it demand a reversal of the post-January course.&lt;ref name = "navratil"/&gt;

==Reactions in Czechoslovakia==
[[File:(Srpen68)Obyvatelstvo se zasobuje.jpg|thumb|Population securing food supplies]]

Popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of [[nonviolent resistance]]. In [[Prague]] and other cities throughout the republic, Czechs and Slovaks greeted Warsaw Pact soldiers with arguments and reproaches. Every form of assistance, including the provision of food and water, was denied to the invaders. Signs, placards, and [[graffiti]] drawn on walls and pavements denounced the invaders, the Soviet leaders, and suspected [[collaborationism|collaborationists]]. Pictures of Dubček and Svoboda appeared in the streets. Citizens gave wrong directions to soldiers and even removed street signs (except for those giving the direction back to Moscow).&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, Vaclav Havel: A Political Tragedy in Six Acts (New York: Basic Books, 2000) 213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:(Srpen68)Cs vlajka pokryta krvi.jpg|thumb|left|National flag of Czechoslovakia covered in blood]]

Initially, some civilians tried to argue with the invading troops, but this met with little or no success. After the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] used photographs of these discussions as proof that the invasion troops were being greeted [[wikt:amicably|amicably]], secret Czechoslovak broadcasting stations discouraged the practice, reminding the people that "pictures are silent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| title = Mit bloßen Händen – der einsame Kampf der Tschechen und Slowaken 1968
| publisher=Verlag Fritz Molden }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests in reaction to the invasion lasted only about seven days. Explanations for the fizzling of these public outbursts mostly centre on demoralisation of the population, whether from the intimidation of all the enemy troops and tanks or from being abandoned by their leaders. Many Czechoslovaks saw the signing of the Moscow Protocol as treasonous.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Dubcek, "Hope Dies Last" (New York: Kodansha International, 1993) 216&lt;/ref&gt; Another common explanation is that, due to the fact that most of Czech society was middle class, the cost of continued resistance meant giving up a comfortable lifestyle, which was too high a price to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (Fn. 25) 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalised resistance caused the Soviet Union to abandon its original plan to oust the First Secretary. Dubček, who had been arrested on the night of 20 August, was taken to Moscow for negotiations. It was agreed that Dubček would remain in office, but he was no longer free to pursue liberalisation as he had before the invasion.

On 19 January 1969, student [[Jan Palach]] set himself on fire in [[Wenceslas Square]] in Prague to protest the renewed suppression of [[free speech]].

Finally, on 17 April 1969, Dubček was replaced as First Secretary by [[Gustáv Husák]], and a period of "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]" began. Pressure from the Soviet Union pushed politicians to either switch loyalties or simply give up. In fact, the very group that voted in Dubček and put the reforms in place were mostly the same people who annulled the program and replaced Dubček with Husák. Husák reversed Dubček's reforms, purged the party of its liberal members, and dismissed the professional and intellectual elites who openly expressed disagreement with the political turnaround from public offices and jobs.

==Reactions in other Warsaw Pact countries==

On 25 August, at the [[Red Square]], eight protesters carried banners with anti-invasion slogans. The demonstrators were arrested and later punished, as the protest was dubbed "[[anti-Soviet]]".&lt;ref name="an"&gt;Letter by [[Yuri Andropov]] to [[Central Committee]] about the demonstration, 5 September 1968, in the [[Vladimir Bukovsky]]'s archive, (PDF, faximile, in Russian), [http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/pdfs/dis60/kgb68-5.pdf JHU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andropov to the Central Committee.

One unintended consequence of the invasion was that many within the Soviet State security apparatus and Intelligence Services were shocked and outraged at the invasion and several KGB/GRU defectors and spies such as [[Oleg Gordievsky]], [[Vasili Mitrokhin]], and [[Dmitri Polyakov]] have pointed out the 1968 invasion as their motivation for cooperating with the Western Intelligence agencies.

A more pronounced effect took place in the [[Communist Romania|Socialist Republic of Romania]], which did not take part in the invasion. [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], who was already a staunch opponent of Soviet influence and had previously declared himself on Dubček's side, held a [[Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968|public speech in Bucharest]] on the day of the invasion, depicting Soviet policies in harsh terms. This response consolidated Romania's independent voice in the next two decades, especially after Ceauşescu encouraged the population to take up arms in order to meet any similar manoeuvre in the country: he received an enthusiastic initial response, with many people, who were by no means Communist, willing to enrol in the newly formed paramilitary [[Patriotic Guards (Romania)|Patriotic Guards]].

===East Germany===
In the [[German Democratic Republic]], the invasion aroused discontent mostly among young people who had hoped that Czechoslovakia would pave the way for a more liberal socialism.&lt;ref name="allinson"&gt;{{cite book | title=Politics and Popular Opinion in East Germany, 1945–68 | publisher= Manchester University Press | first=Mark | last=Allinson | year=2000 | pages=149–150 | isbn=978-0719055546}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, isolated protests were quickly stopped by the [[Volkspolizei]] and [[Stasi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/9JZQKI,8,0,Die_vers%E4umte_Revolte%3A_Die_DDR_und_das_Jahr_1968.html#art8 Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: Die versäumte Revolte: Die DDR und das Jahr 1968 – Ideale sterben langsam (in German)].

===Albania===
Albania responded in opposite fashion: already feuding with Moscow over suggestions that the country should focus on agriculture to the detriment of industrial development, and concerned that Moscow was becoming too liberal in its dealings with Yugoslavia (which, by that time, Albania regarded as a threatening neighbor and had branded in propaganda as "imperialist"), it [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania#Withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact|withdrew from the Warsaw Pact entirely]]. Economic fallout from this move was mitigated somewhat by a strengthening of Albanian relations with the People's Republic of China, which was itself on increasingly strained terms with the Soviet Union.

The night of the invasion, Canada, Denmark, France, Paraguay, the United Kingdom, and the United States all requested a meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name=franck&gt;{{cite book|last=Franck|first=Thomas M.|authorlink=Thomas M.

Soviet Ambassador [[Jacob Alexandrovich Malik|Jacob Malik]] insisted the Warsaw Pact actions were those of "fraternal assistance" against "antisocial forces".&lt;ref name=franck/&gt; The next day, several countries suggested a resolution condemning the intervention and calling for immediate withdrawal.

Ball accused Soviet delegates of [[filibuster]]ing to put off the vote until the occupation was complete. Malik continued to speak, ranging in topics from [[US-Latin American relations|US exploitation of Latin America's raw materials]] to statistics on Czech commodity trading.&lt;ref name=franck/&gt; Eventually, a vote was taken. Ten members supported the motion; Algeria, India, and Pakistan abstained; the USSR (with veto power) and Hungary opposed it. Canadian delegates immediately introduced another motion asking for a UN representative to travel to Prague and work for the release of the imprisoned Czechoslovak leaders.&lt;ref name=franck/&gt; Malik accused Western countries of hypocrisy, asking "who drowned the fields, villages, and cities of Vietnam in blood?"&lt;ref name=franck/&gt; By 26 August, another vote had not taken place, but a new Czechoslovak representative requested the whole issue be removed from the Security Council's agenda.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Although the United States insisted at the UN that Warsaw Pact aggression was unjustifiable, its position was compromised by its own actions. Only three years earlier, US delegates to the UN had insisted that the overthrow of the leftist government of the Dominican Republic, as part of [[Operation Power Pack]], was an issue to be worked out by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) without UN interference. The OAS accepted adherence to [[Marxism–Leninism]] as an armed attack justifying self-defense by the United States.&lt;ref name=franck/&gt; American involvement in the Vietnam War led [[UN Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] to draw further comparisons, suggesting that "if Russians were bombing and napalming the villages of Czechoslovakia" he might be more vocal in his denunciation.&lt;ref name=franck/&gt;

The United States government sent [[Shirley Temple Black]], the famous child movie star, who became a diplomat in later life, to Prague in August 1968 to prepare to become the first United States Ambassador to a free Czechoslovakia.

== Normalization (1969–1971) ==
{{main|Normalization (Czechoslovakia)}}

In the [[history of Czechoslovakia]], '''normalization''' ({{lang-cs|normalizace}}, {{lang-sk|normalizácia}}) is a name commonly given to the period 1969–87. It was characterized by initial restoration of the conditions prevailing before the [[Prague Spring|reform period]] led by [[Alexander Dubček]] (1963/1967 – 1968), first of all, the firm rule of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], and subsequent preservation of this new ''status quo''.

"Normalization" is sometimes used in a narrower sense to refer only to the period 1969 to 1971.

The official ideology of normalization is sometimes called [[Husakism]] after the Czechoslovak leader [[Gustáv Husák]].

=== 1969–1971 (Removing the reforms and reformers) ===

When [[Gustáv Husák]] replaced Alexander Dubček as leader of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|KSČ]] in April 1969 after the military intervention of Warsaw Pact armies, his regime acted quickly to "normalize" the country's political situation. The chief objectives of Husák's normalization were the restoration of firm party rule and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia's status as a committed member of the socialist bloc. The normalization process involved five interrelated steps:
*consolidate the Husák leadership and remove reformers from leadership positions;
*revoke or modify the laws enacted by the reform movement;
*reestablish centralized control over the economy;
*reinstate the power of police authorities; and
*expand Czechoslovakia's ties with other socialist nations.

Within a week of assuming power, Husák began to consolidate his leadership by ordering extensive purges of reformists still occupying key positions in the mass media, judiciary, social and mass organizations, lower party organs, and, finally, the highest levels of the KSČ. In the fall of 1969, twenty-nine liberals on the Central Committee  of the KSČ were replaced by conservatives. Among the liberals ousted was Dubček, who was dropped from the Presidium (the following year Dubček was expelled from the party; he subsequently became a minor functionary in Slovakia, where he still lived in 1987). Husák also consolidated his leadership by appointing potential rivals to the new government positions created as a result of the 1968 Constitutional Law of Federation (which created the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]).

Once it had consolidated power, the regime moved quickly to implement other normalization policies. In the two years following the invasion, the new leadership revoked some reformist laws (such as the National Front Act and the Press Act) and simply did not enforce others. It returned economic enterprises, which had been given substantial independence during the [[Prague Spring]], to centralized control through contracts based on central planning and production quotas. It reinstated extreme police control, a step that was reflected in the harsh treatment of demonstrators marking the first anniversary of the August intervention.

Finally, Husák stabilized Czechoslovakia's relations with its allies by arranging frequent intrabloc exchanges and visits and redirecting Czechoslovakia's foreign economic ties toward greater involvement with socialist nations.

By May 1971, Husák could report to the delegates attending the officially sanctioned Fourteenth Party Congress that the process of normalization had been completed satisfactorily and that Czechoslovakia was ready to proceed toward higher forms of socialism.

==Later reactions and revisionism==
[[File:August 68.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial plate in [[Košice]], Slovakia]]

The first government to offer an apology was Hungary, on 11 August 1989. The [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] publicly published its opinion on the fundamentally wrong decision to invade Czechoslovakia. The House of the National Assembly of Poland in 1989, on the 21st anniversary of military intervention, adopted a resolution condemning the armed intervention. Another apology was issued by the People's Assembly of East Germany on 1 December 1989, where they apologized to the Czechoslovak people for their involvement in the military intervention. An apology from Bulgaria came on 2 December 1989.&lt;ref name="literarky"/&gt;

On 4 December 1989, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and other Warsaw Pact leaders drafted a statement calling the 1968 invasion a mistake. The statement, carried by the Soviet news agency [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|Tass]], said that sending in troops constituted "interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign Czechoslovakia and must be condemned."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soviet, Warsaw Pact Call 1968 Invasion of Czechoslovakia a Mistake With AM-Czechoslovakia, Bjt|url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Soviet-Warsaw-Pact-Call-1968-Invasion-of-Czechoslovakia-a-Mistake-With-AM-Czechoslovakia-Bjt/id-f21e2079f05ce74b2ae605f1468c3435|website = www.apnewsarchive.com|accessdate = 2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government also said that the 1968 action was "an unbalanced, inadequate approach, an interference in the affairs of a friendly country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soviets: Prague Invasion Wrong|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-12-05/news/8903150435_1_warsaw-pact-prague-spring-soviet-forces|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This acknowledgement likely helped to encourage the popular revolutions that overthrew Communist regimes in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania at the end of 1989 by providing assurance that no similar Soviet intervention would be repeated were such uprisings to occur.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The invasion was also condemned by the newly appointed Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] ("We condemn it as an aggression, as an attack on a sovereign, stand-up state as interference in its internal affairs").&lt;ref name="literarky"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raduševič|first1=Mirko|title=Gorbačov o roce 1968: V životě jsem nezažil větší dilema|url=http://www.literarky.cz/politika/domaci/15647-gorbaov-o-roce-1968-v-ivot-jsem-nezail-vti-dilema|website=Literární noviny|language=cs-cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a state visit to Prague, on 1 March 2006, also [[Vladimir Putin]] said that the [[Russian Federation]] bore moral responsibility for the invasion, referring to his predecessor [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s description of 1968 as an act of aggression: "When President Yeltsin visited the Czech Republic in 1993 he was not speaking just for himself, he was speaking for the Russian Federation and for the Russian people. Today, not only do we respect all agreements signed previously – we also share all the evaluations that were made at the beginning of the 1990s... I must tell you with absolute frankness – we do not, of course, bear any legal responsibility. But the moral responsibility is there, of course".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Radio Prague – Putin: Russia bears "moral responsibility" for 1968 Soviet invasion|url = http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/putin-russia-bears-moral-responsibility-for-1968-soviet-invasion|website = www.radio.cz|accessdate = 2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Werner Hosewinckel Christie''' (13 December 1917 – 29 December 2004) was a Norwegian air force officer, who reached the rank of [[major general]] in the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Werner Hosewinckel Christie – norsk flyoffiser|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Werner_Hosewinckel_Christie/norsk_flyoffiser|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Vang, Hedmark]] as a son of professor [[Werner Hosewinckel Christie (1877–1927)|Werner Hosewinckel Christie]] (1877–1927) and Karen Amalie Wedel-Jarlsberg (1886–1952).&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Werner Christie|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Vera|last=Henriksen|authorlink=Vera Henriksen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Werner_Christie/utdypning_%E2%80%93_3|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brother of pianist [[Amalie Christie]] and officer [[Johan Koren Christie (officer)|Johan Koren Christie]], an uncle of politician [[Werner Christie]] and a grandnephew of politician [[Hans Langsted Christie]] and architect [[Christian Christie]].&lt;ref name=snl2&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Christie|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Christie|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a second cousin of [[Jacob Christie Kielland]] and [[Else Christie Kielland]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In 1945 he married Elisabeth Marie Cathrine Hille, which made him a son-in-law of bishop [[Henrik Greve Hille]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Ole Friele Backer norske flygere.jpg|thumb|Christie (left), with fellow Norwegian pilots at [[RAF Catterick]] in 1942]]
Christie took his [[examen artium]] in 1935, and attended the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische College of Berlin]] from 1935 to 1937 and ''[[Hærens Flyveskole]]'' from 1937 to 1939. As [[World War II]] broke out, Christie, with the rank of sergeant, was called to [[Stavanger Airport, Sola|Sola Airport]] as a member of Norway's [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] guard. However the airport was [[Operation Weserübung|attacked by Germany]] on 9 April 1940 and fighting ensued. The Norwegians lost the battle, but Christie managed to retreat to the inner country. His group was involved in [[Norwegian Campaign|fighting]] until 23 April, whereafter it retreated further east. Norway eventually fell to German rule, and in the autumn of 1940 Christie fled to Canada via Sweden, the Soviet Union and the United States. He joined the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile|air force-in-exile]] at [[Little Norway]], and spent the rest of the war as a fighter pilot. He commanded the Norwegian [[No. 332 Squadron RAF|No. 332 Squadron]], then the RAF's [[No. 234 Squadron RAF|234 Squadron]], and as [[wing leader]] of [[No. 150 Wing RAF|150 Wing]] and the Hunsdon Wing flying the P-51 Mustang, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. After 244 operational missions he was shot down over Germany on 18 April 1945 and held as a prisoner-of-war until the war's end.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Not many from his ''Hærens Flyveskole'' class survived the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Werner Christie (obituary)|last=Welle-Strand|first=Erling|authorlink=Erling Welle-Strand|date=6 January 2005|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Christie wanted to continue in the air force. He graduated from the [[RAF Staff College, Bulstrode Park|RAF Staff College]] in 1946, worked for the [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] from 1947 to 1949 and as the [[Air attaché|aerial attaché]] at the Norwegian embassy in Stockholm from 1949 to 1951. He was appointed as head of the [[Norwegian Air Force High Command]] ({{lang|no|Luftforsvarets overkommando}}) in 1951, with the rank of major, but did not stay for long. He worked at the military airport at [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Gardermoen]] from 1952 to 1954 and at the air force staff academy from 1954 to 1956. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1953. From 1956 to 1959 he was the secretary-general of [[Norsk Aero Klubb]]. He then returned to the Air Force, and was promoted to colonel in 1962 and major general in 1968.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He left the air force in 1977. He worked for the clothing company [[Helly Hansen]] for a year,&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; and then for the [[Norwegian Red Cross]] from 1978 to 1982.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; He was also a member of the gentlemen's skiing club [[SK Fram (Oslo)|SK Fram]] from 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Qvale, Fredrik|editor-link=Fredrik Qvale|year=1989|title=Skiklubben Fram 100 år|language=Norwegian|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in December 2004 in Oslo.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;
