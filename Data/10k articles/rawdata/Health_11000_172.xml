The suspect had entered the facility to report to work as usual, before opening fire on victims inside and outside of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wbaltv.com/article/officials-multiple-victims-in-harford-county-shooting/23330608|title=7 shot, 3 killed, suspect dead in Harford County shooting|last=Khan|first=Saliqa A.|date=2018-09-21|work=WBAL|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]] sheriff stated that calls of "shots fired" came from the [[Rite Aid]] distribution center at approximately 9:06&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/09/20/multiple-victims-reported-in-maryland-shooting|title=Officials: 3 killed in shooting at Maryland Rite Aid center|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputies responded at 9:09 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-harford-shooting-20180920-story.html|title=Three killed in shooting at Rite Aid distribution center in Harford County, AP says; suspect in critical condition|last=Anderson|first=Colin Campbell, Jessica|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers reportedly never discharged their weapons while responding to the scene.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/09/20/multiple-victims-reported-in-maryland-shooting-sheriff-says.html|title=Maryland distribution center shooting leaves multiple people dead, wounded, police say|last=Lam|first=Katherine|date=2018-09-20|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents from the Baltimore offices of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)]] and the FBI responded to the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-maryland-shooting/multiple-fatalities-in-maryland-shooting-suspect-arrested-sheriff-idUSKCN1M0266|title='Multiple fatalities' in Maryland shooting, suspect arrested: sheriff|last=Cherelus|first=Gina|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victims ===
Preliminary reports suggest that at least three people were killed in the attack, although the Harford County Sheriff declined to give a precise number of wounded and deceased victims during the press conference.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/9/20/17882414/aberdeen-maryland-shooting-rite-aid-harford-county|title=Aberdeen, Maryland, shooting at Rite Aid distribution center: what we know|work=Vox|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two victims died at the scene and a third in the hospital.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2291">The  '''Aged Care Act 1997''' is an [[statute|act]] of the [[Parliament of Australia]]. It regulates aged care in Australia, in particular services paid for by the government. 

It has been described as a turning point for aged care policy in Australia.  It led to an increase in private investment. Private equity firms, new foreign investors, and superannuation and property real estate investment trusts all entered the Australian residential aged care market.  The staffing requirements contained in the Act have been condemned as disgracefully inadequate, and there is said to be “a complete absence of any positive and mandatory legal obligation on the part of facilities to take proactive measures to promote mental health and wellbeing of their residents”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Russell |first1=Sarah |title=The aged care crisis can be traced back to Howard's Aged Care Act.

On 2 March 2018 the [[Federal Court of Australia]] decided that [[Regis Healthcare]]'s Asset Replacement Charge was not consistent with the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Regis Healthcare Ltd share price falls on court decision |url=https://www.fool.com.au/2018/03/08/regis-healthcare-ltd-share-price-falls-on-court-decision/ |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=The Motley Fool |date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These charges were intended  to “fund reinstatements of fixtures, fittings and infrastructure, rebuilding and construction of, or at, Regis’s residential care facilities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Approved Providers can and cannot charge under the Aged Care Act – Regis Aged Care Pty Limited v Secretary, Department of Health [2018] |url=https://www.holmanwebb.com.au/blog/what-can-approved-providers-charge-under-aged-care-act?utm_source=Mondaq&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=View-Original |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=Holman Webb |date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aylā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: अयला:) is a [[Newar people|Newari]] beverage prepared by distillation of fermented ingredients such as rice, grains and millet. Apart from casual drinking, Aila is an important part of festivals in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Aila:(Nepal) Made from Rice|date=February 14, 2012|url=http://www.improve.com/Aila-Nepal-Made-from-Rice/229}}&lt;/ref&gt; This liquor is usually homemade and prepared by traditional methods. Its preparation is not yet commercial in [[Nepal]], however it is sold in restaurant that serve [[Newa cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrestha|first=Bijay|title=Aila...The Mystical Taste of Nepal|date=July 2003|url=http://www.ecs.com.np/feature_detail.php?f_id=296 |journal=ECS Nepal }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is about 60% alcohol and can be bought in local Newari restaurants .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Thomas|title=Nepal’s local eateries|date=March 1, 2012 |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20120229-nepals-local-eateries |journal=BBC Travel }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]] has noted it as being one of the "50 most delicious drinks in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=World's 50 most delicious drinks|date=  December 9, 2011|url=http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/drink/worlds-50-most-delicious-drinks-883542?page=0,4 |journal=CNN Travel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Aila is usually prepared by Newari women before any festival or socio-cultural event. Rice along with many other ingredients is mixed with ''Marcha'', a local organic [[fermenting]] compound, and fermented at least four to five days to ensure the preparation of a good quality '''Aila'''. [[Millet]] is used instead of rice for an even stronger flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basnet|first=Ayushma |title=Think Local, Drink Local|year=n.d.|url=http://www.fridayweekly.com.np/gourmet.php?id=503 | journal=Friday Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final product is obtained after [[distillation]]. This is done by using traditional clay and brass vessel designed specifically for this purpose. The raw fermented mixture is cooked over a wood fire stove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrestha|first=Bijay|title=Aila...The Mystical Taste of Nepal|date=July 2003 |url=http://www.ecs.com.np/feature_detail.php?f_id=296 |journal=ECS Nepal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature of flame and cooling water are the two factors controlling the quality of this beverage during distillation.

==Religious Significance==
Consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is not just allowed but generally encouraged in Newari culture. This is a religious practice promoted by [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] traditions. According to the Tantric practices, foods are divided into three groups. These food groups are, ''mamsa'' (meat), ''matsya'' (fish) and ''madya'' (alcoholic beverage).
It is believed that offering alcohol would satisfy the Tantric Gods who in turn grant followers with good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Food In Newari Culture|year=|url=http://web.comhem.se/~u18515267/CHAPTERIII.htm#_ftn17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Aila''' is first offered to the Gods before every religious festival and cultural activities, and then it is served. One such famous Newari festival is [[Yenya]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4277">The '''Anatomical Society''', previously known as the '''Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland''' or '''ASGBI''' was founded in London in 1887 to "promote, develop and advance research and education in all aspects of anatomical science". &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.anatsoc.org.uk/AboutUs.aspx|title= About the Anatomical Society|publisher= The Anatomical Society|accessdate = 2012-10-21}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The society organises scientific meetings, publishes the ''[[Journal of Anatomy]]'' and ''Aging Cell'' and makes annual awards of PhD studentships, grants and prizes.

The society was suggested in early 1887 by [[Charles Barrett Lockwood]], a surgeon and anatomist at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London and the first meeting was held on 6 May 1887. Lockwood was elected as Secretary and Sir [[George Murray Humphry]], Professor of Anatomy and the first Professor of Surgery at Cambridge University, as first President of the society. Two resolutions were adopted: “That an Anatomical Society be founded, and that it be called the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland” and “That the scope and object of the Society be the Anatomy, Embryology and Histology of Man and of Animals in so far as they throw light upon the structure of Man”.

In 2010 the name of the society was changed to "The Anatomical Society"

'''Autoimmune disease in women''' is a description of the autoimmune diseases that affect women. Some of these differences are unique to women such as the effects during pregnancy. Women with autoimmune diseases can safely have children. There are be some risks for the mother or baby, depending on the disease and how severe it is. For instance, pregnant women with [[lupus]] have a higher risk of [[preterm birth]] and [[stillbirth]]. [[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] women with [[myasthenia gravis]] (MG) might have [[symptoms]] that lead to trouble breathing during pregnancy. For some women, symptoms tend to improve during pregnancy, while others find their symptoms tend to flare up. Also, some [[medicines]] used to treat [[autoimmune disease]]s might not be safe to use during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=ATA&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.thyroid.org/wp-content/uploads/patients/brochures/Postpartum_Thyroiditis_brochure.pdf | title = Postpartum Thyroiditis brochure | accessdate = 24 July 2017 | date = 2014 | publisher = American Thyroid Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==During pregnancy==
Talking with a health care provider before becoming pregnant is recommended. They may suggest to wait until the disease is in remission or suggest a change in medication before becoming pregnant. There are [[endocrinologist]]s that specialize in treating women with high-risk pregnancies.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

Some women with autoimmune diseases may have problems getting pregnant. This can happen for many reasons. Tests can tell if fertility problems are caused by an autoimmune disease or an unrelated reason. Fertility treatments are able to help some women with autoimmune disease become pregnant.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==Limitations==
Although most autoimmune diseases cannot be cured, it is possible to manage the disease and participate in same activities that other women are able to do. Women with autoimmune diseases lead full, active lives. Seeing a specialist will assist in maintaining function and the maintenance of optimal health.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==Non-pharmacological treatment==
Non-pharmacological treatments are effective in treating autoimmune disease and contribute to a sense of well-being. Women can:
*Eat healthy, well-balanced meals that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk products, and lean sources of protein. A healthy diet limits saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;
*Engage in regular physical activity without overdoing it. Consulting with a clinician about what types of physical activity is appropriate. A gradual and gentle exercise program often works well for people with long-lasting muscle and joint pain. Some types of [[yoga]] or [[tai chi]] may be helpful.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;
*Get enough rest. Rest allows body tissues and joints the time they need to repair. Sleeping is a great way to maintain health and helps both body and mind. Lack of sleep, stress levels and symptoms might get worsen. Immunity to other infections or diseases is reduced when sleep is not adequate. Rest contributes to the ability to handle the stressors and problems. Many people need at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each day to feel well-rested.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;
*Reduce stress. Stress and anxiety can trigger symptoms to flare up with some autoimmune diseases. Simplifying daily stressors will help contribute to a sense of well-being. [[Meditation]], [[self-hypnosis]], and [[guided imagery]], may be effective in reducing stress, reducing pain, and the ability to deal with other aspects of living with the disease . Instructional materials can assist with learning these activities such as self-help books, audio sources, tapes, or with the help of an instructor. Joining a support group or talking with a counselor might also help manage stress and cope with the disease.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==Complementary treatments==

* Some complementary treatments can be effective and include:
* Listening to music
* Taking time to relax in a comfortable position
* Using  imagery throughout the day
* Imagining confronting the pain and watching it be destroyed.&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Autoimmune Diseases |url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/az-topics/autoimmunediseases|publisher = Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=1 February 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Malay name|Abdul Aziz|Ishak|note=on}}

'''Abdul Aziz bin Ishak''' (1913–1999) was a Malaysian freedom fighter, politician and journalist.

Aziz was, in fact, the only member of the pre-war [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]] (KMM) to have served in the 1955 and post-[[Merdeka]] Cabinets under [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]. Between 1955 and 1963, he was the Minister for Agriculture and Co-operatives, where his efforts in rural development to improve the lives of padi farmers and fishermen were important although less known compared with similar efforts undertaken by the Rural Development Ministry.

Aziz remains an enigma unlike his brother [[Yusof Ishak]] who was well known both as a journalist and the founder of [[Utusan Melayu]] and as the first [[President of Singapore]] after the separation with [[Malaysia]] in 1965.

==Early life==
Born in 1913 the state of [[Perak]], which was then part of the [[Federated Malay States]], Aziz Ishak is the descendant of prominent Sumatran Malay Datuk Jannatun who migrated to [[Penang]] in 1759 or 15 years before [[Francis Light]] arrived on the island.

Aziz is of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] descent from his father's side while his mother is a native of [[Langkat]] regency in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060613123230/http://www.istana.gov.sg/FormerPresidents/YusofIshak/ The Istana – index]&lt;/ref&gt; His brother is [[Yusof Ishak]] was the first [[President of Singapore]] and his face adorns the current [[Singapore dollar|paper currency of Singapore]] that is in circulation.

Denied entry into the [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]] because of his non-aristocratic background, Aziz attended Victoria Bridge School (now [[Victoria School]]) and [[Raffles Institution]] in Singapore.

His time at Raffles was an important learning experience. He mixed well with students of various ethnic backgrounds and was the [[School Captain]] for two years, perhaps the only Malay to have held this distinction.

At Raffles, he formed a Malay literary association with friends including [[Hamid Jumaat]], [[Tun Sardon Jubir]] and [[Ahmad Ibrahim (Singapore)|Ahmad Ibrahim]] and contributed articles on the [[Malay people|Malays]] and their plight to Warta Malaya, a leading Malay newspaper in Singapore. This was done through his brother Yusof who was already working as a journalist.

==Career==

===Colonial officer===
Upon completing his Senior Cambridge, Aziz joined the colonial service in the Fisheries Department-based initially in [[Port Dickson]] in 1936, followed by [[Kuantan]] and then Batu Kurau where he was responsible for the northern region.

In [[Kuantan]], his sympathy for the Malay fishermen did not go down well with officials, notably the English district officer, while in Kuala Kurau his immediate boss wanted him to read books on fisheries only and not literary works.

===Journalism===
Frustrated with British officialdom and after being unfairly accused of collaborating with the Japanese by his European boss (who was humiliated by the Japanese during 1942–45 and imprisoned in [[Changi]]), Aziz left the colonial service to join his brother [[Yusof Ishak]] after he founded [[Utusan Melayu]].

It was through journalism that Aziz became widely known in [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. He wrote feature articles on [[UMNO]], on the state and federal administrations and occasionally editorials.

Aziz was a member of the KMM while he was a fisheries officer in Kuala Kurau. In 1946, he and Abdul Samad Ismail formed Gerakan Angkatan Melayu Sedar (Geram), which was refused registration by the colonial authority. It was closely watched by the Special Branch. Geram was critical of the [[Malayan Union]]; it was also critical of [[UMNO]] because of the prominent role of the feudal aristocracy within the movement. Geram died a natural death when Aziz moved to [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 1948 as [[Utusan Melayu]] correspondent in the central region.

Aziz was the only journalist who was appointed a member of the Federal Legislative Council and he played an active role in its proceedings. In September 1951, he urged the government to declare an end to the Emergency.

==Political involvement==
Aziz's political involvement was varied. Before 1942, he was a member of the KMM and after 1945 sympathised with the PKMM. However, in 1950 he joined [[UMNO]] when it was still led by Datuk [[Onn Jaafar]] although his idea of full independence for [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] at this time was neither acceptable to Onn nor the [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]].

When the Independence of Malaya Party was formed in 1951 by Onn, Aziz became deputy chairman of the IMP's [[Kuala Lumpur]] branch and contested the 1952 elections in [[Sentul, Kuala Lumpur|Sentul]] but lost to the Alliance candidate.

In the same year, he left the IMP due to personal differences with Onn. Upon the Tunku's encouragement, he rejoined [[UMNO]] in April 1953. Aziz then held important positions within Umno and the Alliance. In 1953, he was appointed to the Alliance Round Table Conference that called for an early general election in Malaya.

In 1955, he was appointed head of Selangor [[UMNO]] and chairman of the Selangor [[Barisan Nasional|Alliance]]. He was very much involved in drafting the 1955 Alliance manifesto for the general election held that year; the manifesto covered issues such as [[Malay language]], agriculture, economy, education, and finance.

In the elections, he stood on the Alliance ticket and won in [[Kuala Langat]]. He faced a Parti Negara candidate, a former schoolmate. Despite official backing for Parti Negara, including from the colonial police force, the Alliance went on to win the first national elections, taking 51 of the 52 seats.

Earlier in September 1954, Aziz had campaigned actively with the Tunku in the [[Terengganu]] election which was won by the Alliance despite open support for Parti Negara by the British.

==Cabinet position==
Aziz was appointed Minister of Agriculture and co-operatives, a post he kept until 1963. [[Tun Abdul Razak]] took note of Aziz's useful work among the rural folk, especially the setting up of co-operatives to eliminate the exploitation by middlemen.

The year 1955 saw a growing rift between Aziz with his Cabinet colleagues, notably the Tunku and Abdul Razak who was overall in charge of rural development. Aziz's blunt criticisms of ministers, such as the wearing of uniforms, did not endear him well with the Tunku. He was also unhappy at the Alliance's neglect of the 1955 manifesto due to the exuberant push for political independence.

In his memoirs, Aziz claimed that the 1955 Cabinet was beset with policy differences on various issues, including the replacement of expatriate British officers with Malayans or Malayanisation. Aziz was equally passionate on press freedom that he claimed had been eroded after 1955.

Aziz resigned from the Cabinet in 1963 after he was transferred to the Health Ministry. This was due to irreconcilable differences with the Tunku and other Cabinet colleagues on strategies for rural development.&lt;ref name=weiss&gt;Weiss, Meredith Leigh: "Protest and Possibilities: Civil Society and Coalitions for Political Change in Malaysia", Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8047-5295-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no place for a socialist in a Cabinet that was pursuing capitalistic policies and firmly committed to upholding a free-market economy. Soon after, he was expelled from [[UMNO]].

Aziz eventually went on to form the short lived National Convention Party that joined the left wing [[Malayan Peoples' Socialist Front]] together with the [[Labour Party of Malaya]] and [[Parti Rakyat Malaysia|Partai Ra'ayat]] to contest the [[Malaysian general election, 1964|1964 general elections]].&lt;ref name=weiss/&gt;

==Post-Cabinet==
In 1963, soon after the outbreak of the [[Konfrontasi]] between [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance]] government began yet another massive round up of politicians and activists among the opposition under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]]. Among those arrested and detained were [[Ahmad Boestaman]], [[Ishak Haji Muhammad]], Abdul Aziz Ishak (head of GERAM), Datuk Kampo Radjo (later the president of PRM), Tan Kai Hee, Tan Hock Hin, Dr. Rajakumar, Hasnul Hadi, Tajuddin Kahar and hundreds of others.

Aziz was accused of being a traitor and collaborating with Indonesian agents to form a government-in-exile, a charge that he denied. He was detained between 1965 and 1966 under the law.

In his book ''Special Guest: The Detention in Malaysia of an Ex-Cabinet Minister'' he describes in detail the irreconcilable differences with the Tunku and the events that led to his resignation, subsequent detention and release. The book was banned and only allowed restricted access in university libraries.

His earlier biographical account Katak Keluar dari Bawah Tempurong stopped at 1955 and his subsequent appointment as minister. As a result, not much is known about Aziz Ishak and his role in the struggle for independence through the newspaper Utusan Melayu and in the political arena when he was head of [[Selangor]] [[UMNO]] and Selangor [[Barisan Nasional|Alliance]] in the mid-1950s when the political bargaining among the Alliance partners were struck.

He turned down all subsequent offers of state and federal awards.

'''BIRDEM''', the '''Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for [[Diabetes]], [[Endocrine]] and [[Metabolism|Metabolic]] Disorders''' at [[Shahbag]], [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] is a 600-bed multidisciplinary hospital complex of the [[Diabetic Association of Bangladesh]]. The Hospital was established in 1980 with the financial support of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=BIRDEM|title=BIRDEM - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;In BIRDEM 3,000 patients are treated in the outside department every day. No other hospital in Bangladesh offers so many diabetes patients. According to the Denmark-based multinational pharmaceutical company Novo Nordics Vice President of the Pacific Ocean, Selvam Afsar Tuna, This is the world's largest hospital in treating diabetes. It has been designated as a [[WHO]] Collaborating Centre on Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders, as the only one of its kind in Asia. 

==History==
The late national professor [[Muhammad Ibrahim]] is the founder of BIRDEM in 1980. Under his leadership, Bangladesh Diabetic Association (then named Diabetic Association for Pakistan) was formed in February 1956. Bangladesh Diabetic Association are nine separate organizations. These are the BIRDEM (Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders), Rehabilitation and Vocational Training Center, National Healthcare Network, Ibrahim Cardiac Hospital and Research Center, [[Ibrahim Medical College]], Bangladesh Institute of Health Sciences, BIRDEM Nursing College, Bangladesh University of Health Sciences and Healthcare Development Project.  Professor Muhammad Ibrahim proposed a chamber of the lower house of his home in Segunbagicha, [[Dhaka]] to use the Association. In the home, he started the outdoor department for diabetes. First of all, there was a free medical treatment. During the [[East Pakistan|Pakistan]] period, the Samity was given some land for the hospital in Segunbagicha. The hospital was inaugurated in 1980 at Shahbagh. In 2013 BIRDEM-2 hospital was started in Segunbagicha. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/article/1343446/ The Daily Prothom Alo]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria''' (BFPP) is a genetic disorder with [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance that causes a cortical malformation. Our brain has folds in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] to increase surface area called [[Gyrus|gyri]] and patients with polymicrogyri have an increase number of folds and smaller folds than usual.&lt;ref&gt;"Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria (BFPP)." Welcome to the Research View. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.neuroscienceandgenetics.it/syndrome/bilateral-frontoparietal-polymicrogyria-bfpp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Polymicrogyria is defined as a cerebral malformation of cortical development in which the normal gyral pattern of the surface of the brain is replaced by an excessive number of small, fused gyri separated by shallow [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] and abnormal cortical lamination. From ongoing research, mutation in GPR56, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, results in BFPP. These mutations are located in different regions of the protein without any evidence of a relationship between the position of the mutation and phenotypic severity.&lt;ref&gt;Bahi-Buisson, N., K. Poirier, N. Boddaert, C. Fallet-Bianco, N. Specchio, E. Bertini, O. Caglayan, K. Lascelles, C. Elie, J. Rambaud, M. Baulac, I. An, P. Dias, V. Des Portes, M. L. Moutard, C. Soufflet, M. El Maleh, C.

The GPR56 is grouped in the B family of GPCRs. This GPCR group have long N termini characterized by an extracellular “cysteine box” and hydrophilic, potentially [[mucin]]-rich. The cysteine box contains four conserved [[cysteine]]s and two [[tryptophan]]s arranged in a specific fashion (C-x2-W-x6-16-W-x4-C-x10-22-C-x-C) just before the first transmembrane domain and serves as a cleavage site in some members of this group of G protein–coupled receptors.&lt;ref&gt;Piao, X., Chang, B.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnostic criteria for a BFPP patient entails a [[heterozygous]] genotype for a deletion of chromosome 16q12.1-q21 region,
including GPR56 gene.&lt;ref&gt;Borgatti, Renato, Susan Marelli, Laura Bernardini, Antonio Novelli, Anna Cavallini, Alessandra Tonelli, Maria Teresa Bassi, and Bruno Dallapiccola. "Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria (BFPP) Syndrome Secondary to a 16q12.1-q21 Chromosome Deletion Involving GPR56 Gene." Clinical Genetics 79 (2009): 573-76. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To date the only gene known to be associated with polymicrogyria is GPR56. Testing for GPR56-related bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria is available clinically. Mutations in GPR56 hinders Collagen III, its specific [[ligand]], to bind in a developing brain. To date, a total of fourteen BFPP-associated mutations have been identified, including one deletion, two splicing, and eleven [[missense mutation]]s. Two mutations in the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) domain, C346S and W349S, cause a brain malformation through trapping the mutated proteins in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer K, Luo R, Jeong S, Piao X.

GPR56 are a part of the B class of the [[GPCR]] family, the largest cell surface gene family in the human [[genome]]. Within this family there are different types of bio-active molecules that transduce their signal to the [[intracellular]] compartment via interaction with this type of receptor. Children often present with developmental delay, spasticity, or seizures; they are also often [[microcephalic]]. Some patients with polymicrogyria go undiagnosed until they produce children with the disorder who have more severe manifestations. Retrospectively, these patients will often report some difficulty in their medical or educational history.&lt;ref&gt;"Polymicrogyria." MedLink. N.p., 1 May 2011. Web. 28 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.medlink.com/medlinkcontent.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; BFPP patients demonstrate mental retardation, language impairment, motor developmental delay, and seizure disorders such as epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Jeong, S.-J., Luo, R., Li, S., Strokes, N. and Piao, X. (2012), Characterization of G protein-coupled receptor 56 protein expression in the mouse developing neocortex. J. Comp. Neurol., 520: 2930–2940. doi: 10.1002/cne.23076&lt;/ref&gt; The association of epilepsy is in approximately 50% to 85% of affected BFPP patients.

The clinical manifestations of polymicrogyria are stable neurologic deficits:

In the '''mildest form''', polymicrogyria is [[unilateral]] with only one small region of the brain involved;  neurologic problems may not be evident.

In '''more severe forms''', focal motor, sensory, visual, or cognitive problems may be present, depending on the location of the brain region affected.

In the '''most severe forms''', polymicrogyria is [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] and generalized, resulting in severe intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, and refractory epilepsy.

Individuals with the milder forms of polymicrogyria survive into adulthood, while those with the most severe forms, such as BFPP, may die at a young age as a result of such complications as seizures or pneumonia.&lt;ref name="chang"/&gt;
The prevalence of isolated polymicrogyria is unknown. Researchers believe that it may be relatively common overall, although BFPP is probably rare.&lt;ref&gt;"Polymicrogyria."

===Methods/tests===
[[File:Polymicrogyria arrows.JPG|thumb|Polymicrogyria arrows|This child presented with seizures. The coronal true inversion recovery sequence shows thickened and disordered cortex in superior frontal and cingulate gyri bilaterally (arrow). There are small convolutions visible at the corticomedullary junction. The appearance is that of cortical dysplasia, with polymicrogyria more likely than pachygyria due to the small convolutions visible. There are also small foci of grey matter signal in the corpus callosum, deep to the dysplastic cortex (double arrows). These probably represent areas of grey matter heterotopia.]]

There are different tests or methods used to determine [[GPR56]] expression or visuals of the brain to analyze the specific sections that are affected. These tests for example, using animals such as mice, [[RNAi]], Behavioral assay, Electron microscopy, CT scan, or MRI demonstrate different results that concludes an affected BFPP patient.&lt;ref&gt;Koirala, S., Z. Jin, X. Piao, and G. Corfas. "GPR56-Regulated Granule Cell Adhesion Is Essential for Rostral Cerebellar Development." Journal of Neuroscience 29.23 (2009): 7439-449&lt;/ref&gt; MRI's reveal either irregularity to the cortical surface suggestive of multiple small folds or an irregular, scalloped appearance of the gray matter-white matter junction.

'''Neuroimaging''' The diagnosis of [[polymicrogyria]] is typically made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since computed tomography (CT) and other imaging methods generally do not have high enough [[Image resolution|resolution]] or adequate contrast to identify the small folds that define the condition.  The cerebral cortex often appears abnormally thick as well because the multiple small gyri are fused, infolded, and superimposed in appearance.&lt;ref name="chang"/&gt;

'''Neuropathology''' Gross neuropathologic examination reveals a pattern of complex [[convolution]]s to the cerebral cortex, with miniature gyri fused and superimposed together, often resulting in an irregular brain surface. The cortical ribbon can appear excessively thick as a result of the infolding and fusion of multiple small gyri.&lt;ref name="chang"&gt;Chang B, Walsh CA, Apse K, et al. Polymicrogyria Overview. 2005 Apr 18 [Updated 2007 Aug 6]. In: Pagon RA, Bird TD, Dolan CR, et al., editors. GeneReviews™ [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993-. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1329/&lt;/ref&gt;

Microscopic examination demonstrates that the cerebral cortex is in fact abnormally thin and has abnormal lamination; typically the cortex is unlayered or has four layers, in contrast to the normal six layers. The most superficial layers between adjacent small gyri appear fused, with the pia (layer of the meninges) bridging across multiple gyri. [[Prenatal]] diagnosis for BFPP is also available for pregnancies at risk if the GPR56 mutations have been identified in an affected family member.&lt;ref name="chang"/&gt;

=== Associated conditions ===

BFPP is a cobblestone-like cortical malformation of the brain. Disruptions of cerebral cortical development due to abnormal neuronal migration and positioning usually lead to cortical disorders, which includes '''cobblestone lissencephaly'''. Cobblestone lissencephaly is typically seen in three different human congenital muscular dystrophy syndromes:  '''[[Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy]]''', '''[[Walker-Warburg syndrome]]''', and '''muscle-eye-brain disease'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Dr. Hsi-Hsien. Personal Interview. 29 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;   In cobblestone lissencephaly, the brain surface actually has a bumpy contour caused by the presence of collections of misplaced neurons and [[glial cell]]s that have migrated beyond the normal surface boundaries of the brain. Sometimes regions populated by these misplaced cells have caused a radiologic misdiagnosis of polymicrogyria. However, the presence of other abnormalities in these cobblestone lissencephaly syndromes, including ocular anomalies, congenital muscular dystrophy, [[ventriculomegaly]], and cerebellar dysplasia, usually distinguishes these disorders from polymicrogyria.&lt;ref name="chang"/&gt; There are no anatomopathologic studies that have characterized the pattern of cortical laminar alterations in patients with GPR56 gene mutations, but it has been suggested that the imaging characteristics of BFPP, including [[myelination]] defects and cerebellar cortical [[dysplasia]], are reminiscent of those of the so-called cobblestone malformations (muscle-eye-brain disease and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy) that are also associated with N-glycosylation defects in the developing brain.&lt;ref&gt;Parrini, Elena, Anna Rita Ferrari, Thomas Dorn, Christopher A. Walsh, and Renzo Guerrini. "Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, Andgene Mutations." Epilepsia 50.6 (2009): 1344-353. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lissencephaly''' ("smooth brain") is the extreme form of pachygyria. In lissencephaly, few or no sulci are seen on the cortical surface, resulting in a broad, smooth appearance to the entire brain. Lissencephaly can be radiologically confused with polymicrogyria, particularly with low-resolution imaging, but the smoothness and lack of irregularity in the gray-white junction, along with markedly increased cortical thickness, distinguishes lissencephaly.

GPR56 mutation also can cause a severe encelphalopathy which is associated with electro clinical features of the '''Lennox-Gastaut syndrome'''. [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] can be cryptogenic or symptomatic, but the symptomatic forms have been associated with multiple etiologies and abnormal cortical development. BFPP caused by GPR56 mutations is a representation of a malformation of cortical development that causes Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Parriniy, E., Ferrariz A.R., Dorn T., Walsh C.A., Guerrini, R., Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and GPR56 gene mutations, Epilepsia, Volume 50 Issue 6, Pages 1344–1353, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymicrogyria usually gets misdiagnose with pacygyria so therefore it needs to be distinguished from pachygyria.  '''[[Pachygyria]]''' is a distinct brain malformation in which the surface folds are excessively broad and sparse. Pachygyria and polymicrogyria may look similar on low-resolution neuroimaging such as CT because the cortical thickness can appear to be increased and the gyri can appear to be broad and smooth in both conditions. This is why higher resolution neuroimaging are needed such as an MRI.&lt;ref name="chang"/&gt;

===Mode Of Inheritance===
'''Parents of a proband'''

*The parents of an affected individual are obligate heterozygotes and therefore carry one [[mutant]] allele.
*Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic.

'''Sibs of a proband'''

*At conception, each sibling of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.
*Once an at-risk sibling is known to be unaffected, the risk of his/her being a carrier is 2/3.
*Heterozygotes (carriers) are [[asymptomatic]].

'''Offspring of a proband'''

*Offspring of a proband are obligate heterozygotes and will therefore carry one mutant allele.
*In populations with a high rate of consanguinity, the offspring of a person with GPR56-related BFPP and a reproductive partner who is a carrier of GPR56-related BFPP have a 50% chance of inheriting two GPR56 disease-causing alleles and having BFPP and a 50% chance of being carriers.

'''Other family members of a [[proband]]'''.
*Each sibling of the proband's parents is at a 50% risk of being a carrier&lt;ref name="chang"/&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment plans will vary depending on the severity of the condition and its evidences in each patient.
Areas that will probably need to be evaluated and assessed include speech, vision, hearing and [[EEG]]. Treatment measures may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, Speech therapy, anti-seizure drugs and orthotic devices. Surgery may be needed to assuage spastic motor problems. Various supportive measures such as joint contractures that could prevent complications.
Genetic counseling may also be recommended&lt;ref&gt;Guerrini, R., W. Dobyns, and A. Barkovich. "Abnormal Development of the Human Cerebral Cortex: Genetics, Functional Consequences and Treatment Options." Trends in Neurosciences 31.3 (2008): 154-62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Prognosis==
Once the diagnosis of polymicrogyria has been established in an individual, the following approach can be used for discussion of prognosis:

A pregnancy history should be sought, with particular regard to infections, trauma, multiple gestations, and other documented problems. Screening for the common [[congenital]] infections associated with polymicrogyria with standard TORCH testing may be appropriate. Other specific tests targeting individual neurometabolic disorders can be obtained if clinically suggested.

The following may help in determining a genetic etiology:

'''Family history'''

It is important to ask for the presence of neurologic problems in family members, including seizures, cognitive delay, motor impairment, [[pseudobulbar]] signs, and focal weakness because many affected family members, particularly those who are older, may not have had MRI performed, even if these problems came to medical attention. In addition, although most individuals with polymicrogyria do present with neurologic difficulties in infancy, childhood, or adulthood, those with mild forms may have no obvious deficit or only minor manifestations, such as a simple lisp or isolated learning disability. Therefore, if a familial polymicrogyria syndrome is suspected, it may be reasonable to perform MRI on relatives who are asymptomatic or have what appear to be minor findings. The presence of consanguinity in a child's parents may suggest an autosomal recessive familial polymicrogyria syndrome.

'''Physical examination'''

A general physical examination of the proband may identify associated [[craniofacial]], musculoskeletal, or [[visceral]] malformations that could indicate a particular syndrome. Neurologic examination should assess cognitive and mental abilities, cranial nerve function, motor function, deep tendon reflexes, sensory function, coordination, and gait (if appropriate).&lt;ref name="chang"/&gt;

'''Genetic testing'''

=== Anatomy/physical characteristics ===
[[File:Brain-disease-gyrification.png|thumb|right|Brain-disease-gyrification|Left:Normal Middle:polymicrgyria Right:Lissencephaly]]
*Numerous gyrus on the cortex
*Small gyri and sulci
*Thin cortex
*'''Symptoms''': Developmental delay, [[Psychomotor learning|Psychomotor]] delay, Mental retardation - moderate to severe, Exaggerated reflexes and Seizures (epilepsy)
*'''Radiological findings''' (MRI) demonstrated symmetric generalized polymicrogyria with decreasing anterior-posterior gradient, most prominent in frontoparietal cortex.&lt;ref name="chang"/&gt;

'''Blinky Palermo''' (2 June 1943 &amp;ndash; 18 February 1977) was a German abstract painter.

==Early life and education==
Palermo was born '''Peter Schwarze''' in [[Leipzig]], Germany, in 1943, and adopted as an infant, with his twin brother, Michael, by foster parents named Heisterkamp. He adopted his outlandish name in 1964, during his studies with Bruno Goller and [[Joseph Beuys]] at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]] between 1962 and 1967. The name refers to [[Frank Palermo|Frank "Blinky" Palermo]], an [[United States|American]] [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafioso]] and boxing promoter who managed [[Sonny Liston]].&lt;ref name=dia-bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diaart.org/exhibitions/artistbio/105| title=Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964–1977 &gt; Artist Biography| publisher= [[Dia Art Foundation]] | accessdate= December 14, 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620120731/http://diaart.org/exhibitions/artistbio/105 | archivedate= June 20, 2010| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Palermo moved to [[Mönchengladbach]] and set up a studio he would share with [[Imi Knoebel]] and [[Ulrich Rückriem]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} After a stay in New York in the early 1970s, he moved into [[Gerhard Richter]]'s former Düsseldorf studio.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Blinky Palermo died in 1977, aged 33, during a trip&lt;ref name=groveartonline /&gt; to the [[Maldives]], of causes that often are referred to as "mysterious" but widely acknowledged as related to Palermo's drug use.&lt;ref name=wapo-02-25-211&gt;{{cite news |first=Lavanya |last=Ramanathan |date=February 25, 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/23/AR2011022307957.html |title=Blinky Palermo exhibit hits the Hirshhorn |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZDAUKo75?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/23/AR2011022307957.html |archivedate=June 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Michael Heisterkamp is the sole heir and owner of the copyright of Palermo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Dirk | last= Richerdt | date= October 25, 2011 | url = http://www.rp-online.de/niederrhein-sued/moenchengladbach/nachrichten/palermos-zwillingsbruder-1.2526040 | title = Palermos Zwillingsbruder / Palermo's Twin Brother | work = [[Rheinische Post]] | quote = Michael Heisterkamp ist Alleinerbe und Inhaber des Urheberrechts von Palermo. / Michael Heisterkamp is the sole heir and owner of the copyright of Palermo. | accessdate= December 14, 2014| archivedate=December 14, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214181255/http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/moenchengladbach/palermos-zwillingsbruder-aid-1.2526040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Palermo was best known for his spare monochromatic canvases and "fabric paintings" made from simple lengths of colored material cut, stitched and stretched over a frame. He painted on aluminum, steel, wood, paper and Formica, often making lines out of tape instead of paint.

Under Beuys, he became increasingly interested in the organized spatial relationship between form and colour, a polarity which is manifest throughout the rest of his oeuvre. In the mid 1960s, Palermo moved away from conventional rectangular canvases and increasingly opted for surfaces such as the circle, triangle, cruciform, totem pole and even the interior walls of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lance |last=Esplund |date=July 5, 2011| url = https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303936704576397912937413054 |title=Contradictions, Equivocations| work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate= December 14, 2014| archivedate= December 14, 2014| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141214170806/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303936704576397912937413054 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Untitled (Totem)'' (1964) "...is simply a vertical strip of wood, 7 feet by about 2 inches.

Between late 1966 and 1972 he produced a series of circa 65 ''Stoffbilder (Fabric Paintings)'', consisting of colored materials of different widths sewn together along horizontal or vertical seams and attached to stretchers. He took the colour and material quality ready-made from department-store fabrics and had them stitched together by others.&lt;ref name=groveartonline&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4474 | title= The Collection: Blinky Palermo (German, 1943-1977) | first= Walter| last= Litt | publisher= Grove Art Online ([[Oxford University Press]]) via the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City| accessdate= December 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, he and [[Gerhard Richter]] jointly submitted designs for the sports facilities for the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in Munich. For the front of the arena, they proposed an array of glass windows in 27 colors; each color would appear 50 times, with the distribution determined randomly.

Beginning in 1968, Palermo realized more than 20 murals and wall drawings at various sites in Europe, including Edinburgh and Brussels, and recorded them in preparatory sketches and photographic documentation. The original work, however, having been affiliated with their place of installation, no longer exist.&lt;ref name=dia2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diaart.org/exhibitions/introduction/92 |title=Blinky Palermo: Long-term view |first=Anne |last=Rorimer |publisher=Dia Art Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620144725/http://diaart.org/exhibitions/introduction/92 |archivedate=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This is an archive link, and formatted without the original link since that original URL now goes to a different page--&gt; His ''Times of the Day I-IV'' consists of square, aluminum panels painted in  colors arranged from bright to dark, a metaphor for the change sunlight through the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diaart.org/exhibitions/introduction/92 |title=Blinky Palermo: On view through June 29, 2015 |publisher=Dia Art Foundation |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |archivedate=July 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707041519/http://diaart.org/exhibitions/introduction/92 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He often outlined the shapes of some of the walls in a given room or filled them in with a different color, leaving only a border of the original white.&lt;ref name=thenation-barry&gt;{{cite news| first=Barry| last=Schwabsky| date=December 16, 2010| url=http://www.thenation.com/article/157171/options-open-kurt-schwitters-and-blinky-palermo?page=0,0| title=Options Open: On Kurt Schwitters and Blinky Palermo| work=[[The Nation (magazine)|The Nation]]| archivedate=October 14, 2012| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014044838/http://www.thenation.com/article/157171/options-open-kurt-schwitters-and-blinky-palermo?page=0%2C0| deadurl=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of “Metallbilder” (Metal Pictures) followed in 1972, a series of acrylic paintings on steel or aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/current-exhibitions/?key=21&amp;subkey=477#collection=current-exhibitions&amp;detail=http%3A//www.hirshhorn.si.edu/bio/hirshhorn-presents-blinky-palermo-retrospective-1964-1977/ | title= Hirshhorn Presents "Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964-1977| date=January 27, 2011|publisher= [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] | accessdate= December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--link appears unarchivable at Archive.org and Webcitation.org--&gt; They follow a consistent formula: groupings of, usually, four panels, fairly widely separated, with each panel bearing a single main acrylic color area bracketed by bands of one other color at the top and the bottom.&lt;ref name=thenation-barry /&gt;

After visiting New York with [[Gerhard Richter]] in 1970, he moved his practice to [[New York City]] in December 1973. Once back in [[Düsseldorf]] he produced ''To the People of New York City'' (1976), a 15-part work comprising 39  aluminum panels painted in variations of cadmium red, cadmium yellow, and black — the colors of the West and East German flags (and now the German one) - ever changing in pattern. It was shown at the [[Heiner Friedrich]] Gallery, New York, in 1977, and at the [[Dia Art Foundation]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=dia2010 /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Palermo's first solo show was held in 1966 at Galerie Friedrich+Dahlem in [[Munich]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He further participated in more than 70 exhibitions, including at [[documenta]] in 1972 and 1977,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and at the 13th [[São Paulo Art Biennial|Bienal de São Paulo]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=dia-bio /&gt; In 1976, his work ''Himmelsrichtungen'' was shown at the [[Venice Biennale]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1987, Dia inaugurated its exhibition space in Chelsea with major shows of works by Palermo, Beuys, and Knoebel. Palermo has also had posthumous retrospectives at the [[Kunstmuseum Winterthur]] (1984); [[Kunstmuseum Bonn]] (1993); [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art|Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona]], in co-production with the [[Serpentine Gallery]], London (2002–2003); and the [[Kunsthalle Düsseldorf]] (2007). In 2010, the [[Dia Art Foundation]] and the [[Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture]] at [[Bard College]] presented a joint retrospective, the first in the United States, of works by Palermo. The show was financed mostly with a $250,000 grant from [[Gucci]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Carol|last= Vogel |date=February 25, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/arts/design/26vogel.html |title=Blinky Palermo’s American Tour | work=The New York Times | accessdate= December 14, 2014| archivedate= March 4, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100304020255/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/arts/design/26vogel.html | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also travelled to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in Washington. In 2013, the [[David Zwirner Gallery]] organized an exhibition of Palermo's works on paper from 1976-1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibition/palermo/ |title=Palermo: Works on Paper 1976-1977, April 25 - June 29, 2013| publisher = [[David Zwirner Gallery]]| accessdate= December 14, 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140410085830/http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibition/palermo/ | archivedate= April 10, 2014| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Public collections holding major works by Palermo include the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York,&lt;ref name=groveartonline /&gt; the [[Tate Gallery]] in London,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and the [[Dia Art Foundation]].&lt;ref name=dia-bio /&gt;  Most of the artist's work, however, remains in the possession of private collectors and museums in Europe.&lt;ref name=wapo-02-25-211 /&gt;

==Art market==
Palermo's auction record is held by ''Untitled (Stoffbild)'' (1967–69), a large square panel of cotton fabric on burlap, painted with two bands of solid color of uneven height, respectively dark blue and turquoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Souren |last=Melikian |date=February 11, 2010| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/arts/12iht-melik12.html |title=A Great Night for Sotheby’s Contemporary Art Auction| work=The New York Times| accessdate= December 14, 2014| archivedate=February 18, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100218032901/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/arts/12iht-melik12.html | deadurl =no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auctioned from the collection of Gerhard and Anna Lenz at [[Sotheby's]] London in 2010, it sold for £1.11 million.&lt;ref name=sothebys-stoffbild /&gt;

==Influence==
''The Unexpected Death of Blinky Palermo in the Tropics'' became the title of a painting by [[Julian Schnabel]], now part of the collection of the [[Stedelijk Museum]]. In 1993, it was damaged during a rainstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlise |last=Simons |date=January 21, 1993 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/21/news/rain-soaks-us-art-in-amsterdam.html |title= Rain Soaks U.S. Art in Amsterdam| work=The New York Times| accessdate= December 14, 2014| archivedate = June 2, 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200555/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/21/news/rain-soaks-us-art-in-amsterdam.html |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cerebellar abiotrophy''' (CA), also referred to as  the '''cerebellar cortical abiotrophy''' (CCA), is a [[Genetics|genetic]]  [[neurology|neurological]] disease in animals best known to affect certain breeds of [[horse]]s, [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. It can also develop in humans. It develops when the [[neuron]]s known as [[Purkinje cell]]s, located in the [[cerebellum]] of the [[brain]], begin to die off.  These cells affect balance and coordination. They have a critical role to play in the brain.  The [[Cerebellum#Purkinje layer|Purkinje layer]] allows communication between the [[Cerebellum#Cortical layers|granular and molecular cortical layers]] in the cerebellum. Put simply, without Purkinje cells, an animal loses its sense of space and distance, making balance and coordination difficult.  People with damage to the cerebellum can experience symptoms like unsteady gait, poor muscle control, and trouble speaking or swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/cerebellar_degeneration/cerebellar_degeneration.htm NINDS Cerebellar Degeneration Information Page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218075325/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/cerebellar_degeneration/cerebellar_degeneration.htm# |date=2015-02-18 }}, ''National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke'', accessed May 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''Abiotrophy'' means the loss of a vital [[nutrition|nutritive]] factor.  The exact cause of cerebellar abiotrophy is not known, but it is thought to be due to an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] metabolic defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sandy J, Slocombe R, Mitten R, Jedwab D |title=Cerebellar abiotrophy in a family of Border Collie dogs |journal=Vet. Pathol. |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=736–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12450206 |doi=10.1354/vp.39-6-736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the [[Purkinje cell|Purkinje neurons]] begin to die off shortly after the animal is born and the condition is noticeable when the animal is less than six months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms is gradual and the animal is much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.

CA cannot be prevented, other than by selective breeding to avoid the gene, and it cannot be cured.  Genetic testing can detect carriers.  In addition to dogs and horses, there also have been cases of cerebellar abiotrophy in [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] and [[Domestic shorthair]] [[cat]]s; in [[Angus cattle|Angus]], [[Polled Hereford]], [[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] and [[Holstein (cattle)|Holstein Friesian]] [[cattle]]; [[Merino]] and [[Wiltshire Horn|Wiltshire]] [[sheep]]; and [[American Yorkshire pig|Yorkshire]] [[pig]]s.

==Terminology==
{{see also|Cerebellar hypoplasia (non-human)}}
The condition in [[Kerry Blue Terrier]]s is sometimes called ''progressive neuronal abiotrophy'' (PNA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uskbtc.com/article.php/63 Breed Information: Kerry Health] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115130247/http://www.uskbtc.com/article.php/63 |date=January 15, 2012 }}, ''United States Kerry Blue Terrier Club'', accessed November 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Other terms used to describe the condition in dogs include cerebellar cortical atrophy and postnatal cerebellar cortical degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vetsci.usyd.edu.au/lida/index.php?Pg=7&amp;DName=Cerebellar+abiotrophy&amp;DID=476&amp;Op=2 |author=Aitken, Sarah |title=Listing of Inherited Disorders in Animals; Disorder: Cerebellar abiotrophy |publisher=University of Sydney |accessdate=March 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210181711/http://www.vetsci.usyd.edu.au/lida/index.php?Pg=7&amp;DName=Cerebellar+abiotrophy&amp;DID=476&amp;Op=2 |archivedate=2008-12-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerebellar abiotrophy in horses was originally thought to be a form of [[cerebellar hypoplasia (non-human)|cerebellar hypoplasia]] and was described as such in older research literature.  However, it was discovered that in horses, the die-off of purkinje cells began after the animal was born, rather than occurring ''[[in utero]].''  Cerebellar hypoplasia is particularly common in [[cat]]s and has similar symptoms.

There are other diseases that lead to cerebellar degeneration, but the loss of Purkinje cells is a clear way to diagnose CA, and the combination of symptoms is sufficiently unique that CA can easily be distinguished from other conditions, even in a living animal.

==Clinical Signs==
Symptoms of cerebellar abiotrophy include [[ataxia]] or lack of balance, an awkward wide-legged stance, a head tremor (intention tremor) (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping [[horse gait|gait]], coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing or trying to walk with a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out. Verifying the diagnosis in a laboratory setting is possible only by examining the [[brain]] [[post-mortem]] to determine if there has been a loss of Purkinje cells.&lt;ref name=UCD&gt;[http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/genomic/cerebellar/ Cerebellar Abiotrophy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most affected animals have normal intelligence and mildly affected animals can, in theory, live out a normal lifespan. However, affected animals are quite accident-prone, and for this reason many animals that develop CA, particularly horses, are euthanized for humane reasons.  Horses may experience difficulty stepping up and over objects, run into fences, fall easily, and even if allowed to mature to full growth, are generally considered unsafe to ride. Dogs may need lifetime assistance with tasks such as climbing stairs.&lt;ref name=UCD/&gt;

In horses, the symptoms may worsen from the time of onset for six to 12 months, but if not severe enough to mandate euthansia, they stabilize over time. In some dog breeds, symptoms appear to progressively worsen, but research is not consistent on this point.  There also is some evidence that affected animals partially compensate for the condition by cognitively learning alternative methods for moving or to determine distance, and thus appear to improve because they become less accident-prone.

==Horses==
Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA) is best known as a condition affecting [[Arabian horse]]s.  It has also been observed in the [[Curly horse]],&lt;ref name=Brault2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.2010.00349.x | volume=43 | title=The frequency of the equine cerebellar abiotrophy mutation in non-Arabian horse breeds | journal=Equine Veterinary Journal | pages=727–731 | author=Brault L. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miniature horse]], the [[Gotland Pony]], one [[Eriskay Pony]], and possibly the [[Oldenburg (horse)|Oldenburg]].  Most foals appear normal at birth, with symptoms noticeable at an average age of four months, though there have been cases where the condition is first seen shortly after birth and other cases where symptoms are first recognized in horses over one year of age.

Breeds DNA tested that reveal some carrier lines, but to date no affected animals, include the [[Welsh pony]] and the [[Trakehner]]. However, other breeds heavily influenced by Arabian breeding, such as the [[Thoroughbred]] and the [[American Saddlebred]], do not appear to carry the mutation.&lt;ref name=Brault2011/&gt;

In horses, CA is believed to be linked to an [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive gene]].  This means it is not sex-linked, and the allele has to be carried and passed on by both parents in order for an affected animal to be born. Horses that only carry one copy of the gene may pass it on to their offspring, but themselves are perfectly healthy—without symptoms of the disease.  Because it is recessive, the allele for CA may pass through multiple generations before it is expressed.

CA is sometimes misdiagnosed.  Though the symptoms are quite distinguishable from other [[neurologic]]al conditions, it has been confused with [[Wobbler disease|Wobbler's syndrome]], [[Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis]] (EPM), and injury-related problems such as a [[concussion]].

A DNA test which identifies markers associated with cerebellar abiotrophy became available in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=17589 Larson, Erica. "Researcher: Genetic Mutation Likely the Cause of Neurologic Disorder" ''The Horse'' online edition, January 23 2011, Article # 17589.]  Accessed February 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The test  was refined to identify the most likely mutations, and retesting of earlier samples based on an earlier indirect marker test developed by UCD,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=12746&amp;nID=17&amp;src=RA Johnson, Robert S. "Test Allows Arabian Breeders to Scan for Inherited Neurologic Disorder" ''The Horse'' online edition, September 23 2008, Article # 12746.]  Accessed September 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; indicated a 97% accuracy rate for the old test relative to the newer version, with no false negatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/genetic/docs/11Genetic_Cerebellar_Abiotrophy_Update_Revised.pdf "Update on Sample Retesting"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516172306/http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/genetic/docs/11Genetic_Cerebellar_Abiotrophy_Update_Revised.pdf |date=May 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causative mutation was identified in 2011.&lt;ref name="Brault"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brault|first1=Leah S.|last2=Cooper|first2=Caitlin A.|last3=Famula|first3=Thomas R. |last4=Murray |first4=James D. |last5=Penedo |first5=M.

Researchers working on this problem include Dr. Cecilia Penedo, PhD, and Leah Brault, PhD.   The late Dr. [[Ann T. Bowling]] made significant early contributions to the [[genetics]] research on CA.

==Dogs==
CA has been seen in the [[Australian Kelpie]], [[Gordon Setter]], [[Border Collie]], [[Labrador Retriever]], [[Airedale]], [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]], [[Scottish Terrier]], [[Kerry Blue Terrier]], [[Miniature Schnauzer]], [[Lagotto Romagnolo]], and other [[dog]] breeds.  Time of onset varies. In a few breeds, such as the [[Beagle]], [[Rough Collie]], and [[Miniature Poodle]], Purkinje cells begin to die off at or shortly before birth, and pups are born with symptoms or develop symptoms by three to four weeks of age.&lt;ref name=Berry&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berry M, Blas-Machado U |title=Cerebellar abiotrophy in a miniature schnauzer |journal=Can. Vet. J. |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=657–9 |year=2003 |pmid=13677598 |pmc=340240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most breeds prone to the condition, such as the Kerry Blue Terrier, Border Collie, Australian Kelpie, and Labrador Retriever, begin showing symptoms between six and sixteen weeks of age.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; In a very few breeds, such as the [[American Staffordshire Terrier]], [[Old English Sheepdog]], [[Brittany Spaniel]], and Gordon Setter, symptoms do not appear until adulthood or even middle age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buijtels J, Kroeze E, Voorhout G, Schellens C, van Nes J |title=Cerebellar cortical degeneration in an American Staffordshire terrier |journal=Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde |volume=131 |issue=14–15 |pages=518–22 |year=2006 |pmid=16916197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In dogs, CA is also usually an autosomal recessive gene, but in a few breeds, such as the [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]], the gene is [[sex linkage|sex-linked]].

__TOC__

==History of concept==

In the book, ''Circle of Poison: Pesticides and People in a Hungry World'', [[David Weir (journalist)|David Weir]] and Mark Schapiro of the Oakland-based [[Center for Investigative Reporting]] present an investigative study of how certain dangerous chemicals, which are banned in the U.S., still enter back into the United States and the American diet through food imports. Many restricted chemicals, especially [[pesticide]]s, are produced in the U.S. and exported to the global south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic and Political Weekly|date=Jan 6, 2011|publisher=Sameeksha Trust|location=1364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RoYAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%27cash+crops%27,+which+are+subsequently+exported+to+the+US+and+other+industrialized+countries+for+high+profit&amp;dq=%27cash+crops%27,+which+are+subsequently+exported+to+the+US+and+other+industrialized+countries+for+high+profit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje-KiD3ILLAhXIPBoKHVp9AWEQ6AEIHDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banned chemicals are then used on '[[cash crop]]s', which are subsequently exported to the U.S. and other industrialized countries for high profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Marie|last2=Holben|first2=David|title=Community Nutrition in Action: An Entrepreneurial Approach|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=9781285401218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbEKAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%27cash+crops%27,+which+are+subsequently+exported+to+the+US+and+other+industrialized+countries+for+high+profit&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigative study done by Wier and Schapiro showed that the highly potent and dangerous chemicals used in domestic agriculture led to a public clamor for strict regulations, and that pesticides contribute to the expansion of an export-oriented agriculture at the expense of food production for local needs. Even where they are applied to food crops, pesticide are often linked to the [[Green Revolution]], which can mean more hunger even while it raises production. Pesticides, they argue, are no solution to hunger-they bypass the needs of the poor who 'have neither money to buy food nor the land to grow it on'. Moreover, they claim because [[agrochemical]] companies are profit driven, they have tailored the regulations to permit unrestricted export of dangerous chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castleman|first1=Barry|title=The export of hazardous industries in 2015|date=January 19, 2016|doi=10.1186/s12940-016-0091-6|pmc=4717658|pmid=26786721|volume=15|journal=Environ Health|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wier and Schapiro argue that this loophole has been a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weir|first1=David|last2=Schapiro|first2=Mark|title=Circle of poison : pesticides and people in a hungry world|date=1987|publisher=Institute for Food and Development Policy|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=9780935028096|page=12|edition=[2nd printing]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circle of Poison Prevention Act of 1991==
In April 1991, the "Circle of Poison prevention Act" was introduced by Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) in the U.S. Senate and by Representatives [[Mike Synar]] (D-OK) and [[Leon Panetta]] (D-CA) in the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.2083 - Circle of Poison Prevention Act of 1991|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/2083|website=Congress.Gov|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill would have placed strict controls on exports of hazardous chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Circle of poison: Impact on American consumers: Hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, United States Senate, One Hundred Second Congress, first session, on improving the safety of exported pesticides, focusing on the health impact of certain pesticides manufactured in the United States on the American consumer, September 20, 1991.|date=1992|publisher=[[U.S. G.P.O.]]|location=Washington|isbn=9780160396700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcq6icqaPRAC&amp;q=Circle+of+Poison+prevention+Act+of+1991&amp;dq=Circle+of+Poison+prevention+Act+of+1991&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXm6Pq14LLAhXI1x4KHV00A9wQ6AEIHDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar legislation passed both houses of Congress but died in [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Circle of poison: impact on American consumers: hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, United States Senate, One Hundred Second Congress, first session, on improving the safety of exported pesticides, focusing on the health impact of certain pesticides manufactured in the United States on the American consumer, September 20, 1991.|date=1992|publisher=U.S. G.P.O.|location=Washington|isbn=9780160396700|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, the "Circle of Poison Prevention Act" would have:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Circle of poison : impact of U.S. pesticides on Third World workers : hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, United States Senate, One Hundred Second Congress, first session, on the impact on Third World workers who use U.S. made pesticides, June 5, 1991.|date=1991|publisher=For sale by U.S. G.P.O., Supt. of Docs., Congressional Sales Office|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780160353253|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7D2qw7PGDwC&amp;q=Circle+of+Poison+Prevention+Act&amp;dq=Circle+of+Poison+Prevention+Act&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij0oqhnYPLAhWCGB4KHVA9BIAQ6AEIHDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prohibited the export of pesticides that were not registered for domestic use; were not registered for food use and would not be exported for use on food; or had had the majority of registration canceled.
* Permitted government to refuse the import of certain hazardous pesticides, including restricted-use pesticides and those which were conditionally registered or were the subject of cancellation proceedings.
* Permitted citizens to file suit against violators to enforce the law.
* Automatically revoked tolerances for pesticide residues on food for pesticides no longer registered in the U.S.
* Required EPA to disseminate information on non-chemical pest control alternatives and sponsored meetings to develop improved strategies for sustainable agriculture, including integrated pest management and the use of non-chemical alternatives.

==Pesticide regulations==

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has the authority to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the United States; before a pesticide can be sold, it must be licensed or registered by the EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) Database|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/maximum-residue-limits-mrl-database|website=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While registration does not constitute "approval" by the EPA, it means that the agency has determined that a pesticide will not cause 'unreasonable adverse effects' on humans or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sass|first1=Jennifer|last2=Wu|first2=Mae|title=Superficial Safeguards: Most Pesticides Are Approved by Flawed EPA Process|url=http://www.nrdc.org/health/pesticides/files/flawed-epa-approval-process-IB.pdf|website=Natural Resources Defense Council|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA may cancel or suspend the registration of a pesticide, if further evidence indicates that its use poses unreasonable hazard. Or it may restrict the uses for which it may be sold to very specific crops and application practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximum Residue Limits|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/maximum-residue-limits-mrl-database|website=United States Department of Agriculture system|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA does not have the authority to prohibit the export of canceled or suspended pesticides; nor may it forbid the export of restricted use pesticides that may be equally hazardous in the hands of untrained applicators or new compounds, which have never been granted registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Setting Tolerances for Pesticide Residues in Foods|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticide-tolerances/setting-tolerances-pesticide-residues-foods|website=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, millions of pounds of pesticides, which have been determined to be unsafe for use in the U.S, are shipped to foreign ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sass|first1=Jennifer|last2=Wu|first2=Mae|title=Superficial Safeguards: Most Pesticides Are Approved by Flawed EPA Process|url=http://www.nrdc.org/health/pesticides/files/flawed-epa-approval-process-IB.pdf|website=Natural Resources Defense Council|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pesticide residue data==
A 2005 summary report of pesticide residue done by the Pesticide Data Program (a program started by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]) showed that out of 10,154 foods tested, fruits and vegetables such as apples and lettuce had the most pesticide residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Summary Calendar Year 2005|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/2005%20PDP%20Annual%20Summary.pdf|website=United States Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal pesticide laws==
The [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] (FIFRA), and the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], are the two major laws responsible for pesticide control in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and are also responsible for the safety of foods containing pesticide residues to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The Secretary has delegated this responsibility to the Food and Drug Administration.

Open to all genders, the ride was founded in 2012 by Mark Hawwa in Sydney, Australia &amp;mdash; inspired by a photo of [[Mad Men]]’s Don Draper on a classic bike in a fine suit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gentlemansride.com/about/style-guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The ride provides an outline of dress and behaviour, suggesting riders wear dapper clothing, silk vests, tweed suits and behave in an affable manner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gentlemansride.com/about/style-guide|title=Style Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The 2016 Distinguished Gentleman's Ride|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested motorcycles for the themed ride include [[café racer]]s, bobbers, classics, modern classics, flat trackers, scramblers, old school choppers, brat styled, classic scooters, and classic sidecars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ride carries no entry fee, and riders are encouraged to raise sponsorship money for prostate cancer research and male suicide prevention on behalf of charity partner The Movember Foundation.

In 2014 [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph Motorcycles]] started to support and sponsor the ride,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triumphmotorcycles.co.uk/news-and-events/news/global/2014/july/distinguished-gentlemans-ride Triumph Motorcycles UK]&lt;/ref&gt; together with Dime City Cycles in 2015 as prize sponsor. In 2016 Zenith Watches joined Triumph Motorcycles as major co-sponsor with Hedon helmets supporting the event as prize sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gentlemansride.com/about/prizes|title=Prizes|website=The 2016 Distinguished Gentleman's Ride|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015 one of the three motorcycles ridden by actor [[Chris Pratt]] in ''[[Jurassic World]]'' was auctioned off, with the profits going to the prostate cancer funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ultimatemotorcycling.com/2015/07/21/chris-pratt-jurassic-world-triumph-scrambler-ebay-auction/  Chris Pratt Jurassic World Triumph Scrambler eBay Auction] Ultimate Motorcycling, 21 July 2015.

A '''drink mix''', or '''powdered drink mix''' is a [[processed-food product]], a powder designed to mix usually with water to produce a beverage resembling fruit juice or soda in flavor. Another type of drink mix is represented by products that must be mixed into milk.

==About==
[[File: Productos de cacao y chocolate en polvo.jpg|thumb|right|Chocolate drink mix products, that must be mixed with milk; in a supermarket in Spain.]]
While some are made with sugar, or sold unsweetened, the products are often made with artificial sweeteners such as [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], [[cyclamates]] or [[saccharin]], and often include [[artificial flavor]]s and colors. Some of the product include vitamins or other nutrients. The products are variously marketed to children, athletes, bodybuilders, dieters, or as a vitamin supplement. Some brands are only sold as drink mixes, while some beverage companies produce powdered versions of their products, as does [[Gatorade]] and [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]]. Another form of drink mix is represented by products mixed into milk, such as [[malted milk]], [[Nesquik]], [[Ovaltine]] and [[Carnation Instant Breakfast]].

==Drink mix brands==
* [[Nesquik (mix)]]
* [[Burple]]
* [[Country Time]]
* [[Crystal Light]] (primarily to female dieters)
* [[Emergen-C]] (vitamin supplement, with sugar or unsweetened)
* [[Flavor Aid]] (primarily marketed to children)
* Funny Face, (primarily marketed to children) a [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] product originally sweetened with [[cyclamate]]s, then with [[saccharin]], then sold as an unsweetened mix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funnyface.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|date=March 2017}}

The '''eHealth Exchange''', formerly known as the ''Nationwide Health Information Network'' often abbreviated as the ''NHIN'' or ''NwHIN'', is an initiative for the exchange of healthcare information. It was developed under the auspices of the U.S. [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]] (ONC),&lt;ref name=what_is_NHIN&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the NHIN?|url=http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/what-Is-the-nhin--2.pdf|website=HealthIT.gov|publisher=Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (US)|accessdate=6 September 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now managed by a non-profit industry coalition called Sequoia Project (formerly HealtheWay).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Us, Our Initiatives and Collaboration|url = http://sequoiaproject.org/about-us/|website = The Sequoia Project|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exchange is a web-services based series of specifications designed to securely exchange healthcare related data. The NwHIN is related to the [[Nationwide Health Information Network#DIRECT|Direct Project]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} which uses a secure email-based approach. One of the latest goals is to increase the amount of [[onboarding]] information about the NwHIN to prospective vendors of health care systems.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology has been facilitating development of the NwHIN, which will tie together health information exchanges, integrated delivery networks, pharmacies, government, labs, providers, payors and other stakeholders into a "network of networks."{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

A health care system participating in the NwHIN acquires an [[Object identifier]] (OID).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The OID, issued by the ONC, allows the individual health care system or vendor to receive and send messages to trusted entities within the NwHIN through an interface such as [[Mirth Connect]] or a custom-built [[Java (software platform)|Java]] [[User interface|UI]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The NwHIN is built on [[Open-source software|open source]] code utilizing the Java platform.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} This creates a need for technical information sharing among [[programmers]] with the ONC also making information available.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

According to former [[Health and Human Services]] [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] [[Mike Leavitt|Michael Leavitt]] the NwHIN would be a public-private venture, and {{as of|2009|lc=y}} the [[Markle Foundation]], [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] and [[California HealthCare Foundation]] were funding research and demonstration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=National Health Information Network News |title=The Business Case: Key Resources |url=http://www.nhinwatch.com/performSearch.cms?channelId%3D6 |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813211557/http://www.nhinwatch.com/performSearch.cms?channelId=6 |archivedate=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NwHIN is funded through the [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]], the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]], the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], the [[Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[Indian Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[[HITECH Act]], Section 3011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
The stakeholders that participate in the NwHIN will be four broad classes of organizations:
*Care delivery organizations (CDOs) that use [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs).
*Consumer organizations that operate [[personal health record]]s (PHRs) and other consumer applications.
*[[Health information exchange]]s (HIEs): multi-stakeholder entities that enable the movement of health-related data within state, regional or non-jurisdictional participant groups.
*Specialized participants: organizations that operate for specific purposes including, but not limited to, secondary users of data such as public health, research and quality assessment. The specialized nature of these organizations means that they may require only a subset of the shared architecture (standards, services and requirements), processes and procedures used by the other participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=United States Department of Health and Human Services|title=Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) Exchange: Architecture Overview, Draft v.0.9|url=http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/nhin-architecture-overview-draft-20100421-1.pdf|website=HealthIT.gov|publisher=Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (US)|date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|9}}

===Health Information Service Providers===
Some organizations may lack the necessary technical or operational competencies to conform to the architecture and provide the core services. Instead, they may choose to use the services of a Health Information Service Provider (HISP). A {{dfn|Health Information Service Provider}} is a company or other organization that will support one or more NwHIN participants by providing them with operational and technical health exchange services necessary to fully qualify to connect to the NwHIN.&lt;ref name="healthit.hhs.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the NHIN? |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=23 July 2009 |format=PDF |url=http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_10741_877368_0_0_18/WhatIsTheNHIN.pdf |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603062542/http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_10741_877368_0_0_18/WhatIsTheNHIN.pdf |archivedate=June 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access process==
The business, trust and technical arrangements that will enable the NwHIN generally will be local and between organizations. Nonetheless, the primary users of the NwHIN will be people: healthcare providers, healthcare consumers and those who use the data in the NwHIN for public health, quality assessment or other purposes. These people will have several ways to take advantage of the information exchange available through the NwHIN.

Access Paths to the System:&lt;ref name="healthit.hhs.gov"/&gt;
*For healthcare providers:
#Providers may use features of the electronic health record (EHR) systems of their own practice or hospital to connect to an HIE, and the HIE, in turn, will support information exchange with other EHRs or PHRs on that HIE or on other HIEs through the NwHIN;
#They may not have an EHR, so they may use the Web to access a portal operated by the HIE to access information.

*For healthcare consumers:
#They may use features of a PHR that they designate as the repository of their personal health record, and that PHR may be connected to an HIE which, in turn, will provide a connection to the NwHIN;
#They may use features of a multi-regional PHR that will participate directly in the NwHIN;
#If they do not have access to a PHR, they may achieve some limited functionality by using the services of an HIE through its portal.

==Related projects==
===CONNECT software===
An open source software package is available that implements the NwHIN architecture from CONNECT. The CONNECT software is the outcome of a 2008 decision by federal agencies to begin work on connecting their health IT systems into the NwHIN. Rather than individually build the software required to make this possible, the federal agencies collaborated through the Federal Health Architecture program to create a single solution that can be reused by each agency within its own environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ‘CONNECTing’ to the Nationwide Health Information Network|url=http://www.connectopensource.org/display/Gateway/About+CONNECT |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007005817/http://www.connectopensource.org/display/Gateway/About+CONNECT |archivedate=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-two Cooperative members, including seven federal agencies using the CONNECT gateway, participated in testing and demonstrations in 2008.&lt;ref name=what_is_NHIN/&gt;

===Direct project===
The Direct project,&lt;ref name="Direct project"&gt;http://wiki.directproject.org&lt;/ref&gt; which has been termed a scaled down version of the NwHIN,{{By whom|date=September 2016}} allows two trusted entities (for instance, a physician and a referred specialist) to share medical records.&lt;ref name=directOverview&gt;{{cite web |title=The Direct Project Overview |date=11 October 2010 |website=The Direct Project |format=PDF |url=http://wiki.directproject.org/file/view/DirectProjectOverview.pdf |access-date=16 September 2016 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kZ0BzCdZ?url=http://wiki.directproject.org/file/view/DirectProjectOverview.pdf |archive-date=2016-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} In this way, the patient's electronic record could be viewed by two trusted entities. These entities may not have access to the NwHIN in a product like the CONNECT software.&lt;ref name=directOverview/&gt;{{rp|9}} However, they would have a trusted email address issued by the ONC.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Future direction==
The NwHIN, as an operational entity, is moving from public (ONC-backed) operations, to a non-profit public-private structure.  Under this model, the ONC will maintain overall responsibility for the governance of the NwHIN.&lt;ref name=what_is_NHIN/&gt; and the NwHIN operational entity will be known as the eHealth Exchange which will be facilitated by the non-profit Sequoia Project (formerly Healtheway), Inc. a membership-based corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Sequoia Project|url = http://healthewayinc.org|website = The Sequoia Project|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes consist of recurrent attacks of uncontrollable rage, usually after minimal provocation, and may last up to an hour. Following an episode, children are frequently exhausted, may sleep and will usually have no recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McTague |first1=A. |last2=Appleton |first2=R. |title=Episodic dyscontrol syndrome |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=1 June 2010 |volume=95 |issue=10 |pages=841–842 |doi=10.1136/adc.2009.171850 |url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/1828696754?pq-origsite=summon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Cause==
{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}
== Treatment ==
Treatment for EDS usually involves treating the underlying causative factor(s).  This may involve [[psychotherapy]], or medical treatment for diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McTague |first1=A. |last2=Appleton |first2=R. |title=Episodic dyscontrol syndrome |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=1 June 2010 |volume=95 |issue=10 |pages=841–842 |doi=10.1136/adc.2009.171850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDS has been successfully controlled in [[clinical trial]]s using prescribed medications, including [[Carbamazepine]],&lt;ref&gt;Tunks ER, Dermer SW. (1977) Carbamazepine in the dyscontrol syndrome associated with limbic system dysfunction. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 164: 56–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewin J, Sumners D. (1992) Successful treatment of episodic dyscontrol with carbamazepine. British Journal of Psychiatry 161: 261–2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethosuximide]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrulonis PA, Donnelly J, Glueck BC, Stroebel CF, Szarek BL. (1990) Preliminary data on ethosuximide and the episodic dyscontrol syndrome. American Journal of Psychiatry 137: 1455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Propranolol]].&lt;ref&gt;Grizenko N, Vida S. (1988) Propranolol treatment of episodic dyscontrol and aggressive behaviour in children. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 33: 776–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been few randomised controlled trials of treatment of EDS(Episodic dyscontrol syndrome)/IED(intermittent explosive disorder). Antidepressants and mood-stabilisers including lithium, sodium valproate and carbamazepine have been used in adults, and occasionally in children with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder to reduce aggression. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in the treatment of anger. A recent trial randomised adults with IED to 12 weeks of individual therapy, group therapy or waiting list (no therapy). Intervention resulted in an improvement in anger and aggression levels, with no difference between group and individual CBT(Cognitive behavioural therapy). Adolescents and young adults may experience educational and social consequences but also mental health problems, including parasuicide, if IED/EDS is undiagnosed in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McTague |first1=A. |last2=Appleton |first2=R. |title=Episodic dyscontrol syndrome |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=1 June 2010 |volume=95 |issue=10 |pages=841–842 |doi=10.1136/adc.2009.171850 |url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/1828696754?pq-origsite=summon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Union policy for disabled people''' guarantees governmental responsibility for all disabled people in all of  [[European Union|EU's]] member states. This policy operates in the framework of the [[subsidiarity]] principle: if possible, one should improve at the national level, though in principle the EU will refrain from setting hefty laws in this area. Through the activities of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[United Nations]], the EU disability policy has since been in effect in many EU countries for years.

==Background==
During [[World War I]], the disability protection system in Europe covered only war veterans and soldiers, based on the conviction that people are owed this protection  when they have sacrificed for their country. This principle is also referred to in terms of a [[Quid pro quo]] duty, as the soldiers should receive something in exchange for their service.

After [[World War II]], attitudes changed towards disability, in part because of the millions of people injured in its aftermath. Furthermore, there existed a high level of unemployment among the disabled throughout Europe. Therefore, after 1945, European states responded to this situation by forcing employers to recruit disabled veterans and this policy was later extended to cover disabled civilians.

==European legislation for disabled people==
From the beginning of the [[European Community]], the process of lawmaking within the union was subject to the conventions and declarations of the United Nations. Eventually, the EC made its own laws regarding disabled people. Below is a timeline of legislation regarding disabled people established by the EU, or through its predecessor bodies, split into two periods, from 1945-1992 and from 1992-present. The first period guaranteed broad rights to persons with disabilities and non-disabled people alike, though during the second period, treaties and policies came into force which specifically focused on the rights of disabled people. 
 
===Period: 1945-1992===
* European Community [[Treaty of Rome]], 1957: the Council reserves the right to fight discrimination, inter alia, against disability, age, or sex. Treaty articles indicate that people are equal, and have the same rights, but also deserve equal pay for equal work;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3Axy0023 |title=EUR-Lex - Official Journal of the European Union |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[European Convention on Human Rights]], 1953: disabled people are not mentioned in the articles. This Convention safeguards [[human rights]] of individuals, and thereby implicitly includes those who are disabled. However, over the years since the Convention was established (1959), requests and applications contributed by disabled people into the Court of Human Rights, and to the European Commission changed the approach to disability under the Convention;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf|format=PDF|title=European Convention on Human Rights|website=Echr.coe.int|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resolution of the Council of the European Communities (Council of Ministers) of 27 June 1974: laying down the first Community Action Program for occupational rehabilitation of persons with disabilities;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31974Y0708(01) |title=EUR-Lex - Official Journal of the European Union |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resolution of the Council of the European Communities of 27 June 1974: laying down the Joint Program of Activities of the Communities, concentrating on the vocational and social reintegration of people with disabilities;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Resolution of the Council of the European Communities of 21 December 1981: focuses on social inclusion of persons with disabilities at the community level;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A41981X1231 |title=EUR-Lex - Official Journal of the European Union |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recommendation on the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Community 24 July 1986: this recommendation was adopted by the Council of the European Communities. The recommendation was dedicated to the professional careers of disabled persons, with a concentration on the creation of new workplaces. Another focus was that of sheltered employment. It was recommended that each country should review the situation in the field of sheltered employment and protected activities, as well as prepare improvements going forward. It was also decided to grant high priority to improving the possibilities of training disabled persons and preparing them for an active professional life. The Council directed incentives to the employers for the financing of special costs resulting from employing disabled workers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31986H0379 |title=EUR-Lex - Official Journal of the European Union |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[European Social Charter]]: grants the right to solicit benefits from welfare services, and gives both medical and social assistance to those who need it. Furthermore, mentally or physically disabled people gain the right to regulated social resettlements, professional training, and rehabilitation. The charter defines that those people should be properly placed in the labor market and also that some steps should be taken to encourage employees to employ disabled people;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/turin-european-social-charter |title=The European Social Charter |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period: 1992-2016===
* [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], 1997, was the first treaty in which EU directly addressed [[disability]] issues. It imposed an obligation to counteract [[discrimination]] against persons with disabilities. After the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the scope of the initiatives taken by the Union towards conducting a coherent policy for people with disabilities significantly increased;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/treaty/pdf/amst-en.pdf|format=PDF|title=TREATY OF AMSTERDAM AMENDING THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION, THE TREATIES ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND CERTAIN RELATED ACTS|website=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], 7 December 2000, was adopted and was later included in the Lisbon Treaty. This charter clarifies that all people are equal, and among other things prohibits discrimination based on disability and recognizes and respects the rights of persons with disabilities to use the means designed to ensure their independence, social and professional integration, and participation in social life;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|website=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] created a European Union that functioned as a fully-fledged [[international organization]] with a [[legal personality]], and it also gave the Member States tools and mechanisms for working together on policies such as those for disabled people. However, the cooperation and institutional frameworks that were effective for functioning the whole of the EU on many different policy areas were not so effective for the 27 member states. This lead to issues of fulfilling the obligations of the EU legislation at the same level in each state. The treaty includes a number of provisions regarding the situation of persons with disabilities, such as a clause for non-discrimination in the field of disablement at every level. There began an [[open method of coordination]] between States in the fields of employment, protection of health, education, training  and social protection;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A12007L%2FTXT |title=EUR-Lex - Official Journal of the European Union |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Equality Act 2010]] was a legal way to protect persons with disabilities from [[discrimination]] occurrences in workplaces and generally in society. It prohibited discrimination addressed to the disabled people in different fields: including delivery of goods, associations, facilities, services, work, in the discharge of public functions, premises, and education. In the Act, disability is one protected characteristic among others, only those with diagnosed disabilities can rely upon these provisions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents |title=Equality Act 2010 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[European Disability Strategy 2010-2020]] - the continuation of a previous Strategy for period 2004-2010, that distinguishes '''8 priority fields of actions:'''
** [[Accessibility]] – customization of services and goods to disabled people;
** Participation – making sure that the disabled are using all benefits and rights which belong to them from EU citizenship, that are guaranteed in legal documents, treaties and others;
** Equality – commencement of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination,
** [[Employment]] – increasing the share of disabled people who work in the labor market;
** [[Education]], [[training]] – education-promoting actions and life-long learning for young disabled people, ensuring equal access to education, which leads to full participation in society and the overall increased quality of life;
** [[Social protection]] – fight against poverty, exclusion, and promotion of dignified living conditions;
** [[Health care]] - equal access to medical services;
** [[External actions]] – promoting the rights of the disabled among EU enlargements states and establishing international programs about disability;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0636:FIN:en:PDF |title=EUR-Lex - Official Journal of the European Union |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''European Year of People with Disabilities''==
The EU established the year 2003 as the ''European Year of People with Disabilities.'' Following the success of this event, the European Commission introduced the ''Equal opportunities for people with disabilities: a European action plan for the years 2004-2010''. It aimed to develop a sustainable-operational approach to the case for the disabled in the extended Europe, finding out and protecting the rights of the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Ac11414 |title=EUR-Lex - Official Journal of the European Union |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gamete intrafallopian transfer''' ('''GIFT''') is a tool of [[assisted reproductive technology]] against [[infertility]]. Eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries, and placed in one of the [[Fallopian tube]]s, along with the man's sperm. The technique, first attempted by [[Patrick Steptoe|Steptoe]] and [[Robert Edwards (physiologist)|Edwards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v7/n10/full/nm1001-1091.html |author=Robert G. Edwards |title=The bumpy road to human in vitro fertilization |journal=Nature Medicine |doi=10.1038/nm1001-1091 |volume=7 |pages=1091–1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later pioneered by endocrinologist [[Ricardo Asch]], allows fertilization to take place inside the woman's uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Asch RH, Ellsworth LR, Balmaceda JP, Wong PC |title=Pregnancy after translaparoscopic gamete intrafallopian transfer. |journal=Lancet |pmid=6149412 |year=1984 |volume=2 |issue=8410 |pages=1034–5 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(84)91127-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advances in IVF the GIFT procedure is used less as pregnancy rates in [[IVF]] tend to be equal or better and do not require [[laparoscopy]] when the egg is put back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Toner JP| title=Progress we can be proud of: U.S. trends in assisted reproduction over the first 20 years |journal=Fertil. Steril. | pmid=12413976 |year=2002 |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=943–50 |doi=10.1016/s0015-0282(02)03769-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
It takes, on average, four to six weeks to complete a cycle of GIFT. First, the woman must take a fertility drug to stimulate egg production in the [[ovary|ovaries]]. The doctor will monitor the growth of the ovarian follicles, and once they are mature, the woman will be injected with [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG). The eggs will be harvested approximately 36 hours later, mixed with the man's sperm, and placed back into the woman's [[Fallopian tubes]] using a [[laparoscope]].

==Indications==
A woman must have at least one normal fallopian tube in order for GIFT to be suitable. It is used in instances where the fertility problem relates to sperm dysfunction, and where the couple has idiopathic (unknown cause) infertility. Some patients may prefer the procedure to [[IVF]] for ethical reasons, since the fertilization takes place inside the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Dr. Richard Paulson |title=Assisted Reproductive Technology |url=http://www.videojug.com/interview/assisted-reproductive-technology-2#what-is-a-gamete-intra-fallopian-transfer-or-gift |publisher=VideoJug |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211135839/http://www.videojug.com/interview/assisted-reproductive-technology-2#what-is-a-gamete-intra-fallopian-transfer-or-gift |archivedate=11 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a semi invasive procedure and requires laparoscopy.

==Success rate==
As with most fertility procedures, success depends on the couple's age and the woman's egg quality. It is estimated that approximately 25–30% of GIFT cycles result in pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.child.org.uk/html/malta.php/factsheets/79/]&lt;/ref&gt; with a third of those being [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancies]].
The First GIFT baby in the UK was Todd Holden born in October 1986. The First GIFT baby in the US was Kaitlynne Kelley born on 28 April 1987. The first application of this method in Latin America was held in Argentina on 13 May 1986, and was led by Dr. Ricardo Asch, the treatment was successfully completed with the birth of Manuel Campo Lopez.&lt;ref&gt;Diario Clarin, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Jueves 15 de Mayo, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
In Venezuela, the first GIFT babies were Luis Hernández, Rosa Helena Hernández and Luisa Hernández, who were born on 24 June 1987 and were also the first triplets to be born using the GIFT method.

==Bioethical issues==
Gamete intrafallopian transfer is not technically ''in vitro'' fertilisation because with GIFT, fertilisation takes place inside the body, not on a petri dish. Some Catholic moral theologians are nevertheless concerned with it because they "consider this to be a replacement of the marital act, and therefore immoral."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.loras.edu/~CatholicHE/Arch/Sexuality/Gamete.html Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/about/pro-life-activities/respect-life-program/haas-rlp98-begotten-not-made-catholic-view-of-reproductive-technology.cfm|title=Begotten Not Made: A Catholic View of Reproductive Technology|vauthors=Haas JM,((S.T.L.))|accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HIE of One''' is a free software project developing tools for patients to manage their own health records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center for Democracy &amp; Technology staff|title=Patient-Managed Health Information Exchange: An HIE of One|url=https://cdt.org/blog/patient-managed-health-information-exchange-an-%E2%80%9Chie-of-one%E2%80%9D/|website=Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT)|accessdate=27 November 2016|ref=CDT}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIE stands for [[Health Information Exchange]], an electronic network for sharing health information across different organizations, hospitals, providers, and patients. This is one of a growing number of tools for encrypted data exchange within the health care sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conn|first1=Joseph|title=Could blockchain help cure health IT's security woes?|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20161105/MAGAZINE/311059966/could-blockchain-help-cure-health-its-security-woes|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=Modern Healthcare Magazine|issue=2016-11-05|publisher=Crain Communications|date=2016-11-05|ref=Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Doc Searls]] claims that a major structural problem with health care in the United States is that it is paid for by insurance companies and not patients, thus robbing patients of the power they would normally have as the customer in a free market. Searls writes that "[t]he best approach I have seen so far to this challenge is HIE of One, a project of two MDs, Adrian Gropper and Michael Chen."&lt;ref name="Searls"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Searls|first1=Doc|title=Consumers can't help health care. Customers can.|url=http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/11/09/consumers-cant-help-health-care-customers-can/|website=Doc Searls Weblog (Harvard Berkman Center)|accessdate=27 November 2016|ref=Searls|date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that HIE of One provides a patient-centered toolkit built around open source software and open data exchange standards.&lt;ref name="Searls" /&gt; Prof. Phillip Windley, former Chief Information Officer of the State of Utah, has noted the positive impact that HIE of One could have on privacy and consent.&lt;ref name="Windley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Windley|first1=Phillip|title=Sovrin Use Cases: Healthcare|url=http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/11/sovrin_use_cases_healthcare.shtml|website=Technometria|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal&lt;ref name="Gropper"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gropper|first1=Adrian|title=Powering the Physician-Patient Relationship with HIE of One Blockchain Health IT|url=https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/7-29-poweringthephysician-patientrelationshipwithblockchainhealthit.pdf|website=HealthIT.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=27 November 2016|ref=Gropper}}&lt;/ref&gt; for using HIE of One in conjunction with [[blockchain]] technology was reviewed by the US Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), winning an award from the ONC on the basis that the proposal was innovative, viable, and significant.&lt;ref name="ONC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology|title=ONC announces Blockchain challenge winners|url=https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2016/08/29/onc-announces-blockchain-challenge-winners.html|website=HHS.gov|publisher=HHS.gov U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=27 November 2016|ref=ONC|date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project rests on the premise that patients should authorize the sharing of their own health data, instead of leaving these decisions up to hospitals and other healthcare providers who offer generic and opaque disclosure forms. The elements of sharing health data can be broken down into storage, authorization, and transmission. HIE of One has [[decentralization]] solutions for each of these elements, and provides an open platform on which far more capabilities can be built, such as [[decision support]], analytics, public health efforts, and coordinated health care.

==Background and Name==

For most of medical history, doctors shared minimal information about patients. Before the computer age, a doctor might have a phone conversation with a specialist before sending over a patient, or send a few pages of a Continuity of Care Document (CCD) to the next health care provider or nursing facility. Many important aspects of treatment were dropped along the way, leading to suboptimal outcomes and duplication of work.

The advent of electronic records theoretically enabled much better care coordination, and the field of [[health information exchange]] (HIE) grew up around electronic records. Data sharing currently revolves around large, expensive organizations called Health Information Exchanges and industry-led efforts such as [http://www.commonwellalliance.org/ CommonWell]. However, such data exchanges have made slow progress, as found in a literature survey by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hersh, et al.|title=Health Information Exchange|journal=Evidence Report/Technology Assessment|date=December 2015|volume=220|issue=15(16)–E002–EF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies cited by that survey found the HIEs hard to use. An official 2016 government study&lt;ref name="NORC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dullabh, et al.|title=EVALUATION OF THE STATE HIE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT PROGRAM|url=https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/finalsummativereportmarch_2016.pdf|website=HealthIT.gov|publisher=NORC at the University of Chicago|accessdate=27 November 2016|ref=NORC|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; found uneven progress, with a few states succeeding and many lagging.

HIE of One, in contrast, dispenses with these middlemen by allowing each patient to direct the flow of data using an automated policy-driven authorization server. Data sharing is carried out through protocols run by the patient and the people to which she wishes to grant access (doctors, clinical researchers, family members, etc.).

The protocols forming the basis of HIE of One are developed by the [http://openid.net/wg/heart/ OpenID HEART project]. HEART grew out of a pair of meetings at the [[MIT Media Lab]] in 2014 designed to charter work on adding healthcare-specific authorization layer to a RESTful API. Once the scope and charter were defined, the workgroup began under the rules of the [[OpenID]] Foundation with industry and government representatives as co-chairs.

==Storage==

The success of HIE of One depends on shifting the sharing of patient data out of isolated doctors' offices and into patient authorization servers. Most patients are likely to use cloud computing for the authorization server, because robust cloud systems back up data and manage security measures. However, authorization servers can also be on a stand-alone computer or dedicated appliance at the patient's home, such as a [[FreedomBox]].

==Authorization==

Patient control over access to her own data is the central goal of HIE of One, so authorization is the key feature. HIE of One employs standard technologies, including the OpenID [[OAuth]] and [[OpenID Connect standards]], and User-Managed Access (UMA) from the [[Kantara Initiative]].

Both the patient and the person requesting access to data authenticate and provide an identity.The patient delegates control over personal data held by a hospital system or other  resource server using a typical OAuth flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardt|first1=D., Ed.|title=The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749|website=RFC 6749|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requesting party authenticates and provides identity claims to the HIE of One authorization server specified by the patient. The HIE of One authorization server can accept direct login (username/password or multi-factor), federated identity, and even self-sovereign identity.&lt;ref name="Gropper" /&gt;

==Transmission==

HIE of One theoretically can use any RESTful ([[Representational state transfer]]) standard available for data transmission, as long as a it’s controlled by a supported authorization standard such as [[OAuth#OAuth 2.0|OAuth2]]. Currently, [[Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources]] (FHIR) seems to be emerging as the health care industry's choice for formatting data and transmitting it over the Web.

* current experience, including (a) the [[affect (psychology)|feeling of an emotion (affect)]] such as [[pleasure]] or [[joy]],&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; or (b) a more general sense of 'emotional condition as a whole'.&lt;ref&gt; Dan Haybron (https://www.slu.edu/colleges/AS/philos/site/people/faculty/Haybron/, http://www.happinessandwellbeing.org/project-team/); "''I would suggest that when we talk about happiness, we are actually referring, much of the time, to a complex emotional phenomenon. Call it emotional well-being. Happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods, more broadly your emotional condition as a whole. To be happy is to inhabit a favorable emotional state.... On this view, we can think of happiness, loosely, as the opposite of anxiety and depression. Being in good spirits, quick to laugh and slow to anger, at peace and untroubled, confident and comfortable in your own skin, engaged, energetic and full of life.''" https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/happiness-and-its-discontents/ Haybron has also used the term thymic, by which he means 'overall mood state' in this context; https://philpapers.org/rec/HAYHAE &lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[Daniel Kahneman]] has defined happiness as "''what I experience here and now''".&lt;ref&gt;"''People don’t want to be happy the way I’ve defined the term – what I experience here and now. In my view, it’s much more important for them to be satisfied, to experience life satisfaction, from the perspective of ‘What I remember,’ of the story they tell about their lives.''"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-why-nobel-prize-winner-daniel-kahneman-gave-up-on-happiness-1.6528513&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is prevalent in dictionary definitions of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/happy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/happiness&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/happy&lt;/ref&gt;
* appraisal of [[life satisfaction]], such as of [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[Ruut Veenhoven]] has defined happiness as "''overall appreciation of one's life as-a-whole.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://personal.eur.nl/veenhoven/Pub2010s/2012k-full.pdf, 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/ 2011, "‘Happiness’ is often used, in ordinary life, to refer to a short-lived state of a person, frequently a feeling of contentment: ‘You look happy today’; ‘I’m very happy for you’. Philosophically, its scope is more often wider, encompassing a whole life. And in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person’s life, or of their happy life, even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable. The point is that some good things in their life made it a happy one, even though they lacked contentment. But this usage is uncommon, and may cause confusion.' https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/ 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[subjective well-being]],&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. 'Can Happiness be Measured', [[Action for Happiness]], http://www.actionforhappiness.org/why-happiness&lt;/ref&gt; which includes measures of [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and of [[life satisfaction]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Subjective_well-being#Components_of_SWB]]&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] has described happiness as “''the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one's life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.''”&lt;ref&gt;The How of Happiness, Lyubomirsky, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[eudaimonia]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760802303044?src=recsys&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes translated as flourishing.

These uses can give different results.&lt;ref&gt;"I am happy when I'm unhappy." Mark Baum character, [[The Big Short (film)]], https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)#Mark_Baum&lt;/ref&gt; For instance the correlation of income levels has been shown to be substantial with [[life satisfaction]] measures, but to be far weaker, at least above a certain threshold, with [[affect (psychology)|affect]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;"''Surveying large numbers of Americans in one case, and what is claimed to be the first globally representative sample of humanity in the other, these studies found that income does indeed correlate substantially (.44 in the global sample), at all levels, with life satisfaction—strictly speaking, a “life evaluation” measure that asks respondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are satisfied. Yet the correlation of household income with the affect measures is far weaker: globally, .17 for positive affect, –.09 for negative affect; and in the United States, essentially zero above $75,000 (though quite strong at low income levels). If the results hold up, the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction, but weakly related to emotional well-being, at least above a certain threshold.''" Section 3.3, Happiness, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#HedVerEmoSta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being", Daniel Kahneman and [[Angus Deaton]], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 21/9/10&lt;/ref&gt;

The implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context,&lt;ref&gt;"''How does happiness come into this classification? For better or worse, it enters in three ways. It is sometimes used as a current emotional report- “How happy are you now?,” sometimes as a remembered emotion, as in “How happy were you yesterday?,” and very often as a form of life evaluation, as in “How happy are you with your life as a whole these days?” People answer these three types of happiness question differently, so it is important to keep track of what is being asked. The good news is that the answers differ in ways that suggest that people understand what they are being asked, and answer appropriately.''" [[John Helliwell]] and Shun Yang, p11, [[World Happiness Report]] 2012 http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2012/&lt;/ref&gt; qualifying happiness as a [[Polysemy|polyseme]] and a [[fuzzy concept]]. 

Some users accept these issues, but continue to use the word because of its convening power.&lt;ref&gt;"''Some have argued that it is misleading to use ‘happiness’ as a generic term to cover subjective well-being more generally. While ‘subjective well-being’ is more precise, it simply does not have the convening power of ‘happiness’. The main linguistic argument for using happiness in a broader generic role is that happiness plays two important roles within the science of well-being, appearing once as a prototypical positive emotion and again as part of a cognitive life evaluation question. This double use has sometimes been used to argue that there is no coherent structure to happiness responses. The converse argument made in the World Happiness Reports is that this double usage helps to justify using happiness in a generic role, as long as the alternative meanings are clearly understood and credibly related. Evidence from a growing number of large scale surveys shows that the answers to questions asking about the emotion of happiness differ from answers to judgmental questions asking about a person’s happiness with life as a whole in exactly the ways that theory would suggest. Answers to questions about the emotion of happiness relate well to what is happening at the moment. Evaluative answers, in response to questions about life as a whole, are supported by positive emotions, as noted above, but also driven much more, than are answers to questions about emotions, by a variety of life circumstances, including income, health and social trust.''" [[John F. Helliwell]] and others, World Happiness Report, 2015, quoted in What’s Special About Happiness as a Social Indicator? John F. Helliwell, Published online: 25 February 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of happiness}}

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', written in 350 BCE, [[Aristotle]] stated that happiness (also being well and doing well) is the only thing that humans desire for its own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy. Note that ''[[eudaimonia]]'', the term we translate as "happiness", is for Aristotle an activity rather than an emotion or a state.&lt;ref&gt;Eudaimonia (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) is a classical Greek word commonly translated as 'happiness' or, better yet, 'flourishing'. Etymologically, it consists of the word "eu" ("good" or "well being") and "daimōn" ("spirit" or "minor deity", used by extension to mean one's lot or fortune).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way. Specifically, Aristotle argues that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity.  He arrives at this claim with the Function Argument.  Basically, if it's right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For humans, Aristotle contends, our function is to reason, since it is that alone that we uniquely do. And performing one's function well, or excellently, is good. Thus, according to Aristotle, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle does not leave it at that, however. He argues that there is a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity. This second best life is the life of moral virtue.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Many [[ethics|ethicists]] make arguments for how humans should behave, either individually or collectively, based on the resulting happiness of such behavior. [[Utilitarian]]s, such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]], advocated the [[greatest happiness principle]] as a guide for ethical behavior.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] savagely critiqued the English Utilitarians' focus on attaining the greatest happiness, stating that "Man does not strive for happiness, only the Englishman does." Nietzsche meant that making happiness one's ultimate ''goal'' and the aim of one's existence, in his words "makes one contemptible." Nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher, more difficult goals than "mere happiness." He introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the "last man" as a kind of [[thought experiment]] against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers. these small, "last men" who seek after only their own pleasure and health, avoiding all danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle are meant to seem contemptible to Nietzsche's reader. Nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult, what can only be earned through struggle, difficulty, pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and ''unhappiness'' truly play in creating everything of great worth in life, including all the highest achievements of human culture, not least of all philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy|work=stanford.edu|access-date=2015-08-10|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66D67rj9I?url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|archive-date=2012-03-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=2015-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815204318/http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/|archive-date=2015-08-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darrin McMahon]] claims that there has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMahon |first1=Darrin M. |title=From the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness: 400 B.C. – A.D. 1780 |journal=Daedalus |volume=133 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=5–17 |jstor=20027908 |doi=10.1162/001152604323049343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More mundane forms of happiness, such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships, are also recognized as worthy goals for [[householder (Buddhism)|lay people]] (see ''[[sukha]]'').

====Hinduism====
In [[Advaita Vedanta]], the ultimate goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]] is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the Self in all.

[[Patanjali]], author of the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras]], wrote quite exhaustively on the psychological and ontological roots of bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Marvin

====Confucianism====
The Chinese Confucian thinker [[Mencius]], who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during China's Warring States period, was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the "lesser self" (the physiological self) and the "greater self" (the moral self), and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage-hood. He argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one's "vital force" with "righteous deeds", then that force would shrivel up (Mencius, 6A:15 2A:2). More specifically, he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues, especially through music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chan | first = Wing-tsit

The primary meaning of "happiness" in various European languages involves good fortune, chance or happening. The meaning in Greek philosophy, however, refers primarily to ethics.

In [[Catholicism]], the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity, Latin equivalent to the Greek ''[[eudaimonia]]'', or "blessed happiness", described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a [[Beatific Vision]] of God's essence in the next life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Question 3.

According to [[St. Augustine]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], man's last end is happiness: "all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm#article4 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Man's last end (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 1) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105095827/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm#article4 |archive-date=2011-11-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, where utilitarians focused on reasoning about consequences as the primary tool for reaching happiness, Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts, but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts, such as habits according to [[virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Secunda Secundae Partis |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518035222/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3.htm |archive-date=2013-05-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, which habits and acts that normally lead to happiness is according to Aquinas caused by laws: [[natural law]] and [[divine law]]. These laws, in turn, were according to Aquinas caused by a first cause, or God.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

According to Aquinas, happiness consists in an "operation of the speculative intellect": "Consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of Divine things." And, "the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect." So: "Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article2 |title=Summa Theologica: What is happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 3) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109063700/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article2 |archive-date=2012-01-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human complexities, like reason and cognition, can produce well-being or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In temporal life, the contemplation of God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. ''Beatitudo'', or perfect happiness, as complete well-being, is to be attained not in this life, but the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Happiness|work=newadvent.org|access-date=2012-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501191841/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm|archive-date=2012-05-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
[[Al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111), the Muslim Sufi thinker, wrote "[[The Alchemy of Happiness]]", a manual of spiritual instruction throughout the Muslim world and widely practiced today.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Psychology ==
Happiness in its broad sense is the label for a family of pleasant emotional states, such as [[joy]], [[amusement]], [[Contentment|satisfaction]], [[gratification]], [[euphoria]], and [[Pride#As an emotion|triumph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Algoe |first1=Sara B. |last2=Haidt |first2=Jonathan |title=Witnessing excellence in action: the 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration |journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=105–27 |year=2009 |pmid=19495425 |pmc=2689844 |doi=10.1080/17439760802650519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Happiness can be examined in experiential and evaluative contexts. Experiential well-being, or "objective happiness", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as "How good or bad is your experience now?". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as "How good was your vacation?" and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in [[reconstructive memory]], but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. The two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the [[peak-end rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Huppert|editor-first1=Felicia A|editor-last2=Baylis|editor-first2=Nick|editor-last3=Keverne|editor-first3=Barry|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|author1-link=Daniel Kahneman|first2=Jason|last2=Riis|title=The science of well-being|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford ; New York|isbn=9780198567523|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198567523.003.0011|chapter-url=https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/Living_DK_JR_2005.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2017|language=en|chapter=Living, and thinking about it: two perspectives on life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===

====Maslow's hierarchy of needs====
[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, he reaches [[self-actualization]]. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as [[peak experiences]], profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the [[Flow (psychology)|flow]] concept of [[Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Amitai Etzioni points out that Maslow's definition of human needs, even on the highest level, that of self-actualization, is self-centered (i.e. his view of satisfaction or what makes a person happy, does not include service to others or the common good—unless it enriches the self). As implied by its name, self-actualization is highly individualistic and reflects Maslow's premise that the self is “sovereign and inviolable” and entitled to “his or her own tastes, opinions, values, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;Adrianne Aron, “Maslow’s Other Child,” Journal of Humanistic Psychology 17(2), 1977, 13; Amitai Etzioni, Happiness is the Wrong Metric: A Liberal Communitarian Response to Populism, Springer, January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-determination theory====
[[File:Girl of Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Smiling woman from [[Vietnam]]]]
[[Self-determination theory]] relates [[intrinsic motivation]] to three needs: [[Competence (human resources)|competence]], [[autonomy]], and [[Social relation|relatedness]].

====Modernization and freedom of choice====
[[Ronald Inglehart]] has traced cross-national differences in the level of happiness based on data from the [[World Values Survey]]. He finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness. When [[basic needs]] are satisfied, the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives. Happiness also depends on religion in countries where free choice is constrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Inglehart |first1=Ronald F. |title=Cultural Evolution: People's Motivations Are Changing, and Reshaping the World |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/9781108613880 |isbn=9781108613880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positive psychology====
Since 2000 the field of [[positive psychology]] has expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications, and has produced many different views on causes of happiness, and on factors that correlate with happiness.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallis |first=Claudia |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |publisher=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous short-term self-help interventions have been developed and demonstrated to improve happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolier|first1=Linda|last2=Haverman|first2=Merel|last3=Westerhof|first3=Gerben J|last4=Riper|first4=Heleen|last5=Smit|first5=Filip|last6=Bohlmeijer|first6=Ernst|title=Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies|journal=BMC Public Health|date=8 February 2013|volume=13|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psysci.co/40-scientifically-proven-ways-happier/ |title=40 Scientifically Proven Ways To Be Happier |access-date=2018-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311190556/http://www.psysci.co/40-scientifically-proven-ways-happier/ |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement of happiness ==
Several scales have been developed to measure happiness:
* The [[Subjective Happiness Scale]] (SHS) is a four-item scale, measuring global subjective happiness.  The scale requires participants to use absolute ratings to characterize themselves as happy or unhappy individuals, as well as it asks to what extent they identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/subjectivehappinessscale.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522230648/http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/subjectivehappinessscale.pdf |archivedate=May 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyubomirsky |first1=Sonja |last2=Lepper |first2=Heidi S. |date=February 1999 |title=A Measure of Subjective Happiness: Preliminary Reliability and Construct Validation |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=137–55 |jstor=27522363 |doi=10.1023/A:1006824100041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Affect measures#PANAS|Positive and Negative Affect Schedule]] (PANAS) is used to detect the relation between personality traits and positive or negative affects at this moment, today, the past few days, the past week, the past few weeks, the past year, and generally (on average). PANAS is a 20-item questionnaire, which uses a five-point Likert scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camden.rutgers.edu/~bwhitlow/Courses/Experimental/SURVEY04/sld010.htm|title=Search - Rutgers University-Camden|website=www.camden.rutgers.edu|access-date=2012-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426002645/http://www.camden.rutgers.edu/~bwhitlow/Courses/Experimental/SURVEY04/sld010.htm|archive-date=2012-04-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=David |last2=Clark |first2=Lee A. |last3=Tellegen |first3=Auke |title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1063–70 |year=1988 |pmid=3397865 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer version with additional affect scales is available in a manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Watson |first2=Lee Anna |last2=Clark |year=1994 |title=The PANAS-X: Manual for the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Expanded Form |publisher=The University of Iowa |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/psychology_pubs/11 |access-date=2016-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007121957/http://ir.uiowa.edu/psychology_pubs/11/ |archive-date=2016-10-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Satisfaction with Life Scale]] (SWLS) is a global cognitive assessment of [[life satisfaction]] developed by [[Ed Diener]]. The SWLS requires a person to use a seven-item scale to state their agreement or disagreement (1 = strongly disagree,  4 = neither agree nor disagree, 7 = strongly agree) with five statements about their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbims.org/combi/swls/swlsrat.html|title=SWLS Rating Form|work=tbims.org|access-date=2012-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416031915/http://www.tbims.org/combi/swls/swlsrat.html|archive-date=2012-04-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diener |first1=Ed |last2=Emmons |first2=Robert A. |last3=Larsen |first3=Randy J. |last4=Griffin |first4=Sharon |title=The Satisfaction With Life Scale |journal=Journal of Personality Assessment |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=71–75 |year=1985 |pmid=16367493 |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4901_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 [[World Happiness Report]] stated that in subjective well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Helliwell |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Layard |editor3-first=Jeffrey |editor3-last=Sachs |year=2012 |title=World Happiness Report 2012 |isbn=978-0-9968513-0-5 |url=http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2012/ |access-date=2016-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718204801/http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2012/ |archive-date=2016-07-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happiness is used in both life evaluation, as in “How happy are you with your life as a whole?”, and in emotional reports, as in “How happy are you now?,” and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the [[World Happiness Report]] identifies the countries with the highest levels of happiness.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Etzioni argues that happiness is the wrong metric, because it does not take into account that doing the right thing, what is moral, often does not produce happiness in the way this term is usually used.&lt;ref&gt;Amitai Etzioni, Happiness is the Wrong Metric: A Liberal Communitarian Response to Populism, Springer, January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Happiness economics}}

In politics, ''happiness'' as a guiding ideal is expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], as the universal right to "the pursuit of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlesinger |first1=Arthur M. |title=The Lost Meaning of "The Pursuit of Happiness" |journal=The William and Mary Quarterly |volume=21 |issue=3 |year=1964 |pages=325–27 |jstor=1918449 |doi=10.2307/1918449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to suggest a subjective interpretation but one that nonetheless goes beyond emotions alone.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In fact, this discussion is often based on the naive assumption that the word ''happiness'' meant the same thing in 1776 as it does today. In fact, ''happiness'' meant "prosperity, thriving, wellbeing" in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fountain|first1=Ben|title=Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign|accessdate=2017-01-19|work=The Guardian|date=17 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123161503/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign|archive-date=2016-11-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common market health measures such as [[GDP]] and [[GNP]] have been used as a measure of successful policy. On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Bruno S. | last = Frey |author2=Alois Stutzer | title =  Happiness and Economics | publisher = Princeton University Press |date=December 2001 | isbn = 0-691-06998-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 | title = In Pursuit of Happiness Research.

Work by Paul Anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing, that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course.

[[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[think tank]] [[Cato Institute]] claims that [[economic freedom]] correlates strongly with happiness&lt;ref name="cato.org"&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 In Pursuit of Happiness Research. Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219211701/http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 |date=2011-02-19 }} The Cato institute. April 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; preferably within the context of a western mixed economy, with free press and a democracy. According to certain standards, East European countries (ruled by Communist parties) were less happy than Western ones, even less happy than other equally poor countries.&lt;ref name=sci&gt;[http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/spring05/polspr05-2.htm The Scientist's Pursuit of Happiness] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223054616/http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/spring05/polspr05-2.htm |date=February 23, 2010 }}, ''Policy'', Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, much empirical research in the field of [[happiness economics]], such as that by [[Benjamin Radcliff]], professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, supports the contention that (at least in democratic countries) life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Radcliff|Radcliff, Benjamin]] (2013) ''The Political Economy of Human Happiness'' (New York: Cambridge University Press).{{page needed|date=August 2016}} See also '''this collection of full-text peer reviewed scholarly articles on this subject''' by Radcliff and colleagues (from "Social Forces," "The Journal of Politics," and "Perspectives on Politics," among others) [http://benjaminradcliff.com/scholarly-articles/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200741/http://benjaminradcliff.com/scholarly-articles/ |date=2015-07-12 }}{{synthesis inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is evidence that public policies that reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affects average levels of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/14/does-a-higher-minimum-wage-make-people-happier/|title=Does a higher minimum wage make people happier?|author=Michael Krassa|date=14 May 2014|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707112256/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/14/does-a-higher-minimum-wage-make-people-happier/|archive-date=2015-07-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that happiness measures could be used not as a replacement for more traditional measures, but as a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-weiner13nov13,0,5698259.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |title=Four months of boom, bust, and fleeing foreign credit |first=Eric J. |last=Weiner |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2007-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222025241/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-weiner13nov13%2C0%2C5698259.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |archivedate=December 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to professor Edward Glaeser, people constantly make choices that decrease their happiness, because they have also more important aims. Therefore, the government should not decrease the alternatives available for the citizen by patronizing them but let the citizen keep a maximal freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/05/11/edward-glaeser/coercive-regulation-and-the-balance-of-freedom/ Coercive regulation and the balance of freedom] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715000839/http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/05/11/edward-glaeser/coercive-regulation-and-the-balance-of-freedom/ |date=2009-07-15 }}, Edward Glaeser, Cato Unbound 11.5.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Good [[mental health]] and good relationships contribute more than income to happiness and governments should take these into account.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38285223 Mental health and relationships 'key to happiness'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316084200/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38285223 |date=2018-03-16 }} ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Hypertension is rarely accompanied by symptoms, and its identification is usually through [[Screening (medicine)|screening]], or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem. Some people with high blood pressure report [[headache]]s (particularly at the [[Occiput|back of the head]] and in the morning), as well as [[lightheadedness]], [[vertigo]], [[tinnitus]] (buzzing or hissing in the ears), altered vision or [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting episodes]].&lt;ref name=Fisher2005&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Fisher ND, Williams GH |veditors=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1463–81 |chapter=Hypertensive vascular disease|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms, however, might be related to associated [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] rather than the high blood pressure itself.&lt;ref name=Stress2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=IJ|author2=Wolfe, CD |author3=McKevitt, C |title=Lay perspectives on hypertension and drug adherence: systematic review of qualitative research|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Jul 9, 2012|volume=345|page=e3953|pmid=22777025|pmc=3392078|doi=10.1136/bmj.e3953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[physical examination]], hypertension may be associated with the presence of changes in the [[optic fundus]] seen by  [[ophthalmoscopy]].&lt;ref name=Wong2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wong T, Mitchell P |title=The eye in hypertension |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=425–35 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17276782 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60198-6|last2=Mitchell }}&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the changes typical of [[hypertensive retinopathy]] is graded from I–IV; grades I and II may be difficult to differentiate.&lt;ref name=Wong2007/&gt; The severity of the retinopathy correlates roughly with the duration or the severity of the hypertension.&lt;ref name=Fisher2005/&gt;

===Secondary hypertension===
{{Main|Secondary hypertension}}
Hypertension with certain specific additional signs and symptoms may suggest secondary hypertension, i.e. hypertension due to an identifiable cause. For example, [[Cushing's syndrome]] frequently causes truncal obesity, [[glucose intolerance]], [[moon face]], a hump of fat behind the neck/shoulder (referred to as a buffalo hump), and purple abdominal [[stretch marks]].&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite book |author1=O'Brien, Eoin |author2=Beevers, D. G. |author3=Lip, Gregory Y. H. |title=ABC of hypertension |publisher=BMJ Books |location=London |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4051-3061-X |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperthyroidism]] frequently causes weight loss with increased appetite, [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[exophthalmos|bulging eyes]], and tremor. [[Renal artery stenosis]] (RAS) may be associated with a localized abdominal [[bruit]] to the left or right of the midline (unilateral RAS), or in both locations (bilateral RAS). [[Coarctation of the aorta]]  frequently causes a decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities relative to the arms, or delayed or absent [[femoral artery|femoral arterial pulses]]. [[Pheochromocytoma]] may cause abrupt ("paroxysmal") episodes of hypertension accompanied by headache, [[palpitation]]s, [[Pallor|pale appearance]], and [[Diaphoresis|excessive sweating]].&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

===Hypertensive crisis===
{{main|Hypertensive crisis}}
Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than a systolic 180 or diastolic of 110) is referred to as a hypertensive crisis. Hypertensive crisis is categorized as either [[hypertensive urgency]] or [[hypertensive emergency]], according to the absence or presence of end organ damage, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hypertensive crisis|journal = Cardiology in Review|date = 2010-04-01|issn = 1538-4683|pmid = 20160537|pages = 102–07|volume = 18|issue = 2|doi = 10.1097/CRD.0b013e3181c307b7|first = Maria Alexandra|last = Rodriguez|first2 = Siva K.|last2 = Kumar|first3 = Matthew|last3 = De Caro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hypertensive Crisis|url = http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/AboutHighBloodPressure/Hypertensive-Crisis_UCM_301782_Article.jsp|website = www.heart.org|accessdate = 2015-07-25|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150725220209/http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/AboutHighBloodPressure/Hypertensive-Crisis_UCM_301782_Article.jsp|archivedate = 25 July 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hypertensive urgency, there is no evidence of end organ damage resulting from the elevated blood pressure. In these cases, oral medications are used to lower the BP gradually over 24 to 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Marik2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marik PE, Varon J |title=Hypertensive crises: challenges and management |journal=Chest |volume=131 |issue=6 |pages=1949–62 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17565029 |doi=10.1378/chest.06-2490 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/131/6/1949.long |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121204174126/http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/131/6/1949.long |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-04 |last2=Varon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hypertensive emergency, there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs.&lt;ref name=JNC7/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Musini|first2=VM|last3=Wright|first3=James M|date=23 January 2008|title=Pharmacological interventions for hypertensive emergencies.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=1|pages=CD003653|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003653.pub3|pmid=18254026|last1=Perez|first1=MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most affected organs include the brain, kidney, heart and lungs, producing symptoms which may include confusion, drowsiness, chest pain and breathlessness.&lt;ref name="Marik2007" /&gt; In hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure must be reduced more rapidly to stop ongoing organ damage,&lt;ref name="Marik2007" /&gt; however, there is a lack of [[randomized controlled trial]] evidence for this approach.&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt;

===Pregnancy===
{{main|Gestational hypertension|Pre-eclampsia}}

Hypertension occurs in approximately 8–10% of pregnancies.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; Two blood pressure measurements six hours apart of greater than 140/90&amp;nbsp;mm Hg is diagnostic of hypertension in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="harrison"&gt;{{cite book|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780071748896|year=2011|pages=55–61|edition=18th}}&lt;/ref&gt; High blood pressure in pregnancy can be classified as pre-existing hypertension, [[gestational hypertension]], or [[pre-eclampsia]].&lt;ref name="uptodate.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Management of hypertension in pregnant and postpartum women|url = http://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women?source=machineLearning&amp;search=hypertension+pregnancy&amp;selectedTitle=1~150&amp;sectionRank=1&amp;anchor=H53704432#H53704432|website = www.uptodate.com|accessdate = 2015-07-30|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070333/http://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women?source=machineLearning&amp;search=hypertension+pregnancy&amp;selectedTitle=1~150&amp;sectionRank=1&amp;anchor=H53704432#H53704432|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is a serious condition of the second half of pregnancy and [[puerperium|following delivery]] characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]].&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; It occurs in about 5% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16% of all [[maternal death]]s globally.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of [[perinatal mortality|death of the baby around the time of birth]].&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; Usually there are no symptoms in pre-eclampsia and it is detected by routine screening. When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur the most common are headache, visual disturbance (often "flashing lights"), vomiting, pain over the stomach, and [[edema|swelling]]. Pre-eclampsia can occasionally progress to a life-threatening condition called [[eclampsia]], which is a [[hypertensive emergency]] and has several serious complications including [[blindness|vision loss]], [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]], [[tonic-clonic seizures|seizures]], [[kidney failure]], [[pulmonary edema]], and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (a blood clotting disorder).&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urlHypertension and Pregnancy: eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/261435-overview |title=Hypertension and Pregnancy |author=Gibson, Paul |date=July 30, 2009 |work=eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology |publisher=Medscape |pages= |accessdate=16 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724065747/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/261435-overview |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[gestational hypertension]] is defined as new-onset hypertension during pregnancy without protein in the urine.&lt;ref name="uptodate.com"/&gt;

Proper blood pressure measurement requires the person whose blood pressure is being measured to sit quietly for at least five minutes which is then followed by application of a properly fitted blood pressure cuff to a bare upper arm.&lt;ref name="Viera2017"/&gt; The person should be seated with their back supported, feet flat on the floor, and with their legs uncrossed.&lt;ref name="Viera2017"/&gt; The person whose blood pressure is being measured should avoid talking or moving during this process.&lt;ref name="Viera2017"/&gt; The arm being measured should be supported on a flat surface at the level of the heart.&lt;ref name="Viera2017"/&gt; Blood pressure measurement should be done in a quiet room so the medical professional checking the blood pressure can hear the [[Korotkoff sound]]s while listening to the [[brachial artery]] with a [[stethoscope]] for accurate blood pressure measurements.&lt;ref name="Viera2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vischer2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vischer|first1=AS|last2=Burkard|first2=T|title=Principles of Blood Pressure Measurement - Current Techniques, Office vs Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement|journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|date=2017|volume=956|pages=85–96|doi=10.1007/5584_2016_49|pmid=27417699|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blood pressure cuff should be deflated slowly (2-3 mmHg per second) while listening for the Korotkoff sounds.&lt;ref name="Vischer2017"/&gt; The [[urinary bladder|bladder]] should be emptied before a person's blood pressure is measured since this can increase blood pressure by up to 15/10 mmHg.&lt;ref name="Viera2017"/&gt; Multiple blood pressure readings (at least two) spaced 1–2 minutes apart should be obtained to ensure accuracy.&lt;ref name="Vischer2017"/&gt; Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over 12 to 24 hours is the most accurate method to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Siu|first1=AL|title=Screening for High Blood Pressure in Adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=13 October 2015|pmid=26458123|doi=10.7326/m15-2223|volume=163|pages=778–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to this is those with very high blood pressure readings especially when there is poor [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] function.&lt;ref name="NICE127 full"/&gt; Initial assessment of the hypertensive people should include a complete [[Medical history|history]] and [[physical examination]]. With the availability of 24-hour [[ambulatory blood pressure]] monitors and [[bloodpressure#Home monitoring|home blood pressure]] machines, the importance of not wrongly diagnosing those who have [[white coat hypertension]] has led to a change in protocols. In the United Kingdom, current best practice is to follow up a single raised clinic reading with ambulatory measurement, or less ideally with home blood pressure monitoring over the course of 7 days.&lt;ref name="NICE127 full"/&gt; The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] also recommends getting measurements outside of the healthcare environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Siu|first1=AL|last2=U.S. Preventive Services Task|first2=Force|title=Screening for High Blood Pressure in Adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=17 November 2015|volume=163|issue=10|pages=778–86|pmid=26458123|doi=10.7326/m15-2223}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudohypertension in the elderly]] or noncompressibility artery syndrome may also require consideration.

Once the diagnosis of hypertension has been made, healthcare providers should attempt to identify the underlying cause based on risk factors and other symptoms, if present. [[Secondary hypertension]] is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by [[kidney disease]]. Primary or [[essential hypertension]] is more common in adolescents and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension.&lt;ref name="pmid16719248"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Luma GB, Spiotta RT | title = Hypertension in children and adolescents | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 73 | issue = 9 | pages = 1558–68 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16719248| last2 = Spiotta }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory tests can also be performed to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension, and to determine whether hypertension has caused damage to the [[Human heart|heart]], [[Human eyes|eyes]], and [[kidney]]s. Additional tests for [[diabetes]] and [[high cholesterol]] levels are usually performed because these conditions are additional risk factors for the development of [[heart disease]] and may require treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid10645931"/&gt;

Serum [[creatinine]] is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease, which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension. Serum creatinine alone may overestimate [[glomerular filtration rate]] and recent guidelines advocate the use of predictive equations such as the [[Modification of Diet in Renal Disease]] (MDRD) formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).&lt;ref name=JNC7&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure |journal=Hypertension |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=1206–52 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14656957 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000107251.49515.c2 |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/42/6/1206.long |name-list-format=vanc |author1=Chobanian AV |author2=Bakris GL |author3=Black HR |author4=Cushman WC |author5=Green LA |author6=Izzo Jr. JL |author7=Jones DW |author8=Materson BJ |author9=Oparil S |author10=Wright Jr. JT |author11=Roccella EJ |display-authors=11 |publisher=Joint National Committee On Prevention |last12=Joint National Committee On Prevention |first12=Detection |author13=National High Blood Pressure Education Program Coordinating Committee |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520105829/http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/42/6/1206.long |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df=dmy-all |access-date=1 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eGFR can also provide a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain [[Antihypertensive drug|anti-hypertensive]] drugs on kidney function. Additionally, testing of urine samples for [[proteinuria|protein]] is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease. [[Electrocardiogram]] (EKG/ECG) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure. It may also show whether there is thickening of the heart muscle ([[left ventricular hypertrophy]]) or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance such as a silent heart attack. A [[chest X-ray]] or an [[echocardiogram]] may also be performed to look for signs of heart enlargement or damage to the heart.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

==Prevention==
Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labeled as hypertensive.&lt;ref name="BHSIV"/&gt; Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive medications. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure, before starting medications. The 2004 British Hypertension Society guidelines&lt;ref name="BHSIV"/&gt; proposed lifestyle changes consistent with those outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Whelton PK | year = 2002 | title = Primary prevention of hypertension.

* maintain normal body weight for adults (e.g. [[body mass index]] 20–25&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* reduce dietary sodium intake to &lt;100&amp;nbsp;mmol/ day (&lt;6 g of sodium chloride or &lt;2.4 g of sodium per day)
* engage in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking (≥30 min per day, most days of the week)
* limit alcohol consumption to no more than 3 units/day in men and no more than 2 units/day in women

{{Main|Management of hypertension}}
According to one review published in 2003, reduction of the [[blood pressure]] by 5&amp;nbsp;mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of [[ischemic heart disease]] by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of [[dementia]], [[heart failure]], and [[death|mortality]] from [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Law M, Wald N, Morris J |title = Lowering blood pressure to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke: a new preventive strategy |journal = Health Technol Assess |volume = 7 |issue = 31 |pages = 1–94 |year = 2003 |pmid=14604498|doi=10.3310/hta7310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Comparison of international blood pressure guidelines}}

===Medications ===
Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as [[antihypertensive drug|antihypertensive medication]]s, are available for treating hypertension.

First-line medications for hypertension include [[Thiazide|thiazide-diuretics]], [[calcium channel blockers]], [[angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor]]s (ACE inhibitors), and [[Angiotensin II receptor antagonist|angiotensin receptor blockers]] (ARBs).&lt;ref name=JNC8/&gt; These medications may be used alone or in combination (ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended for use in combination); the latter option may serve to minimize counter-regulatory mechanisms that act to restore blood pressure values to pre-treatment levels.&lt;ref name=JNC8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=JM|last2=Heran|first2=BS|last3=Wright|first3=JM|title=Blood pressure lowering efficacy of diuretics as second-line therapy for primary hypertension.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=7 October 2009|issue=4|page=CD007187|pmid=19821398|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007187.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people require more than one medication to control their hypertension.&lt;ref name="Go2013" /&gt; Medications for blood pressure control should be implemented by a stepped care approach when target levels are not reached.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[File:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg|Image of veins from Harvey's ''Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus''|left|thumb]]

===Measurement===
Modern understanding of the cardiovascular system began with the work of physician [[William Harvey]] (1578–1657), who described the circulation of blood in his book "''De motu cordis''". The English clergyman [[Stephen Hales]] made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733.&lt;ref name="pmid1744849"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kotchen2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kotchen TA |title=Historical trends and milestones in hypertension research: a model of the process of translational research |journal=Hypertension |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=522–38 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21859967 |doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.177766}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, hypertension as a clinical entity came into its own with the invention of the cuff-based [[sphygmomanometer]] by [[Scipione Riva-Rocci]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A century of arterial hypertension 1896–1996 | editor=Postel-Vinay N | page=213 | location=Chichester | publisher=Wiley | year=1996 | isbn=0-471-96788-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed easy measurement of systolic pressure in the clinic. In 1905, [[Nikolai Korotkoff]] improved the technique by describing the [[Korotkoff sounds]] that are heard when the artery is ausculated with a stethoscope while the sphygmomanometer cuff is deflated.&lt;ref name=Kotchen2011/&gt; This permitted systolic and diastolic pressure to be measured.

===Identification===
The symptoms similar to symptoms of patients with hypertensive crisis are discussed in medieval Persian medical texts in the chapter of "fullness disease".&lt;ref name="The medieval origins of the concept of hypertension"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The medieval origins of the concept of hypertension|journal=Heart Views|date=2014|volume=15|issue=3|pages=96–98|doi=10.4103/1995-705X.144807|url=http://www.heartviews.org/article.asp?issn=1995-705X;year=2014;volume=15;issue=3;spage=96;epage=98;aulast=Heydari|accessdate=25 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323115925/http://www.heartviews.org/article.asp?issn=1995-705X%3Byear%3D2014%3Bvolume%3D15%3Bissue%3D3%3Bspage%3D96%3Bepage%3D98%3Baulast%3DHeydari|archivedate=23 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms include headache, heaviness in the head, sluggish movements, general redness and warm to touch feel of the body, prominent, distended and tense vessels, fullness of the pulse, distension of the skin, coloured and dense urine, loss of appetite, weak eyesight, impairment of thinking, yawning, drowsiness, vascular rupture, and hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;ref name="pmid25310615"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Emtiazy M, Choopani R, Khodadoost M, Tansaz M, Dehghan S, Ghahremani Z |title = Avicenna's doctrine about arterial hypertension |journal = Acta Med Hist Adriat |volume = 12 |issue = 1 |pages = 157–62 |year = 2014 |pmid = 25310615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fullness disease was presumed to be due to an excessive amount of blood within the blood vessels.

Descriptions of hypertension as a disease came among others from [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1808 and especially [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]] in 1836.&lt;ref name="pmid1744849"/&gt; The first report of elevated blood pressure in a person without evidence of kidney disease was made by [[Frederick Akbar Mahomed]] (1849–1884).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Swales JD|title=Manual of hypertension |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=xiii |isbn=0-86542-861-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
Historically the treatment for what was called the "hard pulse disease" consisted in reducing the quantity of blood by [[bloodletting]] or the application of [[leech]]es.&lt;ref name="pmid1744849"&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Esunge PM |title=From blood pressure to hypertension: the history of research |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=84 |issue=10 |page=621 |date=October 1991 |pmid=1744849 |pmc=1295564}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This was advocated by The [[Yellow Emperor]] of China, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Cornelius Celsus]], [[Galen]], and [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref name="pmid1744849"/&gt;  The therapeutic approach for the treatment of hard pulse disease included changes in lifestyle (staying away from anger and [[sexual intercourse]]) and dietary program for patients (avoiding the consumption of [[wine]], meat, and pastries, reducing the volume of food in a meal, maintaining a low-energy diet and the dietary usage of [[spinach]] and [[vinegar]]).

In the 19th and 20th centuries, before effective pharmacological treatment for hypertension became possible, three treatment modalities were used, all with numerous side-effects: strict sodium restriction (for example the [[rice diet]]&lt;ref name="pmid1744849"/&gt;), [[sympathectomy]] (surgical ablation of parts of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]), and pyrogen therapy (injection of substances that caused a fever, indirectly reducing blood pressure).&lt;ref name="pmid1744849"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dustan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Dustan HP, Roccella EJ, Garrison HH |title = Controlling hypertension.

The first chemical for hypertension, [[sodium thiocyanate]], was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular.&lt;ref name="pmid1744849"/&gt; Several other agents were developed after the [[World War II|Second World War]], the most popular and reasonably effective of which were [[tetramethylammonium chloride]], [[hexamethonium]], [[hydralazine]], and [[reserpine]] (derived from the medicinal plant ''[[Rauwolfia serpentina]]''). None of these were well tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons, RH|last2=Hoobler, SW|last3=Neligh, RB|last4=Moe, GK|last5=Peet, MM|date=1948-02-28|title=Experiences with tetraethylammonium chloride in hypertension|journal=JAMA|volume=136|issue=9|pages=608–13|doi=10.1001/jama.1948.02890260016005|issn=0002-9955|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakris|first=G.

The first was [[chlorothiazide]], the first [[thiazide]] [[diuretic]] and developed from the antibiotic [[sulfanilamide]], which became available in 1958.&lt;ref name="pmid1744849"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Novello FC, Sprague JM | title=Benzothiadiazine dioxides as novel diuretics | journal=J.

[[The World Health Organization]] has identified hypertension, or high blood pressure, as the leading cause of [[cardiovascular]] [[Mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name="pmid17534457"/&gt; [[The World Hypertension League]] ([[The World Hypertension League|WHL]]), an umbrella organization of 85 national hypertension societies and leagues, recognized that more than 50% of the hypertensive population worldwide are unaware of their condition.&lt;ref name="pmid17534457"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chockalingam A |title=Impact of World Hypertension Day |journal=Canadian Journal of Cardiology |volume=23 |issue=7|pages=517–19 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17534457 |pmc=2650754 |doi= 10.1016/S0828-282X(07)70795-X|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To address this problem, the WHL initiated a global awareness campaign on hypertension in 2005 and dedicated May 17 of each year as [[World Hypertension Day]] ([[World Hypertension Day|WHD]]). Over the past three years, more national societies have been engaging in WHD and have been innovative in their activities to get the message to the public. In 2007, there was record participation from 47 member countries of the WHL. During the week of WHD, all these countries – in partnership with their local governments, professional societies, nongovernmental organizations and private industries – promoted hypertension awareness among the public through several [[Mass media|media]] and public rallies. Using [[mass media]] such as Internet and television, the message reached more than 250 million people. As the momentum picks up year after year, the WHL is confident that almost all the estimated 1.5 billion people affected by elevated blood pressure can be reached.&lt;ref name="pmid18548140"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chockalingam A |title=World Hypertension Day and global awareness|journal=Canadian Journal of Cardiology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=441–44 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18548140 |pmc=2643187|doi= 10.1016/S0828-282X(08)70617-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Heart Association estimated the direct and indirect costs of high blood pressure in 2010 as $76.6 billion.&lt;ref name = AHA2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lloyd-Jones D |title=Heart disease and stroke statistics—2010 update: a report from the American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=e46–e215 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20019324 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192667 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Adams RJ |author3=Brown TM |display-authors=3 |last4=Carnethon |first4=M. |last5=Dai |first5=S. |last6=De Simone |first6=G. |last7=Ferguson |first7=T.

People also face the challenges of adhering to medicine schedules and making lifestyle changes. Nonetheless, the achievement of blood pressure goals is possible, and most importantly, lowering blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of death due to heart disease and stroke, the development of other debilitating conditions, and the cost associated with advanced medical care.&lt;ref name="The Economic Impact of Hypertension"&gt;{{cite journal |author=William J.

==Research==
A 2015 review of several studies found that restoring blood vitamin D levels by using supplements (more than 1,000 IU per day) reduced blood pressure in hypertensive individuals when they had existing vitamin D deficiency.&lt;ref name="chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=S|last2=Sun|first2=Y|last3=Agrawal|first3=DK|title=Vitamin D deficiency and essential hypertension.|journal=Journal of the American Society of Hypertension|year=2015|volume=9|issue=11|pages=885–901|doi=10.1016/j.jash.2015.08.009|pmid=26419755|pmc=4641765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results also demonstrated a correlation of chronically low vitamin D levels with a higher chance of becoming hypertensive. Supplementation with vitamin D over 18 months in normotensive individuals with vitamin D deficiency did not significantly affect blood pressure.&lt;ref name=chen/&gt;

There is tentative evidence that an increased calcium intake may help in preventing hypertension. However, more studies are needed to assess the optimal dose and the possible side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cormick|first1=G|last2=Ciapponi|first2=A|last3=Cafferata|first3=ML|last4=Belizán|first4=JM|title=Calcium supplementation for prevention of primary hypertension.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=30 June 2015|issue=6|pages=CD010037|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010037.pub2|pmid=26126003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
===Cats===
Hypertension in cats is indicated with a systolic blood pressure greater than 150&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, with [[amlodipine]] the usual first-line treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Samantha S |last2=Sparkes |first2=Andrew H |last3=Briscoe |first3=Katherine |last4=Carter |first4=Jenny |last5=Sala |first5=Salva Cervantes |last6=Jepson |first6=Rosanne E |last7=Reynolds |first7=Brice S |last8=Scansen |first8=Brian A |title=ISFM Consensus Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension in Cats |journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery |date=March 2017 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=288–303 |doi=10.1177/1098612X17693500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foodborne illness''' (also '''foodborne disease''' and colloquially referred to as '''food poisoning''')&lt;ref&gt;
{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952820|food poisoning}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[illness]] resulting from the food spoilage of [[Food spoilage|contaminated food]], [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, or [[parasite]]s that contaminate food.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Infant food safety''' is the identification of risky food handling practices and the prevention of illness in infants. Fooddborne illness is a serious health issue, especially for babies and children. 
Infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to foodborne illness because their immune systems are not developed enough to fight off foodborne bacterial infections. In fact, 800,000 illnesses affect children under the age of 10 in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref name = FDA2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/HealthEducators/ucm089629.htm|title=Health Educators - Food Safety for Moms to Be: Once Baby Arrives|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=25 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, extra care should be taken when handling and preparing their food.

==Prevention==
Handwashing is the first step in maintaining the safety of infant food.&lt;ref name = fsgov&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/types/babyfood/index.html|title=Baby Food and Infant Formula|first=|last=Foodsafety.gov|website=www.foodsafety.gov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caregivers hands can pick up bacteria and spread bacteria to the baby. Objects that are high in bacteria are:
* [[Diapers]] containing [[feces]] and [[urine]]
* [[Raw meat]] and raw [[poultry]]
* Uncooked [[seafood]], and [[poultry egg|eggs]]
* Dogs and [[feline zoonosis|cats]], [[turtles]], [[snakes]], [[birds]], and [[lizards]].
* Other animals
* [[Soil]]
* Other children&lt;ref name = FDA2017/&gt;
Handwashing can remove harmful bacteria and will help to prevent foodborne illness. Instructing other children in a family on good handwashing will help to spread the bacteria that cause illness.&lt;ref name = FDA2017/&gt;

Handwashing is most effective in providing safe food for the infant during 'key times':&lt;ref name="form" /&gt;
* Before preparing and feeding bottles or foods to the baby.
* Before touching the baby's mouth.
* Before touching pacifiers or other things that go into the baby's mouth.
* After using the toilet or changing diapers.&lt;ref name="form" /&gt;

==Infant Formula==
Though breastfeeding helps prevent many kinds of sicknesses among infants, caregivers often choose to use [[infant formula]]. Promoting food safety in infants requires safe preparation and use.&lt;ref name = form/&gt;

Use infant formula within two hours of preparation. If the infant does not finish the entire bottle, the remainder is thrown away. If the prepared feed is not used right away, refrigerating it immediately will slow the growth of microorganisms, however it must be used within 24 hours.&lt;ref name = form/&gt;

''[[Cronobacter]]'', formerly known as Enterobacter sakazakii, is a group of bacteria that can be found in the environment. The germs can also live in dry foods, such as powdered infant formula. Anybody can get sick from ''Cronobacter'', but the infection occurs most often in infants. ''Cronobacter'' infections are rare, but they can be deadly in newborns. Infections in infants usually occur in the first days or weeks of life. ''Cronobacter'' germs can cause dangerous blood infections (sepsis) or infections of the linings surrounding the brain and spine (meningitis). Infants two months of age and younger are most likely to develop meningitis if they get sick with Cronobacter. Infants born prematurely and infants with a lower ability to fight germs and sickness due to illness (such as HIV) or medical treatment (such as chemotherapy for cancer) are also more likely to get sick. The first symptom of ''Cronobacter'' infection in infants is usually a fever, coupled with poor feeding, crying, or very low energy. Parents or caregivers should take an infant with these symptoms to see a doctor.&lt;ref name = form/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43547/1/9241563311_eng.pdf?ua=1 page xv&lt;/ref&gt;
===Infection prevention===
''Cronobacter'' infections can be prevented by:

* Breastfeeding. This is one of the best things that can do for the infant's health, and benefits include preventing many kinds of infections. Reports ''Cronobacter'' infections among infants who were fed only breast milk and no formula or other foods are rare.
* Cleaning, sanitizing, and storing dry feeding items and breast pump parts. Contamination can be prevented and the milk kept relatively free of microbes by washing, sanitizing, and safely storing other feeding implements.
* Cleaning the breasts before nursing.
* Keeping ill family and friends from feeding the infant.
* Using liquid formula, when possible. If your baby gets formula, 
* Choosing infant formula sold in liquid form over powdered, especially in very young infants.
* Preparing powdered infant formula safely.&lt;ref name = form/&gt;
===Safe infant formula preparation===
Recommendations from health organizations for the preparation of infant formula are:

* Warming treated and clean water to at least 158 °F /70 °C and pour it into the bottle.
* Adding infant formula, and carefully shaking, rather than stirring the bottle.
* Cooling the mixture so that it is not too hot before feeding the baby by running the prepared, capped bottle under treated, clean and cool water taking care to keep the cooling water from getting into the bottle or on the nipple.
* Testing the temperature of the mixture by shaking a few drops on the wrist.

If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol (check the product label to be sure). Hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is effective in killing Cronobacter germs. But use soap and water as soon as possible afterward because hand sanitizer does not kill all types of germs and may not work as well if hands are visibly greasy or dirty.

''Cronobacter'' can also cause diarrhea and urinary tract infections in people of all ages. The infection can be serious for older people and for people whose immune systems are weakened by other illnesses or conditions. They are also more likely to get sick.&lt;ref name = form/&gt;

Caregivers can prepare infant formula safely by:
* Preparing safe water for mixing: Bring tap water to a roiling boil and boil it for one minute. Bottled water can be sterilized before using.
* Using clean bottles and nipples: Sterilizing bottles and nipples before first use is safer. After that, it is safe to wash them by hand or in a dishwasher.
* Not making more formula than is needed. Formula can become contaminated during preparation, and bacteria can multiply quickly if formula is improperly stored. The safest practice is to make formula in smaller quantities on an as-needed basis to greatly reduce the possibility of contamination and always follow the label instructions for mixing formula.&lt;ref name="fsgov" /&gt;

===Heating breast milk or infant formula===
There are two ways to heat bottles with disposable inserts or hard plastic, and glass bottles. A bottle can be placed under hot, running tap water until the desired temperature is reached. This should take one-to-two minutes. A bottle can be placed in a pan after the water has been heated on a stove. The pan can be removed from the heat and set the bottle in it until it is warm. It is safer to shake milk or formula to even out the temperature. Heating breast milk or infant formula in the microwave is not recommended. This results in "hot spots" that can scald a baby's mouth and throat.&lt;ref name = microwave/&gt;

==Cow's milk==
Cow's milk by itself is not appropriate for infants less than one year old. Cow’s milk does not have the correct balance of nutrients for infants to grow and develop normally, and it can cause problems with anemia and kidney function. Raw milk is never appropriate for infants – or anyone else. It should not be consumed by anyone at any time for any purpose. Raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms, such as ''Salmonella'', ''E. coli'', and ''Listeria'', that can pose serious health risks. Most infant formula is made with cow's milk, but it has been modified and supplemented with additional nutrients. As a result, the formula is more nutritious and easier for the baby to digest than cow’s milk. Other formula options include soy-based formulas and hypoallergenic (or protein hydrolysate and amino acid-based) formulas. Special formulas are available for babies who are premature or have other health problems.&lt;ref name="fsgov" /&gt;

==Sanitizing objects==
Infants put anything within reach into their mouths. It is also important to keep all objects that enter baby's mouths (such as pacifiers and teethers) clean.&lt;ref name = form/&gt; Though research into [[Five-second rule | five-second rule]] has been done, results are inconclusive.

==Solid foods==
Infants are introduced to solid foods at different ages. Breast milk alone is sufficient to support optimal growth and development for approximately the first six months after birth. For these very young infants water, juice, and other foods are generally unnecessary. Even when babies enjoy discovering new tastes and textures, solid foods should not replace breastfeeding, but merely complement breast milk as the infant’s main source of nutrients throughout the first year. Beyond one year, as the variety and volume of solid foods gradually increase, breast milk remains an ideal addition to the child’s diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  - Breastfeeding - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents and caregivers can reduce choking hazards in a child's environment. Special attention should be given to food and nonfood items (e.g., candy, nuts, and coins) commonly involved in choking. Younger children are particularly at risk because of their tendency to place objects in their mouths, poor chewing ability, and narrow airways compared with those of older children. Recommendations are available to guide parents and caregivers about the types of food items that are inappropriate for children aged less than four years. Removal of nonfood choking hazards also is important for infants and children aged less than five years because approximately one third of all choking episodes involve nonfood items.&lt;ref name =cdcchoke&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5142a1.htm|title=Nonfatal Choking-Related Episodes Among Children --- United States, 2001|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microwaving of solid foods===
When baby food is microwaved in a jar it often heats unevenly. The hottest places are in the center of the foods. The coolest places are next to the glass sides, which could lead you to believe that the food is not too hot. Safe practices for microwaving food for infants are:
* Don't microwave baby foods in the jar. Instead, transfer the food to a dish before microwaving it. This way the food can be stirred and taste-tested for temperature.
* Microwave four ounces of solid food in a dish for about 15 seconds on high power. Always stir, let stand 30 seconds, and taste-test before feeding. Food that's "baby-ready" should taste or feel lukewarm.
* Do not heat baby-food meats, meat sticks or eggs in the microwave. Use the stovetop instead. These foods have a high fat content, and since microwaves heat fats faster than other substances, these foods can cause splattering and overheating.&lt;ref name = microwave&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foodsafety.gov/risk/children/index.html|title=Food Safety Concerns for Children Under Five|first=|last=ASPA|website=www.foodsafety.gov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First aid for choking===
Early and effective treatment is crucial to prevent morbidity and mortality from childhood choking. Methods taught routinely in courses on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or first aid can be lifesaving when instituted early by trained parents and caregivers. Opening the airway quickly by ejecting the foreign body can avoid potentially severe injuries. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all parents and caregivers participate in the American Heart Association's Basic Lifesaving Course or the American Red Cross' Infant/Child CPR Course&lt;ref name =cdcchoke/&gt;.  To prevent infant choking, be sure your child has adequate motor skills to swallow food&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/infant-choking/art-20044661?pg=2|title=What can I do to prevent infant choking?|last=|first=|date=|website=Mayoclinic.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Do not offer babies or young children high-risk foods, such as chunks of meat, cheese, grapes, or raw vegetables, unless they are cut up into small pieces&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/infants.html|title=CDC - Child Development, infants (0-1 years) NCBDDD|last=|first=|date=|website=cdc.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Avoid hard foods, such as nuts, seeds, and popcorn.

===Commercial baby food===
Infant food safety includes the evaluation of commercially prepared baby food before feeding it to a baby. Examining each jar of commercial baby food before using it and noting the position of the safety button on top of the jar will indicate whether or not the jar has been opened. Unopened baby food in jars will have a safety button that is down. A jar of baby food that is swelling, leaking, contain chipped glass is probably not safe to feed to a baby. Some baby food comes in pouches. If the pouch is leaking or swelling it may not be safe to feed to a baby.&lt;ref name = fsgov/&gt;

The Food and Drug administration has published the following ''do's'' and ''don'ts'' regarding commercial baby food safety:
* Do not “double dip” with baby food.
* Never put baby food in the refrigerator if the baby does not finish it. 
* It is best if a baby is not fed directly from the jar of baby food. 
* A small serving of food on a clean dish and refrigerating the remaining food in the jar is safer.
* If the baby needs more food from the same jar, using a clean spoon to serve another portion is safer. 
* It is safer to throw away any food in the dish that is not eaten. 
* If a baby is fed from a jar, it is safer to throw away any food left in the jar.
* Sharing spoons is not the safest way to feed a baby
* Putting the baby's spoon in the mouth of another person is not safe.
* Baby food left out for two hours or more will begin to grow bacteria at room temperature. It is not safe.
* If an opened baby food container is stored in the refrigerator for more than three days, it may not be safe to feed the baby. "If in doubt, throw it out".&lt;ref name="fsgov" /&gt;

==Handwashing==
# Wet hands thoroughly with warm water and add soap.
# Thoroughly scrub hands, wrists, fingernails, and in between fingers - for at least 20 seconds.
# Rinse, then dry hands with a clean cloth towel or use a paper towel so the germs are thrown away.&lt;ref name = form&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/cronobacter/index.html|title=Learn About Cronobacter|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===When to wash===
Handwashing prevents spreading infection. Washing before and after handling food, after using the bathroom, changing diapers, or handling pets.&lt;ref name = FDA2017/&gt;

==Epidemiology==

Caregivers of infants less than four months old:

* 41% didn't wash their hands after petting animals;

* 32% didn't wash their hands after changing the baby's diaper;

* 15% didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom;

* 10% didn't wash their hands after handling raw meat;

* 5% didn't wash their hands after gardening or working with soil.&lt;ref name = FDA2017/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5317">'''James Kennedy''' (born November 5, 1950) is an American [[social psychologist]], best known as an originator and researcher of [[particle swarm optimization]]. The first papers on the topic, by Kennedy and [[Russell C. Eberhart]], were presented in 1995; since then [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C21&amp;q=kennedy+swarm&amp;btnG= tens of thousands] of papers have been published on particle swarms. The Academic Press / Morgan Kaufmann book, ''[[Swarm Intelligence]]'', by Kennedy and Eberhart with Yuhui Shi, was published in 2001.

The [[particle swarm]] paradigm draws on social-psychological [[simulation]] research in which Kennedy had participated at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], integrated with [[evolutionary computation]] methods that Eberhart had been working with in the 1990s. The result was a problem-solving or [[optimization algorithm]] based on the principles of human social interaction. Individuals begin the program with random guesses at the problem solution. As the program runs, the "particles" share their successes with their topological neighbors; each particle is both teacher and learner. Over time, the population converges reliably on optimal vectors.

[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jez.b.22795 A recent paper] discusses the possible contribution of human female orgasm to the species' prosociality.

Kennedy has been an active combatant in the controversy over [[sex education]] in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], supporting the public schools' efforts to develop a comprehensive and inclusive program. He also worked to support a [[gender identity]] nondiscrimination law in Montgomery County that came under attack from conservatives.

He also worked as a professional musician for fifty years and currently plays in a [[rockabilly]] band called The Colliders, which released albums in 2011 and 2015. In 2018 Kennedy released a self-produced album, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpypSCGVWD8&amp;list=PL5YGtiYw_6JzsexxrfjmW20hQy2jlruQ8&amp;index=1 The Life of Mischief].

Kennedy worked in survey methods for the US government, and has conducted basic and applied [[research]] into social effects on [[cognition]] and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. He served as Director of the Office of Analysis and Research Services at the US International Trade Commission until his retirement in 2017. He has worked with particle swarms since 1994, with research publications in fields related and unrelated to swarms and surveys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3317">'''Katrina cough''' is a putative respiratory illness thought to be linked to exposure to [[mold]] and dust after the 2005 [[Hurricane Katrina]] in the [[United States]]. First described by doctors treating patients in the metro [[New Orleans]] area symptoms include [[cough]], [[paranasal sinus|sinus]] [[headache]], [[nasal congestion|congestion]], runny nose, and sore [[throat]], and [[conjunctivitis|pink eye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwltv.com/topstories/stories/WWL103105katrinacough.170a5332.html "Mold, dust contributing to spread of 'Katrina cough,'" WWL-TV, November 1, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;   This condition may make [[immunocompromised]] individuals more susceptible to bacterial [[bronchitis]] and [[sinusitis]]. Most patients are treated with [[antihistamine]]s, nasal sprays, and/or [[antibiotic]]s.

The Louisiana Office of Public Health conducted a [[case-control study]] of [[emergency department]] visits in New
Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  The OPH distributed a questionnaire to patients seeking treatment for cough, sinus drip, sneezing, wheezing, chest congestion, swollen red and puffy eye(s) and sore throat.  According to the study, state epidemiologists found no increase in the rate of New Orleans-area respiratory illnesses.  Although rates were found to be no different in comparison to state and country rates, the study showed that people with chronic sinus or respiratory symptoms were more affected by the hurricane.   

State epidemiologist Dr. Raoult Ratard disputed the existence of any disease cluster associated with the hurricane in 2006: "There is no such thing as a single condition such as ‘Katrina Cough’ that would be different from the bacterial and viral respiratory conditions we would expect to see at that time of year...no such outbreak occurred because of Hurricane Katrina."&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Media &amp; Communications. "Medical Study Shows No Increase in Respiratory Illnesses Because of Hurricane Katrina" ''[http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/news.asp?ID=192&amp;Detail=852 Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals]''. April 18, 2006. URL accessed on 2006-05-16. [http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/publications/pubs-192/KatrinaCoughReport.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2008, Henry Glindmeyer, researcher and professor of pulmonary, critical care and environmental medicine at the [[Tulane University School of Medicine]] is conducting a five-year study to determine if workers in New Orleans face risks from inhalant exposure to minute particles such as mold, fungi or bacteria. The study is funded by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], an agency of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], which is providing $1.86&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tulane.edu/news/newwave/010208_cough.cfm "Researcher Seeks Truth About 'Katrina Cough,'" ''New Wave'', Tulane University, January 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:キットカットに受験生向けメッセージ刻んであるんだが、なんかキツい (8358321632).jpg|thumb|A Japanese edition Kit Kat]]
Kit Kats were introduced to Japan in [[1973 in Japan|1973]] when [[Rowntree's]] made an agreement with [[Fujiya]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Demetriou|first1=Danielle|title=How the KitKat became a phenomenon in Japan|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/how-the-kitkat-became-a-phenomenon-in-japan/|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214022458/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/how-the-kitkat-became-a-phenomenon-in-japan/|archivedate=14 December 2015|date=12 December 2015 |deadurl=No}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, they were the top-selling confection in the country.&lt;ref name="AdAge" /&gt; The Kit Kat brand took the number one sales position from Meiji chocolate in 2012, though Meiji remains the leading confection company in Japan overall.&lt;ref name="Nieburg" /&gt;

In 2004, the green tea flavor was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/26/news/companies/flavored-kitkat-japan-nestle/index.html?sr=twmoney072617flavored-kitkat-japan-nestle1210PMVODtopLink&amp;linkId=40208435|title=Nestlé is building a factory just for flavored KitKats|last=Iyengar|first=Rishi|date=26 July 2017|website=CNN|access-date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the product has been sold in more than 300 seasonal and regional flavors.&lt;ref name="CNN Eatocracy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2015" /&gt; The top-selling flavor of the candy bar in 2010 was [[soy sauce]].&lt;ref name="AdAge" /&gt; Nestlé attributes the success of the flavor varieties to the tradition of [[Souvenir|''omiyage'']], in which regional specialties are brought back for family and co-workers from trips away.&lt;ref name="Guardian Gold"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nestle Japan strikes gold Kit Kat in single fingered salute to itself|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/nestle-japan-strikes-gold-kitkat-in-single-fingered-salute-to-itself|website=Guardian|accessdate=10 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120170401/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/nestle-japan-strikes-gold-kitkat-in-single-fingered-salute-to-itself|archivedate=20 January 2016 |deadurl=No}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company believes the limited-edition seasonal models create a "scarcity and rarity of value" for customers.&lt;ref name="Madden-inv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=51525533&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Break me off a piece of that soy-sauce bar|date=14 June 2010|publisher=Advertising Age|issue=24|last1=Madden|first1=Normandy|accessdate=10 February 2016}}{{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The business model was created to solve a problem the company found in Japanese [[convenience store]]s, which frequently rotated items and flavors off of shelves. By producing smaller runs of flavors, the company was better able to control its production costs.&lt;ref name="Madden-inv" /&gt; It was also economically viable in Japan because there is no initial product fee for listing new products in Japanese convenience stores.&lt;ref name="Madden-inv" /&gt;

Kit Kats in Japan are produced at Nestlé-owned factories in [[Himeji]] and [[Kasumigaura, Ibaraki|Kasumigaura]].  The milk chocolate used for Kit Kats is made from whole-milk powder and Nestlé buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa.&lt;ref name=Rao&gt;{{citation |last=Rao |first= Tejal |title=Big in Japan: the story of how Kit Kats became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 24, 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/24/magazine/candy-kit-kat-japan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santetsu 36-105 01.jpg|thumb|A train car with Kit Kat logos in Japan]]
Marketing for Kit Kats in Japan is believed to have benefited from the coincidental [[false cognate]] with "Kitto Katsu", a phrase meaning "You will surely win" in Japanese.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2015" /&gt; Some market research has shown that the brand is strongly correlated to good luck charms, particularly among students ahead of exams.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Superstition"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaidyanathan|first1=Rajiv|last2=Aggarwal|first2=Praveen|title=A Typology of Superstitious Behaviors: Implications for Marketing and Public Policy.|journal=Advances in Consumer Research – Latin American Conference Proceedings|date=2008|volume=2|pages=147–149|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=36211070&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=10 February 2016|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryall-Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryall|first1=Julien|title=Exam fever gives Japan a craving for Kit Kat|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/1482614/Exam-fever-gives-Japan-a-craving-for-Kit-Kat.html|accessdate=10 February 2016|agency=The Telegraph|date=2 February 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107073246/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/1482614/Exam-fever-gives-Japan-a-craving-for-Kit-Kat.html|archivedate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kit Kat's "Lucky Charm" advertising campaign in Japan won the Asian Brand Marketing Effectiveness Award in 2005.&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Media: Asia's Media &amp; Marketing Newspaper|journal=Media: Asia's Media &amp; Marketing Newspaper|date=15 July 2005|page=39|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=17829957&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=Haymarket Business Publications Ltd|issn=1562-1138|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nestlé and the Japan Post launched a campaign in 2009, allowing people to write messages and mail the chocolate bars from 20,000 post offices.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2015" /&gt; The special packages included a space to write a message of encouragement and affix a stamp.

'''Larry Dossey''' (born 1940,&lt;ref name=viafdossey/&gt; [[Groesbeck, Texas]]&lt;ref name=bplace/&gt;) is a physician and author who propounds the importance for [[healing]] of [[prayer]], [[spirituality]], and other non-physical factors.

==Biography==
According to his written biography on his personal website,&lt;ref name=ldsite&gt;[http://www.dosseydossey.com/larry/default.html Larry Dossey (biography)] (accessed 4 September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Dossey graduated from [[University of Texas at Austin]] and received an M.D. from [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] in Dallas (1967).&lt;ref name=ldsite/&gt; Dossey served as a battalion surgeon in Vietnam, being decorated for valor, and served as Chief of Staff of [[Medical City Dallas Hospital]] (1982).&lt;ref name=ldsite/&gt;

==Reception==
Dossey's writings and opinions have been controversial, having drawn both praise and criticism.&lt;!--- THIS SIMPLE STATEMENT THAT HE HAS "drawn both praise and criticism", IS EASILY "EXTRACTABLE" FROM THE REACTIONS. GOING FURTHER TO SAY SOMETHING MORE NUANCED RISKS ENGAGING IN ORIGINAL RESEARCH. BALANCED SECONDARY SOURCES WOULD BE DESIRABLE THAT CHARACTERIZE THE TYPES OF PRO AND CON REACTIONS---&gt;

Surgical oncologist [[David Gorski]] has written that Dossey utilizes [[straw man]] arguments, misrepresents and misunderstands [[medical research]] and "the evidence base in favor of the woo that Dr. Dossey favors is pathetic in comparison to that supporting science-based medicine."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/be-careful-what-you-ask-for-larry-dossey-deepak-chopra-and-rustum-roy-declare-war-on-science-based-medicine/ "Be careful what you wish for, Dr. Dossey, you just might get it"]. Science-Based Medicine. Retrieved 6 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 Dossey co-wrote a post in the [[Huffington Post]] called "The Mythology Of Science-Based Medicine" with [[Deepak Chopra]] and [[Rustum Roy]], which Gorski characterized as "an exercise that combines cherry-picking, logical fallacies, and whining, raising the last of these almost to an art form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gorski|first1=David|title=Be careful what you wish for, Dr. Dossey, you just might get it|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/be-careful-what-you-ask-for-larry-dossey-deepak-chopra-and-rustum-roy-declare-war-on-science-based-medicine/|work=Science-Based Medicine|date=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dossey|first1=Larry|last2=Chopra|first2=Deepak|last3=Roy|first3=Rustum|title=The Mythology Of Science-Based Medicine|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-larry-dossey/the-mythology-of-science_b_412475.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary P. Posner, a physician, has criticized Dossey for writing "New Age psychobabble". Posner in a review has stated that Dossey uncritically accepts psychic powers, [[parapsychology]] experiments and dubious claims such as [[wikt:voodoo|voodoo]] or "[[distant healing]]" as genuine, whilst ignoring the literature that has refuted these subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpposner.com/Healing_Words.html "Medical Practice Enters a New Age"]. Originally published in the Summer 1994 Skeptical Inquirer and in the Summer 1994 Tampa Bay Skeptics Report. Retrieved 6 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Robert A. Baker]] in a review for Dossey's ''Healing Words'' wrote that it is an entertaining book but "We'd all be better served-Dossey, his patients, his readers, and the general public-if Dossey would take his head out of the clouds, plant his feet on the ground, and stop talking nonsense. Everyone knows that evil looks won’t kill you. We also know that sticks and stones will break your bones and a doctor’s words alone-no matter how kind or gentle-will never heal you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/if_looks_could_kill_and_words_could_heal/ "If Looks Could Kill and Words Could Heal"]. Skeptical Inquirer. Retrieved 6 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Roberts in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' has described ''Healing Words'' as a religious book, useful to see how an argument could be made on how humans could utilize prayer to heal but some of the book was "convoluted new-age jargon".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John. (1995). ''Healing Words: The Power Of Prayer And The Practice Of Medicine by Larry Dossey''. [[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]. Vol. 311, No. 7013. p. 1174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dossey's views and activities have frequently been reported in the media. For example, ''[[Business Insider]]'' quoted Dossey as having "coined the term 'time-sickness' in 1982 to describe the belief that 'time is getting away, that there isn’t enough of it, and that you must pedal faster and faster to keep up.'"&lt;ref name=businessinsider2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Parrish |first1=Shane |title=The modern workplace is ruining the way we think |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-modern-workplace-is-ruining-the-way-we-think-2015-8 |accessdate=5 September 2015 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' described Dossey as a "distinguished American physician" and a "New York Times best-selling author", while quoting his views on [[Lorna Byrne]].&lt;ref name=belfasttelegraph2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brankin|first1=Una|title=Mum can be difficult to get organised... she gets so distracted by angels|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/mum-can-be-difficult-to-get-organised-she-gets-so-distracted-by-angels-31222778.html|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minnesota ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported that in 1993, Dossey had appeared on the [[Oprah Winfrey]] show, in an episode themed on the power of prayer, describing Dossey as "a physician who advocates for spirituality in health care".&lt;ref name="startribune2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pratt |first1=Anna |title='Make every day count': Words that a cancer survivor lives by |url=http://www.startribune.com/make-every-day-count-words-that-a-cancer-survivor-lives-by/261709521/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |work=[[Star Tribune]] (Minnesota) |date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Puerto Rico]] is and has been in economic crisis for a very long time due to the unpayable debt the island has. As of 2015 it is 72 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ora|first=Bannan, Natasha Lycia|date=2016|title=Puerto Rico's Odious Debt: The Economic Crisis of Colonialism|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/clr/vol19/iss2/5/|journal=City University of New York Law Review|language=en|volume=19|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mounting debt has caused a lot of damage to the society in question. Cutbacks on a lot of necessities in the island have caused a health care problem. In the mental health care, the problem grows bigger as people find themselves unemployed or with lack of good jobs a lot of people have fled the island,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iniciativacomunitaria.org/homeless-drug-addicted-more-vulnerable-amid-puerto-rico-debt-crisis/?lang=en|title=Iniciativa Comunitaria {{!}} Homeless, drug-addicted more vulnerable amid Puerto Rico debt crisis|website=www.iniciativacomunitaria.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a lack of professionals.

With a large amount of people migrating out of Puerto Rico to find better jobs an opportunity, professionals and students are lacking. This greatly impacts the mental healthcare of the public, with a lack of people and funds to pay professionals, leaving those who are in need, to suffer. This leaves the mental health care specialized areas severely limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiménez|first=J.|last2=Rivera|first2=D.|last3=Benítez|first3=P.|last4=Tarrats|first4=H.|last5=Ramos|first5=A.|date=2013-09-01|title=Integrating Mental Health Services into a General Hospital in Puerto Rico|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10880-012-9352-x|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=294–301|doi=10.1007/s10880-012-9352-x|issn=1068-9583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suicide rate in Puerto Rico is high with it being one of the top 15 causes of death in the island.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vera|first=Mildred|last2=Reyes-Rabanillo|first2=María L|last3=Huertas|first3=Sarah|last4=Juarbe|first4=Deborah|last5=Pérez-Pedrogo|first5=Coralee|last6=Huertas|first6=Aracelis|last7=Peña|first7=Marisol|date=2011-03-11|title=Suicide ideation, plans, and attempts among general practice patients with chronic health conditions in Puerto Rico |journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=4|pages=197–205|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S17156 |pmc=3068880|pmid=21475631}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study shows that people with chronic illnesses are likely to think about, and attempt suicide. 25% of all suicides attempts are committed by people with chronic illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Suicide ideation]] is high among people with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and active depression symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Socioeconomic issues were linked to increased suicide attempts or ideation by education, those without a college degree were more likely to think about or commit suicide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The professionals in charge of treating mental illness lack training in suicide prevention is also a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiménez Chafey|first=Maria|last2=Serra Taylor|first2=José|last3=Irizarry Robles|first3=Carol|date=July 2013|title=University Mental Health Professionals in Puerto Rico: Suicide Experiences, Attitudes, Practices, and Intervention Skills|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=5a29df02-a2dc-40cd-a7a9-2ee8a5fa29f6%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=89440163&amp;db=a9h|journal=Journal of College Student Psychotherapy|volume=27|pages=238–253|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Puerto Rico, 60% of children live in [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsismybusiness.com/children-living-poverty/|title=Study: Some 60% of P.R.’s children living in poverty {{!}} News is my Business|last=admin|website=newsismybusiness.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research and statistics, men tend to lash out in violence when unemployed. It threatens their masculinity and to re-ensure power and control, they would physically and mentally abuse their wife or significant others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=Alice E. Colón|date=2003|title=Puerto Rico: Feminism and Feminist Studies|jstor=3594704|journal=Gender and Society|volume=17|issue=5|pages=664–690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, women and men both lack the potential and qualification to retain a job. The stress of experiencing poverty and the lack of financial support impacts executive functions. In the case of poverty, people are prone to experience depression, stress, [[addiction]], low self-esteem and suicide. As mentioned above, suicide records in Puerto Rico reached a high 25% before the 20th century. In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Maria]], researchers and ‘The Commission for the  Prevention of Suicide’ reported an 16% increase. Approximately, a suicide per day since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/puerto-rico-mental-health-hurricane-maria-us-780062|title=Doctors in Puerto Rico are blaming Hurricane Maria for the spike in suicide rates|date=2018-01-13|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel C. Marston, a cognitive and behavioral psychologist, conducted a study on the ‘Neurobehavioral and psychological effect on poverty’. Marston's findings distinguish the differences poverty has on adults, children, families and new moms. As stated, the psychological effects with poverty causes depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Marston's study states that adults in poverty display higher levels of withdrawal symptoms, somatic complaints and pervasive negative thinking. Adults are impacted by feeling worry and anxious about what how handle the situation. In contrast, children are impacted by feeling a sense of helplessness and lack of control. Children are more likely to experience developmental delays, attention problem and disciplinary problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/indicator/2013/01/poverty-behaviors.aspx|title=Neurobehavioral effects of poverty|website=www.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, factors such as  poverty, lack of resources, malnutrition and environmental factors significantly impacts a fetus physical development and executive functions. They are in higher risks to develop [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[autism]]. Newborn babies are troubled by lack of proper functions, such as communicating and socializing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On the other hand, denial may not be the case for all Puerto Ricans since the economic crisis effects most poverty and minority individuals. Lack of public resources affects both the psychologist and patient. According to the welfare system, they will be responsible to cover some of the many visits, medication and tests. Leaving unemployed or lower class Puerto Ricans responsible to pay out of pocket for further services. To top it off, beginning 2018, [[Ricardo Rosselló|Governor Ricardo Rosselló]] enforced work/employment requirement for welfare recipients on the island, presenting great challenges for Puerto Ricans, when more than 48% of the island's people live below the federally defined [[poverty line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/puerto-ricos-man-made-disaster-might-be-worse-than-the-hurricane/|title=Puerto Rico's Man-Made Disaster Might Be Worse than the Hurricane {{!}} Daniel J. Mitchell|date=2017-10-16|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first epidemiological study the status of mental health in Puerto Rico in 1985, shows that 165,497 people suffer from serious conditions in a population of 3,187,671. Many of the participants suffered from mental, emotional and behavioral conditions, while many remained silent. Quoting the research, facilities accepted and treated those with serious and disabling conditions and not to those who, despite also suffering from mental illnesses, are still considered “functional.” One out of every 10 Puerto Rican, since 1985, have suffered from [[anxiety]] and [[panic disorder]], [[mood disorders]] and depression. Some experienced a combination of disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/criticalstateofmentalhealthinpuertorico-2281421/|title=Critical State of Mental Health in Puerto Rico|date=2017-01-16|work=El Nuevo Dia|access-date=2018-05-11|language=es-pr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel C. Marston concluded, “lack of access to appropriate care due to economic crisis, traditionally identified as in main reason why people in poverty do not receive services to help address neuro-behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;” Overall the economic crisis in Puerto Rico negatively affects all aspects of life but the mental healthcare system is an important aspect of this.

==Investigations==

===Highway tour bus companies===
After a fatal bus accident on April 29, 2012, where a bus bound for [[Tokyo Disneyland]] crashed in [[Gunma Prefecture]] killing seven and injuring 39 others,&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120430a1.html Bus crash in Gunma leaves seven dead, 39 injured April 30 2012] Retrieved on July 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the ministry launched an investigation into highway bus companies. Investigations were carried out at a total of 339 businesses. It was discovered that 95.6% (324 firms) were violating the [[Labor Standards Act of 1947|Labor Standards Law]] and the Industrial Safety and Health Law. 219 businesses (64.6%) broke the law by having their drivers work behind the wheel more than the legal maximum of eight hours a day and 40 hours a week, or longer than what was agreed upon with their [[Labor unions in Japan|labor union]]. It also found 37 businesses, (10.9%), did not provide "at least one day off a week," which the law obliges employers to give their drivers. Also, it found that 260 (76.6%) did not observe standards involving bus driver working hours, which prohibit them from working more than 16 hours a day in combined driving and office time. The ministry said it took "corrective measures" with those who violated the laws.&lt;ref&gt;The Yomiuri Shimbun [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120719004995.htm 80% of tour bus firms found to violate laws July 20 2012] Retrieved on July 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Published ministry employee and outspoken critic Moriyo Kimura states that the ministry's medical officers (''ikei gikan'') are "corrupt and self-serving."  Kimura states that the officers, who number 250, have little experience and see no patients nor practice medicine after being hired by the ministry.  Thus, says Kimura, Japan's public health policies lag behind other developed countries, by "decades".&lt;ref&gt;Otake, Tomoko, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2009/11/01/general/ministry-insider-speaks-out/ Ministry insider speaks out]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', November 1, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molecular modification''' is chemical alteration of a known and previously characterized [[lead compound]] for the purpose of enhancing its usefulness as a [[drug]]. This could mean enhancing its specificity for a particular body target site, increasing its [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]], improving its rate and extent of [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]], modifying to advantage its time course in the body, reducing its [[toxicity]], changing its [[physical property|physical]] or [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (like [[solubility]]) to provide desired features.

==Modification for water solubility==
Molecular modification is used to enhance drug’s water solubility by incorporating water solubilizing groups in its structure. The discussion of the introduction of water solubilizing groups into the structure of a lead compound can be conveniently broken down into four general areas:

* The type of group introduced;
* Whether the introduction is reversible or irreversible;
* The position of incorporation; and
* The chemical route of introduction.

===The type of group===
The incorporation of [[Chemical polarity|polar]] [[functional group]]s, such as the [[alcohol]], [[amine]], [[amide]], [[carboxylic acid]], [[sulfonic acid]] and [[phosphate]] groups, which either ionize or are capable of relatively strong intermolecular forces of attraction with water ([[hydrogen bond]]ing), will usually result in analogues with an increased water solubility. Acidic and basic groups are particularly useful, since these groups can be used to form salts, which would give a wider range of dosage forms for the final product. However, the formation of zwitterions by the introduction of either an acid group into a structure containing a base or a base group into a structure containing an acid group can reduce water solubility. Introduction of weakly polar groups, such as [[carboxylic acid ester]]s, [[aryl halide]]s and [[alkyl halide]]s, will not significantly improve water solubility and can result in enhanced lipid solubility.

The incorporation of acidic residues into a lead structure is less likely to change the type of activity, but it can result in the analogue exhibiting [[hemolysis|haemolytic]] properties. Furthermore, the introduction of an [[aromatic]] acid group usually results in [[anti-inflammatory]] activity, whilst carboxylic acids with an alpha functional group may act as chelating agents. Basic water solubilizing groups have a tendency to change the mode of action, since bases often interfere with neurotransmitters and biological processes involving amines. However, their incorporation does mean that the analogue can be formulated as a wide variety of acid salts. Non-ionizable groups do not have the disadvantages of acidic and basic groups.

===Reversibly and irreversibly attached groups===
The type of group selected also depends on the degree of permanency required. Groups that are bound directly to the carbon skeleton of the lead compound by less reactive C–C, C–O and C–N bonds are likely to be irreversibly attached to the lead structure.

Groups that are linked to the lead by ester, amide, phosphate, sulfate and glycosidic bonds are more likely to be [[metabolism|metabolized]] from the resulting analogue to reform the parent lead compound as the analogue is transferred from its point of administration to its site of action. Compounds with this type of solubilizing group are acting as prodrugs and so their activity is more likely to be the same as the parent lead compound. However, the rate of loss of the solubilizing group will depend on the nature of the transfer route, and this could affect the activity of the drug.

===The position of the water solubilizing group===
In order to preserve the type of activity exhibited by the [[lead compound]], the water solubilizing group should be attached to a part of the structure that is not involved in the drug–receptor interaction. Consequently, the route used to introduce a new water solubilizing group and its position in the lead structure will depend on the relative reactivities of the pharmacophore and the rest of the molecule. The reagents used to introduce the new water solubilizing group should be chosen on the basis that they do not react with, or in close proximity to, the pharmacophore. This will reduce the possibility of the new group affecting the relevant drug–receptor interactions.

===Methods of introduction===
Water solubilizing groups are best introduced at the beginning of a drug [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]], although they may be introduced at any stage. Introduction at the beginning avoids the problem of a later introduction changing the type and/or nature of the drug–receptor interaction. A wide variety of routes may be used to introduce a water solubilizing group; the one selected will depend on the type of group being introduced and the chemical nature of the target structure. Many of these routes require the use of protecting agents to prevent unwanted reactions of either the water solubilizing group or the lead structure.

===Acidic and basic groups===
Examples of water solubilizing structures and the routes used to introduce them into the lead structures. O-alkylation, N-alkylation, O-acylation and N-acylation reactions are used to introduce both acidic and basic groups. [[Acetylation]] methods use both the appropriate [[acid chloride]] and [[anhydride]].

Examples of water solubilizing structures and the routes used to introduce them into lead structures. Phosphate acid halides have been used to introduce phosphate groups into lead structures. Structures containing hydroxy groups have been introduced by reaction of the corresponding monochlorinated hydrin and the use of suitable epoxides amongst other methods. Sulphonic acid groups may be introduced by either direct sulfonation or the addition of bisulfite to reactive C = C bonds amongst other methods.

'''National Doughnut Day''', or '''National Donut Day''' — celebrated in the United States, is on the first Friday of June of each year, succeeding the Doughnut event created by [[The Salvation Army]] in [[Chicago]] in 1938 to honor those of their members who served doughnuts to soldiers during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Holey holiday"&gt;Kevin Fagan [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/06/BAEQ181KO9.DTL A holey holiday – National Donut Day] February 31, 2009 SF Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday celebrates the [[doughnut]].

==History==
National Doughnut Day started in 1938&lt;ref name="Holey holiday" /&gt; as a fund raiser for [[Chicago]]'s [[The Salvation Army]]. Their goal was to help those in need during the [[Great Depression]], and to honor The Salvation Army "Lassies" of World War I, who served doughnuts to soldiers.

Soon after the US entrance into [[World War I]] in 1917, The Salvation Army sent a fact-finding mission to France. The mission concluded that the needs of US enlisted men could be met by canteens/social centers termed "huts" that could serve baked goods, provide writing supplies and stamps, and provide a clothes-mending service. Typically, six staff members per hut would include four female volunteers who could "mother" the boys. These huts were established by The Salvation Army in the United States near army training centers.

About 250 Salvation Army volunteers went to France. Because of the difficulties of providing freshly baked goods from huts established in abandoned buildings near to the front lines, the two Salvation Army volunteers (Ensign [[Margaret Sheldon]] and Adjutant [[Helen Purviance]]) came up with the idea of providing doughnuts. These are reported to have been an "instant hit", and "soon many soldiers were visiting The Salvation Army huts". Margaret Sheldon wrote of one busy day: "Today I made 22 pies, 300 doughnuts, 700 cups of coffee."

Soon, the women who did this work became known by the servicemen as "Doughnut Girls".&lt;ref name="Doughboy Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/doughnut.htm |title=Doughboy Center – The Story of the American Expeditionary Forces |author=Susan Mitchem, Director of the Archives at Salvation Army Headquarters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doughnut Dollies 1918 France.jpg|Doughnut Dollies 1918 France.jpg|right|thumb|Doughnut Dollies were women volunteers of the Salvation Army, who traveled to France in 1918 to support US soldiers]]

A misconception has taken hold that the provision of doughnuts to US enlisted men in World War I is the origin of the term "[[doughboy]]" to describe US infantry. But, the term was in use as early as the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–47.{{Citation needed |reason=No source provided that says term originated during Mexican-American War era, nor is it mentioned in said article. The Doughboy article similarly needs better citation (see Doughboy Talk page). During WWI, "doughboys" refers to the apparent wealth of U.S. soldiers newly joining the war; dough being a euphemism for money. |date=June 2012}}

In Chicago and other cities, National Doughnut Day is still a fundraiser for The Salvation Army.  In 2017, the organization joined with Russ's Market, Super Saver, LaMar's Donuts, Hurts Donut and [[Krispy Kreme]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] and [[Tempe, Arizona]] to raise funds on National Doughnut Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/local-bakeries-offer-free-or-cheap-doughnuts-friday/article_1772f924-e0df-5e24-84af-ebd9a9fd53ca.html|title=Local bakeries offer free or cheap doughnuts Friday|last=Star|first=Lincoln Journal|work=JournalStar.com|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Second World War, Red Cross Volunteers also distributed doughnuts, and it became routine to refer to the Red Cross girls as Doughnut Dollies as well.

There are three other doughnut holidays, the origins of which are obscure. International Jelly-Filled Doughnut Day is widely recognized as June 8 (occasionally as June 9).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foodimentary.com/2016/06/08/june-8-is-national-jelly-filled-doughnut-day/|title=June 8th is National Jelly-Filled Donut Day|date=2016-06-08|website=Foodimentary – National Food Holidays|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Cream-Filled Doughnut Day is celebrated on September 14&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.punchbowl.com/holidays/national-cream-filled-donut-day|title=National Cream Filled Donut Day|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is also a National Boston Cream Pie Day observed October 23rd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-boston-cream-pie-day-october-23/|title=NATIONAL BOSTON CREAM PIE DAY|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buy a Doughnut Day occurs on October 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdkitchen.com/recipes/articles/view/310/1/Buy-a-Doughnut-Day.html|title=Buy a Doughnut Day – Fun Food Holiday {{!}} CDKitchen|website=CDKitchen|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birthday of the [[United States Marine Corps]] was once referred to as National Donut Day, in a successful ruse by American prisoners of war at [[Son Tay prison camp]] to trick the North Vietnamese into giving out donuts in honor of the occasion.&lt;ref name=USMC-Donut-Day&gt;{{cite web|title=Today is National Donut Day: A funny POW story|url=http://blog.usni.org/2009/11/10/today-is-national-donut-day-a-funny-pow-story|work=November 10, 2009|publisher=US Naval Institute|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nose-blowing''' is the act of expelling nasal [[mucus]] by [[exhaling]] forcefully through the [[Human nose|nose]], usually into a [[facial tissue]] or [[handkerchief]].  In some cultures, blowing one's nose in public may be considered a breach of [[etiquette]].

[[File:Sneeze_in_white_hankie.jpg|thumb|Woman blowing her nose]]

Nose-blowing may be used to alleviate [[nasal congestion]] or [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose).  A 2000 study showed that nose-blowing produces a high degree of pressure in the nasal cavities and may worsen a [[Common cold|cold]] by propelling nasal mucus into the [[paranasal sinuses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nose blowing propels nasal fluid into the paranasal sinuses |last=Gwaltney |first=JM Jr. |last2=Hendley |first2=JO |last3=Phillips |first3=CD |last4=Bass |first4=CR |last5=Mygind |first5=N |last6=Winther |first6=B |work=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]] |date=February 2000 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=387–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paxherbals''' also known as '''Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories''' is a Nigerian [[alternative medicine]] product manufacturing company founded by [[Adodo Anselm]] in 1996 at [[Ewu Monastery]].

The company adopted a science-based approach to its [[Traditional African medicine]] brand of alternative medicine by establishing three sets of science laboratories for its operations.&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Itchen|first1=Jame etal|title=Modern African Remedies - Herbal Medicine and Community Development in Nigeria|journal=Policy Voice Series|date=April 2015|issue=April 2015|url=http://www.africaresearchinstitute.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ARI-Policy-Voice-Pax-Herbal-download.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was with a view to diffusing the age-long bias associated with African herbal practices in Nigeria and in most parts of Africa which associated [[herbal medicine]] with [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[ritualism]], [[paganism]], and all sorts of [[Fetishism|fetish]] practices.

==History==
[[File:Paxherbals outside view at a distance.jpg|thumb|Pax Herbal Center complex]]
===1997 to 2007===
In 1997, the founder of Paxherbals ([[Adodo Anselm]]) started a small herbal garden in [[Ewu Monastery]] where he grew medicinal plants. The first herbal preparations from the herbal garden were used in making herbal remedies for common ailments like [[malaria]] and [[cough]]. A loan of about thirty thousand Nairas (NGN 40,000 or approx. $200) was used to build a three-room clinic where patients from nearby villages were attended to by Anselm and his first employee Gbogbo John. The three-room clinic soon came to be called Pax Herbal Center.&lt;ref name="taylor2017" /&gt;
By May 2006, Paxherbals have built a set of laboratories which was commissioned by Chief [[Lucky Igbinedion]], Governor of [[Edo State]] (1999-2007).&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt; The laboratories include a quality control laboratory and microbiology laboratory.&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt; By 2008, Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories had become the biggest, best-equipped, best organized, and most modern herbal research center in Africa.&lt;ref name="lessem2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ronnie|first1=Lessem|title=The Integrators: The Next Evolution in Leadership, Knowledge and Value Creation|date=2016|publisher=Routledge: Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1472481214|page=86|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Integrators-The-Next-Evolution-in-Leadership-Knowledge-and-Value/Lessem/p/book/9781472481214|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor2017" /&gt;

Poor regulation and insufficient research has always been the bane of herbal medicine practice in Africa.&lt;ref name=van1999&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Wyk|first1=Ben-Erik|last2=van Oudtshoorn|first2=Bosch|last3=Gericke|first3=Nigel|year=1999|title=Medicinal Plants of South Africa|page=7|location=Pretoria|publisher=Briza Publications|isbn=978-1-875093-37-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to change this narrative, Paxherbals created a research team which is a mixture of exogenous (pharmacists, botanists, pharmacologists, microbiologists, laboratory scientists and plant scientists) and the indigenous (traditional birth attendants, bone setters, local taxonomists, village historians, and chemists).&lt;ref name="lessem2016" /&gt; The research team is headed by professor Okogun Joseph, who is the head of Scientific Research and Development.&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt;

===With Institute of African Studies===
[[File:Herberium.jpg|thumb|Paherbals herbarium laboratory]]
Paxherbals have formed a partnership with the [[Institute of African Studies]] (IAS) with the view of changing the way herbal medicine is learned and taught in Nigeria. With the university's curriculum committee approving a new curriculum, the university is open to admitting students for masters and Ph.D studies in Traditional African Medicine.&lt;ref name="THEGUARD1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muanya|first1=Chukwuma|title=Why government should invest in trado-medicine development|url=https://guardian.ng/features/why-government-should-invest-in-trado-medicine-development/|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian Newspapers|accessdate=4 May 2017|ref=THEGUARD1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
A major challenge to research effort at Paxherbals has been Nigerian government's regulations which requires that clinical trials have to be done in partnership with the government and so far, this have not proved possible&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt; until 2016 when some collaborative efforts was recorded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3205">Detection of [[peroxide]] gives the initial evidence of [[rancidity]] in unsaturated fats and oils. Other methods are available, but '''peroxide value''' is the most widely used. It gives a measure of the extent to which an oil sample has undergone primary oxidation, extent of secondary oxidation may be determined from p-anisidine test.&lt;ref&gt;Chemistry And Technology Of Oils And Fats [http://www.alliedpublishers.com/BookDetails.aspx?BookId=228 Chemistry And Technology Of Oils And Fats By Dr. M.M. Chakrabarty]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[double bond]]s found in fats and oils play a role in [[autoxidation]]. Oils with a high degree of [[Unsaturated fat|unsaturation]] are most susceptible to autoxidation. The best test for [[autoxidation]] (oxidative rancidity) is determination of the peroxide value. [[Peroxide]]s are intermediates in the autoxidation reaction.

Autoxidation is a [[Free radical addition|free radical reaction]] involving [[oxygen]] that leads to deterioration of fats and oils which form off-flavours and off-odours. Peroxide value, concentration of peroxide in an oil or fat, is useful for assessing the extent to which spoilage has advanced.

== Definition ==

The peroxide value is defined as the amount of peroxide oxygen per 1 [[kilogram]] of fat or oil. Traditionally this was expressed in units of [[milliequivalent]]s, although if we are using [[SI unit]]s then the appropriate option would be in [[millimole]]s per [[kilogram]] (N.B. 1 milliequivalents = 0.5 millimole; because 1 mEq of O2 =1&amp;nbsp;mmol/2=0.5&amp;nbsp;mmol of O2, where 2 is valence). &lt;!-- See discussion page --&gt; Note also that the unit of milliequivalent has been commonly abbreviated as mequiv or even as meq.

==Method==
The peroxide value is determined by measuring the amount of [[iodine]] which is formed by the reaction of peroxides (formed in fat or oil) with [[iodide]] ion.

2 I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + HOOH    -&gt;    HOH + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Note that the [[Base (chemistry)|base]] produced in this reaction is taken up by the excess of [[acetic acid]] present. The iodine liberated is titrated with [[sodium thiosulphate]].

2S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;    -&gt;    S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The acidic conditions (excess acetic acid) prevents formation of hypoiodite (analogous to [[hypochlorite]]), which would interfere with the reaction.

The indicator used in this reaction is a [[Starch indicator|starch solution]] where [[amylose]] forms a blue to black solution with iodine and is colourless where iodine is [[Redox titration|titrated]].

A precaution that should be observed is to add the starch indicator solution only near the [[Equivalence point|end point]] (the end point is near when fading of the yellowish iodine colour occurs) because at high iodine concentration starch is decomposed to products whose indicator properties are not entirely reversible.

==Taste==

Peroxide values of fresh oils are less than 10 milliequivalents/kg; when the peroxide value is between 30* and 40 milliequivalents/kg, a rancid taste is noticeable.

Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana Kendra (PMBJPK) have been set up to provide generic drugs, which are available at lesser prices but are equivalent in quality and efficacy as expensive branded drugs. BPPI (Bureau of Pharma Public Sector Undertakings of India) has been established under the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Govt. of India, with the support of all the CPSUs for co-coordinating procurement, supply and marketing of generic drugs through Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://janaushadhi.gov.in|title=Jan Aushadhi : An Initiative of Government of India {{!}} Generic Medicine Campaign Improving Access to Medicines|website=janaushadhi.gov.in|access-date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
“Jan Aushadhi” is the novel project launched by Government of India in the year 2014 for the noble cause – Quality Medicines at Affordable Prices for All. The campaign was undertaken through sale of generic medicines through exclusive outlets namely “Jan Aushadhi Medical Store”in various districts of the country. In September 2015, the 'Jan Aushadhi Scheme' was revamped as 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana' (PMJAY). In November 2016, to give further impetus to the scheme, it was again renamed as "Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana" (PMBJP).

== Criticism ==
The concept of Jan Aushadhi Kendra, which was launched at government hospitals to provide patients with medicines at affordable rates, has miserably failed to serve its purpose at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana. Only 20 per cent patients at Civil Hospital are able to benefit from this facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/community/jan-aushadhi-kendra-no-relief-to-most-patients/383771.html|title=Jan Aushadhi Kendra no relief to most patients|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stores, set up under the Jan Aushadhi Scheme to provide non-branded generic medicines to all, haven’t stocked common medicines for months for lack of supply. These include medicines for seasonal infections, gas, cough, cold, etc. Officials said the shortage of medicines is due to logistical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2017/jun/24/govts-cheap-medicine-scheme-falls-sick-1620516.html|title=Govt’s cheap medicine scheme falls sick|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

The PsAQoL was first published in 2004 by Galen Research. The development of the measure was a joint effort between Galen Research, the [[University of Leeds]] and [[St. Vincent’s University Hospital]] in Dublin. The study was funded by the [[Arthritis Research Campaign]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="mckenna" /&gt;

[[Qualitative research|Qualitative]] interviews were conducted with 48 patients, after which a 51-item questionnaire was created. A follow up survey with 94 patients was then conducted which reduced the items to 35.

The PsAQoL has also been utilized in [[clinical research]] studies in order to determine whether a medication or treatment is effective in treating psoriatic arthritis. If the scores on the PsAQoL change after treatment, this means that the given treatment has had an effect on quality of life.

'''Sahasralinga Tank''' or '''Sahasralinga Talav''' is a medieval artificial water tank in [[Patan, Gujarat]], [[India]]. It was commissioned during [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] (Solanki) rule, but now it is empty and in a ruined state. It is a [[Monument of National Importance]] protected by [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (N-GJ-161).

==Legend==
[[Jasma Odan]], a wife of Rooda who belonged to the Od community of tank diggers, cursed [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya ruler]], [[Jayasimha Siddharaja|Siddhraj Jaisinh]] when he proposed her marriage who was captivated by her beauty. Due to the curse, the tank was not filled with water. To repeal the curse, a human sacrifice was needed. Mayo or Mahya, from lower caste Dhed community, committed self-sacrifice which resulted in water filling the tank. Jaysinh, out of gratitude, allowed his caste to stay with higher castes in town.&lt;ref name="Ray2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bharati Ray|title=Women of India: Colonial and Post-colonial Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJFwK8XYQMkC&amp;pg=PA527|date=4 October 2005|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-3409-7|pages=527–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bharati Ray|author2=Swati Joshi|title=Different Types of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9x5FX2RROZgC&amp;pg=PA374|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1818-6|pages=374–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(India)1965"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gujarat (India)|title=Gujarat State Gazetteers: Rajkot District|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSAbAAAAIAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Directorate of Government Print., Stationery and Publications, Gujarat State|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bairam Khan is assassinated by an Afghan at Patan, 1561, Akbarnama.jpg|left|thumb|Bairam Khan is assassinated by an Afghan at Patan, 1561, Akbarnama]]
Sahasralinga Tank are among the many artificial tanks built in different parts of Gujarat under the patronages of [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]] (1092-1142 AD).

[[Bairam Khan]], Akbar's tutor, while passing through Patan on his way to Mecca, was said to have been murdered after he returned from boating in this tank in 1561.

The architecture of this tank integrated the great sense of water management and sanctity of water in Hindu religion. The tank used to receive water from a canal of the Saraswati River and had spread of about 5&amp;nbsp;km with good stone masonry embankments. There were thousand Shiva Shrines on the edge of the tank. Some remains of the same are even visible today.

One of the largest and the grandest in size is the Sahasralinga Tank. It must have been a reservoir of immense size and derived its name from the numerous little temples containing linga placed on the banks which were dismantled during the late medieval period, when a large octagonal rouza was raised on a part of its ruins. The great embankment surrounding it is of solid brick work and was faced with stone masonry forming flights of steps to the water's edge. Near the middle of the eastern embankment are the remains of the old Siva temple, comprising the basements of the pavilions together with a colonnade of forty eight pillars; it was in good condition till 16th century A.D.
Towards the western end there is a rudra kupa in which water from the river Saraswati was collected and then allowed to pass into the inlet channel of the Sahasralinga Tank. This cistern is about forty meters in diameter.&lt;ref name="Pandya2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaushik Pandya|title=A journey to the glorious Gujarat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4MMAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Akshara Prakashan|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spelling confusion== 
Saha'''sr'''a &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shabdkosh.com/sa/translate/sahasra/sahasra-meaning-in-Sanskrit-English|title=Sahasra}}&lt;/ref&gt;is the correct suffix that means "a thousand", not Saha'''s'''T'''r'''a. However, it is invariably misspelled as the latter. Notice how the same suffix is spelled when it occurs in family names (example: Sahasrabuddhe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vinaysahasrabuddhe.in/|title=Sahasrabuddhe}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ''without'' a T. The confusion arises because the hindi letter "Sa" (स) merges with "ra" (र) and looks like "tra".

'''Sorokdo''' (Sorok island) is an island in [[Goheung]], [[Jeolla]], [[South Korea]]. "Sorok" means "small deer", which the island's coastline, viewed from above, is supposed to resemble.

==Travelling to Sorokdo==
It takes five minutes to reach Sorokdo from Nokdong-hang (Nokdong harbor) in [[Goheung]]. As of 3 March 2009, Sorok-Daegyo (bridge) is open for traffic.

==Leper Colony==
Sorokdo is the site of a [[leper colony]] with a history of [[patient abuse]] including slave labor, [[Sterilization_(medicine)|forced sterilizations]], and starvation, under both Japanese and Korean administration.&lt;ref name = The_State_2013&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thestate.com/2013/11/24/3119624/ex-leprosy-patients-return-to.html | title = Korean ex-leprosy patients return to island colony | work = The State |date = 2013-11-24 | accessdate=2013-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = The_Independent_2013&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/sorok-island-the-last-leper-colony-462293.html | title = Sorok Island: The last leper colony | work = The State |date = 2007-08-20 | accessdate=2013-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''StatsDirect''' is a [[List of statistical packages|statistical software package]] designed for biomedical, public health, and general health science uses. The second generation of the software was reviewed in general medical&lt;ref name="Freemantle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freemantle|first=Nick|title=CD: StatsDirect---Statistical Software for Medical Research in the 21st Century|journal=BMJ|date=16 December 2000|volume=321|issue=7275|pages=1536|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7275.1536}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public health journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipp|first=Alastair|title=Stats Direct|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=1 September 2002|volume=24|issue=3|pages=242|doi=10.1093/pubmed/24.3.242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and use ==
StatsDirect's interface is menu driven and has editors for spreadsheet-like data and reports. The function library includes common medical statistical methdods that can be extended by users via an [[XML]]-based description that can embed calls to native StatsDirect numerical libraries, [[R (programming language)|R]] scripts, or algorithms in any of the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] languages (such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.Net]], [[J Sharp|J#]], or [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]).&lt;ref name="SDTech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statsdirect.com/sd3technology.aspx|title=StatsDirect Technologies|publisher=StatsDirect Ltd|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common statistical misconceptions are challenged by the interface. For example, users can perform a [[chi-square test]] on a two-by-two table, but they are asked whether the data are from a [[Cohort study|cohort (perspective)]] or [[Case-control study|case-control (retrospective)]] study before delivering the result. Both processes produce a chi-square test result but more emphasis is put on the appropriate statistic for the inference, which is the odds ratio for retrospective studies and relative risk for prospective studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Cole|title=Statistical Testing in Practice with StatsDirect|year=2013|url=http://www.coledavis.org/book.html|isbn=978-1605944500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Professor Iain Buchan of the [[University of Manchester]] wrote a doctoral thesis on the foundational work and is credited as creator of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchan|first=Iain Edward|title=The Development of a Statistical Computer Software Resource for Medical Research (MD Thesis)|url=http://www.statsdirect.com/thesis/md.pdf|publisher=University of Liverpool|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchan said he wished to address the problem of clinicians lacking the statistical knowledge to select and interpret statistical functions correctly, and often misusing software written by and for statisticians as a result.

The software debuted in 1989 as Arcus, then Arcus ProStat in 1993, both written for the DOS platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adler|first=Eric|title=Arcus Pro-Stat 3 (Short Reviews)|journal=Personal Computer World|date=March 1994|pages=306|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/690/Personal-Computer-World-March-1994/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arcus Quickstat for Windows followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sachdev|first=Harshi|title=Arcus Quickstat (Multimedia Review)|journal=Indian Pediatrics|date=October 1999|volume=36|issue=10|pages=1075–1076|url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/oct99-16.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, an expanded version, StatsDirect, was released for Microsoft Windows.&lt;ref name="Freemantle"/&gt; In 2013, the third generation of this software was released, written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] for the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] platform.&lt;ref name="SDTech"/&gt;

StatsDirect reports embed the metadata necessary to replay calculations, which may be needed if the original data is ever updated. The reproducible report technology follows the [[Research Objects|research object]] approach for replaying in "eLabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bechhofer, Sean; Buchan, Iain; De Roure, David; Missier, Paolo; Ainsworth, John; Bhagat, Jiten; Couch, Philip; Cruickshank, Don; Delderfield, Mark; Dunlop, Ian; Gamble, Matthew; Michaelides, Danius; Owen, Stuart; Newman, David; Sufi, Shoaib; Goble, Carole|title=Why linked data is not enough for scientists|journal=Future Generation Computer Systems|volume=29|issue=2|pages=599–611|doi=10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wild rabbit.jpg|thumb|250px|A wild rabbit – considered a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] by many farmers, due to their eating of farmer crops]]

'''Vermin''' ([[colloquialism|colloquially]] '''varmint'''&lt;ref name="origin" /&gt; or '''varmit''') are [[Pest (organism)|pests]] or [[nuisance animal]]s, that [[zoönosis|spread diseases]] or destroy [[crops]] or [[livestock]]. Since the term is defined in relation to human activities, which species are included vary from area to area and person to person.

The term derives from the [[Latin]] ''vermis'' ([[worm]]), and was originally used for the worm-like [[larva]]e of certain [[insect]]s, many of which infest foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vermin |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Britannica Publishing |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vermin |accessdate=December 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''varmint'' (and ''vermint'') has been found in sources from c. 1530–1540s.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Dictionary.com |title=Varmint definition |accessdate=2012-01-05 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Varmint?qsrc=2888|quote=Origin: 1530–40; var. of vermin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vermint" cited in England in 1539, ''Oxford English Dictionary', 2nd ed&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spelling distinction ==
''Varmint'' or ''varmit'' is an [[American-English]] [[colloquialism]], particularly common to the [[Eastern United States|American East]] and South-east within the nearby bordering states of the vast [[Appalachia]] region. The term describes farm pests which raid farms as opposed to those that infest farms, referring mainly to predators such as [[Free-ranging dog|feral dogs]], [[fox]]es, [[weasel]]s, and [[coyote]]s, sometimes even [[Wolf|wolves]] or rarely [[bear]]s, but also, to a lesser degree, herbivores and burrowing animals that directly damage crops and land.

Although this version of the word "vermin" is not a prevalent term in [[Standard Written English]], it is a common descriptor for certain kinds of weapons and [[pest control]] situations in the Appalachian and nearby states and the American west and south-west which have adopted terms such as ''[[varmint rifle]]'' and  ''[[varmint hunting]]''.

== Scope of meanings ==
The term "vermin" is used to refer to a wide scope of organisms, including [[rodent]]s, [[cockroach]]es, [[termite]]s,  and [[Bed bug (insect)|bed bug]]s.&lt;ref name="Bellemore2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillipa Bellemore|title=Tenants' Rights Manual: A Practical Guide to Renting in NSW|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbTaHlWD-VoC&amp;pg=PA66|date=November 2006 |publisher=Federation Press|isbn=978-1-86287-557-9|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, in the 16th and 17th century, the expression also became used as a [[derogatory term]] associated with groups of persons typically plagued by vermin, namely [[beggar]]s and [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], and more generally [[Poverty|the poor]].&lt;ref name="Raber2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Raber|title=Animal Bodies, Renaissance Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdwAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|date=24 September 2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-0859-7|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disease-carrying [[rodent]]s and [[insect]]s are the usual case, but the term is also applied to larger animals—especially small [[predator]]s—typically because they consume [[Natural resource|resources]] which humans consider theirs, such as livestock and crops. Birds which eat cereal crops and fruit are an example. The American crow (''Corvus brachyrhynchos''), is widely hated by farmers because of crop depredation. [[Rock dove|Pigeons]], which have been widely introduced in urban environments, are also sometimes considered vermin. Some varieties of [[snake]]s and [[arachnid]]s may also be referred to as vermin. Vermin is also used as a term for vile people, an enemy of a state or nation, or certain ethnic groups that are considered [[wikt:subhuman|subhuman]].&lt;ref name=origin /&gt;

== Deterioration of balance ==
Any species can develop into vermin if introduced into a region where there is favorable living conditions and few natural predators. In such cases, they are seen as an invasive species and humans often choose to fill the role of the [[predator]] to limit the danger to the environment. Examples of vermin include [[goat]]s on the [[Galápagos Islands]], [[rabbits in Australia]] or [[cat]]s on [[Prince Edward Islands]]. [[Rat]]s, [[mouse|mice]], and [[cockroaches]] are common urban and suburban vermin.

== Canada ==
Hunting laws and definitions vary by province in Canada.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

== United Kingdom ==
Under Tudor "vermin laws", many creatures were seen as competitors for the produce of the countryside and bounties were paid by the parish for their carcasses. The declaration of the [[red kite]] as vermin led to its decline to the point of extirpation in the UK by the 20th century. However, the red kite is being reintroduced by the trans-location of breeding pairs from other parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/silent-fields-by-roger-lovegrove-441401.html|title=Book Review: Silent Field, By Roger Lovegrove: songbirds versus shotguns|last=McCarthy|first=Michael|date=23 March 2007|work=The Independent |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animals ==
Vermin types can also include ferrets, stoats, sables, rats, and occasionally foxes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4350">The '''Vienna Psychoanalytic Society''' ({{Lang-de|Wiener Psychoanalytische Vereinigung}}, WPV), formerly known as the '''Wednesday Psychological Society''', is the oldest [[psychoanalysis]] society in the world. It commenced meetings in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s apartment in 1902. By 1908 the group adopted its new name and was the international psychoanalytic authority of the time.

The first president was [[Alfred Adler]], who resigned in 1911.

Prominent members:
*[[Sigmund Freud]]
*[[Wilhelm Reich]]
*[[Otto Rank]]
*[[Karl Abraham]]
*[[Carl Jung]]
*[[Sándor Ferenczi]]
*[[Isidor Isaak Sadger]]
*[[Victor Tausk]]

==First meetings==

In November 1902, Sigmund Freud wrote to Alfred Adler, "A small circle of colleagues and supporters afford me the great pleasure of coming to my house in the evening (8:30 PM after dinner) to discuss interesting topics in psychology and neuropathology. . . .Would you be so kind as to join us?"  The group included [[Wilhelm Stekel]], Max Kahane and Rudolf Reitler, soon joined by Adler. Stekel, a Viennese physician who had been in analysis with Freud, provided the initial impetus for the meetings. Freud made sure that each participant would contribute to the discussion by drawing names from an urn and asking each to address the chosen topic.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Joseph |title=Cassandra's Daughter: A History of Psychoanalysis |pages =100–103 |isbn=0-670-88623-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New members were invited only with the consent of the entire group, and only a few dropped out. By 1906, the group, then called the Wednesday Psychological Society, included 17 doctors, analysts and laymen. [[Otto Rank]] was hired that year to collect dues and keep written records of the increasingly complex discussions. Each meeting included the presentation of a paper or case history with discussion and a final summary by Freud. Some of the members presented detailed histories of their own psychological and sexual development.&lt;ref name="Gay"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gay |first=Peter |title=Freud: A Life For Our Time |isbn=0-393-31826-5 |pages=177–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active years==

As the meetings grew to include more of the original contributors to psychoanalysis, analytic frankness sometimes became an excuse for personal attacks. In 1908 [[Max Graf]], whose five-year-old son had been an early topic of discussion as Freud's famous "[[Little Hans]]" case, deplored the disappearance of congeniality. There were still discussions from which important insights could be gleaned, but many became acrimonious. Many members wanted to abolish the tradition that new ideas discussed at the meetings were credited to the group as a whole, not the original contributor of the idea. Freud proposed that each member should have a choice, to have his comments regarded as his own intellectual property, or to put them in the public domain.&lt;ref name="Gay"/&gt;

In an attempt to resolve some of the disputes, Freud officially dissolved the informal group and formed a new group under the name Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. On the suggestion of [[Alfred Adler]], the election of new members was based on secret ballot rather than Freud's invitation. Although the structure of the group became more democratic, the discussions lost some of their original eclectic character as the identity of the group developed. The psychosexual theories of Freud became the primary focus of the participants.&lt;ref name="Makari"&gt;{{cite book |last=Makari |first=George |title=Revolution in Mind: The Creation of Psychoanalysis |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-134661-3 |pages=174–178, 253–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bolivia's drinking water and sanitation''' coverage has greatly improved since 1990 due to a considerable increase in sectoral investment. However, the country continues to suffer from what happens to be the continent's lowest coverage levels and from low quality of services. Political and institutional instability have contributed to the weakening of the sector's institutions at the national and local levels. Two concessions to foreign private companies in two of the three largest cities&amp;mdash;[[Cochabamba]] and [[La Paz]]/[[El Alto]]&amp;mdash;were prematurely ended in 2000 and 2006 respectively. The country's second largest city, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], relatively successfully manages its own water and [[sanitation]] system by way of cooperatives. The government of [[Evo Morales]] intends to strengthen citizen participation within the sector. Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment financing.

According to the government the main problems in the sector are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of indigenous customs; "technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects"; a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is "not consistent with the political change in the country"; "ambiguities in the social participation schemes"; a reduction in the quantity and quality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and programs for the reuse of wastewater.&lt;ref name="PNSB"/&gt;

== Access ==

In 2015, in Bolivia 90% of the total population had access to [[Improved water source|"improved" water]], or 97% and 76%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. Regarding sanitation, 50% of the total population had access to [[Improved sanitation|"improved" sanitation]], or 61% and 28%, in urban and rural areas, respectively.&lt;ref name="JMP2015"&gt;WHO/UNICEF (2015) [https://www.wssinfo.org/documents/ Progress on sanitation and drinking water - 2015 update and MDG assessment], Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/bolivia/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Bolivia|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality of service ==

The [[Water supply#Service quality|quality of service]] in the majority of the country’s water and sanitation systems is low. In 2000, according to the [[WHO]], in only 26% of the urban systems water was disinfected&lt;ref&gt;OMS/OPS 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and only 25% of the collected wastewater was treated.&lt;ref name="Plan Nacional"/&gt;

== Recent developments ==
In the last decades, frequent changes of government resulted in several restructurings of the institutional framework to face the problems of the sector. Consequently, it seems difficult to draw up a long-term continuous and sustainable sector policy.

=== The 1990s: Privatization and regulation ===
{{see also|Water privatization in Bolivia}}
In 1999, during the second mandate of [[Hugo Banzer]] (1997–2001), the sectoral institutional framework law (Law 2029) established the legal framework for the sector that is in force today. It allows for private sector participation and formalized SISAB as a regulator (SISAB replaced the former Superintendencia de Agua created in 1997). During that period two major concessions for water and sanitation were granted to the private sector: One in [[La Paz]]/[[El Alto]] to the Aguas de [[Illimani]] S.A. (AISA), a subsidiary of the French [[Suez (company)|Suez]] (formerly Lyonnaise des Eaux) in 1997; and a second one in [[Cochabamba]] to Aguas de Tunari, a subsidiary of the multinationals [[Biwater]] and [[Bechtel]] in 1999.

Following two popular uprisings against [[Water privatization in Bolivia|water privatization]], the first in [[Cochabamba protests of 2000|Cochabamba]] in April 2000 and the second in [[La Paz]]/[[El Alto]] in January 2005, which centered on [[Bolivian gas conflict|natural gas]] concessions, the two water concessions were terminated. In the latter case, Aguas de Illimani was replaced by the public utility Empresa Pública Social de Agua y Saneamiento (EPSAS), which came under severe criticism in 2008 due to water shortages, accounting errors, tariff increases and poor disaster preparedness. Consequently, representatives of the La Paz neighborhood association announced to create their own service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 2008-02-14
|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolivian Norm NB 688, an important technical norm for the design and construction of sewage and sanitation, was revised in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/ WSP-PAS Nota de Campo]&lt;/ref&gt; The revised norm permits the installation of more efficient and of lower cost [[condominial sewerage]] systems and helps to increase sanitation coverage with limited funds.

Furthermore, the government defined the National Plan for Basic Sanitation Services 2001-2010 to increase the water and sanitation access to improve the quality of service and promote their sustainability.&lt;ref name="Plan Nacional"&gt;{{cite web

|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Evo Morales government: popular participation ===

In 2006 the [[Movement toward Socialism (Bolivia)|MAS]] won the elections and [[Evo Morales]] became president of the Republic. "Water cannot be a private business because it converts it into a merchandise and thus violates human rights. Water is a resource and should be a public service," emphasized president-elect Morales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adital.com.br/site/noticia.asp?lang=ES&amp;cod=20720 Adital] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307020525/http://www.adital.com.br/site/noticia.asp?lang=ES&amp;cod=20720 |date=2008-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new president created the Water Ministry (see below) and nominated a leader of the protests in [[El Alto]] against Aguas de Illimani as the country's first water minister. He nominated Luis Sánchez-Gómez Cuquerella, who was formerly an activist of the struggle against the privatization in Cochabamba, as vice-minister of Basic Services. In May 2006 the government dissolved the regulatory agency SISAB, saying that it failed to properly regulate tariffs and that it lacked accountability.&lt;ref&gt; ((Es)) IRC:[http://www.es.irc.nl/page/35067 Bolivia: eliminarán la Superintendencia de Saneamiento Básico], 9 June 2006 &lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Evo Morales considers passing a new water and sanitation services law called “Water for Life”. According to vice-minister Rene Orellana, under this law the legal concept of the concession would be eliminated. A preferential electricity tariff would be introduced for EPSAs and community water rights would be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aguabolivia.org Agua Bolivia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the government published a National Basic Sanitation Plan that analyzes the main problems in the sector, puts forward a vision, sets targets (90% access to water and 80% access to sanitation by 2015) and defines the investments needed to achieve the targets (US$ 283 million per year). These figures include investments for the reuse of wastewater and to adapt to climate change.&lt;ref name="PNSB"&gt; Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia:[http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Basico 2008-2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228092846/http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf |date=2013-02-28 }}, retrieved on September 30, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 Water Shortages and National Emergency ===
In November 2016, the worst drought in 25 years led to water rationing in La Paz and El Alto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/25/bolivia-drought-water-rationing-crops|title='We are in shock': historic Bolivia drought hammers homes and crops|last=Farthing|first=Linda|date=2016-11-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various causes were cited for the shortage, which saw the capital's main reservoir level drop to less than 1% capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/nov/23/bolivian-water-rationing-in-pictures|title=Bolivian water rationing – in pictures|last=Hecimovic|first=Arnel|date=2016-11-23|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two weeks into the crisis, Bolivia's Vice Ministry of Civil Defense estimated that the drought had affected 125,000 families and threatened 290,000 hectares (716,605 acres) of agricultural land and 360,000 heads of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-drought-idUSKBN13G1P4|title=Bolivia declares state of emergency due to drought, water shortage|date=2016-11-21|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Evo Morales called on local governments to devote funds and workers to drill wells and transport water to cities in vehicles, with the support of the armed forces, from nearby bodies of water. 

A national state of emergency was declared after 172 of the country's 339 municipalities declared their own emergencies related to the drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-drought-idUSKBN13G1P4|title=Bolivia declares state of emergency due to drought, water shortage|date=2016-11-21|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities for water and sanitation ==

The sector’s institutional framework is the Law #2029 of 1999, or Water and Sanitation Services Law, revised in 2000 as Law #2066. As mentioned above in “Recent Developments”, the Morales government is contemplating a new water and sanitation services law, named “Water for Life”.

=== Policies ===
[[File:Potosi air.jpg|left|thumbnail|300px|right|Potosí]]
Policies are set by the government; within the government the Vice-Ministry of Basic Sanitation in the Ministry of Environment and Water and is in charge of setting water policies. Another Vice-Ministry in the same ministry is in charge of water resources management and irrigation. Before 2006 these sectors were under different ministries, notably the Ministry of Housing and Basic Services and the Ministry of the Environment.

=== Provision of services ===
[[File:VistaSC.jpg|thumbnail|350px|right|Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]

In urban areas, municipal governments (either directly or through decentralized companies) are in charge of service provision as well as the development of plans and programs for service expansion in areas under their jurisdiction, in coordination with [[Departments of Bolivia|departmental governments]]. 

In some cities, [[cooperative]]s (utilities owned by their consumers) are in charge of water supply and sanitation service provision. SAGUAPAC in Santa Cruz is the largest consumer cooperative utility in the world. According to the [[World Bank]], its performance indicators place it among the best water utilities in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWSS/Resources/WN5cooperatives.pdf CONSUMER COOPERATIVES: AN ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONAL MODEL FOR DELIVERY OF URBAN WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICES?] ''Water Supply &amp; Sanitation Working Notes'', Note No. 5, January 2006, by Fernando Ruiz-Mier and Meike van Ginneken, retrieved on September 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has 9 departments and 327 municipalities. It also has 14 water and sanitation providers, which are called Empresas Prestadores de Servicios de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (EPSA) in the largest cities. In 1982, the EPSAs have formed the National Association of Water and Sewage Companies (ANESAPA). 

In rural areas Juntas or Water Committees are in charge of operating and maintaining the systems. In more dispersed areas of the country it is often the households themselves who take the initiative to obtain access to water and sanitation services, an approach called [[self-supply of water and sanitation]].

== Financial aspects ==
===Investment===

In the 1980s investment in the sector was below US$20 million per year. Starting in 1990, this average increased to approximately US$40 million.&lt;ref&gt;WSP&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, when US$69.4 million were invested the annual investment reached its peak. After 2000 investments dropped back again (see table below)&lt;ref&gt;Source: Vice Ministry of public investment and external financing&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/timeline&gt;

=== Sources of financing ===

Between 1992 and 2000, 58% of investments were externally financed (mainly from the [[Inter-American Development Bank|IDB]], [[World Bank]], Japanese [[JICA]] and the German [[KfW]]), 17% by municipal governments, 8% by the private sector and 17% by departmental governments.&lt;ref name="Plan Nacional"/&gt;

=== Financing mechanisms ===

In 2004 the government of President [[Carlos Mesa]] defined a new Sectoral Financial Policy. The EPSA would receive credits and transfers for investments for participating in a Plan for Institutional Modernization (PMI) and establishing an Integral Development Plan (PID). Resources are assigned to each EPSA with priority to those with larger poverty levels and lower levels of coverage, according to a mathematic formula called Asignador Financiero Sectoral (AFS). The subsidies are higher and the conditions of loans less onerous to the EPSA with lower coverage and higher levels of poverty. The National Fund for Regional Development (FNDR) is the government’s instrument for the targeting of loans destined for water and sanitation investments.

The Foundation for the Support to Sustainable Basic Sanitation (FUNDASAB) channels technical assistance to services to promote their sustainability.

The water resources of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] are fully controlled by [[Israel]] and the division of groundwater is subject to provisions in the [[Oslo II Accord]].

Generally, the water quality is considerably worse in the [[Gaza strip]] when compared to the [[West Bank]]. About a third to half of the delivered water in the Palestinian territories is [[Non-revenue water|lost in the distribution network]]. The lasting blockade of the Gaza Strip and the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] have caused severe damage to the infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="UN Gaza"&gt;{{cite web

Concerning wastewater, the existing treatment plants do not have the capacity to treat all of the produced wastewater, causing severe water pollution.&lt;ref name="Fatta" /&gt; The development of the sector highly depends on external financing.&lt;ref name="HBS" /&gt;

==History==
Since the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the issue of the development of the area's water resources, has been a critical issue in regional conflict and negotiations, initially involving [[Syria]], [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Kliot, ''Water Resources and Conflict in the Middle East'', Routledge,  2005 p.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Six-Day War]], when Israel occupied the [[Palestinian territories]], water use and sanitation have been closely linked to developments in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. The water and land resources in the [[West Bank]] in particular are considered to constitute the major obstacle to the resolution of conflict in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Kliot, [https://books.google.it/books?id=IRGxvz1B8p8C&amp;pg=PA249 ''Water Resources and Conflict in the Middle East''], Routledge,  2005 p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinians claim they have a legal right to ownership, or claim to use of three water sources in the area:(a)the groundwater reservoir of the [[Yarkon-Taninim Aquifer|Mountain Aquifer]], the Gaza Strip Coastal Aquifer and the [[Jordan River]] to the amount of 700 MCM/Y, over 50% of natural water resources between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.&lt;ref name="Gvirtzman2012" &gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/MSPS94.pdf 'The Israeli–Palestinian Water Conflict: An Israeli Perspective,'] [[Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies]] ''Mideast Security and Policy Studies'' No. 94 2012 pp.1–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) was established by a presidential decree. One year later, its functions, objectives and responsibilities were defined through a by-law, giving the PWA the mandate to manage water resources and execute the water policy.&lt;ref name="husseini"&gt;{{cite web|last=Husseini|first=Hiba|title=The Palestinian Water Authority: Developments and Challenges involving the Legal Framework and the Capacity of the PWA|date=n.d.|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-69509-7_31 |format=pdf|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water resources==

===Division in the Oslo II Accord===
The 1995 [[Oslo II Accord]] allows the Palestinians in the West Bank the use of up to 118 million cubic meters (mcm) water per year. 80 mcm was supposed to come from to drill new wells. However, the PWA was able to drill new wells for only 30 mcm at the expense of the existing springs and wells.&lt;ref name=PWA_violations&gt;[http://www.pwa.ps/page.aspx?id=QdCCoda1311515634aQdCCod Joint Water Committee-The Israelis Violations].

See Schedule 10. On the Knesset website, accessed December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the Oslo II Accord, the Israelis are allotted four times the Palestinian portion or 80% of the joint-aquifer resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol12/iss1/5/ ''The Jordan River Basin and the Mountain Aquifer: The Transboundary Freshwater Disputes between Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians''].

Amira Hass, Haaretz, 16 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; However, 94% (340 mcm) of the Western Aquifer was allotted to the Israelis for use within Israel.&lt;ref name=Oslo2_Annex3/&gt; The allowed quantities have not been adapted after the end of the supposed five years interim period. The parties established the [[Joint Water Committee]] to carry out the provisions of the concerning article 40 of Annex III.

According to a World Bank report, Israel extracted 80% more water from the West Bank than agreed in the Oslo Accord, while Palestinian abstractions were within the agreed range.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_9-13/&gt; Contrary to expectations under Oslo II, the water actually extracted by Palestinians in the West Bank has dropped between 1999 and 2007. Due to the Israeli over-extraction, aquifer levels are near ''″the point where irreversible damage is done to the aquifer.″''  Israeli wells in the West Bank have dried up local Palestinian wells and springs.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_9-13/&gt;

=== Water from the Jordan River basin ===
{{See also|Water politics in the Jordan River basin}}
[[File:Yarden 034PAN2.JPG|thumb|300px|Jordan River]]
The Upper Jordan River flows south into [[Sea of Galilee]], which provides the largest freshwater storage capacity along the Jordan River. Lake Tiberias drains into the Lower Jordan River, which winds further south through the Jordan Valley to its terminus in the Dead Sea. The Palestinians are denied any access to this water. About a quarter of the 420 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Israel pumps from the Sea of Galilee goes to the local communities in Israel and to Jordan; the rest is diverted to Israel through the [[National Water Carrier]] (NWC) before it can reach the West Bank. Virtually all water from the [[Yarmouk River]], north of the West Bank is diverted by Israel, Syria and Jordan. The water of the [[Tirza Stream]], the largest stream in the central Jordan Valley, fed by rainwater, is diverted by Israel to the Tirza Reservoir and used by settlements in the area for irrigation of crops and for raising fish.&lt;ref name=btselem_dispossession_19-21&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/sites/default/files/201105_dispossession_and_exploitation_eng.pdf ''Dispossession and Exploitation: Israel's Policy in the Jordan Valley and Northern Dead Sea''], pp. 19-21. B'Tselem, May 2011. On [http://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/dispossession-and-exploitation-israels-policy-jordan-valley-northern-dead-sea]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other surface water ===
In Gaza, the only source of surface water has been the [[HaBesor Stream|Wadi Gaza]]. There are claims that Israel diverts part of its water for agricultural purposes within Israel prior to its arrival to Gaza.&lt;ref name=waterforlife_32/&gt;&lt;ref name=Troubled_Waters_14-15/&gt;

=== Groundwater ===
In the West Bank, the main groundwater resource is the ''Mountain Aquifer'', which consists of three [[aquifer]]s:&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_9-13&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReportJuly2009.pdf ''Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development''], pp. 9–13.

* The '''Western Aquifer''', in Israel called the "Yarkon-Taninim Aquifer",&lt;ref name=Shapland&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=VDKJV-916UoC&amp;pg=PA11 ''Rivers of Discord—International Water Disputes in the Middle East''], pp 11-12. Greg Shapland, C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest one, with an annual safe yield of 362 million cubic metres (mcm), based on average annual estimate, (of which 40 mcm are brackish). Eighty percent of the ''recharge'' area of this basin is located within the West Bank, whereas 80% of the ''storage'' area is located within Israeli borders. Israelis exploit the aquifers of this basin by means of 300 deep groundwater wells to the west of the Green Line, as well as by deep wells within the West Bank boundary. Palestinians use it via wells and springs.
* The '''North-Eastern Aquifer''', in Israel called the "Gilboa-Bet She'an Aquifer" or "Schechem-Gilboa Aquifer",&lt;ref name=Shapland/&gt; has an annual safe yield of 145 mcm (of which 70 mcm are brackish). Almost 100% of its water comes from precipitation falling within the West Bank area, but then flows underground in a northerly direction into the Bisan (Bet She'an) and Jezreel valley.
* The '''Eastern Aquifer''', entirely within the West Bank, has an annual safe yield of 172 mcm (of which 70–80 mcm are brackish). This aquifer is mainly drained by springs.

According to Hiniker, at an average sustainable rate, the amount of renewable shared freshwater available throughout the entire [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] is roughly 2700 mcm per year, which is composed of 1400 million cubic metres of [[groundwater]] and 1300 million cubic metres of [[surface water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hiniker |first=Mike |title=Sustainable solutions to water conflicts in the Jordan Valley |journal=Cambridge Review of International Affairs |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=255–273 |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a781996382 |doi=10.1080/09557579908400261 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a fraction of this can be used by Palestinians in the West Bank. Israel has denied Palestinians access to the entire Lower Jordan River since 1967. After the start of Israel’s military occupation in 1967, Israel declared the West Bank land adjacent to the Jordan River a closed military zone, to which only Israeli settler farmers have been permitted access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Obidallah |first=Mohammed T. |title=Water and the Palestinian–Israeli Conflict|journal=Central European Journal of International and Security Studies (CEJISS) |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=103–117 |publisher=Metropolitan University Prague |year=2008 |url=http://cejiss.org/sites/default/files/m.obidallah_water_and_conflict.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the West Bank water infrastructure controlled by the Israeli army was handed over to the Israeli national water company [[Mekorot]]. As of 2009, Mekorot operates some 42 wells in the West Bank, mainly in the Jordan Valley region, which mostly supply the Israeli settlements. The amount of water Mekorot can sell to the Palestinians is subject to approval of the Israeli authorities.&lt;ref name=Troubled_Waters_14-15&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/027/2009/en/ ''Troubled Waters: Palestinians denied fair access to water''], pp. 14–15. Amnesty International, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drilling of wells into the mountain aquifer by the Palestinians is restricted. Most of its water thus flows underground towards the slopes of the hills and into Israeli territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eckstein |first=Yoram |author2=Eckstein, Gabriel |title=Groundwater Resources and International Law in the Middle East Peace Process |journal=Water International |volume=28|issue=2 |pages=154–161 |ssrn=758637 |doi=10.1080/02508060308691680 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to different estimates, between 80 and 85% of groundwater in the West Bank is used either by Israeli settlers or flows into Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Isaac, J. |title=The role of groundwater in the water conflict and resolution between Israelis and Palestinians |booktitle=International Symposium on Groundwater Sustainability (ISGWAS), ARIJ |url=http://aguas.igme.es/igme/ISGWAS/Ponencias%20ISGWAS/18-Isaac%20Jad.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coastal Aquifer''' is the only source of water in the Gaza strip. It runs beneath the coast of Israel, with Gaza downstream at the end of the basin. With the water flows underground mainly east-west, however, Palestinian extractions from the aquifer have no effect on the Israeli side.&lt;ref name=Shapland/&gt; Israel, on the contrary, has installed a cordon of numerous deep wells along the Gaza border and in this way extracts much of the groundwater before it can reach Gaza.&lt;ref name=waterforlife_32&gt;[http://www.phg.org/data/files/publications/general_reports/Reports/2008/waterforlife_07_08.pdf ''Water for Life''], p. 32.

PCBS, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; While Israel transports water from the north of its territory to the south, the Palestinians are not allowed to move water from the West Bank to Gaza. This is a reason why this aquifer is heavily over-exploited, resulting in seawater intrusion. The aquifer is polluted by salt as well as [[nitrate]] from wastewater infiltration and fertilizers. Only 5-10% of the aquifer yields drinking water quality.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_27-29&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReportJuly2009.pdf ''Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development''], p. 27-29. World Bank, April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the water from the Coastal Aquifer in the Gaza region was considered no longer drinkable due to high salinity from the sea water intrusion and high nitrate pollution from agricultural activity.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_Annex11&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReportJuly2009.pdf ''Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development''], pp. 118-119, Annex 11. World Bank, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant Oslo II (Annex III, Article 40.7), Israel committed itself to sell 5 mcm/year to the Gaza Strip. In 2015 Israel had doubled the amount to 10 mcm/year.&lt;ref name=Algemeiner&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/06/05/israel-doubles-water-supply-to-gaza-strip-increases-supply-to-palestinian-authority/ ''Israel doubles water supply to Gaza strip, increases supply to Palestinian Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; Gaza also imports water, or produces drinkwater by means of desalination plants.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_27-29/&gt;

=== Desalination of brackish groundwater ===
[[File:Water supply in West Bank and Gaza February 2014 2water photoblog.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An elderly man fills a water container at a public multi-faucet sink in [[Khan Younis]], Gaza Strip.]]
In Gaza, [[desalination|desalinated]] brackish groundwater has become an important source of drinking water. Over 20,000 consumers in over 50% of the Gaza households have installed domestic ‘[[reverse osmosis]]’ (RO) units to desalinate water for drinking purposes. The water quality is high, though the water lacks basic minerals. As of January 2014, there were 18 neighborhood desalination plants in the Gaza strip, providing safe drinking water for free to 95,000 people who come to fill their canisters at the plants. 13 of these plants are operated by UNICEF.&lt;ref name=UNICEF_fresh_solution&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/oPt_71763.html ''A fresh solution to Gaza's water crisis'']. Catherine Weibel and Sajy Elmughanni, UNICEF, 14 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, approximately 100 industrial desalination plants were operational. Due to the Israeli [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]], the import of spare parts – essential to operate the desalination plants of industry, communities and households – as well as necessary chemicals, is problematic.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_Annex11/&gt;

=== Desalinated seawater ===
As of 2007, there was one seawater desalination plant in [[Deir al-Balah]] in the Gaza Strip, built in 1997–99 with funding by the Austrian government. It has a capacity of {{convert|600|m3}} per day and it is owned and operated by the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility. At least initially, the operating costs were subsidized by the Austrian government. The desalinated water is distributed to 13 [[water kiosk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Development Agency: Water Sector Review Weast Bank &amp; Gaza, January 2007, Vol. II, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7rgHmpppZ-wC&amp;pg=PA111 ''Integrated Water Resources Management and Security in the Middle East''], p. 111. Clive Lipchin; Springer, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Desalination of seawater is expected{{By whom|date=March 2016}} to become more important in the future through a long-planned regional desalination plant that would provide desalinated water using the piped water network throughout the entire Gaza strip. For over 20 years, a major desalination plant for Gaza has been discussed. The Palestinian Water Authority has approved a $500 million facility. Israel supports it and has quietly begun to offer Palestinians desalination training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alon Tal  |author2=Yousef Abu-Mayla |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gaza Need Not Be a Sewer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/opinion/gaza-need-not-be-a-sewer.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times Op-Ed|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million-euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the [[Islamic Development Bank]], committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment. The [[European Investment Bank]] provides technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UfM presents the Gaza Desalination Project at the 2012 World Water Week in Stockholm|url=http://ufmsecretariat.org/ufm-presents-the-gaza-desalination-project-at-the-2012-world-water-week-in-stockholm/|publisher=Union for the Mediterranean|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major problem is that desalination is very energy-intensive, while the import of fuel to produce the necessary electricity is restricted by Israel and Egypt. Furthermore, revenues from drinking water tariffs are insufficient to cover the operating costs of the envisaged plant at the current tariff level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Gaza heads for water crisis, desalination seen key|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4399067,00.html|publisher=Ynet|date=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rainwater collection ===
In the West Bank, [[rainwater harvesting|collection of rainwater]] is a very limited resource in addition to tanker truck water for Palestinians who lack connection to the [[water grid]], notably in rural areas. However, Israeli authorities control even the collection of small quantities of rainwater. According to the 2009 report ''Troubled Waters'' by [[Amnesty International]], some 180,000–200,000 Palestinians living in rural communities have no access to running water and the Israeli army often prevents them from even collecting rainwater. The Israeli army frequently destroys small rainwater harvesting cisterns built by Palestinian communities who have no access to running water, or prevents their construction.&lt;ref name=Troubled_Waters_rainwater_cistern&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/027/2009/en/ ''Troubled Waters: Palestinians denied fair access to water''], pp. 2–4, 15, 28, 34, 39–50, 63, 68.

Palestinian Water Authority. Accessed February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water reuse ===
In view of the limited availability of water resources, water reuse is seen as an important source. In the West Bank, Israel collects wastewater in two facilities in the Jordan Valley. Not only wastewater from Israelis in Jerusalem and settlements is collected, but also from Palestinians. All recycled water is used for irrigation in settlements in the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area.&lt;ref name=btselem_dispossession_23&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/sites/default/files/201105_dispossession_and_exploitation_eng.pdf ''Dispossession and Exploitation: Israel's Policy in the Jordan Valley and Northern Dead Sea''], p. 23. B'Tselem, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water use ==

=== Palestinians ===

As of 2007, the estimated average ''per capita supply'' in the '''West Bank''' had increased to about 98 ''liter per capita per day'' (98 lpcd). The estimated ''household use'' was 50 lpcd, with many households consuming as little as 20 lpcd, even if connected to the network. Due to the fragmentation of the West Bank, movement of water from water-rich areas to Palestinian communities with water shortage is inhibited.&lt;ref name=btselem_dispossession_24-26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/FFM/FFMSettlements.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there are huge differences in water use in the eastern and southern West Bank. While the daily consumption in the Jericho district was 161 liters in 2009, in Jericho city even 225 liters, it was less than 100 liters in other areas. In the central Jordan Valley it was about 60 liters. Inhabitants of a-Nu’ima, east of Jericho, had only 24 liters. Residents of villages that are cut off from water supply have to buy water from watertanker operators.&lt;ref name=btselem_dispossession_24-26&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/sites/default/files/201105_dispossession_and_exploitation_eng.pdf ''Dispossession and Exploitation: Israel's Policy in the Jordan Valley and Northern Dead Sea''], p. 24-26. B'Tselem, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; All of the eastern West Bank, except the Israeli settlements and Jericho are designated as a closed military area or as an area that for other reasons has access restrictions for Palestinians. In 2012, 90% of the small Palestinian communities living there had less than 60 lpcd. Over half of them, mostly Bedouin or herding communities, often cut off from their traditional wells, had even less than 30 litres per person per day.&lt;ref name=ochaopt_firingzone&gt;[http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_firing_zone_factsheet_august_2012_english.pdf ''The Humanitarian Impact of Israeli-declared ″Firing Zones″ in the West Bank'']. Factsheet OCHAoPt, AUGUST 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) or municipalities provided about 70 lpcd in '''Gaza''', but could not reach all households.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_Annex11/&gt;

For 2012, the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS) provided the following figures (domestic use):&lt;ref name=PCBS_water_use-2012&gt;[http://pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_Rainbow/Documents/water/water-2012-E-tab%207.htm ''Quantity of Water Supply for Domestic Sector and Water Consumed ..., 2012''].

In 2012, about 44% of the groundwater was for use in agriculture.&lt;ref name=PCBS_agriculture_use-2012&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_Rainbow/Documents/water/water-2012-E-tab%203.htm ''Palestinian Water Wells and it's Annual Pumping Quantity ..., 2012'']. Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Accessed March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Industrial use was only 3% in 2005.&lt;ref name=EMWater/&gt;

The household ''use'' is less than the ''supply'', which includes industrial, commercial and public consumption as well as losses.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_16-17&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReportJuly2009.pdf ''Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development''], pp. 16-17 (par. 46-48); for Gaza: p. 28 (par. 73). World Bank, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Gaza strip, for example, the estimated average ''per capita supply'' in 2005 was 152 lpcd, but due to high network losses, the actual water use was only 60% of it, which would be about 91 liter.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_16-17/&gt; The minimum quantity ''for domestic use'', recommended by the [[WHO]] is 100 lpcd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/WSH0302exsum.pdf ''Domestic Water Quantity, Service Level and Health''], Executive summary. WHO, 2005. On [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/wsh0302/en/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli settlers ===

In 2008, the settlements in the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area were allocated 44.8 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (MCM) of water, 97.5 percent of which (43.7 MCM) were for agricultural use. Seventy percent of it was provided by [[Mekorot]]. According to Israeli figures, the household use of settlers in the Jordan Valley was 487 liters per capita per day (lpcd) and in the northern Dead Sea area even 727 lpcd. That is three to four times the use of 165 liters in Israel.&lt;ref name=btselem_dispossession_24-26/&gt; As the settlers in the eastern West Bank use nearly all the water use for agriculture, they in fact export water from the Palestinian Territories.

In 2009, settlers in Pnei Hever, Hebron District, consumed 194 liters per day; those in Efrat, east of Bethlehem, 217 liters.&lt;ref name=btselem_waterday&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/water/20090322_international_water_day ''22.3.09: World Water Day – 22 March – waters that cross borders'']. B'Tselem, 22 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water use of Israelis versus Palestinians===
[[File:Water supply in West Bank and Gaza February 2014 5water photoblog.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bedouins purchase water from water trucks in Khirbet A-Duqaiqah in the South Hebron Hills near the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], a village with 300 residents that is not hooked up to water grid.]]
According to the Palestinian Water Authority, the average Israeli consumption of water is 300 liter per person per day, which is more than 4 times that of the Palestinian use of 72 liters per day. Some Palestinian village communities live on even less water than the average Palestinian consumption, in some cases no more than 20 liters per person per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwa.ps/page.aspx?id=QdCCoda1607510817aQdCCod ''Pending Water Issues between Israelis and Palestinians'']. Palestinian Water Authority. Accessed February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Bank]], water extractions per capita for West Bank Palestinians are about one quarter of those for Israelis, and have declined over the last decade. In 1999, Palestinians in the West Bank used only 190 lpcd from the West Bank resources, the settlers 870 lpcd, and the Israelis used even 1,000 lpcd. [[Israeli settler]]s in the West Bank thus used about 4.5 times the amount of water available to the Palestinians.&lt;ref name=WB_Assessment_compare&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReportJuly2009.pdf ''Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development''], pp. iv and 13 (par. 39). World Bank, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the settlers in the Niran settlement, north of Jericho, used more than 5 times the amount of the nearby Palestinian village al-A’uja. The Argaman settlement, in the central Jordan Valley, used more than 5 times the amount of the adjacent Palestinian village a-Zubeidat. The household use in the Ro’i settlement, in the northern Jordan Valley, was per head 21 times that of the adjacent Bedouin community al-Hadidya, which is not connected to the regular water supply.&lt;ref name=btselem_dispossession_24-26/&gt;

In 2009, the settlers in [[Efrat]] consumed, with 217 liters, three times the amount of the per capita use of 71 liters in the nearby Palestinian [[Bethlehem Governorate]].&lt;ref name=btselem_waterday/&gt;

While many Palestinians living in rural communities have no access to running water, Israeli settlers who export their products have irrigated farms, lush gardens and swimming pools. The 450,000 settlers use as much or even more water than all 2.3 million Palestinians together.&lt;ref name=Amnesty_International_buy_water&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/027/2009/en/ ''Troubled Waters–Palestinians denied fair access to water''], p. 5, 13, 27-28, 47, 50. Amnesty International, October 2009. On [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/israel-rations-palestinians-trickle-water-20091027 ''Israel rations Palestinians to trickle of water'']&lt;/ref&gt; Many Palestinians have to buy water from Israel, of often dubious quality, delivered with tanker trucks at very high prices. Water tankers are forced to take long detours to avoid Israeli military checkpoints and roads which are out of bounds to Palestinians, resulting in steep increases in the price of water.&lt;ref name=Amnesty_International_buy_water/&gt;

==Infrastructure==

=== Connection to the water grid ===
According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) of the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] and [[UNICEF]], about 90% of the Palestinians in the Territories had access to an [[improved water source]].&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt;

A survey carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) found that the number of households in the Palestinian territories connected to the water network was 91.8% in 2011. In the West Bank, 89.4% of the households were connected while the connection share in the Gaza Strip was 96.3%.&lt;ref name="PCBS 11"&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_PCBS/Downloads/book1813.pdf Household Environmental Survey, 2011—Main Findings], p. [13] (English section). Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2004 study by Karen Assaf, there are low service levels especially in small villages and [[refugee camp]]s. The gap between urban and rural areas concerning water supply house connections may be due to the fact that available water resources are not accessible for the Palestinian actors in many cases. In 42% of the localities, water supply
got uninterrupted; 19% received it at least partially. Furthermore, about 40% of all served localities suffer from water shortages.&lt;ref name=HBS&gt;{{cite journal

=== Water cisterns ===
[[File:Roof water cistern in Jenin, West Bank 019 - Aug 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Roof water cistern in Jenin]]

Due to unreliable water delivery, virtually every Palestinian house has at least one, most several, water cisterns to store water. In the West Bank, water cisterns are often targeted by the IDF or Israeli settlers and destroyed under the pretext of illegality.&lt;ref name=Troubled_Waters_cistern-destruction&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/027/2009/en/ ''Troubled Waters–Palestinians denied fair access to water''], pp. 15, 39-50, 68-69. Amnesty International, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drinking water quality===
Data of a survey carried out in 2011 revealed that 47.2% of the households in the Palestinian Territories consider the water quality as good. The share is significantly higher in the West Bank (70.9%) than in the Gaza Strip (5.3%).&lt;ref name="PCBS 11"/&gt; Compared to an earlier study, the results indicate that the percentage of households which consider the water quality as good decreased from 67.5% in 1999.&lt;ref name="PCBS"&gt;Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), [http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/DesktopModules/Articles/ArticlesView.aspx?tabID=0&amp;lang=en&amp;ItemID=234&amp;mid=10859 Household Environmental Survey 2008] Retrieved on 2009-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water losses and sewage problems ===
In 2012, the losses of water in the network were estimated some 28% in the West Bank and even half of the supplied amount in Gaza.&lt;ref name=PCBS_water_use-2012/&gt; In the West Bank, construction and maintenance of water and sewage infrastructure are problematic. The Palestinian areas are enclaves in the Israeli-controlled [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Area C]]. Therefore, all projects are subject to approval of the [[Joint Water Committee]] and the Israeli army. In Gaza, the infrastructure is subject to periodic large-scale destruction by Israeli attacks, such as in the [[Raid on Beit Hanoun (2004)#Damages and casualties|2004 Raid on Beit Hanoun]],&lt;ref name=ocha-report&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/5e4e866e111a903085256f01004f6bae ''Preliminary Humanitarian Situation Report Operation "Forward Shield"''].

Marian Houk, The Electronic Intifada, 30 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The groundwater in Gaza is highly contaminated by leaked sewage.

The high water loss rates are ascribed to illegal connections, worn out pipe systems in the networks, and utility dysfunction. Especially in the Gaza Strip, high losses are caused by illegal connections. Illegal use of water is often the result of water shortages and insufficient supply. Furthermore, the conditions of water supply utilities suffer from grave deficiencies causing high leakage rates and a weak water pulse in the system,  ascribed to both institutional weakness and the restrictions posed by the occupation on the development of the water and sanitation sectors, including the Gaza blockade.&lt;ref name=waterforlife_45-46&gt;[http://www.phg.org/data/files/publications/general_reports/Reports/2008/waterforlife_07_08.pdf ''Water for Life''], pp. 45-46. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Monitoring Program (WaSH MP) 2007/2008. Palestinian Hydrology Group (PHG) (7,3 MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of the Gaza war and the Gaza blockade===
Following the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, the [[World Bank]] reported severe damages to the water and sanitation infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. Almost all sewage and water pumps were out of operation due to a lack of electricity and fuel. Spare parts and other maintenance supplies were in urgent need to be replenished. This situation resulted in a serious shortage of water and sewage overflows in urban areas, posing a threat to [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Gaza"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip impedes the provision of spare parts and thus contributes to exacerbate the problem. Several aid agencies and the top United Nations humanitarian official in the Palestinian territories therefore demanded the immediate opening of crossings. According to the United Nations, about 60% of the population in the Gaza Strip did not have access to continuous water supply in 2009.&lt;ref name="UN Gaza"/&gt;

==Wastewater treatment==

About 90% of the Palestinians in the Territories had access to [[improved sanitation]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt; [[Cesspit]]s were used by 39% of households, while access to the sewer network increased to 55% in 2011, up from 39% in 1999.&lt;ref name="PCBS 11" /&gt;

In the Gaza strip, from the 110,000 m³ of wastewater per day which is produced in the Gaza Strip, 68,000 m³ was treated, according to a study from 2001. 20% of the treated wastewater was reused.&lt;ref name="Fatta" /&gt; The World Bank reported in 2009 that the three existing wastewater treatment plants work discontinuously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReportJuly2009.pdf ''Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development''], p. 30. World Bank, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Damaged sewage infrastructure can often not be repaired due to the ongoing Israeli blockade. It leads to delays in repairs and a lack of electricity and fuel which would be necessary to operate the wastewater treatment facilities. The United Nations estimate that per day 50,000 to 80,000 cubic meters of untreated and partially treated wastewater are discharged into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] since January 2008, threatening the environment in the region.&lt;ref name="UN Gaza"/&gt;

In the West Bank, only 13,000 out of 85,000 m³ of wastewater were treated in five municipal wastewater treatment plants in [[Hebron]], [[Jenin]], [[Ramallah]], [[Tulkarem]] and [[Al-Bireh]].&lt;ref name="Fatta"&gt;{{cite journal

==Responsibility for water supply and sanitation==

===Relevant laws===
The current sector legislation was established after the 1995 [[Oslo Accords]], with a by-law establishing the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) in 1996, a 1998 Water Resources Management Strategy and the 2002 water law.&lt;ref name="EMWIS 2008"&gt;EMWIS, International Coordination Unit Palestinian Water Authority (PWA): Palestine 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Water Law of 2002 clarifies the responsibilities of the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) and establishes a National Water Council (NWC) with the task to set national water policies. It also establishes "national water utilities".&lt;ref name="Daibes"&gt;{{cite book

===Policy and regulation===
[[File:Shaddad Attili-IMG 4130.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Shaddad Attili, Head of the Palestinian Water Authority from 2008 until 2014 at the 6th World Water Forum in Marseille, 2012.]]
General water sector policies are set by the Palestinian cabinet of ministries and the''' National Water Council''' (NWC). The council has the authority to suspend or dismantle the services of the board of directors of the regional water and wastewater services providers. The members of the council include the main Palestinian ministries.&lt;ref name="Daibes"/&gt; The [[Palestinian Water Authority]] (PWA) acts as regulatory authority,&lt;ref name="HBS" /&gt; responsible for the legislation, monitoring and human resources development in the sector. The PWA is also in charge of water resources management. It has the mandate to carry out regular inspections and to keep a register of all water related data and information.&lt;ref name="Daibes"/&gt; The authority shares responsibility for irrigation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and for environmental protection with the Environment Quality Authority (EQA).&lt;ref name="EMWIS 2008"/&gt;

====The Joint Water Committee====
As part of the 1995 Interim Agreement, a [[Israeli–Palestinian Joint Water Committee|Joint Water Committee]] (JWC) has been established between Israel and the Palestinian territories. The JWC was expected to implement the regulations of article 40 of the agreement which concern water and sanitation.&lt;ref name =Oslo2_Annex3/&gt; The committee is composed of an equal number of participants by the two parties and all decisions need consensus, which means that each side has a veto. The JWC is not independent from Israel and the PA. Instead, decisions can be passed to a higher political level. Jägerskog reports several delays concerning the implementation of Palestinian project proposals within the committee, partly due to missing Palestinian funding, time-consuming approval procedures, hydrological and political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Service provision===
The Water Law No. 3 provided the legal basis for the establishment of "national water utilities". The PWA's goal is to establish four regional utilities, one in Gaza and three in the West Bank (North, Center and South). However, in reality as of 2011 only the regional utility for Gaza has been established.

'''West Bank'''.  Water services in the West Bank continue to be provided by municipalities, two multi-municipal utilities and village councils.&lt;ref name="WSR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palestinian Water Authority|title=Water Sector Review West Bank &amp; Gaza|url=http://www.lacs.ps/documentsShow.aspx?ATT_ID=733|accessdate=5 August 2011|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest and oldest multi-municipal utility in the West Bank is the Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU) in the Ramallah and Al-Bireh area. JWU, founded in 1966 when the West Bank was still part of Jordan, serves the two cities as well as 10 smaller towns, more than 43 villages and 5 refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation of JWU|url=http://www.jwu.org/etemplate.php?id=96|publisher=Jerusalem Water Undertaking|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second much smaller multi-municipal utility is the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WSSA) that serves Bethlehem and the neighboring towns [[Beit Jala]] and [[Beit Sahour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Bethlehem Beit Jala Beit Sahour, West Bank and Gaza|url=http://www.ib-net.org/utility_report.php?code=PS4&amp;key=08f9a0318f38a6c2064ef9fe481f94e3|publisher=International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cities such as Tulkarem, Qalqilya, Nablus, Jenin, Jericho and Hebron as well as in small towns, municipalities provide water and - if existing - sewer services. Both utilities and municipalities depend to a varying extent on bulk water supply by the Israeli water company [[Mekorot]], which delivers about 80% of the water used by JWU.&lt;ref&gt;, p. 43. World Bank, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas, water is provided by Village Council water departments. In the North-Eastern Jenin area a Joint Service Council (JSC) formed by six villages provides water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReportJuly2009.pdf ''Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development''], p. 15 World Bank, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaza strip''' In all 25 municipalities in the Gaza strip, water provision is the responsibility of the [[Coastal Municipalities Water Utility]] (CMWU). However, the utility is still in the process of being set up and exercise its legal tasks. The intended procedure is that the municipalities receive technical assistance by the CMWU and gradually transfer their staff and assets to it. According to the World Bank, this model led to some improvements like faster repair of leakage and economies of scale. However, the plan is far from being fully implemented. The model experienced serious problems which are mainly caused by the unstable political conditions in the Gaza strip since 2008, including differences between municipalities governed by Hamas and Fatah, so that some municipalities refused to transfer their assets and staff to CMWU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReportJuly2009.pdf ''Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development''], p. 65-66 World Bank, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organizations and universities===
[[Non-governmental organisations|Non-governmental organisations (NGOs)]] are very active in the field of water and wastewater treatment and reuse. One NGO network is the Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network (PENGON) that was initiated after the 2000 [[al-Aqsa Intifada]]. It has more than 20 members, including NGOs, universities and research centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Private sector participation===
Two [[management contract]]s were awarded for Gaza in 1996 and for the Bethlehem area in 1999. In 2002, soon after the outbreak of the [[Second Intifada]], the Bethlehem contract was terminated and the Gaza contract expired.

In '''Gaza''', a four-year management contract was awarded to a [[joint venture]] of Lyonnaise des Eaux (now [[Suez (company)|Suez]]) and [[Khatib and Alami]] in 1996. The contract was entirely funded by a US$25 million World Bank credit. According to a 1998 World Bank paper, water quality improved since the contract became active. Furthermore, water losses fell and water consumption and revenues rose. However, actual responsibility for service provision remained with municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The contract was awarded to a joint venture of the French [[Vivendi]] and the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-Palestinian company [[Khatib and Alami]].

==Efficiency==
About half (44%) of the produced water is [[non-revenue water|non-revenue water (NRW)]], water which is not billed due to leakage or water theft. The share varies widely from 25% in [[Ramallah]] to 65% in [[Jericho]]. In the Gaza Strip, NRW is estimated to be about 45%, out of which 40% is caused by physical losses and 5% by unregistered connections and meter losses.&lt;ref name="HBS" /&gt; For comparison leakage of water at Israeli municipal pipes amount to about 10% of water usage.&lt;ref name=libel&gt;[http://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/truth-behind-palestinian-water-libels/ The Truth Behind the Palestinian Water Libels] by Prof. Haim Gvirtzman, [[Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies]], 24 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial aspects==

===Tariffs and cost recovery===
A water-pricing policy is under preparation. Currently, increasing block tariffs are applied in the Palestinian territories. There is no price differentiation according to the purpose (residential, commercial, industrial). The average cost of water supply is $22 per month ($25 in the West Bank and $10 in Gaza).&lt;ref name="PCBS"/&gt; Karen Assaf reported an average tariff of US$1.20 (5 [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]]&lt;ref name="NIS"&gt;5 Israeli New Shekel = 1.19591 US Dollar (02/26/09); source: http://oanda.com&lt;/ref&gt;) per m³ in 2004. In areas where piped water is not available, water is purchased from water tankers for prices five to six times higher than for piped water.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; The long term objective to recover water production costs, or at least operation and maintenance costs, is still not reached.

The following table gives an overview of the distribution of households in the Palestinian Territories by the cost of monthly consumed water in 2003.&lt;ref name="PCBS 03"&gt;{{cite web

===Investment and financing===
The PWA issues periodic reports including information about projects and donor contributions. In the West Bank, the total investment cost of water projects from 1996 to 2002 amounted to about US$500 million, out of which 150 million were already spent on completed projects. The costs of ongoing projects were US$300 million, and the remaining US$50 million were committed to future projects. Out of the total cost of US$500 million, 200 million were invested in the water supply sector and 130 million in the wastewater sector. The remaining financial resources were spent in water conservation (80m), institutional and capacity building (30m), storm water, water resources and irrigation systems.

At the same time, the total investment costs of water projects in the Gaza Strip were about US$230 million, out of which most was spent on ongoing projects (US$170 million), while the remaining 60 million were implemented costs. About 90% of these investments were financed by grants and 10% by loans from the [[European Investment Bank|European Investment Bank (EIB)]] and the [[World Bank]]. US$100 million were invested in the water sector and 40 million in the wastewater sector.
 
It is estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1 billion for the West Bank and US$0.8 billion is needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.&lt;ref name="HBS" /&gt;

==External cooperation==
About 15 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies support the Palestinian water sector. In 2006, the PWA complained that coordination between PWA and donors was "still not successful" and that some donors and NGOs were "bypassing" the PWA.&lt;ref name="WSR"/&gt; Donor coordination mechanisms in the sector include Emergency Water, Sanitation and Hygiene group (EWASH) regrouping UN agencies and NGOs as well as Emergency Water Operations Center (EWOC) led by USAID. Both were established to coordinate the reconstruction after the 2002 Israeli incursions into the West Bank.

===European Union===
The [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) provided loan funding for refurbishing water reservoirs and was expected to fund the construction of the south regional wastewater treatment plant and a section of the North-South municipal water carrier in Gaza. Within the framework of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), the EIB financed operations with more than 137 million Euro in the West Bank and Gaza between 1995 and 2010. 10% of the funds were allocated to the water and environment sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===France===
The French development agency, Agence française de développement (AFD), supports several projects in the Palestinian territories. For example, AFD finances the connection of densely populated areas of Rafah to the sewage system, the construction of water pipes and reservoirs in Hebron, and the construction of a water distribution network in six villages in the district of Jenin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Germany===
German development cooperation has been engaged in the water and sanitation sector in the Palestinian Territories since 1994. It consists of financial cooperation through [[KfW]] and technical cooperation through [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]], both working on behalf of the [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (Germany)|German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]].

KfW is engaged in [[Nablus]], [[Tulkarem]], [[Salfit]], [[Ramallah]] / [[Al-Bireh]], [[Jenin]] and [[Gaza City]]. The water supply activities focus on the reduction of [[non-revenue water]] so that the available water resources can be used more efficiently. One successful example of water loss reduction is the first phase of the KfW-supported program in Nablus: the frequency of supply for 8,000 inhabitants in the Rafidia neighbourhood was increased from every 4 days to every 2–3 days. This was achieved by reducing distribution losses from 40% to currently 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} KfW Entwicklungsbank:[http://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/DE_Home/Laender_Programme_und_Projekte/Nordafrika_und_naher_Osten/Palaestinensische_Gebiete/Leuchtturmprojekt_1.jsp Wasserverlustreduzierung Nablus] (Water loss reduction Nablus), June 2009  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanitation activities include the construction of sewer networks and wastewater treatment. The town of Al Bireh had the only functioning wastewater treatment plant in the West Bank in 2009. The plant, which was funded by KfW, was commissioned in 2000 and operates in a satisfactory way despite the challenging environment of the West Bank. The construction of wastewater treatment plants in Gaza City, Western Nablus, Salfeet and the Tulkarem region, however, was substantially delayed as of 2009. Until 2008 new financial cooperation commitments were granted in the form of projects that identified specific investments at an early stage. This approach changed in 2008 with the approval of a new KfW-supported water and sanitation program for the West Bank and Gaza. This program is open for proposals from small and medium-sized towns if they comply with certain selection criteria. The program’s main focus is on water loss reduction.

Outcomes of technical cooperation include improved performance for the Jerusalem Water Undertaking, the utility serving Ramallah, as a result of capacity building and training. Employees of the municipality Al-Bireh were trained in operating the town's wastewater treatment plant. Wells have been drilled or rehabilitated in the Nablus and Ramallah area, supplying 120,000 people with drinking water. GTZ also supported the creation of the National Water Council in 2006. Furthermore, at least 6,000 schoolchildren have been taught water conservation measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Swedish International Development Agency]] (SIDA) has participated in the development of feasibility and design studies for the north regional wastewater treatment plant and associated sewerage collection systems in Gaza.&lt;ref name="GTZ"&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) |authorlink=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit |title=GTZ Water Programme |date=n.d. |url=http://www.waterprogramme.ps/index.php |accessdate=2009-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122132218/http://www.waterprogramme.ps/index.php |archivedate=November 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Agency for International Development (USAID)===
USAID is a leading development agency within the sector in the Palestinian territories. Their work includes the repair and rehabilitation of small scale water and sanitation facilities, rehabilitation of water and sewage networks as well as replacement of water pumps. In addition, USAID helps communities without access to piped water through water supply via tankers. In rural areas, the agency provides water collection cisterns to poor families. USAID helps to connect households to water and to install rainwater drainage pipes.

On the official web page, USAID announces to provide more than 60&amp;nbsp;km of water pipes in oder to supply ten additional villages in the southern Nablus area with potable water. By 2009, USAID has improved water supply for more than 19,500 households while about 30,000 households gained improved sanitation and connections to sewage networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An example of USAID's work in the Palestinian territories is the '''Emergency Water and Sanitation and Other Infrastructure Program'''. Between 2008 and 2013 USAID finances the second phase of the program. It is supposed to address the urgent need of adequate water and sanitation systems e.g. by providing emergency relief and rehabilitation of existing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another program funded by USAID from 2008-2013 is the '''Infrastructure Needs Program'''. It does not only focus on water, but also includes the financing of other infrastructure that is critical for economic growth. With regard to water, several achievements have been accomplished in 2010. For example, a water transmission line, water distribution systems, reservoirs, and steel water pipes have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===World Bank===
Under the '''Second Gaza Water and Sanitation Project''' which is active from 2005 to 2010, the World Bank provides US$20 million. One objective of the project is to develop a sustainable institutional structure of the water and sanitation sector. This is planned to be achieved through supporting the establishment of a Coastal Water Utility which is owned by the local governments and through increased private sector participation. In addition, the project seeks to strengthen the regulatory and institutional capacity of the PWA. The second objective of the project is the improvement of the water and sanitation services through rehabilitation, upgrade and expansion of the existing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = World Bank
  | title = Projects - West Bank and Gaza : Gaza Water and Sanitation Project (02)

  | accessdate = 2009-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, another US$5 million for the project have been approved by the bank. The additional funding will contribute to finance the institutional strengthening of the Coastal Municipal Water Utility, which has suffered from a very difficult security situation. Moreover, operation and maintenance costs of the water and sanitation facilities in the Gaza Strip for one additional year are covered. One aim is to reduce non-revenue water from 45% to 35%, accompanied by an increase of revenues and customer satisfaction. The funding also provides for [[water meter]]s, chemicals for water treatment and disinfection and the rehabilitation of water production wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the bank provides US$12 million for the '''North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment (NGEST) Project''', which seeks to mitigate the health and environmental risks which arise from the [[Beit Lahia]] Waterwater Treatment Plant. Effluents of the treatment plant are discharged into a lake, putting the surrounding communities at risk. The objective of the project is to provide a long-term solution to wastewater treatment in the Gaza northern governorate. In order to achieve this, the lake is drained. New infiltration basins are built in another location, where the effluent of the lake will be transferred. A new wastewater treatment plant with improved quality standards will be built, covering the whole northern governorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the World Bank approved three water and sanitation projects in the West Bank and Gaza. The '''Water Sector Capacity Building Project''' is supposed to support the Palestinian Water Authority by providing e.g. advisory support, technical assistance and staff training. The objective is to strengthen the PWA's capacity of monitoring, planning and regulating water sector development in the Palestinian territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2011-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, the '''Water Supply and Sanitation Improvements for West Bethlehem Villages Project''' aims at the preparation of a feasibility study and a project concept for wastewater management and reuse in selected rural communities. Other components shall strengthen the capacity of the Water and Wastewater Department and increase the reliability of an existing water supply system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2011-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, the bank approved the third additional financing of the '''Second Gaza Emergency Water Project'''. Besides the capacity improvement of both the PWA and the coastal municipalities' water utility, the project shall ensure the management, operation and delivery of wastewater and water services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Xenophagy''' (Greek "strange" + "eating") and '''allotrophy''' (Greek "other" + "nutrient") are changes in established patterns of [[biological]] consumption, by individuals or groups.

• In [[entomology]], xenophagy is a categorical change in diet, such as an [[herbivore]] becoming [[carnivorous]], a [[predator]] becoming [[necrophagous]], a [[coprophage]] becoming necrophagous or carnivorous, or a reversal of such changes.&lt;ref&gt;Insects and plants: parallel evolution and adaptations - Page 29 Pierre Jolivet - 1986 "Xenophagy is a complete change in diet, the herbivorous diet becoming carnivorous or vice versa, predators becoming necrophagous, coprophages becoming necrophagous or carnivorous, and so on."&lt;/ref&gt; Allotrophy is a less extreme change in diet, such as in the case of the [[seven-spot ladybird]], which can diversify a diet of [[aphid]]s to sometimes include [[pollen]].&lt;ref&gt;Sven Erik Jørgensen ''Encyclopedia of Ecology: P-S'' Page 2924  2008 "Allotrophy is also widespread among insects, an example being the 7-spot ladybird, whose diet is mainly based on aphids (plant lice) but often includes pollen, too."&lt;/ref&gt; There are several apparent cases of allotrophy in Israeli ''[[Longitarsus]]'' beetles.&lt;ref&gt;''Israel journal of entomology'' Volumes 12-14 - Page 138 Entomological Society of Israel - 1978 "Jolivet (1953, 1967, and in litt., 1976) has used the term allotrophy for the cases where a beetle is found to feed on a completely unrelated host from its normally ... There are several apparent cases of allotrophy in Israeli [[Longitarsus]] (Table 1). "&lt;/ref&gt;

• In [[microbiology]], xenophagy is the process by which a cell directs [[autophagy]] against [[pathogen]]s, as reflected in the study of [[antiviral protein|antiviral]] defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando E. Vega, Harry K. Kaya ''Insect Pathology'' Page 470 - 2012 "The process whereby the cell directs its autophagy machinery toward killing pathogens is termed xenophagy (Levine, 2005). Xenophagy is thought to play a role in antiviral defenses (Sabin et al., 2010), although there are few data on these interactions. While the specific molecules controlling this process are poorly understood, they are expected to share similarities ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Cellular xenophagy is an innate component of [[immune response]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Diane Elizabeth Alexander, ''Multiple functions of the herpes simplex virus type 1''  Page 86 Washington University in St. Louis - 2008 "Xenophagy is proving to be an important component of the innate immune response to viral infections. Neuronal expression of the mammalian [[autophagy]] promoting protein Beclin 1 protects mice against lethal Sindbis virus encephalitis "&lt;/ref&gt; though the general importance of xenophagy is not yet certain.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Greer, John Foerster, George M. Rodgers ''Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology'' Volume 2 - Page 271  2008 "The general importance of xenophagy is not yet certain. Among the key components that are transferred to the [[phagosome]] and are critical in creating an antimicrobial environment are the vacuole ATPase, NOS2, and phagocyte oxidase ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Issues in Biological, Biochemical, and Evolutionary Sciences "We also find that the invasive efficiency of group A Streptococcus into cells is not altered by knockdown of VAMP8 or Vti1b, whereas cellular bactericidal efficiency is significantly diminished, indicating that xenophagy is functionally impaired."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Velan, Avigdor Shafferman, Arie Ordentlich -''The Challenge of Highly Pathogenic Microorganisms'' Page 31  2010 "Furthermore, studies have shown the ability of Y. pestis to survive in [[macrophage]]s activated with the cytokine IFNγ. Some vacuolar pathogens appear to co-opt the process of autophagy for survival in host cells. Alternatively, xenophagy is an ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

• In [[ecology]], allotrophy is also reflected in [[eutrophication]], being a change in nutrient source such as an [[aquatic ecosystem]]&lt;ref&gt;''Eutrophication: causes, consequences, correctives'' Page 53 [[National Academy of Sciences]] (U.S.) - 1969 "The allotrophy of a lake indicates the intensity of organic supply from its environment. According to the first statement, trophy should not be equated with the status of nutrient conditions, as advocated by Findenegg (1955)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Inland Aquatic Ecosystem Management'' - Page 16 Sven Erik Jorgensen, Jose Galizia Tundisi, Takako Matsumura Tundisi - 2012 (L 1 ) “Allotrophy” (heterotrophic pathway) “Autotrophy” (autotrophic pathway)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Productivity of world ecosystems'' Page 90 International Council of Scientific Unions. Special Committee for the International Biological Programme - 1975 "DEGREE OF ALLOTROPHY IN STREAMS The role of allochthonous organic matter in stream economy was ... However, the measurement of the degree of allotrophy has been attempted only recently and by a few stream ecologists.&lt;/ref&gt; that starts receiving new nutrients from drainage of the surrounding land.&lt;ref&gt;''Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology''- Page 80 Christopher G. Morris, Academic Press - 1992 "Thus, allotroph, allotrophy. allotrophic lake Ecology, a lake that receives organic material by drainage from the surrounding land. allotropic relating to or characterized by allotropy.
