}}

The '''1-euro coin''' ('''€1''') is a [[euro coin]] with a value of one [[euro]] (€1). It is made of two [[alloy]]s: the inner part of [[cupronickel]], the outer part of nickel [[brass]]. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.

As of July 2015, there were approximately 6.7 billion one-euro coins in circulation, constituting 26.4% of all circulated euro coins by value and 5.9% by quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/euro/circulation/html/index.en.html|title=Banknotes and coins circulation|accessdate=2015-09-11}} See "Circulation of euro coins, quantities report and data" and "Circulation of euro coins, values report and data" in the "Alternative data formats" section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The coin dates from 2002, when euro coins and [[euro banknotes|banknotes]] were introduced in the twelve-member [[Eurozone]] and its [[Eurozone#Use outside the Union|related territories]]. The common side was designed by [[Luc Luycx]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist who won a Europe-wide competition to design the new coins. The design of the one and two euro coins was intended to show the [[European Union]] (EU) as a whole with the then 15 countries more closely joined together than on the 10- to 50-cent coins (the 1- to 5-cent coins showed the EU as one, though intending to show its place in the world).

There were then 15 versions of the national sides (eurozone + [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] who could mint their own) and in each case there was a national competition to decide the design, which had to comply with uniform specifications, such as the requirement to include twelve stars (see [[euro coins]]). National designs were not allowed to change until the end of 2008, unless a [[monarch]] (whose portrait usually appears on the coins) died or abdicated. This happened in Monaco and the Vatican City, resulting in three new designs in circulation (the Vatican had an interim ''[[sede vacante]]'' design until the new [[Pope]] was elected). National designs have seen some changes, as they are now required to include the name of the issuing country: previously neither Finland nor Belgium showed this. {{as of|2010}}, Austria, Germany and Greece are obliged to change their designs due this requirement in the future.

As the [[Member state of the European Union|EU's membership]] has since [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanded]] in 2004 and 2007, with further expansions envisaged, the common face of all euro coins of values of 10 cents and above were redesigned in 2007 to show a new map. This map showed Europe, not just the EU, as one continuous landmass; however [[Cyprus]] was moved west as the map cut off after the [[Bosphorus]] (which was seen as excluding [[Turkey]] for political reasons). The 2007 redesign coincided with the first enlargement of the [[eurozone]] in that year, with the entry of [[Slovenia]]. Hence, the Slovenian design was added to the designs in circulation. Since then designs for [[Cyprus]], [[Malta]], [[Slovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] have been added as each of these states joined the eurozone. [[Andorra]] began minting its own designs in 2014 after winning the right to do so.

==Design==
[[File:EUR 1 edge (2007 issue).png|thumb|Edge of all €1 coins]]
The coins are composed of two alloys. The inner circle is composed of three layers ([[Cupronickel|copper-nickel]], [[nickel]], copper-nickel) and the outer ring of nickel [[brass]], giving the coin a two-colour appearance. The coin has a diameter of 23.25&amp;nbsp;mm, thickness 2.33&amp;nbsp;mm and a mass of 7.5&amp;nbsp;grams. The coins' edges consist of alternating segments: three smooth, three finely ribbed. The coins have been used from 2002, though some are dated 1999, which is the year the [[euro]] was created as a currency, but not put into general circulation.

===Reverse (common) side===
The reverse (used from 2007 onwards) was designed by Luc Luycx and displays a map of Europe, not including [[Iceland]] and cutting off, in a [[semicircle]], at the Bosphorus, north through the middle of [[Ukraine]], then [[Russia]] and through northern [[Scandinavia]]. Cyprus is located further west than it should be and Malta is shown disproportionately large so that it appears on the map. The map has numerous indentations giving an appearance of geography{{clarify|date=September 2013}} rather than a flat design. Six fine lines cut across the map except where there is landmass and have a star at each end—reflecting the twelve stars on the [[flag of Europe]]. Across the map is the word EURO, and a large number 1 appears to the left hand side of the coin. The designer's initials, LL, appear next to Cyprus.

Luc Luycx designed the original coin, which was much the same except that the design was only of the then 15 members in their entirety{{clarify|date=September 2013}} and showing borders and no geographic features.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} The map was less detailed and the lines the stars were upon{{clarify|date=September 2013}} cut through where there would be landmass in [[eastern Europe]] if it were shown.

===Obverse (national) side===
The obverse side of the coin depends on the issuing country. All have to include twelve stars (in most cases a circle around the edge), the engraver's initials and the year of issue. New designs also have to include the name or initials of the issuing country. The side cannot repeat the denomination of the coin unless the issuing country uses an alphabet other than [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (currently, [[Greece]] is the only such country, hence "1 ΕΥΡΩ" is engraved upon its coin. [[Austria]] is currently in breach of the revised rules, but has so far not announced plans to remove "1 EURO" from its coin).

|2006–2013
|-
|FOURTH SERIES: In 2014 the coins were updated with the election of [[Pope Francis]]. ''CITTA DEL VATICANO'' is written around the top, broken by Pope Francis's head, with the date below the O in Vaticano.
|2014–2016
|-
|FIFTH SERIES: After the announcement that Pope Francis would not appear on any coins issued by the Vatican, a new 1-euro coin was issued depicting the papal coat of arms of Francis.
|2017 onward

====Planned designs====
{{See also|Enlargement of the eurozone}}

Austria, Germany and Greece will at some point need to update their designs to comply with guidelines stating they must include the issuing state's name or initial, and not repeat the denomination of the coin.

In addition, there are several EU states that have not yet adopted the euro, some of them have already agreed upon their coin designs; however, it is not know exactly when they will adopt the currency, and hence these are not yet minted. See [[enlargement of the Eurozone]] for expected entry dates of these countries.

====Minting====
One-euro coins have been produced every year in Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands and Spain. In Austria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxemburg, Portugal, San Marino and the Vatican City no €1 coins were minted dated 1999, 2000 and 2001. In [[Monaco]], no €1 coins were minted in 1999, 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2010. Malta did not issue €1 coins in 2009. Slovenia and Slovakia have produced coins every year since their respective entries to the eurozone.

[[Proof coinage|Proof]] €1 coins are minted by the majority, but not all, of the eurozone states.

One of the most valuable planned issues of a €1 coin was by Vatican City in 2002, which may sell for several hundred euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coinweek.com/world-coins/the-coin-analyst-collecting-vatican-coins-can-be-rewarding-in-many-ways/ | title=Collecting Vatican Coins Can Be Rewarding in Many Ways | date = 12 November 2014 | website = coinweek.com | accessdate = 24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the French mint marks were mistakenly not placed on some 2007 Monaco coins which are hence worth more than €200 to collectors.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

PP means the proof-condition coins.
Numbers means if more than one coin was minted in that year in that condition by the country. In Germany, there are five [[Identifying marks on euro coins|mint marks]], so they mint ten types of coins in every year. In Greece, there were coins in 2002 which were minted in Finland with S mint mark. In the Vatican, there were coins minted with [[John Paul II]]'s effigy, and with "Sede Vacante" image in 2005.

==Error coins==
There are several error 1-euro coins: Italian types from 2002 without mintmarks; Portuguese coins, also from 2002 with another type of edging (29 stripes instead of 28) and from 2008 with the first type of the common side, officially used until 2007; and the famous Monegasque coin from 2007 without mint marks.

== History ==

=== Academic research ===
3D Repo version control system—still in its early stages of doctoral research—was originally demonstrated at the joint [[SIGGRAPH]] and Web3D conference in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States]] in August 2012 featuring the [[London King's Cross railway station#Restoration|King's Cross Station Redevelopment]] project by [[Arup Group|Arup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Steed|first2=Anthony|date=2012|title=3D Revision Control Framework|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2338714.2338736|journal=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on 3D Web Technology|series=Web3D '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=121–129|doi=10.1145/2338714.2338736|isbn=9781450314329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Steed|first2=Anthony|date=2012|title=3D Diff: An Interactive Approach to Mesh Differencing and Conflict Resolution|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2343045.2343064|journal=ACM SIGGRAPH 2012 Talks|series=SIGGRAPH '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=15:1–15:1|doi=10.1145/2343045.2343064|isbn=9781450316835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, 3D Repo attended an invited lecture at [[German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence]] (DFKI) in [[Saarbrücken]], [[Germany]] which led to a collaboration and development of the first [[Representational state transfer|REST]] [[Application programming interface|API]] for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://domino.mpi-inf.mpg.de/internet/events.nsf/0/7941CF10F149CE95C1257A8D00513219|title=Campus Event Calendar: Jozef Dobos (10/08/2012 in D 3 2/VizCenter, DFKI)|website=domino.mpi-inf.mpg.de|language=en|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Sons|first2=Kristian|last3=Rubinstein|first3=Dmitri|last4=Slusallek|first4=Philipp|last5=Steed|first5=Anthony|date=2013|title=XML3DRepo: A REST API for Version Controlled 3D Assets on the Web|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2466533.2466537|journal=Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on 3D Web Technology|series=Web3D '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=47–55|doi=10.1145/2466533.2466537|isbn=9781450321334}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front-end visualization was programmed in XML3D and was featured at Web3D 2013 in [[San Sebastián]], [[Spain]].

'''''4′33″''''' (pronounced "'''Four minutes, thirty-three seconds'''" or just "'''Four thirty-three'''")&lt;ref name="Solomon 1998/2002"&gt;Solomon 1998/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; is a three-[[movement (music)|movement]] composition&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Pritchett, Kuhn, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 69–71,&amp;nbsp;86,&amp;nbsp;105,&amp;nbsp;198,&amp;nbsp;218,&amp;nbsp;231.&lt;/ref&gt; by American [[Experimental music|experimental]] composer [[John Cage]] (1912–1992). It was composed in 1952, for any instrument or combination of instruments, and the score instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements. The piece consists of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed,&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is commonly perceived as "four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence".&lt;ref&gt;Fetterman 1996, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard 2003, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the piece refers to the total length in minutes and seconds of a given performance, ''4′33″'' being the total length of the first public performance.&lt;ref&gt;Published score, Edition Peters 6777.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceived around 1947–48, while the composer was working on ''[[Sonatas and Interludes]]'',&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; ''4′33″'' became for Cage the epitome of his idea that any sounds may constitute [[Definition of music|music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.classicalnotes.net/columns/silence.html| title = John Cage and the Avant-Garde: The Sounds of Silence| accessdate = April 4, 2007| last = Gutmann| first = Peter| authorlink = Peter Gutmann (journalist)| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a reflection of the influence of [[Zen Buddhism]], which Cage studied since the late 1940s. In a 1982 interview, and on numerous other occasions, Cage stated that ''4′33″'' was, in his opinion, his most important work.&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz 2003, 70"&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' describes ''4′33″'' as Cage's "most famous and controversial creation".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;

==History of composition==

===Background and influences===
Silence played a major role in several of Cage's works composed before ''4′33″''. The ''Duet for Two Flutes'' (1934), composed when Cage was 22, opens with silence, and silence was an important structural element in some of the ''[[Sonatas and Interludes]]'' (1946–48), ''[[Music of Changes]]'' (1951) and ''Two Pastorales'' (1951). The ''Concerto for prepared piano and orchestra'' (1951) closes with an extended silence, and ''Waiting'' (1952), a piano piece composed just a few months before ''4′33″'', consists of long silences framing a single, short [[ostinato]] pattern. Furthermore, in his songs ''[[The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs]]'' (1942) and ''[[A Flower]]'' (1950) Cage directs the pianist to play a closed instrument, which may be understood as a metaphor of silence.&lt;ref&gt;Revill 1993, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time Cage mentioned the idea of a piece composed entirely of silence was during a 1947 (or 1948) lecture at [[Vassar College]], ''A Composer's Confessions''. Cage told the audience that he had "several new desires", one of which was
&lt;blockquote&gt;to compose a piece of uninterrupted silence and sell it to [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak Co]]. It will be three or four-and-a-half minutes long—those being the standard lengths of "canned" music and its title will be ''Silent Prayer''. It will open with a single idea which I will attempt to make as seductive as the color and shape and fragrance of a flower. The ending will approach imperceptibility.&lt;ref name="pritchett"&gt;Pritchett 1993, 59, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the time, however, Cage felt that such a piece would be "incomprehensible in the Western context," and was reluctant to write it down: "I didn't wish it to appear, even to me, as something easy to do or as a joke. I wanted to mean it utterly and be able to live with it."&lt;ref name="Revill 1993, 164"&gt;Revill 1993, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Painter [[Alfred Leslie]] recalls Cage presenting a "one-minute-of-silence talk" in front of a window during the late 1940s, while visiting Studio 35 at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Stein, Judith |year=2009 |title=Interview: Alfred Leslie |magazine=[[Art in America]] |issue=January 2009 |page=92 |url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/interview-alfred-leslie/ |access-date=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204172036/http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/interview-alfred-leslie/ |archive-date=December 4, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Cage visited the [[anechoic chamber]] at [[Harvard University]]. An anechoic chamber is a room designed in such a way that the walls, ceiling and floor absorb all sounds made in the room, rather than reflecting them as echoes. Such a chamber is also externally sound-proofed. Cage entered the chamber expecting to hear silence, but he wrote later, "I heard two sounds, one high and one low. When I described them to the engineer in charge, he informed me that the high one was my [[nervous system]] in operation, the low one my blood in [[circulatory system|circulation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sask/features/artist/journal2.html |title=A few notes about silence and John Cage |date=November 24, 2004 |publisher=CBC.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212191730/http://www.cbc.ca/sask/features/artist/journal2.html |archivedate=February 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cage had gone to a place where he expected total silence, and yet heard sound. "Until I die there will be sounds. And they will continue following my death. One need not fear about the future of music."&lt;ref&gt;Cage 1961, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The realization as he saw it of the impossibility of silence led to the composition of ''4′33″''.

Another cited influence&lt;ref name="Revill 1993, 164" /&gt; for this piece came from the field of the visual arts. Cage's friend and sometimes colleague [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had produced, in 1951, a series of white paintings, seemingly "blank" canvases (though painted with white house paint) that in fact change according to varying light conditions in the rooms in which they were hung, the shadows of people in the room and so on. This inspired Cage to use a similar idea, as he later stated, "Actually what pushed me into it was not guts but the example of Robert Rauschenberg. His white paintings [...] when I saw those, I said, 'Oh yes, I must. Otherwise I'm lagging, otherwise music is lagging'."&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In an introduction to an article called On Robert Rauschenberg, Artist, and His Works, John Cage writes "To Whom It May Concern: The white paintings came first; my silent piece came later."&lt;ref&gt;Cage, John. Silence: Lectures and Writings. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan UP, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursors===
Compositions that, like ''4′33″'', include no sounds produced by the performer, were conceived by a number of composers and writers before Cage. Examples include the following:
* [[Alphonse Allais]]'s 1897 ''Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man'', consisting of twenty-four blank measures.&lt;ref&gt;Allais, Alphonse. 1897. ''[[Album primo-avrilesque]]'', p. 23-26. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86263801/f29.image Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Allais was an associate of [[Erik Satie]], and given Cage's profound admiration for Satie, it is possible that Cage was inspired by the ''Funeral March''. When asked, Cage claimed he was unaware of Allais's composition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1991, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Gaston Leroux]]'s 1903 novel ''La Double Vie de Théophraste Longuet'', silent concerts are given by the Talpa people.&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Gaston. 1903. ''La Double Vie de Théophraste Longuet''. [http://www.ebooksgratuits.com/pdf/leroux_double_vie_t_longuet.pdf Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Erwin Schulhoff]]'s 1919 "In futurum", a movement from the ''Fünf Pittoresken'' for piano. The Czech composer's meticulously notated composition is made up entirely of rests.&lt;ref&gt;Bek, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Harold Acton]]'s 1928 book ''Cornelian'' a musician conducts "performances consisting largely of silence".&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Humphrey. 1990. ''The Brideshead Generation: Evelyn Waugh and His Friends'', 153. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|978-0-395-44142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1947, jazz musician [[Dave Tough]] joked that he was writing a play in which "A string quartet is playing the most advanced music ever written. It's made up entirely of rests. [...] Suddenly, the viola man jumps up in a rage and shakes his bow at the first violin. 'Lout,' he screams, 'you played that last measure wrong.'"&lt;ref&gt;"New Jazz: 'All or Nothing at All'" (March 16, 1947) ''The Washington Post''. p. S7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yves Klein]]'s 1949 ''Monotone-Silence Symphony'' (informally ''The Monotone Symphony'', conceived 1947–48), an orchestral forty-minute piece whose second and last movement is a twenty-minute silence&lt;ref&gt;See sources and recordings at the [[Yves Klein]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; (the first movement being an unvarying twenty minute drone).
{{further|List of silent musical compositions}}
The musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has argued that ''4′33″'' is an example of [[Automatic behavior|automatism]].  Since the [[Romantic Era]] composers have been striving to produce music that could be separated from any social connections, transcending the boundaries of time and space. In automatism, composers wish to completely remove both the composers and the artist from the process of creation. This is motivated by the belief that what we think of as "self-expression" is really just an infusion of the art with the social standards that we have been subjected to since birth. Therefore, the only way to achieve truth is to remove the artist from the process of creation. Cage achieves that by employing chance (e.g., use of the ''[[I Ching]]'', or tossing coins) to make compositional decisions. In ''4′33″'', neither artist nor composer has any impact on the piece, so that Cage has no way of controlling what ambient sounds will be heard by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin 2009, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" | They missed the point. There's no such thing as silence. What they thought was silence, because they didn't know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds. You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third the people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.

| style="text-align: right;" | — [[John Cage]] speaking about the premiere of ''4′33″''&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz 2003, 70" /&gt;
|}
The premiere of the three-movement ''4′33″'' was given by [[David Tudor]] on August 29, 1952, in [[Maverick Concert Hall]], [[Woodstock, New York]], as part of a recital of contemporary piano music. The audience saw him sit at the piano and, to mark the beginning of the piece, close the keyboard lid. Some time later he opened it briefly, to mark the end of the first movement. This process was repeated for the second and third movements.&lt;ref&gt;The actions of Tudor in the first performance are often misdescribed so that the lid is explained as being open during the movements. Cage's handwritten score (produced after the first performance) states that the lid was closed during the movements, and opened to mark the spaces between.&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece remains controversial to this day, and is seen as challenging the very [[definition of music]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In defining [[noise music]] and its value, Paul Hegarty in ''Noise/Music: A History'' (2007) contends that Cage's ''4′33″'' represents the beginning of [[noise music]] proper. For Hegarty, noise music, as with ''4′33″'', is that music made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between "desirable" sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable "noise" that make up all noise music.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hegarty, ''Noise/Music: A History'' (2007) Continuum International Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

''4′33″'' challenges, or rather exploits to a radical extent, the social regiments of the modern concert life etiquette, experimenting on unsuspecting concert-goers to prove an important point. First, the choice of a prestigious venue and the social status of the composer and the performers automatically heightens audience's expectations for the piece. As a result, the listener is more focused, giving Cage's ''4′33″'' the same amount of attention (or perhaps even more) as if it were Beethoven's Ninth.&lt;ref name="Taruskin 2009, 71"&gt;Taruskin 2009, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even before the performance, the reception of the work is already predetermined by the social setup of the concert. Furthermore, the audience's behavior is limited by the rules and regulation of the concert hall; they will quietly sit and listen to 4′33” of ambient noise. It is not easy to get a large group of people to listen to ambient noise for nearly five minutes, unless they are regulated by the concert hall etiquette.

The second point made by ''4′33″'' concerns duration. According to Cage, duration is the essential building block of all of music. This distinction is motivated by the fact that duration is the only element shared by both silence and sound. As a result, the underlying structure of any musical piece consists of an organized sequence of "time buckets".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin 2009, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; They could be filled with either sounds, silence or noise; where neither of these elements is absolutely necessary for completeness. In the spirit of his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], Cage managed to emancipate the silence and the noise to make it an acceptable or perhaps even integral part of his music composition. ''4′33″'' serves as a radical and extreme illustration of this concept, asking that if the time buckets are the only necessary parts of the musical composition, then what stops the composer from filling them with no intentional sounds?

The third point is that the work of music is defined not only by its content but also by the behavior it elicits from the audience.&lt;ref name="Taruskin 2009, 71" /&gt; In the case of Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring|Rite of Spring]]'', this would consist of widespread dissatisfaction leading up to violent riots. In Cage's ''4′33″'', the audience felt cheated by having to listen to no composed sounds from the performer. Nevertheless, in ''4′33″'' the audience contributed the bulk of the musical material of the piece. Since the piece consists of exclusively ambient noise, the audience's behavior, their whispers and movements, are essential elements that fill the above-mentioned time buckets.

In a 2013 [[TED Talk]], philosophy professor Julian Dodd argues that ''4′33″'' is witty [[conceptual art]], but does not meet the criteria for it to count as music, instead challenging the listener to question what the nature of music is.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=WTCVnKROlos&amp;t=13m38s|title=Is John Cage's 4′33″ music? Prof. Julian Dodd at TEDxUniversityOfManchester}}, June 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 TED Talk, psychologist Paul Bloom puts forward ''4′33″'' as one example to show that knowing about the origin of something influences our opinion about it as "that silence is different from other forms of silence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure?language=en#|title=Paul Bloom: The origins of pleasure - Talk Video - TED.com|author =Paul Bloom|work=ted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versions of the score===
Several versions of the score exist:&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph summarizes some of the findings from Solomon 1998/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; There are four known later versions, one of which is in the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref name=Vogel&gt;Carol Vogel (November 15, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/arts/design/a-glenn-ligon-at-national-gallery-john-cage-at-moma.html A Moment of Silence at MoMA] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The original Woodstock manuscript (August 1952): conventional notation, dedicated to [[David Tudor]]. This manuscript is currently lost. Tudor's attempt at re-creating the original score is reproduced in Fetterman 1996, 74.
* The Kremen manuscript (1953): graphic, space-time notation, dedicated to [[Irwin Kremen]]. The movements of the piece are rendered as space between long vertical lines; a tempo indication is provided (60), and at the end of each movement the time is indicated in minutes and seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Fetterman 1996, 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Edition Peters No. 6777a. Kremen was given the score by Cage on June 5, 1953, for his 28th birthday. The score was later purchased for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] by [[Henry R. Kravis]] in honor of his wife, [[Marie-Josée Drouin]], the museum's president.&lt;ref name=Vogel /&gt;
* The so-called ''First Tacet Edition'': a typewritten score, lists the three movements using Roman numbers, with the word "[[Tacet|TACET]]" underneath each. A note by Cage describes the first performance and mentions that "the work may be performed by any instrumentalist or combination of instrumentalists and last any length of time." Edition Peters No. 6777 (out of print).
* The so-called ''Second Tacet Edition'': same as the First, except that it is printed in Cage's calligraphy, and the explanatory note mentions the Kremen manuscript. Edition Peters No. 6777 (i.e., it carries the same catalog number as the first ''Tacet Edition'') Additionally, a facsimile, reduced in size, of the Kremen manuscript, appeared in July 1967 in ''Source'' 1, no. 2:46–54; the ''First Tacet Edition'' is described in Nyman 1974, 3, but it is not reproduced in that book.

There is some discrepancy between the lengths of individual movements of the premiere performance, specified in different versions of the score. The Woodstock printed program specifies the lengths 30″, 2′23″ and 1′40″, as does the Kremen manuscript, and presumably the original manuscript had the same indications. However, in the ''First Tacet Edition'' Cage writes that at the premiere the timings were 33″, 2′40″ and 1′20″. In the ''Second Tacet Edition'' he adds that after the premier a copy has been made for Irwin Kremen, in which the lengths of the movements were 30″, 2′23″ and 1′40″. The causes of this discrepancy are not currently understood, the original manuscript being still lost.&lt;ref name="Solomon 1998/2002" /&gt;

===''4′33″ No. 2''===
In 1962, Cage wrote '''''0′00″''''', which is also referred to as '''''4′33″ No. 2'''''. The directions originally consisted of one sentence: "In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action." At the first performance Cage had to write that sentence.

The second performance added four new qualifications to the directions: "the performer should allow any interruptions of the action, the action should fulfill an obligation to others, the same action should not be used in more than one performance, and should not be the performance of a musical composition."&lt;ref name="pritchett" /&gt;

===''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''===
In late 1989, three years before his death, Cage revisited the idea of ''4′33″'' one last time. He composed ''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'', the full title of which is ''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4′33″ (0′00″) + [[Image:GClef.svg|9px]]''. As in all [[Number Pieces|number pieces]], "One" refers to the number of performers required. The score instructs the performer to build a [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]] in the concert hall, so that "the whole hall is on the edge of [[Audio feedback|feedback]], without actually feeding back." The content of the piece is the electronically amplified sound of the hall and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://johncage.org/pp/John-Cage-Work-Detail.cfm?work_ID=299 |title= One3 = 4'33" (0'0") + [G clef] |website= John Cage |access-date= 25 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances and recordings==
''4′33″'' has been recorded on several occasions: [[Frank Zappa]] recorded it as part of ''A Chance Operation: The John Cage Tribute'', on the Koch label, 1993; in 2002, [[James Tenney]] performed ''4′33″'' at Rudolf Schindler's historic [[Kings Road House]] in celebration of the work's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney's recording is archived on line via The Society for the Activation of Social Space through Art and Sound (SASSAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several performances of ''4′33″'' including a "techno remix" by [[New Waver]] were broadcast on Australian radio station [[ABC Classic FM]], as part of a program exploring "sonic responses" to Cage's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s376971.htm|title=ABC Classic FM music details for 11 July 2001|access-date=January 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425183449/http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s376971.htm|archive-date=April 25, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kouvaras|first=Linda|title=Loading the Silence: Australian Sound Art in the Post-Digital Age|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Farnham|isbn=9781409441564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish electronic band [[Covenant (band)|Covenant]] concluded their 2000 album ''[[United States of Mind (album)|United States of Mind]]'' with a rendition of ''4′33″'' entitled "You Can Make Your Own Music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Alexander S.|date=2013|title=Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=43|isbn=9780199339624|quote=Industrial trio Covenant conclude their 2000 album ''United States of Mind'' with four minutes and thirty-three soundless seconds (on a track called "You Can Make Your Own Music"), nodding slyly to composer John Cage, whose silent ''4’33”'' of 1952 may be the ultimate open question of what constitutes music; but the other ten songs on Covenant's album are more or less all pop tunes with scarcely a trace of Cage's vital indeterminacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2004, at the [[Barbican Centre]] in London, the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] gave the UK's first orchestral performance of this work. The performance was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, and one of the main challenges was that the station's emergency backup systems are designed to switch on and play music whenever apparent silence ([[dead air]]) lasting longer than a preset duration is detected. They had to be switched off for this performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/01_january/12/john_cage.shtml|title=BBC Press Office, Cage Uncaged|date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tongue-in-cheek]] version was recorded by the staff of the UK ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper on January 16, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jan/16/1?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Guardian recording of 4′33|date=January 16, 2004 | location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the work was voted to be number 40 in the ABC radio's [[Classic 100 piano (ABC)|Classic 100 piano countdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Classic 100 Piano |url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/classic100/piano.htm |publisher=[[ABC Classic FM]] |accessdate=25 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A silence of four minutes and thirty-three seconds appears as the penultimate track of the 2009 [[Living Colour]] album [[The Chair in the Doorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Living Colour –  The Chair In The Doorway|url=https://www.discogs.com/Living-Colour-The-Chair-In-The-Doorway/master/236886 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2010, an international simultaneous performance of Cage's ''4′33″'' took place involving over 200 performers, amateur and professional musicians, and artists. The global orchestra, conducted live by Bob Dickinson, former member of post-punk group [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], via video link, performed the piece in support of the Cage Against The Machine campaign to bring ''4′33″'' to Christmas number 1 in 2010. A second performance took place on December 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We're pitching the silence of John Cage against the noise of Simon Cowell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8195729/Were-pitching-the-silence-of-John-Cage-against-the-noise-of-Simon-Cowell.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=December 11, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010|location=London|first=Norman|last=Lebrecht|authorlink=Norman Lebrecht| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110121140124/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8195729/Were-pitching-the-silence-of-John-Cage-against-the-noise-of-Simon-Cowell.html| archivedate= January 21, 2011  | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Family Thing''''' is a 1996 film starring [[Robert Duvall]], [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Irma P. Hall]]. It was written by [[Billy Bob Thornton]] and [[Tom Epperson]] and directed by [[Richard Pearce (film director)|Richard Pearce]].

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=June 2016}}
The film is a drama about a [[Scotch-Irish American]] [[Southern United States|Southerner]] (Duvall) named Earl Pilcher, whose late mother makes a shocking revelation in a letter that is given to him after her death. She reveals that Earl's biological mother was a [[Black American]] maid named Willa Mae, who was raped by Earl's (white) father and that she died while giving birth to Earl. His adoptive mother's dying wish is that he go to [[Chicago]] to meet his half-brother, Raymond Murdock (Jones). 

Earl initially takes the unexpected news of his mixed parentage badly, tearfully challenging his father to confirm the facts in the letter. Old and feeble, his father refuses to discuss the letter, but admits it is true. As a result, Earl packs up his clothes and takes off for Chicago to find his brother.  

He meets Ray at city hall (where Ray works as a police officer) and Ray, although he really wants nothing to do with Earl, agrees to meet him for lunch at a diner. 

During lunch, Ray reveals that he knew all along that he had a half white brother and that he hates Earl's father (and Earl too by association) because he feels Earl's birth is what killed his mother.  He says in so many words that he doesn't want or need a brother, and they go their separate ways.  But when Earl leaves and drives off in his truck he encounters four black Chicago street toughs who rear end his truck.  When Earl gets out to survey the (minimal) damage, he, being a trusting Southern "good ol' boy", leaves his keys in the ignition. The toughs beat him up and steal his truck and his wallet.  He walks around in a daze and ends up in a hospital. The hospital staff finds Ray's information in Earl's pocket and calls Ray.  He comes reluctantly, and the doctor tells him that Earl may have a concussion and needs to take it easy for a couple of days; no traveling is allowed. She also tells him that the hospital is full, so he will have to take Earl home to recuperate.  

At Ray's home, Earl meets Aunt T (Hall), a kind and generous elderly woman who is blind. Aunt T. is Willa Mae's sister, and thus, Earl's aunt. 

Earl also meets Ray's son, Virgil (Beach), a surly and hostile city bus driver who doesn't appreciate a white southerner sleeping in his bed. At first, Earl's stay at the Murdoch residence is rocky. 

Ray explains that Earl is an old war buddy whose life he saved, but Virgil is skeptical.  During a grocery shopping excursion with Earl, Aunt T reveals that she knows who Earl really is.

In a powerful scene, Aunt T scolds Ray and Virgil for not welcoming a member of their family, no matter how different he is. Earl overhears the discussion and leaves Ray's house, walking unknowingly into a bad part of town.

Ray gives in to Aunt T's wish that he welcome Earl into their home, and he quickly locates him on a nearby street. Earl obstinately refuses to come back with Ray, knowing he is not wanted. The two argue, ending up in an awkward wrestling match, and Earl uses the word "nigger" to punctuate his disdain for Ray, seeing too late that he has gone too far. Angry at Earl's callous words, Ray tells Earl to stay away from him, and he heads back home.

Meanwhile, Earl wanders Chicago and gets drunk at a Chicago bar, where he is tossed out for bothering a black couple. He ends up sleeping under a bridge. The next day, Ray has cooled down and, again on Aunt T.'s wishes, manages to find Earl, who apologizes for his words and rude behavior. The two begin to settle their differences. 

When Virgil's estranged wife (played by [[Regina Taylor]]) and their two daughters visit, Earl learns that Virgil had a promising career in football that was shattered by an injury in college. Virgil cannot cope with the missed opportunities caused by his injury, and, the resulting bitterness has hurt his relationship with his family.

Ray and Earl bond together more as they find similarities between them. Both served in the military (Earl as a firefighter in the [[United States Navy]], and Ray in the [[U.S. Marines]]) during the [[Korean War]], where they received lifelong scars.

Ray reveals that as a child, he once threw a rock at Earl that could have blinded him, because of Ray's hatred towards Earl's father.

Later on, in a bar, Earl takes Virgil aside and explains to him that by dwelling on the loss of his football career, he isn't devoting himself to his wife and children in the way he should. Both of them begin to have a grudging respect for the other.

Once Earl is ready to go home, and the police unexpectedly find his truck operational (it was shot up in a bank robbery), Aunt T. sits Earl and Ray down to tell them the dramatic tale of the night Earl was born and Willa Mae died.

According to Aunt T., Willa Mae knew she was likely to die and Earl's life was saved only by the quick action of his adoptive mother, Carrie, who brought a white doctor to the shack where Willa Mae and Ray lived to help with the delivery.

Aunt T speculates that Carrie and Willa Mae agreed that Earl, who was born with white-appearing features, should be raised by Carrie and his biological father. Aunt T. gives Earl a picture of Willa Mae which he keeps near.  Earl begins to accept his new family with pride, and he convinces Ray to return to their Arkansas hometown to find their mother's grave. As they share a drink on her tombstone, Earl decides to take Ray to meet his southern family and tell them the unlikely story, ending the movie by joking with Ray that when Earl's ''white'' nephew finds out he is part black, he will likely want to fight the both of them.

The '''Albertina''' is a [[museum]] in the [[Innere Stadt]] (First District) of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It houses one of the largest and most important [[print room]]s in the world with approximately 65,000 [[drawing]]s and approximately 1 million [[old master print]]s, as well as more modern graphic works, photographs and architectural drawings.  Apart from the graphics collection the museum has recently acquired on permanent loan two significant collections of [[Impressionist]] and early 20th-century art, some of which will be on permanent display. The museum also houses temporary exhibitions.

== History==
The Albertina was erected on one of the last remaining sections of the [[fortification]]s of Vienna, the Augustinian [[Bastion]]. Originally, the Hofbauamt (Court Construction Office), which had been built in the second half of the 17th century, stood in that location. In 1744 it was refurbished by the director of the Hofbauamt, [[Emanuel Teles Count Silva-Tarouca]], to become his [[palace]]; it was therefore also known as ''Palais Taroucca''. The building was later taken over by [[Albert of Saxe-Teschen|Duke Albert of Saxen-Teschen]] who used it as his residence. He later brought his graphics collection there from [[Brussels]], where he had acted as the [[Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]]. He had the building extended by [[Louis Montoyer]]. Since then, the palace has immediately bordered the [[Hofburg]]. The collection was expanded by Albert's successors.

The collection was created by Duke Albert with the Genoese count [[Giacomo Durazzo]], the Austrian ambassador in Venice. In 1776 the count presented nearly 1,000 pieces of art to the duke and his wife [[Archduchess Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen|Maria Christina]] ([[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]'s daughter). Count Durazzo, who was the brother of [[Marcello Durazzo]], the [[Doge of Genoa]] – "wanted to create a collection for posterity that served higher purposes than all others: education and the power of morality should distinguish his collection...." 
In the 1820s [[Archduke Charles of Austria|Archduke Charles]], Duke Albert and Maria Christina's foster son, initiated further modifications to the building by [[Joseph Kornhäusel]], which affected mostly its interior decoration. After Archduke Charles, his son [[Archduke Albert (1817-1895)|Archduke Albrecht]] then Albrecht's nephew [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen]] lived in the building.

In early 1919, ownership of both the building and the collection passed from the [[Habsburg]]s to the newly founded Republic of [[Austria]]. In 1920 the collection of prints and drawings was united with the collection of the former imperial court library. The name Albertina was established in 1921. 

In March 1945, the Albertina was heavily damaged by Allied [[bomb]] attacks. The building was rebuilt in the years after the war and was completely refurbished and modernized from 1998 to 2003. Modifications of the exterior entrance sequence, including a signature roof by [[Hans Hollein]] were completed 2008, when also the graphics collection finally reopened.

'''The Arden School of Theatre''', also known as '''The Arden''', is a [[Drama school]] and is part of the Performing Arts faculty at [[Ucen manchester|UCEN Manchester]] located in [[Manchester]], [[England]].

The Arden School of Theatre was founded jointly by the [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester]] and [[City College Manchester|South Manchester College]] in 1991 by the Senior Curriculum Manager Robert S Ely, to provide [[vocational degree]] level theatrical education in the North of England, one of the first to provide theatrical degrees in the [[United Kingdom]]. The School wanted to expand to provide other theatrical professions, but today only provides courses for actors and musical theatre performers. The Arden name came from the original City College Arden Campus where the drama school was based between 1991 and 2004, in Northenden, South Manchester. It has never been a member of the [[Conference of Drama Schools]].

The school now provides four BA (Hons) programmes, validated by [[Sheffield Hallam University]] in Acting for Live and Recorded Media (Marie Mair), Dance and Performance (Belinda Grantham), Musical Theatre (Andrew Stephenson), and Theatre and Performance ([[Wayne Steven Jackson]]).

The College is a founder member of the  National Skills Academy for Creative &amp; Cultural Skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa-ccskills.co.uk|title=National Skills Academy Homepage|website=Nsa-ccskills.co.uk|accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a wide range of relationships locally with the Contact Theatre and the Royal Exchange theatre. Graduates Showcases are presented each year both in the region and in London with a number of casting agents for Acting, Dance, and Musical Theatre.  Theatre and Performance present the annual unTaPped festival each year in May.

In 2006, The Arden moved into new premises located over three floors at Universal Square, a development by Frogmore Northern who had renovated the former [[Great Universal Stores]] headquarters offices. In September 2010 The Arden moved into [[Ellen Wilkinson High School|Nicholls House]], Ardwick, Manchester; a renovated Victorian building with additional rehearsal space, production rooms and voice and singing rooms. The programmes utilise a dedicated theatre space at The Waterside Theatre, attached to the Manchester College Shena Simon Campus, [[Whitworth Street]] in central Manchester. Collaboration with other College degree programmes allows access to other specialist facilities including music recording studios and radio studio and film and television production equipment.

The Arden teaching faculty boasts a wealth of industry experience with Theatre professionals such as West End Musical Director ''Robert Purvis'' and broadway leading man and director [[Tim Flavin]], TV and Screen Actors Marie Critchley,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|nm2174363|Marie Critchley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul Broughton&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|nm0112701|Paul Broughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;, dancers Belinda Grantham and Tomas Simon, as well as performance makers [[Wayne Steven Jackson]] and Graham Hicks.

An '''artist's proof''' is, at least in theory, an impression of a print taken in the [[printmaking]] process to see the current printing state of a plate while the plate (or stone, or woodblock) is being worked on by the artist. A proof may show a clearly incomplete image, often called a ''working proof'' or ''trial impression'', but in modern practice is usually used to describe an impression of the finished work that is identical to the numbered copies.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Prints and Printmaking, Antony Griffiths, British Museum Press (in UK),2nd edn, 1996 {{ISBN|0-7141-2608-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be ''printer's proofs'' which are taken for the printer to see how the image is printing, or are final impressions the printer is allowed to keep; but normally the term "artist's proof" would cover both cases.

Artist's proofs are not included in the count of a limited [[edition (printmaking)|edition]], and sometimes the number of artist's proofs, which belong to the artist, can be twenty or more. By convention, the artist is not supposed to sell these at once.

==History==
The term "proof" is generally, but not consistently, applied only to prints from the late eighteenth-century onwards, beginning with the English [[mezzotint]]ers, who began the practice of issuing small editions of proofs for collectors, often before the "lettering" or inscription below the image was added.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt; The practices of signing or numbering impressions in the main edition had not begun, and in the absence of this, it is normally only when the image is clearly different from the final form that the term proof has any meaning.

In [[old master print]]s, a proof will be described as belonging to a different [[State (printmaking)|state]] of the print. States are numbered I, II, III etc., in the sequence they were produced, which can normally be determined.

For example, [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], who had his own printing-press and printed at least the earliest copies of his [[etching]]s himself, was a great taker of proofs, but these are normally described as different states - his record was nine for one etching, although this involved returning to an older print he had sold many copies of, and largely reworking it.

But the term proof can be used in the case of a clear working proof of an [[old master print]], like the two impressions of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''Adam and Eve''  (1504, [[British Museum]] and [[Albertina, Vienna]]) which show the figures largely finished but the background with only the main outlines lightly done.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;

== Status ==

Art historians, curators, and collectors view working proofs as especially desirable because of their rarity, the insight they may give into the progress of the work, and because they may well have belonged to the artist. Especially in the case of dead artists, they can be the only evidence of the artist's incremental development of an image, something not usually available with [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s, or [[sculpture]]. Some lithographs may be hand signed in the border and labeled "Epreuve D'Artiste", which means Artist's Proof, which also increases its value.

Collectors also usually prefer final artist's proofs even when they are identical to the main edition; if nothing else the print may have been presented to a friend by the artist.  Prints are generally sold as limited editions, with a print being cheaper than a drawing or painting because the artist/gallery makes more money by selling multiples. An artist's proof has special value because of its extra rarity and its possible differences from the "standard" print, factors that are often reflected in its price.

== Printshop technicians ==

Since many printmaking processes require expensive equipment, most artists choose to work with specialist printers. The print shop provides technicians skilled in the process; the artist provides the art. It is customary in these cases to pay the technicians with a signed artist's proof, in addition to his wages. The print shop will also retain a proof, normally signed off as "bon à tirer" ("good for printing" in French) to use as a control example against which the other impressions are compared. This has resulted in some very impressive collections of prints owned by printmakers themselves.

An artist's proof is also known as a "comp" or "complimentary" if given to printers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11186">'''Associated American Artists''' ('''AAA''') was an [[Art museum|art gallery]] [[New York City|in New York City that was established in 1934 and]] [[New York City|ceased operation in 2000.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=11|nopp=|oclc=910009711}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gallery marketed art to the [[middle class|middle and upper-middle class]]es, first in the form of affordable prints and later in home furnishings and accessories, and played a significant role in the growth of art as an industry.

==Beginnings==
Associated American Artists was begun by [[Reeves Lewenthal]].  Lewenthal's first job was as a reporter for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' but he quickly expanded into artists' agent, working as a publicist for British artist [[Douglas Chandor]].  By the 1930s Lewenthal had a clientele of 35 groups including the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Beaux-Arts Institute of Design]].  Realizing the limited possibilities in selling high-priced art to high-class dealers, and the correspondingly huge potential in marketing affordable art to the much larger middle classes, he left his [[public relations]] work to try his hand at this new business model.

[[Lithography|Print]]s being relatively cheap to produce, Lewenthal decided to focus on that medium.  Before the 1930s, fine-art prints were usually [[special edition|limited edition]]s which sold for $10–$50.  During the [[Great Depression]] the [[Federal Art Project]] had resulted in hundreds of thousands of prints, but these were distributed free (mostly to schools) thus the artists made no profits from print sales. Lewenthal's idea was to combine quality, affordability, and profit.  In 1934 he met with several well-known American artists, including [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and proposed hiring them to produce lithographs which he would then sell to middle-class buyers for $5 apiece plus $2 per frame, paying the artist $200 per [[edition (printmaking)|edition]].  At the same time, [[corporation]]s began hiring famous artists to work on [[advertising campaign]]s – [[Dole Pineapple]], for example, hired artist [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] to "create pictorial links between pineapple juice and tropical romance".&lt;ref&gt;Doss, Erika.  "Catering to Consumerism: Associated American Artists and the Marketing of Modern Art, 1934-1958." ''Winterthur Portfolio,'' Vol. 26, No. 2/3. (Summer - Autumn, 1991), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;  This convergence of art, business, and consumerism was the perfect environment for Lewenthal's new Associated American Artists enterprise.

When Lewenthal [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]ed his first lithographs in 1934, the American economy was still limping towards recovery from the Depression; high-priced art was an impossible [[Luxury good|luxury]] for most people and the old galleries that had always supported artists were finding it difficult to broker their work. AAA was thus "an agent of economic salvation" for numerous American artists including [[Peggy Bacon]], [[Aaron Bohrod]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Luigi Lucioni]], and [[Grant Wood]], despite the fact that signing with AAA usually meant being fired from their higher-end gallery.

:''I knew the regionalists were popular because their names were in the art magazines all the time.  But they weren't popular enough, and they weren't making any money.  Why, when I first went to Tom Benton's New York apartment he was living in utter squalor.  I more or less rescued him.''&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fall of 1934 Lewenthal had contracts with fifty department stores to carry his "signed originals by America's great artists." &lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Populist appeal==
Lewenthal marketed his prints as educational resources, as a [[patriotism|patriotic]] choice, and as "art for the people" rather than "art for the wealthy."  In January 1935 AAA issued its first mail-order print catalogue; mail-order print sales will continue for the next forty-nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=15|oclc=909251636}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also placed advertisements in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and by promoting print collecting in terms of upward mobility—in the same way as buying Listerine ("The Dentifrice of the Rich," according to one ad campaign&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;), owning modern art raised one's life socially. AAA's success led them to open a 30,000-square-foot gallery at 711 Fifth Avenue in 1939 where they featured paintings and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=15|oclc=909251636}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, AAA had 107 artists under contract and sold 62,374 lithographs, for a net income of $1 million per month.

In addition to its mainstream marketing strategy, AAA chose art and artists with [[populism|populist]] appeal.  [[Representationalism|Representational]] and [[Regionalism (art)|regional]] art made up the bulk of their lines; particularly popular were the works of Benton, Curry and Wood.  These artists avoided gritty realism and created positive images of an idealized, strong, capable America, a viewpoint which accorded well with the political environment of the [[New Deal]] and was in some senses [[therapy|therapeutic]] for the anxiety and weakness pervasive during and just after the Depression.  Typical of this was Benton's ''Plowing It Under'', released shortly after the federal government arranged the plowing under of millions of acres previously devoted to cotton production in order to increase farm revenue; Benton's work reassured the public that the government was working in the best interests of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization of art==
The Regionalists by and large were in favor of businesses and advertising using their works, believing that fine art could raise the consciousness of business.  They did not fully realize how art figured into corporate [[brand management|branding]] and advertising in the minds of corporate planners, or consider that their art might be used to inspire confidence in a product.  They were soon to learn. Benton's original works for R.J. Reynolds' [[Lucky Strikes]], for example, showed black [[sharecropper]]s at work, but corporate headquarters were not interested in "Negroes doing what looked like old-time slave work."  They demanded pictures that showed not realism but idealism, leading Benton to complain that "Every time a patron dictates to an artist what is to be done, he doesn't get any art, he just gets a poor commercial job."&lt;ref&gt;Doss, pp. 158-159&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly, rather than deal with AAA and its artists, companies built in-house [[art department]]s that could produce art in the Regionalist style.  This appropriation of the regionalist/representational style culminated in the [[Propaganda in the United States#Government propaganda|propaganda posters of World War II]].

==Post-WWII==
The increasing association of regionalist and representational art with commercialism and advertising (and in some eyes, with [[fascism]]) contributed to its decreasing popularity and to the rise of [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] art after World War II.  When AAA opened galleries in [[Chicago]] and [[Beverly Hills]], it stocked them with modern works by American and—a first for AAA—European artists.  (When Lewenthal offered [[Jackson Pollock]] an art-for-business commission like those he had offered his artists in 1934, Pollock turned him down.)  In its [[press release]]s and articles AAA talked about exploring "new frontiers," "new trends" --  and made no mention of the $5 mail-order line and the artists who had helped it succeed twenty years earlier.  Thomas Hart Benton resigned from AAA in 1946.

AAA continued to find new ways to sell art, however, branching out into [[Stonelain]] porcelain, fabric, and housewares such as ashtrays, playing cards, and lamp shades as vehicles for work in abstract and other modern styles.  By the mid-1950s, Lewenthal was quoted as saying, "Today's artist is a designer, not an [[Ivory Tower]] tenant.  His is a field of practical creativity and every American room can become a showcase for his genius.".&lt;ref&gt;Article in ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Now, rather than bringing modern art to the masses, AAA was bringing mass consumer commodities into the world of art.

AAA was a victim of its own success in some ways.  Having been so successful, it was adopted as a model by other companies that began to compete with AAA—marketing fabric, for example, as "etching by the yard" or commissioning artists to do designs for lines of china or wallpaper.  [[Steubenville China]] marketed its "American Modern" line of place settings as "art translated into dinnerware." &lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958 Lewenthal took over management of Rust Craft Greeting Cards, handling all AAA's decorative arts lines, while [[Sylvan Cole]] took responsibility for the New York gallery and the fine art market.

In a strange reversal of its "market to the masses" philosophy, many early AAA prints which sold originally for $5 go to [[art collector]]s for thousands of dollars today.

[[File:Book of Ballymote 170v.jpg|thumb|220px|fol. 170v of the Book of Ballymote, the Incipit of the ''Auraicept''.]]

'''''Auraicept na n-Éces''''' ({{IPA-ga|arakʲept na neːgʲes|}}, "the scholars' [''éices''] primer [''airaiccecht'']") is claimed as a 7th-century work of Irish [[Linguist|grammarians]], written by a scholar named '''Longarad'''. 
The core of the text could indeed date to the mid-7th century, but much material will have been added over the five centuries preceding the text as recorded in the earliest surviving copy (12th century).

If indeed dating to the 7th century, the text is the first instance of a defence of [[vernacular]]s, defending the spoken [[Irish language]] over [[Latin]], predating [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' by 600 years and [[Chernorizets Hrabar]]'s ''O pismeneh'' by 200 years.

==Contents==
The Auraicept consists of four books,
: I: The Book of [[Fenius Farsaidh]]
: II: The Book of [[Amergin Glúingel|Amergin]]
: III: The Book of Fercheirtne Filidh
: IV: The Book of [[Cenn Fáelad mac Ailella|Cennfaeladh]]

The author argues from a comparison of Gaelic grammar with the materials used in the constructions of the [[Tower of Babel]]:

:Others affirm that in the tower there were only nine materials and that these were [[clay]] and [[water]], [[wool]] and [[blood]], [[wood]] and [[lime (material)|lime]], [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], [[linen]], and [[bitumen]] [...] These represent noun, pronoun, verb, adverb, participle, conjunction, preposition, interjection

(note the discrepancy of nine materials vs. eight parts of speech). As pointed out by Eco (1993), Gaelic was thus argued to be the  only instance of a language that overcame the [[confusion of tongues]], being the first language that was  created after the fall of the tower by the seventy-two wise men of the school of [[Fenius]], choosing all that was best in each language to implement in Irish.  Calder notes (p. xxxii) that the poetic list of the "72 races" was taken from a poem by [[Luccreth moccu Chiara]].

===Ogham===
The ''Auraicept'' is one of the three main sources of the manuscript tradition about [[Ogham]], the others being ''[[In Lebor Ogaim]]'' and ''[[De dúilib feda na forfed]]''. A copy of ''In Lebor Ogaim'' immediately precedes the ''Auraincept'' in the Book of Ballymote, but instead of the ''[[Bríatharogam]] Con Culainn'' given in other copies, there follows a variety of other "secret" modes of ogham. The [[Younger Futhark]] are also included, as'' ogam lochlannach'' "ogham of the Norsemen".

[[File:Book of Ballymote 170r.jpg|thumb|220px|fol. 170r of the ''Book of Ballymote'', variants of ogham, nr. 43 (''sluagogam'') to nr. 77 (''sigla'').]]

Similar to the argument of the precedence of the Gaelic language, the ''Auraicept'' claims that [[Fenius Farsa]]idh discovered four alphabets, the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] ones, and finally the [[ogham]], and that the ogham is the most perfected because it was discovered last. The text is the origin of the tradition that the ogham letters were named after trees, but it gives as an alternative possibility that the letters are named for the 25 members of Fenius' school.

In the translation of Calder (1917),
:''This is their number: five Oghmic groups, i.e., five men for each group, and one up to five for each of them, that their signs may be distinguished. These are their signs: right of stem, left of stem, athwart of stem, through stem, about stem. Thus is a tree climbed, to wit, treading on the root of the tree first with thy right hand first and thy left hand after. Then with the stem, and against it and through it and about it. (Lines 947-951)''

In the translation of McManus:
:''This is their number: there are five groups of ogham and each group has five letters and each of them has from one to five scores and their orientations distinguish them. Their orientations are: right of the stemline, left of the stemline, across the stemline, through the stemline, around the stemline. Ogham is climbed as a tree is climbed..."''

Retrieved 14 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; The film, a joint [[Russia|Russian]]-[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] production, was released in both countries on April 2, 2015; its international premiere took place two weeks later at the [[Beijing International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4084744/releaseinfo Bitva za Sevastopol (2015) - Release Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically speaking, the movie revolves around the events of the [[Siege_of_Odessa_(1941)|siege of Odessa]] and the [[Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1941%E2%80%9342)|siege of Sevastopol]].

The film is directed by Sergey Mokritskiy and stars [[Yulia Peresild]] as Pavlichenko. In addition to Beijing, where Peresild was awarded Best Actress award, the film has also appeared at [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes-news/battle-for-sevastopol-sold-into-asia/5087942.article 'Battle for Sevastopol' sold into Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film opens and closes with post-war scenes from the perspective of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] ([[Joan Blackham]]) as she visits the protagonist Lyudmila Pavlichenko (Yulia Peresild) during the former first lady's 1957 trip to the Soviet Union. Pavlichenko's story is told through flashbacks to 1942 when Pavlichenko toured the United States with Roosevelt, and further flashbacks to Pavlichenko's experiences in the Soviet Union. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], university student Pavlichenko becomes a sniper in the [[25th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|25th Rifle Division]]. She fights in the [[Battle of Odessa (1941)|Battle of Odessa]] and, eventually, the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|defense of Sevastopol]]. After 309 confirmed kills, she is sent to the [[United States]] to campaign for American support. Eleanor Roosevelt invites her to the White House, and the two become friends.

In 1941, Lyudmila is a student who has just gotten into university; to celebrate, she goes to a shooting range with her friends including a classmate named Masha, doing exceptionally well despite never have shot before. At home, her father shows no pride in her, having desired a son who could become a soldier. In a twist of events, her perfect shooting results at the range eventually result in the military contacting her for a sharpshooting program, as Germany has just invaded the Soviet Union. Though a doctor courting her, Boris, tells her she should stay with him, she rejects what she perceives as cowardice and leaves to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

During training, Lyudmila is shown as an excellent sniper, and eventually is partnered with a grizzled veteran named Makarov, who she falls in love with. He doesn't return her affections, however, and explains that he had lost his wife and family when the Germans invaded. She is also reunited with Masha, who is now a nurse engaged with a young pilot. During battle defending the city of Odessa, she is injured and Makarov drags her to safety to a local hospital, where Boris has volunteered as a military doctor. After awakening, Lyudmila manages to get Boris to sign her papers so that she can return to the frontlines, but finds out that Makarov has died in battle and the Soviets are retreating to Sevastopol.

She is paired with another superior, Leonid, and begins to show signs of trauma, showing signs of cruelty by shooting enemy soldiers to wound them and watch them suffer, rather than kill them instantly. Thus, their relationship starts off rough, but they eventually develop a close romance. Masha invites them to her wedding, but at the wedding reveals that her fiance had died, leaving her alone. This leads Lyudmila to tell Leonid privately that she wants a son.

While on patrol in a field, Leonid steps on a mine that triggers a [[flare]]. Immediately, artillery shells begin to pummel the field, and Leonid shelters her from them with his body. Lyudmila again wakes up in a hospital, where Boris tells her Leonid has died. Though in a broken state, she is ordered to kill a top enemy sniper for propaganda purposes. The duel takes all of a day, and, tired of waiting, Lyudmila steps out of cover, exposing herself completely. She is shot, but manages to pinpoint the enemy sniper's location and kills him.

Boris eventually is able to pull her away from battle. As the city is being evacuated, Boris carries a traumatized Lyudmila to a submarine that is evacuating the city. As panicked civilians attempt to board evacuating ships, Lyudmila realizes that Boris isn't coming with her, as he gave her his ticket. A voiceover by Eleanor Roosevelt reveals that Boris, Masha, and countless civilians and soldiers died defending the city from the Germans.

Roosevelt later visits Lyudmila after the war, where she is now a mother. They attend the opera together, with Lyudmila's son.

== Production ==
The filming began in 2012 after the first archive material devoted to Pavlichenko was examined. Serhiy Mokrytskyi, who is better known as a cinematographer, served as director; after his arrival, the plot was altered to more closely match Pavlichenko's life. During production, there was concern of the growing [[Russia-Ukraine relations|political tension between Russia and Ukraine]].
However, the film was successfully released in both countries on the same day, in each country's own respective language.

==Box office==
The movie grossed [[Ruble|RUB]] 435,468,256 ($8,702,274) in the Russian box office against a budget of RUB 124,000,000 and hence was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/742026/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bitter Honey''''' is a 2014 [[documentary film]] directed by anthropologist and filmmaker [[Robert Lemelson]] that chronicles the lives of three polygamous families living in [[Bali|Bali, Indonesia]]. The film follows the wives from their introduction to the polygamous lifestyle to the emotional hardships and jealousies to their struggle for empowerment and equal rights.

==Production==
''Bitter Honey'' was directed by Robert Lemelson, an anthropologist and filmmaker with a doctorate from [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3199649/&lt;/ref&gt; Lemelson had originally been researching the [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|1998 mass rapes]] perpetrated during the economic crisis and the fall of the [[Suharto]] regime. Realizing that these acts were only one piece of the larger puzzle of gender inequality in Indonesia, Lemelson shifted his focus to domestic violence and particularly how it coincided with polygamous kinship forms.&lt;ref name="The Blot"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://theblot.com/bitter-honey-shows-ugly-side-of-bali-where-polygamy-and-domestic-abuse-reign-7726463 | title= ‘Bitter Honey' shows ugly side of Bali, where polygamy and domestic abuse reign | work=[[The Blot]] | date=October 2, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Olds, Dorri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/anthropologist-s-film-exposes-plight-of-polygamy-in-indonesia | title= Anthropologist’s film exposes plight of polygamy in Indonesia | work=[[UCLA Newsroom]] | date=September 25, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Barrosse, Emilia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film’s title refers to a regional play on words, as the local term for co-wife (''madu'') also translates to “honey.”&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/movies/bitter-honey-looks-at-multiple-spouses-in-bali.html?_r=4 | title= The Pain of Polygamy | work=[[New York Times]] | date=October 30, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Webster, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot over a period of seven years.&lt;ref name="LVLD"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.leveledmag.com/2014/10/bitter-honey-documentary-polygamy-violence/ | title= Bitter Honey: A Documentary on Polygamy, Love and Violence | work=[[Leveled Magazine]] |date=October 1, 2014 | accessdate= January 14, 2015 | author=Maleszka, Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemelson used this longitudinal approach to gain the trust of his subjects, saying, “We returned over and over so that people could see we weren’t just there to get data and never return.”&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt;

The film is presented in thematic chapters, with each new section introduced by a traditional [[Wayang | Wayang Kulit]] shadow-puppet performance about the issues surrounding polygamous unions. The filmmakers commissioned this performance for use in the film.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-bitter-honey-1201321492/ | title=Film Review: ‘Bitter Honey’ | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=October 4, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Harvey, Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier cuts of “Bitter Honey”, the film had focused on the husbands in these polygamous arrangements, but Lemelson quickly realized that the more compelling story arose from examining how these marriages are experienced by the co-wives.&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film follows the lives of three polygamous families living in Bali, Indonesia, where [[polygyny|polygynous]] unions make up about 10% of households.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-bitter-honey-movie-review-20141003-story.html | title=‘Bitter Honey’ doesn’t sugarcoat polygamy | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=October 2, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Linden, Sheri}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the family of Sadra, a fair trade craftsman with two wives and eight children living in separate compounds. Sadra’s main narrative thread concerns generational cycles of violence and his abusive relationship with his first wife and mother, and its effect on his children. At one point in the narrative, Sadra’s first wife requests the help of his boss and a local human rights lawyer to stage an intervention confronting Sadra about his abusive behavior.&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt; 
The second family is that of local thug and cockfight organizer, Darma. His five wives each describe how they were “tricked or badgered” into accepting a polygamous marriage and their efforts to come to terms with it.&lt;ref name="HWR"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/bitter-honey-film-review-729282 | title=‘Bitter Honey’: Film Review | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=September 15, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=DeFore, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darma frequently seeks sexual relationships outside of his marital bonds, including with sex workers—putting himself and his wives at risk of STD infection.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/bitter-honey-movie-review/2014/11/05/e83fb7e2-5fb1-11e4-8b9e-2ccdac31a031_story.html | title=‘Bitter Honey’ movie review | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=November 6, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Merry, Stephanie }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consisting of ten wives, the third family profiled is that of Sang Putu Tuaji, a powerful elderly man who was the leader of a local anti-communist militia.&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;

==Release==
The film opened in limited theatrical release in the United States on October 3, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bitterhoneyfilm.com/screenings/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
Critical reception was mixed to positive, with reviewers praising the film for its objective illumination of cultural issues in relation to gender status in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/10/23/movie-review-bitter-honey-leaves-unsettling-taste/1BuXQwM4K9migdN9NzTv7M/story.html | title=‘Bitter Honey’ leaves an unsettling taste | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=October 23, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Keough, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many reviewers praised the film for its potential as an educational tool within Bali as well as in Western classrooms.&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HWR" /&gt; Critics of the film believed it to be too narrow in its focus. Dennis Harvey of [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] wrote, “Intriguing enough in what it shows, ''Bitter Honey'' nonetheless frustrates for what it doesn’t.”&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;

The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an overall 67% positive approval rating based on 9 reviews, and a [[Weighted mean|rating average]] of 5.8 out of 10.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bitter_honey/|title= Bitter Honey (2014)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date= |accessdate=January 15, 2014|publisher=Flixter, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating “generally favorable reviews.”&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bitter-honey|title=Bitter Honey|website=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CH2M HILL''', also known as '''CH2M''', was a global engineering company that provided consulting, design, construction, and operations services for corporations, and federal, state, and local governments.  The firm's headquarters was in [[Meridian, Colorado|Meridian]], an unincorporated area of [[Douglas County, Colorado]], in the [[Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area]].

The postal designation of nearby [[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]] was commonly listed as the company's location in corporate filings and local news accounts. As of December 2013, CH2M had approximately 26,000 employees and 2013 revenues totaled $5.88&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="CH2M-Hill-Companies-Ltd-2013-10-K" /&gt;

The firm was [[employee-owned company|employee owned]],&lt;ref name=employee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/about_us/employee_ownership/default.asp|publisher=CH2M Hill|title=Employee Ownership|accessdate=2007-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831165324/http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/about_us/employee_ownership/default.asp|archivedate=August 31, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an internal stock market that operated buy/sell events quarterly.

In December 2017, it was announced that CH2M had been acquired by Jacobs Engineering Group, a Dallas Engineering firm, reportedly for $3.3 Billion. &lt;ref name="Acquisition"&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/18/ch2m-colorado-jacobs-engineering-group-purchase/ |title=CH2M, one of Colorado’s largest private companies, is swallowed up by Texas firm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CH2M was founded in 1946 in [[Corvallis, Oregon]], by [[Oregon State University]] civil engineering professor Fred Merryfield and three of his students: Holly Cornell, James Howland and Thomas Burke Hayes (the firm was named after the founders, with Howland and Hayes making up the '''H2''' portion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/about_us/history.asp |title=CH2M Hill – Our History |publisher=Ch2m.com |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cornell, Howland, and Hayes were all graduates of Oregon State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/ |title=Oregon State University |publisher=Oregonstate.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company became CH2M Hill, after a merger in 1971 with Clair A. Hill and Associates of [[Redding, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/about_us/history.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402214509/http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/about_us/history.asp |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy }}, CH2M.com&lt;/ref&gt; The firm remained headquartered in Oregon until 1980, when a decision was made to relocate to Colorado, a more central location in the United States.

On August 2, 2017, CH2M agreed to be purchased by [[Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.]] in a US$2.85 billion cash and stock deal. Shareholders approved the deal in December 2017,&lt;ref name="TCI-15Dec2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=CH2M shareholders back merger with Jacobs|url=http://www.theconstructionindex.com/news/view/ch2m-shareholders-back-merger-with-jacobs|accessdate=18 December 2017|work=The Construction Index|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the completion of the acquisition was announced on 18 December.&lt;ref name="TCI-18Dec2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jacobs completes acquisition of CH2M|url=http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/jacobs-completes-acquisition-of-ch2m|accessdate=18 December 2017|work=The Construction Index|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company manages projects for the clients, taking into account the [[environmental footprint]], aiming to use sustainable technology.

In 2008, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) contracted a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), to manage deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, one of the world's largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a {{convert|586|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to {{convert|75|sqmi|km2}} or less.

More importantly, the project will reduce legacy infrastructure costs on site by more than $25&amp;nbsp;million per year starting in 2015. Using [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

When ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink to a total of {{convert|290|sqmi|km2}}, roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">The '''Camden Roll''' is a 13th-century English [[roll of arms]] believed to have been created c. 1280, containing 270 painted [[coats of arms]] with 185 French [[blazon]]s for various English and European monarchs, lords and knights.

The original roll is now held at the [[British Museum]] as Cotton Roll XV. 8. It consists of three [[vellum]] membranes in total measuring 6.25" by 63". The face of the roll consists of 270 painted shields arranged in 45 rows of six shields, each with associated names and/or titles listed above each shield. The dorse includes French blazons for 185 of the shields on the face.&lt;ref name="Aspilogia I"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=Anthony Richard|title=A Catalogue of English Medieval Rolls of Arms.|year=1950|publisher=Charles Batey for The Society of Antiquaries|location=Society Of Antiquaries|isbn=0854312129|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The roll belonged to [[William Camden]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], c. 1605, and is believed to have been among several documents and manuscripts which were willed to [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington]], in 1623. In 1700 Sir John Cotton, Sir Robert's grandson, sold the [[Cotton library|Cottonian library]] to the nation, and in 1753 the collection was granted to the British Museum in London.&lt;ref name="Aspilogia I" /&gt;

==Contents==
The coats on the face of the roll are loosely divided into the following sections:&lt;ref name="Aspilogia I" /&gt; 
*Shields 1-18: Emperors and kings
*Shields 19-24: Foreign dukes
*Shields 25, 27, 29, 30, 34, 36, 37: English earls
*Shield 26: "Sire Aunfour" ([[Alphonso, Earl of Chester|Alphonso of England, Earl of Chester]], eldest son of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]])
*Shield 28: "Prince of Gales" ([[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]])
*Shields 31-3, and 35: Foreign counts
*The rest are those of English lords and knights, with the following exceptions: 44-51, 54, 56-61, 71-2, 83, 88, 94, 102, 181, 184, 207-8, 226, 240, 243, 246, 256-67, 270
The blazons, written in French on the dorse, are of the shields 1-202 with the omission of 9 "Rey de Escoce" ([[King of Scotland]]), 86 "Johan Giffard" ([[John Giffard (died 1299)|John Giffard]]), and several others.

In [[drama]], particularly the [[tragedies]] of [[classical antiquity]], the '''catastrophe''' is the final resolution in a poem or narrative plot, which unravels the intrigue and brings the piece to a close. In comedies, this may be a marriage between [[main character]]s; in tragedies, it may be the death of one or more main characters. It is the final part of a play, following the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[catastasis]].

The catastrophe is either simple or complex, for which also the [[fable]] and action are denominated. In a simple catastrophe, there is no change in the state of the main characters, nor any discovery or unravelling; the plot being only a mere passage out of agitation, to quiet and repose. This catastrophe is rather accommodated to the nature of the [[Epic poetry|epic]] poem, than of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a complex catastrophe, the main character undergoes a change of fortune, sometimes by means of a discovery, and sometimes without. The qualifications of this change are that it be probable and necessary: in order to be probable, it must be the natural result or effect of the foregoing actions, ''i.e.'' it must spring from the subject itself, or take its rise from the incidents, and not be introduced merely to serve a turn.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

The ''discovery'' in a complex catastrophe must have the same qualifications as the catastrophe itself, of which it is a principal part: it must be both probable and necessary. To be probable, it must spring out of the subject itself; not affected by means of marks or tokens, rings, bracelets, or by a mere recollection, as is frequently done both in ancient and modern times. To be necessary, it must never leave the characters it concerns in the same sentiments they had before, but still produce either love or hatred, etc. Sometimes, the change consists in the discovery, sometimes it follows at a distance, and sometimes results immediately from it; the last was used, for example, in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

Among critics, it has long been debated whether the catastrophe should always end happily, and favorably on the side of virtue, or not; ''i.e.'' whether virtue is always to be rewarded, and vice punished, in the catastrophe. [[Aristotle]], for example, preferred a shocking catastrophe, rather than a happy one; in that regard, the moving of terror and pity, which is the aim of tragedy, is better effected by the former than the latter.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

[[René Le Bossu]], a 17th-century French critic, divides the catastrophe, at least with regards to epics, into the unravelling, or ''[[denouement]]'', and the finishing, or ''achievement''; the latter of which he makes the result of the former, and to consist in the hero's passage out of a state of trouble and agitation, to rest and quiet. This period is but a point, without extent or duration; in which it differs from the former, which comprehends everything after the plot is laid. He adds, that there are several unravellings in a piece, each interconnected. The ''finishing'' is the end of the last unravelling.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] distinguished between what he called the ''catastrophe'' and the ''[[eucatastrophe]]''. The eucatastrophe is a classical catastrophe with an unexpected positive outcome for the protagonist. This term was coined to distance itself from the vernacular use of the word 'catastrophe' to signify disaster (which gave the term negative connotations in everyday usage).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1899">'''DFMA''' stands for Design for Manufacture and Assembly.  DFMA is the combination of two methodologies; [[Design for manufacturability|Design for Manufacture]], which means the design for ease of manufacture of the parts that will form a product, and [[Design for assembly|Design for Assembly]], which means the design of the product for ease of assembly.

==Usage==
DFMA is used as the basis for [[concurrent engineering]] studies to provide guidance to the design team in simplifying the product structure, to reduce manufacturing and assembly costs, and to quantify improvements. The practice of applying DFMA is to identify, quantify and eliminate waste or inefficiency in a product design. DFMA is therefore a component of [[Lean Manufacturing]]
DFMA is also used as a benchmarking tool to study competitors’ products, and as a should cost tool to assist in supplier negotiations.&lt;ref&gt; Boothroyd, G., Dewhurst, P. and Knight, W., “Product Design for Manufacture and Assembly, 2nd Edition”, Marcel Dekker, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
DFMA is the name of the integrated set of software products from Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc. that are used by companies to implement the DFMA methodology.  DFMA is a registered trademark of Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc.

'''G. Peignot et Fils foundry''' (Fonderie G. Peignot et Fils) was a French [[type foundry|typographic foundry]], established in 1898 and closed down between 1919 and 1923 after a merger to become [[Deberny &amp; Peignot|Deberny &amp; Peignot foundry]]. Led by [[Georges Peignot]] (1872&amp;ndash;1915), G. Peignot &amp; Fils was a prestigious French typographic foundry, an "elite house",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Louis Barthou | title = Lettres à un jeune français. XXV. La contagion sublime | journal = Les Annales  | volume = | issue = 1727 | pages =  | date = July 1916  | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Louis Barthou]], former French Prime Minister.

== History ==
G. Peignot et Fils is founded in 1898 in [[Paris]], after absorption of the '''Veuve Routier et Peignot''' foundry (established in 1867), itself heir of the foundry "Veuve Routier" (established in 1865) and foundry of Pierre Leclerc (established in 1842).

=== Foundry of Pierre Leclerc (1842) ===
In 1842, Pierre Leclerc, a craftsman, creates a [[Letter-spacing|fixed spaces]] foundry (hand-set metal type to achieve letter-spacing) in Paris. ''"He can be considered as the genuine creator of the fixed spaces industry"'', says the magazine ''La fonderie typographique'' in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = | title = Gustave Peignot | journal = La fonderie typographique | volume = | issue = 7 | pages =  | date = 1899  | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fixed spaces between words and lines, margins, etc., require great precision. He invents a new process, instead of cutting fixed spaces, pouring them into molds, which increases accuracy. In 1856, after his death,&lt;ref name="Tuleu"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Tuleu | first1 = Jane | title = Souvenirs de famille | place = Paris | publisher = Deberny |pages = 77 | date = 1915 | isbn =  | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company management is entrusted to a friend of his widow, Clémentine Dupont de Vieux Pont (wife Peignot, 1815-1897). She then settles beside her his son, Gustave Peignot (1839-1899), engineer of [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech|Arts et Métiers school]].&lt;ref name="froissart"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Froissart | first1 = Jean-Luc | title = L’or, l’âme et les cendres du plomb. L'épopée des Peignot, 1815-1983 | place = Paris | publisher = librairie Tekhnê |pages = | date = 2004 | isbn = 2-9522836-0-5 | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veuve Routier (1865) and Veuve Routier et G. Peignot (1867) foundries===
In 1865, the foundry of Pierre Leclerc is sold by auction to Peignot. The new company is called "Veuve Routier" (''Widow Routier''), which is the name of the lessor having made possible the purchase by Gustave Peignot. In 1867, Gustave Peignot and the lessor merge in a company which takes the name of "Veuve Routier et Peignot."

In 1869 the company moved to Boulevard de Montrouge (now boulevard Edgar-Quinet), at no. 66-68, where a building is constructed (upstairs for the family, ground for the plant).&lt;ref name="Tuleu" /&gt; In 1875, the debt to the Veuve Routier is cleared, and Gustave Peignot becomes sole owner of the company and the building.
[[File:1883-g-peignot-fonderie-publicite.png|thumb|600 px|Advertisement for G. Peignot foundry published in ''L'imprimerie'' magazine, in 1883]]

From 1875 to 1898, Gustave Peignot continues to make great profits with fixed spaces production, not amputated this time by refunds to the Veuve Routier. ''"In this lead will Thou find gold"'', used to say his mother.&lt;ref name="froissart" /&gt; At this time, Gustave Peignot becomes first President of the Chambre syndicale des maîtres fondeurs typographes (trade association of type foundry masters). He marries Marie Laporte, and is a father of 8 children.

=== G. Peignot et Fils Foundry (1898)=== 
In 1898, Gustave Peignot distributes to his children an equal parts of stocks and appoints Georges Peignot, his second son, as co-manager.&lt;ref name="Tuleu" /&gt; The company's name changes for "G. Peignot &amp; Fils" (''G. Peignot &amp; Sons''). He dies in 1899.

Georges Peignot continues the production of fixed spaces, causing significant growth in sales, and launches studies for new [[typeface]]s. The quality of fonts puts foundry G. Peignot et Fils at the forefront. In 12 years, Georges Peignot creates many typefaces: [[Grasset (typeface)|Grasset]], [[Auriol (typeface)|Auriol]], [[Cochin (typeface)|Cochin]], [[Garamond (typeface)|Garamond-Peignot]], [[Bellery-Desfontaines (typeface)|Bellery-Desfontaines]], [[Naudin (typeface)|Naudin]], [[Guy-Arnoux (typeface)|Guy-Arnoux]]. He also publishes a ''Specimen'', great typefaces catalog (still highly sought, 600 pages, 2 volumes).

In 1904, to address growth of sales, G. Peignot et Fils built a new plant at the corner of [[Rue Cabanis (Paris)|Cabanis]] and [[Rue Ferrus (Paris)|Ferrus]] streets. In 1911-1912, Georges Peignot sends in South America his two young brothers, Lucien and Rémy, looking for distributors. The company is at its peak.

But war brakes out in 1914. Volunteer for the front, Adjudant Georges Peignot is killed by a bullet to the forehead at the head of his section, Sept. 28, 1915, near Givenchy.&lt;ref name="froissart"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Froissart | first1 = Jean-Luc | title = L’or, l’âme et les cendres du plomb. L'épopée des Peignot, 1815-1983 | place = Paris | publisher = librairie Tekhnê |pages = | date = 2004 | isbn = 2-9522836-0-5 | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; His four brothers also die.

The legacy of Georges Peignot is taken hostage by infighting: in 1919, his own mother, Marie Laporte-Peignot, requires its children or their widows the payment of a substantial sum (1 million of French francs, equivalent of USD [2015] 1,4 million) in the form of a capital increase&lt;ref name="froissart" /&gt; to its competitor Deberny (founded by [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] in 1826), owned by Charles Tuleu (heir of Alexandre de Berny and husband of Jane Peignot-Tuleu). In 1923, G. Peignot et Fils foundry disappears, victim of the merger between Deberny foundry (2.6 million, including the 1 million Peignot subsidy) and G. Peignot &amp; Fils foundry (4.1 million). The new company's name relegates Peignot's name in background: the new entity is indeed called "[[Deberny et Peignot]]" and commonly called "Deberny". Against all logic (the manager is usually chosen by the majority shareholder), the manager of the small Deberny foundry, Robert Girard, under whom the old foundry Deberny had collapsed,&lt;ref name="froissart" /&gt; takes the reins of the new entity.

In 1922, the Commission de l’enseignement et des beaux-arts (governmental ''Commission for education and fine arts'') suggests honoring the story of Peignot: it transports the awls of the foundry in the building of the Imprimerie nationale (Government printing office), near [[Rue Gutenberg (Paris)|Gutenberg street]] in [[Paris]]. And it proposes that the continuation of this street would be baptized "[[Rue des Quatre-Frères-Peignot (Paris)|rue des Quatre-Frères-Peignot]]" (''Four-brothers-Peignot street'') in memory of Georges, André, Lucien and Rémy who died between September, 1914 and June, 1916, snatched by the World War I.

The '''Hamilton King Award''' is an annual award, presented to one individual, for excellence in illustration by the [[Society of Illustrators]].

== History ==

The Hamilton King Award was established in 1965 by Mrs. Hamilton King in memory of her husband through a bequest and is presented annually for the best illustration in the annual exhibition executed by a member of the [[Society of Illustrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Society of Illustrators | url=http://www.societyillustrators.org/HamiltonKing.aspx?id=140 | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton King (1871–1941)&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00098749?rskey=dp4IvD&amp;result=9 Benezit Dictionary of Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent illustrator who worked in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanartarchives.com/king,h.htm americanartarchives]&lt;/ref&gt; King illustrated the "[[Coca-Cola]] girls" for calendars from 1910 to 1913. The Coca-Cola calendar work was considered significant because the artist's signature appeared in all printed matter for Coca-Cola, including serving trays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Famous Artists Who Have Worked With Coca-Cola | url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coke-lore-commissioned-artists | date=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King became well known for his "Hamilton King Girls", significantly working on behalf of [http://www.metmuseum.org/en/collections/search-the-collections?&amp;what=Color+lithographs&amp;who=Turkish+Trophies+Cigarettes&amp;pg=1 Turkish Trophies Cigarettes].

'''''Hoodlum''''' is a 1997 American [[crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] that gives a fictionalized account of the gang war between the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian]]/[[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish mafia]] alliance and the Black gangsters of [[Harlem]] that took place in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The film concentrated on [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson]] ([[Laurence Fishburne]]), [[Dutch Schultz]] ([[Tim Roth]]), and [[Lucky Luciano]] ([[Andy García]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0119311|title=Hoodlum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=March 2015}}

After being paroled from [[Sing Sing]], Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) returns to [[Harlem]] to resume his old life. He is welcomed back by his cousin, Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride) as well as Stephanie "Madame Queen" St. Clair ([[Cicely Tyson]]), the monarch reigning over the [[Numbers game|numbers racket]] in Harlem. The psychopathic Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] associate who reports to mob boss Charles "Lucky" Luciano (Andy Garcia) runs the numbers rackets in downtown New York. His gang has been crowding into Harlem, terrorizing residents to only play the numbers with his operation.

While hanging on the stoop one afternoon with Illinois and his girlfriend Mary, Bumpy meets one of Mary's friends, Francine (Vanessa Williams). She and Illinois talk trash to each other, with her disapproving of the 'numbers' rackets Illinois is involved in and him defending it as the only way to make ends meet in the Depression. Bumpy introduces himself to her and is obviously interested. They meet again in a nightclub and dance together. Bumpy walks Francine home and they debate the effect of gambling in Harlem on its citizens. At her door, she says that he could do anything he wanted. He responds that he has written some poetry and then recites a poem to her, about her beautiful eyes.

Dutch Schultz asks to partner with the Queen, who declines the offer, as she disapproves of the violent tactics Schultz uses to terrorize her customers. Later a hit is ordered by Dutch on the Queen; however Whispers ([[Paul Benjamin]]) and Bumpy repel the attackers. Using his friendship with corrupt Captain Foley ([[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]]), of the New York City Police Department, Schultz arranges for the Queen to be arrested, and the Queen asks Johnson to take charge of the business during her incarceration. The Queen instructs Johnson to avoid bloodshed, but Schultz's men grow increasingly violent.

Bumpy and Dutch start a devastating war with each other. In one of Dutch's attempts on Bumpy's life, Dutch employs two big hit men. They break into Bumpy's home, killing two of his bodyguards and making their way up to the bedroom, where Bumpy and Francine are. They attack Bumpy and Francine in the bathroom. One of them is killed and the scene culminates in Francine having to shoot the other just as he is about to kill Bumpy. They hold each other on the floor of the bathroom, covered in blood. More and more people are killed, including the sixteen-year-old Tyrone, who begged Bumpy to let him become a numbers runner for him.

One afternoon, Bumpy and Francine are having a banana split in his favorite ice cream parlor. Bumpy notices in the nick of time that the split has almonds on it, which he never orders. Francine is already to dig in when Bumpy stops her. Suddenly, the tension mounts, Bumpy's men rush all the regular citizens out of the parlor and pull down the shades. After questioning the terrified owner, Bumpy finds out that it was the new boy, Jimmie, who made the split, which has been poisoned. Bumpy invites him over to the table where he asks him to eat the split. The kid makes all kinds of excuses and is also terrified. After more threatening, he confesses it was one of Bumpy's closest men, Vallie, who set Bumpy up. Bumpy sends Francine out of the parlor and forces the kid to eat the poisoned ice cream. Bumpy, Illinois, Whispers and two other of his men take Vallie to a private pool hall and question Vallie about the set-up. Vallie weeps, confessing it was all for the money and begs for his life. Bumpy notices a nice ring on Vallie's finger and asks him if he bought it with the money, which Vallie vehemently denies. Eventually, everyone walks out except Whispers, who cuts Vallie's throat with a straight razor.

Bumpy and his gang show up at the Cotton Club in downtown New York. This is in Dutch's territory and does not allow black people in except as entertainers. Dutch is holding court. The place goes silent as Bumpy tells Dutch that he knows all about his operation and if Dutch doesn't shut it down, Bumpy will do it for him. Dutch mentions Vallie and Bumpy replies that Vallie won't be able to comment anymore but left a souvenir for Dutch. He puts a handkerchief on the table that contains a bloody finger, with a fancy ring on it. It nearly comes to a shoot-out, with cooler heads holding Dutch. Bumpy and his gang leave. When Dutch continues terrorizing uptown Harlem, Bumpy engages an explosives expert to rig a bomb. He and Illinois manage to infiltrate one of Dutch's liquor warehouses as delivery boys and just manage to get away before the whole building explodes.

In the meantime, Dutch and his men have broken into Mary's house (Illinois' girlfriend). Dutch hits and threatens her, asking her where Illinois is. One of his right hand men, Bub (Clarence Williams III) says she doesn't know anything and he doesn't have to do this. Dutch tells him to toughen up. After blowing up the warehouse, Illinois makes his way back to Mary's to find her dead.

Bumpy arrives home where Francine tells him that she is leaving him. He is enraged and starts throwing the fancy dresses and jewels that he bought at her. She yells that she didn't want any of them and that she doesn't know him anymore, that he is no longer the good man with whom she had fallen in love.

Devastated by Mary's death, Illinois gets drunk and tells Bumpy that he's changed, that he is as bad as Dutch now. They have it out; Illinois says he's finished with Bumpy and staggers out. As he's walking down the street, Captain Foley and Bub Hewlett ([[Clarence Williams III]]) see him, kidnap him and chain him up in a machinery room. Foley beats him and wants to torture him for information. Hewlett says Illinois isn't going to talk and wants him let go. He leaves but Foley kills him using a corkscrew. Eager to end the war between each faction, Luciano decides to try and make the Schultz and Johnson come to an agreement, although neither wants to compromise.

Later that evening, word comes to the Johnson house that Illinois has been found murdered. Johnson and his gang go to the warehouse where Illinois was killed and find him hanging by a chain on the outside wall, one of the 'numbers' tickets in his mouth and a suitcase with "No More Secrets" written across it attached to him. A local witness tells them that he saw a man with Captain's bars with Illinois shortly before his murder. Bumpy immediately knows who it is and gets his revenge on Foley by cutting his throat after finding him in a room with a prostitute. As Bumpy is leaving, he sees Bub Hewlett and asks if he had a hand in Illinois's murder. He denies any involvement so Bumpy spares him and tells him that he now owes him.
 
Bumpy has a meeting with Bub and tells him that it's not in his best interest to continue working for Dutch. Bumpy later contacts Luciano and tells him that he wants to compromise. Luciano agrees to the terms and they devise a plan to kill Dutch. Cecil, Luciano's driver, appears to betray Luciano and Bumpy by telling Dutch what they are planning. Cecil, however, is being paid by Bumpy to do so. Believing he now has the upper hand, Dutch plans the murder of Luciano and Bumpy but fails to do so. Luciano and Bumpy's plan is revealed when Lulu ([[Ed O'Ross]]) (Dutch's right-hand man) follows Dutch into the restroom and shoots him three times. Dutch walks out of the restroom and down the stairs, sits down at a table and drops dead. Lulu walks outside, gets in Luciano's car and asks to be paid but instead, an associate of Luciano's shoots him dead and dumps his body on the sidewalk.
 
The last scene shows Bumpy asking Bub if those involved have been paid, with Bub saying yes. With the Queen back in business, Johnson tells Bub that he has some unfinished business and Bub says he's going to go get some sleep. The two shake hands and part company. Bumpy then walks across the street and enters the church to briefly pay his final respects to Illinois. The gospel choir sings "Amazing Grace" while he walks down the aisle, exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen. When he arrives at the coffin, he goes down on his knees with tears in his eyes, then turns and walks out. He takes off his hat and turns his face up to the pouring rain, letting it run down his face.

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that "the film is being marketed as a violent action picture, and in a sense, it is" and that director [[Bill Duke]] having made "a historical drama as much as a thriller, and his characters reflect a time when Harlem seemed poised on the brink of better things, and the despair of the postwar years was not easily seen on its prosperous streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Roger Ebert | date = August 27, 1997 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970827/REVIEWS/708270302 | title = Hoodlum :: rogerebert.com | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">The '''Integrated Circuit Topography Act''' ("An Act to provide for the protection of integrated circuit topographies and to amend certain Acts in consequence thereof", C-37) is legislation passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1990 that regulates the [[intellectual property]] of [[mask work|integrated circuit topographies]]. It came into force in 1993. The Act provides [[exclusive right]]s for the creator of the integrated circuit topography and remedies to deter infringement. The exclusive right is transferable. To receive the exclusive right to an integrated circuit topography the topography must be registered at the [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]. Between 1993 and 1999 there were about 38 registrations under the Act.

Integrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) are electronic integrated circuits or '''IC products''' that are configured and interconnected. These creations are protected in Canada by the Integrated Circuit Topography Act, which gives the creator exclusive rights for a period of ten years after registration. Because products containing these circuits are often exported outside Canada, Canada has reciprocal agreements with other countries that also protect the design for ten years.

==Shabbat and circumcision==
{{Judaism}}
The Shabbat, according to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign ("ot") between Him and His people. It states, "Moreover also I gave them my shabbats, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them."  The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means He set it apart for only Holy use.  The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, "six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work".

==The Tabernacle and the sacrifices==

{{Main|Tabernacle (Judaism)|Korban}}

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], while the [[Israelites]] were living in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] for forty years, they built a Tabernacle ({{lang-he|משכן}} [[transliteration|translit]]: ''mishkan'', "Place of [Divine] dwelling"); this was viewed as the abode of the Shekhinah (the presence of YHWH) on Earth, and the place where the priests could minister to God on behalf of the nation of Israel.

==The priests==
The Hebrew for priest is ''Kohen''; the ''Kohanim'' (plural) mediated between God and man by offering sacrifices, and by other services in the Temple. The leader of them the ''Kohen Gadol'', the high priest.

The vestments of the high priest were interpreted in three ways. The explanation of Philo is as follows ("Vita Mosis," iii. 209): His upper garment was the symbol of the ether, while the blossoms represented the earth, the [[pomegranate]]s typified running water, and the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s denoted the music of the water. The [[ephod]] corresponded to heaven, and the stones on both shoulders to the two hemispheres, one above and the other below the earth. The six names on each of the stones were the six signs of the [[zodiac]], which were denoted also by the twelve names on [[Priestly breastplate|the breastplate]]. The miter was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.

[[Josephus]]' explanation is this:&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." iii. 7, § 7&lt;/ref&gt; The coat was the symbol of the earth, the upper garment emblemized heaven, while the bells and pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The [[ephod]] typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was in the center of the ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the [[girdle]] symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the miter was a token of heaven.

The [[Talmud|Jerusalem Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;Menachot vii. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Midrash]] ''Leviticus Rabbah'' (x.) give the following interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder or for the sin of wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement for unchastity. The miter denoted atonement for pride, and the belt for theft or trickery. The breastplate represented atonement for any perversion of the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.

==The symbolic values of numbers==
{{See also|Significance of numbers of Judaism|Hebrew numerology}}

The number [[3 (number)|three]] was the symbol of holiness and love. The Holy of Holies occupied one-third, and the Holy Place two-thirds, of the entire Temple. The tapestries were ten times three [[ell]]s in length, and there were three vessels each for the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, and the Ark. The candlestick had twice three arms (besides the shaft, which also held a lamp), and each arm had three knobs. The blessing of the priest consisted of three sections,&lt;ref&gt;Num. vi. 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt; and in the invocation of God the word "holy" was repeated thrice.

The symbolism of the number [[4 (number)|four]] was based on the contemplation of the quaternity as found in the universe, which included both heaven and earth&lt;ref&gt;comp. Job xxxvii. I Copied from wikipedia3; Isa. xi. 12; Ezek. vii. 2; I Chron. ix. 24; Dan. viii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number four connoted [[heaven]] as the throne of God.

The Holy of Holies was in the form of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], and the Holy Place was a double cube in length. All the vessels of the Temple in Jerusalem (except the candlestick) were rectangular. According to Ezekiel i. 26-28, the number four symbolized the divine revelation, while in the view of Philo it was the number of complete harmony.&lt;ref&gt;"De Opificio Mundi," pp.&amp;nbsp;13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The number [[5 (number)|five]] typified semicompletion. The dimensions of the curtain of the Holy of Holies were four ells by five; the altar in the court covered a surface of five square ells; and there were five pillars at the entrance to the Tabernacle.

The number [[6 (number)|six]] symbolizes imperfection.

The number [[7 (number)|seven]] was the general symbol for all association with God, and was the favorite religious number of Judaism, typifying the covenant of holiness and sanctification, and also all that was holy and sanctifying in purpose. The candlestick had seven lamps, and the acts of atonement and purification were accompanied by a sevenfold sprinkling. The establishment of the Sabbath, the [[shmita|Sabbatical year]], and the year of jubilee was based on the number seven, as were the periods of purification and of mourning.
The number 7 is the Divine number of completion.

The number [[8 (number)|eight]] symbolizes new beginnings. According to [[Kaballah]] in the [[Zohar]] the number eight signifies this because the eighth day was the first day after creation when God returned to work; the week began again.

The number [[10 (number)|ten]] symbolized absolute completeness. The court to the Tabernacle was ten times ten ells long, and five times ten ells wide, and in the Holy of Holies the [[Ten Commandments]] were preserved.

The number [[12 (number)|twelve]], being the product of three and four, typified the union of the people with God.&lt;ref name="Maude-1862"&gt;[[#MAUDE 1862|Maude 1862]]: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8oMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;pg=PA509#v=onepage&amp;q=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;f=false 509]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:31-38|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|32:24-30|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the table were twelve loaves of show-bread, and the breastplate of the priest contained twelve precious stones as emblems of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]], which camped round about the Sanctuary.

The number [[13 (number)|thirteen]] symbolizes the principles of faith and God's mercy.

The number [[18 (number)|eighteen]] is considered significant because the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for "life" is חי (''[[Chai (symbol)|chai]]''), which has a [[gematria|numerical value]] of 18.

The number [[26 (number)|twenty six]] symbolizes God's name.

==Metals and minerals==
[[Gold]] was the symbol of the divine or celestial light, the glory of God.&lt;ref&gt;Zech. vi. 11; Dan. xi. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver]] was the emblem of moral innocence and of holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. i. 22; Jer. vi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brass]] symbolized hardness, strength, and firmness.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xxvi. 19; Jer. xv. 12; Job xl. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Brass was a substitute for gold, and iron for silver.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salt]] was declared to be necessary in every meal-offering, in which it takes the place of the blood in the animal sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. ii. 13; but comp. Ezek. xliii. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud salt symbolizes the [[Torah]], for as the world cannot exist without salt, so it can not endure without the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Soferim xv. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colors==

The Israelites used an [[indigo]]-colored dye called ''tekhelet''; this dye was likely made from snail ''[[murex trunculus]]''. This dye was very important in both Jewish and non-Jewish cultures of this time, and was used by royalty and the upper-class in dyeing their clothing, sheets, curtains, etc. This dye is known as [[Tyrian purple]].

In the Torah the Israelites are commanded to dye one of the threads of their [[tallit]] (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; when they look at this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) [[Blue in Judaism]] has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.

"Argaman" was the symbol of power, and of glory,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 6; Judges viii. 26&lt;/ref&gt; so that [[Alexander Balas]] robed Jonathan in purple,&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20&lt;/ref&gt; which was especially used to designate royal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20, xi. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tola'at" and "shani" ("[[scarlet (color)|scarlet]]," "[[crimson]]") symbolized blood, and thus frequently typified life, although this color often designated sin, as well as joy and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. xxxviii. 28; Josh. ii. 18, 21; Jer. iv. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Purification from sin was also symbolized by purple.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xvi. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shesh" ([[white]]) was the symbol of physical and intellectual purity, being the true color of light, without any modification.&lt;ref&gt;Cant. v. 10; Dan. iv. 10, 14, 20; Zech. xiv. 5&lt;/ref&gt; White also symbolizes death.  In some cases, it can also symbolize life.

Yellow has an association with an anti-Semitic forced identification mark (see [[Yellow badge]]).

==Festivals and holy days==
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|Jewish ritual objects shown on a gold goblet (2nd century CE) excavated in Rome]]
The Torah delineates three [[pilgrimage]] festivals, [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] (The Feasts of Weeks) and [[Sukkot]] (Tabernacles). Each of these was tied to the agricultural cycle of the Israelites, and was also given a theological symbolism.

[[Passover]] celebrated the rebirth of nature, and symbolized the origin of the Jewish people.

The eating of bitter herbs symbolized the miseries of the [[The Exodus#Bondage in Egypt|Egyptian bondage]]. In the evenings four cups of wine were drunk, to symbolize the four world-kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yerushalmi Pesachim 37c; Midrash Gen. Rabbah lxxx&lt;/ref&gt; People eating during the Passover meal reclined, in the style of free rich aristocrats, to represent their liberation from [[slavery]].

A discussion of the meaning of [[Shavuot]] (the Feast of Weeks) and of [[Sukkot]], the Feast of [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacles]], is found in the entries on those subjects.

A discussion of symbolism inherent in [[Rosh Hashanah]] (The New Year) and [[Yom Kippur]] (the Day of Atonement) is found in the entries on those subjects. The Day of Atonement was considered the most holy day of the entire year, and was regarded as the symbol of the complete atonement of the people and of their absolution from their sins committed against God.

==Symbolic visions of the Prophets==
[[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] beheld an [[almond]]-tree as a token of the speedy fulfillment of the word of God.

[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] saw a basket of summer fruit as a symbol of the approaching end of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Amos viii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahijah the Shilonite tore Jeroboam's mantle into twelve pieces, to typify the division of the kingdom of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and Zedekiah made horns of iron to encourage Ahab to engage in war with Ramoth-gilead.&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xxii. 11&lt;/ref&gt; King Joash, at the command of the prophet Elisha, shot arrows from the open window into the air, to symbolize the destruction of his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;II Kings xiii. 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah walked naked and barefoot to show how the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] would be treated when taken captive by the Assyrians,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. xx. 2&lt;/ref&gt; while Jeremiah wore a [[yoke]] upon his neck to induce the nations to submit to the King of Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;Jer. xxvii. 2-4, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezekiel]] was commanded to inscribe the names of certain tribes upon separate pieces of wood, to show that God would reunite those tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Ezek. xxxvii. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]

==On tombstones==
Some common themes appear on many Jewish tombstones. Two hands with outspread fingers indicated that the dead man was descended from priestly stock (''[[Kohen|Kohanim]]'') who blessed the people in this fashion, and a jug was carved on the tombstones of the [[Levite]]s as an emblem of those who washed the priest's hands before he pronounced the blessing.

Some gravestones show a tree with branches either outspread or broken off, symbolizing the death of a young man or an old man respectively; or they have a cluster of [[grape]]s as an emblem of Israel.

The [[Star of David]] (''Magen David'') occurs frequently.

Sometimes figures symbolized the name of the deceased, as the figure of a lion for Loeb, a wolf for Benjamin, and a rose for the name Bluma/Blume.

==Influence on Christian symbols==
The influence of Judaism upon [[Christian symbolism]] as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., is apparent both in painting and in sculpture, the most frequent motives being those that occur in the [[Mishnah]] as formulas for prayer on fast-days. The prayer beginning with the words "Mi she-'anah," which was included in the [[selihah]] at an early date, was adopted in the Christian ritual as the litany "Libera domine." This litany was figuratively used in a certain sequence as a symbol, for the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] was regarded as a symbol of the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]], since the early religions, and the act of sacrifice emblemized the death on the cross.

Abraham was represented as the symbol of the power of faith and Isaac as the sacrificed redeemer. The ascension of [[Elijah]] was believed to typify the [[ascension of Jesus Christ]], who was regarded by Christian symbolism as an analogue to Elijah, although this ascension was also taken as a type of the general [[resurrection]] from the dead. Job sitting among the ashes was the symbol of patience and of the power of resistance of the flesh; and [[Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael|Hananiah]], [[Meshach|Mishael]], and [[Abednego|Azariah]] in the fiery furnace typified steadfastness in persecution and faith in the aid of God. Christian [[sarcophagi]] contained artistic representations of the fall of man, [[Noah]] and the ark, scenes from the life of [[Moses]] in three variations, [[Joshua]], [[David]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].

==The land of Zion==
{{Main|Land of Israel}}

[[Zion]] is a Biblical term that refers to [[Jerusalem]], and is the source for the modern term [[Zionism]].

'''Kendell Geers''' is a [[South Africa]]n conceptual artist.

==Life==
Kendell Geers was born in Johannesburg into a white working-class Afrikaans family during the time of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Salon | Artist Talk | Manifesta 9: FIRED UP by Kendell Geers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGJDXFKIz0U&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becoming aware of the political struggles in his country, he ran away from home at the age of 15 to get involved in the anti-apartheid movement. 
Kendell finished his schooling at the end of 1984. At the beginning of 1985, to avoid conscription, he enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for a Fine Arts degree.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Siebrits,States of Emergency 1985-1990, "Irrespektiv." BOM / Actar, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1988, Kendell Geers was one of 143 young men who publicly refused to serve in the South African Defence Force and faced either a life in exile or six years' imprisonment in a civilian jail.&lt;ref&gt;Merret, C., Saunders, C., in Switzer L., Adhikari M., ''South Africa's Resistance'', Ohio University Press, 2000, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he left South Africa and lived for a brief period in exile in the United Kingdom and New York where he worked as an assistant to artist [[Richard Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Clive Kellner, Kendell Geers 1988-2012, Prestel, 2012, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was only after [[Nelson Mandela]] and other political prisoners' release from prison, that Geers could return from exile to Johannesburg without fear of being imprisoned. In 1990, he returned to [[Johannesburg]] where he worked as an artist, and art critic, curator and performance artist. The first work of art he created back on South African soil was "Bloody Hell", a ritual washing of his white [[Afrikaaner]] [[Boer]] body with his own fresh blood.&lt;ref name="Fin de Partie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sans|first=Jerome|title=Hang Grenades From My Heart|year=2012|publisher=Blue Kingfisher|isbn=9789881506474|pages=23–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rejecting everything his family and his community stood for, in 1993 he changed his name to Kendell Geers and his date of birth to May 1968 as a political act, reclaiming his identity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Bourriaud, ''Kendell Geers: A Proletarian Gnosis'', ''Kendell Geers 1988-2012'', Munich, Prestel, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Brussels in 2003.

==Work==
Sometimes described as a political artist, Kendell Geers is known best for using a variety of colors and materials that signal danger such as sirens, broken glass, and barbed wire in an attempt to examine power structures, social injustices, and establishment values. Geers has worked with different media ranging from objects to large scale installation, neon works, performances and video.
Geers also uses words as a means to explore the coding and reinterpretation of language and its meaning and to communicate with his audience.

===Early work===
His work had heavily political elements from 1988 to 2000, during which time Geers, explored the moral and ethical contradictions of the apartheid system through his practice.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; He developed a visual vocabulary characterized by provocation as well as humor by using found objects such as barbed wire or glass shards. By appropriating historical events and ideas, he focused on questions of relationship between individual and society. It was in this context that Geers changed his date of birth to May 1968, the start of the student and civil revolution, and joined every political party in the period before South Africa’s first democratic elections, from the extreme right-wing to the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition traces the shift and the development of Kendell Geers' aesthetic language|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=59989#.US94rjdhAqA|work=Art Daily|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, he expressed his doubts about the fetishization of party politics.

He participated in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1993, the first time since the anti-[[Apartheid]] boycotts that South African artists had been invited.

From 1999 until 2004, Geers worked as the curator and art consult for [[Gencor]] which was later bought out by [[BHP Billiton]]. The collection focused on artists and works of art that were central to the [[apartheid|Anti-Apartheid Movement]] spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Williamson, South African Art in the Nineties: Part I, II &amp; III, [http://www.artthrob.co.za/00jan/news.html Artthrob]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Geers edited and published ''Contemporary South African Art,'' with essays by [[Okwui Enwezor]], [[Olu Oguibe]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary South African Art'', Jonathan Ball Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|978-1-86842-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiated by his move to Brussels in 2000, his later European period is characterized by a more poetic aesthetic.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; Here, Geers transferred his incendiary practice into a post-colonial and increasingly global context, suggesting more universal themes like terrorism, spirituality, and mortality. As such, the artist’s life and work can be said to constitute a living archive composed of political events, photographs, letters, and literary texts that serve as a source of inspiration and represent a continuation of his oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=haus der kunst|url=http://www.hausderkunst.de/index.php?id=132&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 a Geers retrospective called "1988-2012" opened at the [[Haus der Kunst]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=welt&gt;{{cite news|last=Reitter-Welter|first=Barbara|title=Hinweis warnt vor Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article113480460/Hinweis-warnt-vor-Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung.html|newspaper=Die Welt|date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The exhibition divided his life and work into two decade-long periods, the first political phase until 2000, and the later more poetic phase.

===Manifesto===
In 2011 Geers wrote a Manifesto in which through a series of statements, he explores the link between political and natural revolutions, mourns the loss of our talent for revolution and the underlying causes, and gives us clues on how to remember our inner selves to live a more true life.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Arts: A Journal of South-North Cultural and Media Studies 27(6), An Van Dienderen &amp; Kris Rutten, 2013, p. 655-660.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side projects==
Together with musician Patrick Codenys ([[Front 242]]) Kendell Geers formed the Belgium Audio-Visual group "[[thefucKINGFUCKS]]" in 2007. The project grew out of the now defunct "[[Red Snyper]]" collaboration between Geers and Codenys.

==Exhibitions==
He has exhibited globally since 1993 and participated in numerous exhibitions including [[Documenta]], the [[Carnegie International]], Havana Biennial, Istanbul Biennial, Kwang Ju Biennial, Taipei Biennial, [[Gwangju Biennale]], Lyon Biennial, [[Glasstress]] at the Venice Biennale, as well as presented solo exhibitions in the CCA Cincinnati, [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst]] Gent, [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltic Museum Presents Kendell Geers|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/10544/Baltic-Museum-Presents-Kendell-Geers/?month=&amp;year=|work=Design Taxi|accessdate=28 February 2013|date=3 Aug 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspen Art Museum, MOCA in Rome, Migros Museum, Palais de Tokyo, the CAC in Lyon and Haus der Kunst in Munich.

With over 140 years of history, the '''Lausanne Opera''' continues to respond to the public’s growing demand for lyrical performances. Once known as a municipal theater, it has transformed into a world renowned opera house that produces and co-produces their own productions. With a stage renovation in 2012, the Lausanne Opera offers a wide variety of operas, from baroque to contemporary, along with concerts and ballets. Thanks to its bold programming and emphasis on quality vocals and stage production, the Lausanne Opera welcomes over 45'000 spectators a year and continues to make itself known internationally. 

==History==
The opening ceremony took place on 10 May 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opera-lausanne.ch/fr/lopera/un-peu-dhistoire.html |title=Opéra de Lausanne - Un peu d'histoire |publisher=Opera-lausanne.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant''''' is an oil painting created in 1905 by the French artist [[Robert Antoine Pinchon]] (1886–1943). Associated with the new generation of [[Rouen School|l'École de Rouen]]&lt;ref name="François Lespinasse"&gt;François Lespinasse, ''Robert Antoine Pinchon'', Association Les amis de l'École de Rouen, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marelibri"&gt;[http://www.marelibri.com/t/main/3304776-vlaminckMauriceDe/books/AUTHOR_AZ/0/en Edition du Groupe des XXX (trente), Paris, Rouen, December 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After James H. Rubin, ''L'Impressionnisme'', 2008 [1999], {{ISBN|978-0-7148-9081-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinchon executed this work in a [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] style with a subdued [[Fauvism|Fauve]] or [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] palette of golden yellows and incandescent blues. The dynamic image of the train in Pinchon's painting is an homage to the emerging industrialized world.

The work was exhibited in April 1905 at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen (see photograph), and again at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]]; inauguration 13 November 1909. In the collection of [[:fr:François Depeaux|François Depeaux]] at the time, ''Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant'' was purchased by the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]] in 1909 where it currently forms part of the permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&amp;FIELD_1=DOMN&amp;VALUE_1=&amp;FIELD_2=Ctyob&amp;VALUE_2=&amp;FIELD_3=AUTR&amp;VALUE_3=%27PINCHON%20ROBERT%20ANTOINE%27&amp;FIELD_4=Clieu&amp;VALUE_4=&amp;FIELD_5=REPR&amp;VALUE_5=&amp;FIELD_6=Cdate&amp;VALUE_6=&amp;FIELD_7=DECV&amp;VALUE_7=&amp;FIELD_8=LOCA&amp;VALUE_8=&amp;FIELD_9=Mat%E9riaux%2ftechniques&amp;VALUE_9=&amp;FIELD_10=Titre&amp;VALUE_10=&amp;NUMBER=4&amp;GRP=0&amp;REQ=%28%28%27PINCHON%20ROBERT%20ANTOINE%27%29%20%3aAUTR%20%29&amp;USRNAME=nobody&amp;USRPWD=4%24%2534P&amp;SPEC=5&amp;SYN=1&amp;IMLY=&amp;MAX1=1&amp;MAX2=1&amp;MAX3=100&amp;DOM=All Joconde, Portail des collections des musée de France]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Robert Antoine Pinchon, Galerie Legrip, Rouen, April 1905.jpg|thumb|250px|Robert Antoine Pinchon (left), Galerie Legrip, Rouen, April 1905. At this 27 April – 13 May show, Pinchon, at the age of 19, exhibited 24 paintings, one of which is ''Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant'' (top center). The two persons on the right are unidentified, though one may be art collector [[:fr:François Depeaux|François Depeaux]].&lt;ref name="François Lespinasse" /&gt;]]

''Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant'' is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 54 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm (21.25 by 28.75 in), signed ''R Pinchon'' lower left. The composition painted [[en plein air|en plein air (sur le motif, in the open air)]], is dominated by the Pont aux Anglais, [[Rouen]], with receding perspective tending towards the right side of the canvas. A locomotive and train cars pass over the bridge leaving a trail of steam in the direction of the receding perspective, carrying the eye towards the right, where below, a boat passes carrying two people a short distance from Le Pont aux Anglais. The rhythmic arches of the bridge and the speeding train create a sense of dynamism and modernity not often found in Post-Impressionist works. The colors Pinchon has chosen to depict this late afternoon scene are both warm and cool. The golden yellow highlights generated by the setting sun, off the canvas to the left, are juxtaposed against the grays, blues, violets and greens of the background hillside, the bridge and its massive base pillars, the poplar trees and the River [[Seine]] in the foreground.

==Le Pont aux Anglais==
The first railway station of Rouen was built on the left bank in 1843. The government authorized the continuation of the line to Le Havre and Dieppe the same year. It was therefore decided to build a bridge to the end of the Brouilly island (now connected to the Lacroix island), leading to the tunnel under the Côte Sainte-Catherine. The bridge, located in the Rouen metropolitan area, linking Paris and Le Havre, was named the ''English Bridge'' because many workers who built it were of English nationality. It is also called the Viaduc d'Eauplet, after the neighborhood where it is located.&lt;ref name="Jacques Tanguy"&gt;[http://www.rouen-histoire.com/Ponts/Pont_Anglais.htm Pont aux Anglais (1), Jacques Tanguy, December, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge originally consisted of wooden arches resting on piles of masonry. It was located a little further downstream than the existing bridge. It was inaugurated in 1847. A few months after its inauguration, in 1848, two arches on the side of the left bank were set on fire during a riot. It was then rebuilt. In 1856 the wooden arches were replaced by cast iron. This is the bridge that Pinchon painted. These arches proved fragile and it was decided to build a new bridge in 1912. Despite its destruction during the Second World War, the bridge completed and operational in 1914 is still used today.&lt;ref name="Jacques Tanguy" /&gt;

==1909==
Robert Antoine Pinchon's first [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibition]] in Paris took place on 15&amp;ndash;25 March 1909 at the Galerie des Artistes Modernes run by Chaine and Simonson, with thirty works listed in the catalogue. The show resulted in both sales and press coverage. This was followed by another show at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen on 30 June. A few months later, on 13 November, the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]], opened a show with fifty-two paintings: three by [[Claude Monet]], nine by [[Alfred Sisley]], three by [[Armand Guillaumin]], one by [[Auguste Renoir]], thirteen by [[Albert Lebourg]], five by [[Joseph Delattre]], two by [[Charles Frechon]] and four by Robert Antoine Pinchon (now almost twenty-three years old); ''Péniches dans la brume, Vue pris du Mont-Garan, Effet de neige'', and ''Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant''.&lt;ref name="François Lespinasse" /&gt;

In 1909 Pinchon, [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]], [[Pierre Hodé]] and [[Eugène Tirvert]] founded the [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]], attracting the participation of [[Georges Braque]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]].&lt;ref name="latelierdutemps"&gt;[http://latelierdutemps.com/artenseine/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=63 L'Atelier du temps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061244/http://latelierdutemps.com/artenseine/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=63 |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, four paintings by Pinchon entered the collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.&lt;ref name="Rouen, Musée des Beaux-Arts"&gt;[http://www.musees-haute-normandie.fr/IMG/pdf/dossierpedagoexprouenimpressionnisme2010.pdf Une ville pour l’impressionnisme, Monet, Pissarro et Gauguin à Rouen, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen, 2010] {{fr icon}} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letras y figuras''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]], "letters and figures"), is a [[Genre art|genre]] of [[painting]] pioneered by [[José Honorato Lozano]] during the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonial period in the Philippines]]. The art form is distinguished by the depiction of letters of the [[alphabet]] using a genre of painting that contoured shapes of human figures, animals, plants, and other objects called [[Tipos del Pais]] popularized by [[Damián Domingo]]. The letters depicted spell out a phrase or a name, usually that of the [[Patronage|patron]] who commissioned the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Blanco | first =John D. | title =Frontier Constitutions: Christianity and Colonial Empire in the Nineteenth-Century Philippines | publisher =[[University of California]] | year =2009 | isbn =978-0-520-25519-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings were done with [[watercolor]] on [[Manila paper]]. The earliest example of this art form dates from 1845; the latest existing specimens were completed during the latter portion of the American period in the 1930s during the administration of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=ecapz&gt;{{cite web | title =Letras Y Figuras Uniquely Filipino Art Genre | url=https://knoji.com/letras-y-figuras-uniquely-filipino-art-genre | accessdate = 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, an album of José Honorato Lozano's paintings were auctioned at [[Christie’s]] at the starting bid of [[Pound sterling|£]]300,000.&lt;ref name=ecapz/&gt;

==Examples==
*The BALVINO MAURICIO was completed by José Honorato Lozano in November 1864 for its namesake, Balvino Mauricio, a [[Binondo]] merchant who was later implicated in the [[1872 Cavite mutiny]]. Measuring 93 [[centimeters|cm]] x 113&amp;nbsp;cm, this painting depicts a [[Manila]] house of that time. This  house is believed to be the same house described by [[José Rizal]] in the opening chapter of the [[Noli me tangere (novel)|''Noli Me Tángere'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ocampo | first =Ambeth R. | title =A peek into Kapitan Tiago’s house | publisher =[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = 2 April 2014 | url =http://opinion.inquirer.net/73191/a-peek-into-kapitan-tiagos-house | accessdate = 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The IMELDA ROMUALDEZ MARCOS, of unknown provenance.

Because of the large number of categories, such as "Best Art", "Best Writing", "Best Gag Comic" and "Best Newcomer", only the winners of the main category "Best Comic" are listed here.

===Eisner Award===

{{Main|List_of_Eisner_Award_winners#Best_Digital_Comic/Webcomic}}

The Will Eisner Comic Industry Award, commonly shortened to the Eisner Award, is a prize given for creative achievement in American comic books. In 2003, Justine Shaw's ''[[Nowhere Girl]]'' received a nomination for an Eisner award in the "best new series" category, while Shaw was nominated for "talent deserving of wider recognition", making her the first webcomic artist to be nominated for an Eisner.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Matthew (April 18, 2003). "DC leads in nominations; Norman artist in race for award". ''[[The Daily Oklahoman]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;21D.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' noted in 2016 that the Eisner's conflation of "[[digital comic]]" and "webcomic" may cause independent works to be overshadowed by online services such as [[Marvel Unlimited]] and [[DC Comics]]' "Digital First".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/05/why-the-eisners-need-to-show-webcomics-some-love.html|work=[[Paste Magazine]]|title=Why The Eisners Need to Show Webcomics Some Love|last=Rosberg|first=Caitlin|date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was split into "Best Digital Comic" and "Best Webcomic".

===Harvey Awards===

{{Main|List of Harvey Award winners#Best Online Comics Work}}

The Harvey Awards, named for writer-artist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] (1924-1993) and coordinated by the publisher [[Fantagraphics]], are given for achievement in comic books. The Harveys were created as part of a successor to the [[Kirby Awards]] which were discontinued after 1987.

Following the revamp in 2018 after the awards moved to [[New York Comic Con]], the "Best Online Comics Work" has been renamed "Digital Book of the Year".&lt;ref name="comicsbeat"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McDonald |first1=Heidi |title=Details of the 2018 Harvey Awards announced and it’s a big change |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/details-of-the-2018-harvey-awards-announced-and-its-a-big-change/ |website=The Beat |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignatz Awards===

{{Main|Ignatz Award#Outstanding Online Comic}}

The Ignatz Awards are intended to recognize outstanding achievements in comics and cartooning by small press creators or creator-owned projects published by larger publishers. They have been awarded each year since 1997, but skipped a year in 2001 due to the show's cancellation after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Recipients of the award are determined by the votes of the attendees of the annual [[Small Press Expo]].

{{Coord|50|20|50|N|4|15|40|E||display=title}}
'''Lobbes Abbey''' was a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery in [[Lobbes]] in [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[Belgium]]. The abbey played an important role in the religious, political and religious life of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]], especially around the year 1000.  In addition to its founder St [[Landelin]], 4 other saints are said "of Lobbes".&lt;ref&gt;http://catholicsaints.info/lobbes-abbey/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Foundation===
[[File:Lobbes JPG001.jpg|thumb|right|Lobbes. St Ursmarus church (11th century)|230px]]
[[File:Lobbes, abbaye avant 1794 (gravure).jpg|thumb|right|The abbey in the 18th century with St Ursmarus church on the hill|230px]]
[[File:Lobbes - La Portelette - JPG1.jpg|thumb|right|Former abbey buildings (17th century)|230px]]
The early history of Lobbes Abbey is known in relative detail because fortunately, and unlike with most abbeys, the ancient [[annals]] survived.&lt;ref&gt;the ''Annales Laubicenses'', printed in [[G. H. Pertz]], ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores''&lt;/ref&gt; The monastery was founded  by Saint Landelin around 650. Landelin was a young man from a well-to-do family in [[Bapaume]], who lived a sinful life as the head of a band of brigands. After repenting, he founded a monastery at the place where he had committed his sins, at the shores of the river [[Sambre]]. The number of monks at the new monastery increased rapidly and the founder grew tired of his duties as an abbot, so in 680 he resigned from his post and dedicated the rest of his life to the worship of God.

===Early fame===
Landelin was succeeded by [[Ursmar]] (Saint Ursmarus) who devoted himself to preaching [[Christianity]] among the largely pagan [[Franks]]. The fame of Saint Ursmarus and his successors [[Ermin of Lobbes]], [[Abel of Reims]] and [[Theodulph of Lobbes]], made Lobbes the most important monastery in Belgium of the time. Under [[Anson of Lobbes|Anson]], the 6th abbot (776-800), the abbey school rose to great fame. 

In 864 [[Hucbert]], brother-in-law of [[Lothair II of Lotharingia]], became lay abbot. Through his decadent lifestyle he almost brought the monastery to destitution. His successor, Franco, was both abbot of Lobbes and [[List of bishops and prince-bishops of Liège|bishop of Liège]], a situation that continued until 960. The abbey basically became a fief of the Bishop of Liège, although ecclesiastically it was situated in the [[bishopric of Cambrai]]. 

In 954 the abbey was raided and burned during the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]].

Under the abbots Folcuin (965-990), [[Heriger of Lobbes]] (990-1007) and Hugo (1033–1053), the abbey and the school once again attained a great reputation.

===Decline===
After this period the fame of the abbey gradually declined, until the monastic revival originating from the [[Bursfelde Congregation]] brought fresh life in the 15th century. In 1569 Lobbes, [[St. Vaast's Abbey]] in [[Arras]], and several other abbeys, were combined to form the ''Benedictine Congregation of Exempt Monasteries of Flanders''.

===Dissolution===
In 1794, the last abbot, Vulgise de Vignron, and 43 monks were expelled from the monastery by [[French Revolution|French revolutionary]] troops. Under the law of 2 September 1796 the abbey was dissolved. Most of the monastic buildings, including the abbey church of Saint Peter, were destroyed. The former burial church of Saint Ursmarus survived as a parish church. A few other minor buildings were later incorporated into a railway station.

==Art historical significance==
The church of Saint Ursmarus is one of the oldest churches in Belgium. The oldest parts date from [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] or [[Ottonian]] times. The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[crypt]] are [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and stand out by their simplicity. The crypt contains the tombs of Saint Ursmarus and Saint Erminus, as well as tombstones from other abbots. The [[westwork]] tower is a typical example of [[Mosan art|Mosan architecture]]. The pointed spire was added in the 19th century.

From 1865 until 1870 the church was restored by the architect Eugène Carpentier, who basically rebuilt large sections of the church and removed all traces of earlier situations.

Today the Abbey library stored a copy of "Lobbes Bible" completed in 1084 AD and a digitized copy is available on line at IRHT (see [http://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr/mirador/index.php?manifest=http://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr/iiif/20145/manifest Lobbes Bible]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">In the fields of [[bibliography]] and [[bookselling]], '''prize books''' (also known as '''prize bindings'''), are a category of finely bound books once given as prizes and awards in educational institutions primarily in [[England]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=John |date= September 1989|title=Reviewed Work: Gold-Tooled Bookbindings Commissioned by Trinity College, Dublin in the Eighteenth Century. (Studies in the History of Irish Bookbinding: 1) by Joseph McDonnell and Patrick Healy |url= |journal= The Burlington Magazine  |volume=131  |issue=1038  |pages=656–657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition flourished in Latin schools in continental [[Europe]] from the mid-17th century until the introduction of publishers bindings after about 1830. Books continued to be given as prizes at academic ceremonies, but the only distinguishing feature are typically special inscriptions and/or [[bookplates]].

==History in UK==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the tradition of special prize bindings persisted until the mid-20th century with the demise of traditional hand binding. Most titles consist of classical works in the [[humanities]] published in unbound print runs for this purpose. Schools would contract with a local [[bindery]] to prepare prize editions stamped or [[Paper embossing|embossed]] with the logo of the school. The editions are often made to resemble the fine bindings of the 18th century and are prized by booksellers for their classical appearance. They are often mistaken as ex-school library books but can be distinguished by a prize inscription, lack of [[call number]], and general higher quality of the binding.

[[File:Mikhail bakhtin.jpg|thumb|[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], author of ''Rabelais and His World'', pictured in 1920]]
'''''Rabelais and His World''''' (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, ''Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja i Renessansa''; 1965) is a scholarly work which is considered one of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s most important texts and now a classic of [[Renaissance]] studies. In the work Bakhtin explores ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' by the French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin argues that for centuries Rabelais’s book has been misunderstood. Bakhtin attempts to redress this and clarify Rabelais's intentions through two methods: recovery of sections of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' that were previously either ignored or suppressed, and analysis of the [[Renaissance]] social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and ''[[grotesque body|grotesque realism]],'' which is defined as a literary mode.  

Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 297-299&lt;/ref&gt; As written, ''Rabelais and His World'' not only examines the openness of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', it also serves as an example of such openness.

==History of the text==
Bakhtin completed his book on Rabelais (titled ''Rabelais in the History of Realism'') in 1940. After several attempts to get the book published fell through, it was submitted as a dissertation for the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree at the [[Gorky Institute of World Literature]] in Moscow. At the dissertation's defense in 1946, all three official opponents were in favor of awarding Bakhtin a [[Higher doctorate|higher doctoral degree]]: the [[Doctor of Sciences]], and their motion was accepted with a narrow majority vote. However, following an assault on the institute published in the press at the time, and after six years of repeated revisions and deliberations, USSR's [[Higher Attestation Commission|VAK]] decided Bakhtin would only receive the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree&lt;ref&gt;See commentary to vol. 4 of Bakhtin's Collected Writings (''Sobranie sochinenii'', Moscow: Russkie Slovari, 2008–2010)&lt;/ref&gt; (roughly equivalent to a [[research doctorate]]). The book was eventually published in Russian in 1965, under the title ''Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance''. Its 1968 English translation by Hélène Iswolsky was given the title, ''Rabelais and His World''.

==Carnival==
{{Main article|Carnivalesque}}
For Bakhtin, ''carnival'' is associated with the collectivity. Those attending a carnival do not merely constitute a crowd; rather the people are seen as a
whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist 302"&gt;Clark and Holquist 302&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, “[A]ll were considered equal during carnival.  Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age”.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 10&lt;/ref&gt; The carnival atmosphere holds the lower strata of life most important, as opposed to higher functions (thought, speech, soul) which were usually held dear in the signifying order. At carnival time, the unique sense of time and space causes individuals to feel they are a part of the collectivity, at which point they cease to be themselves.  It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed.  At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one’s sensual, material, bodily unity and community.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist 302"/&gt;

==Grotesque==

{{Main article|Grotesque body}}

Bakhtin’s notion of ''carnival'' is connected with that of the ''grotesque''. In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; emphasis is placed on the body in its open dimension, in its connection to the life of the community. This emphasis on the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for the consciousness of the historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.&lt;br&gt;
In the grotesque body, emphasis is placed on the open, the penetrative, and the "lower stratum." The open (the mouth, the anus, the vagina, etc.) and the penetrative (the nose, the penis, etc.) allow exchange between the body and the world (mostly through sex, eating, and drinking), but also to produce degrading material (curses, urine, feces, etc.). The lower stratum (belly, womb, etc.) is the place where renewal happens, where new life is forged, thus connecting degradation to renewal. The grotesque body is one of excess, rebellious to authority and austerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail|title=Rabelais and His World|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=9780253348302|pages=303–436}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Due to its inscription in time and its emphasis on bodily changes (through [[eating]], [[Defecation|evacuation]], and [[sex]]), the ''grotesque'' has been interpreted by some critics as a dimension of the body that permits to perceive the historicity of man: it is in this reading used as a measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of laughter==
Bakhtin opens this work with a quotation from [[Alexander Herzen]]: "It would be extremely interesting to write the history of laughter".&lt;ref&gt;chap.1, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary expressions of the [[ancient world]]'s conceptions of laughter is the text that survives in the form of apocryphal letters of  [[Hippocrates]] about [[Democritus]] ([[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''Epistles'' 10–21).&lt;ref name="p.66-67"&gt;p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; The laughter of Democritus had a philosophical character, being directed at the life of man and at all the vain fears and hopes related to the gods and to life after death. Democritus here made of his laughter a complete conception of the world, a certain spiritual premise of the man who has attained maturity and has awakened. Hippocrates finally perfectly agreed with him.&lt;ref name="p.66-67"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5841">The '''research-based design''' process is a research process proposed by Teemu Leinonen inspired by design theories.&lt;ref&gt;Ehn, P. &amp; Kyng, M. (1987). "The Collective Resource Approach to Systems Design". In G. Bjerknes, P. Ehn &amp; M. Kyng (Eds.), ''Computers and Democracy: A Scandinavian Challenge'' (pp. 17–57).Avebury.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schön, D.A. (1987). ''Educating the Reflective Practitioner. Toward a New Design for Teaching and Learning in the Professions''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, H. &amp; Stolterman, E. (2003). The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World: Foundations and Fundamentals of Design Competence. New Jersey: Educational Technology Publications&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly oriented towards the building of [[prototype]]s and it emphasizes creative solutions, exploration of various ideas and design concepts, continuous testing and redesign of the design solutions. This method is also influenced by the [[Participatory design#History in Scandinavia|Scandinavian participatory design]] approach. Therefore, most of the activities take place in a close [[dialogue]] with the community that is expected to use the tools designed.

==Phases==
The process can be divided into four major phases, although they all happen concurrently and side-by-side. At different times of the research, researchers are asked to put more effort into different phases. The continuous iteration, however, asks researchers to keep all the phases alive all the time: contextual inquiry, participatory design, product design, prototype as hypothesis.

===Contextual inquiry===
{{See also|Contextual inquiry}}
Contextual inquiry refers to the exploration of the socio-cultural context of the design. The aim is to understand the environment, situation, and culture where the design takes place. The results of the contextual inquiry are better understanding of the context by recognizing in it possible challenges and design opportunities. In this phase, design researchers use [[Ethnography|rapid ethnographic]] methods, such as [[Participant observation|participatory observation]], note-taking, sketching, informal conversations, and interviews. At the same time as the field work, the design researchers are doing a focused review of the literature, benchmarking existing solutions, and analyzing trends in the area in order to develop insights into the design challenges.

===Participatory design===
{{See also|Participatory design}}
Throughout the contextual inquiry design researchers start to develop some preliminary design ideas, which would be validated during the next stage—participatory design—in workshops with different stakeholders. The participatory design sessions tend to take place with small groups of 4 to 6 participants. A common practice is to present the results as [[User scenario|scenarios]] made by the design researchers containing challenges and design opportunities. In the workshop, the participants are invited to come up with design solutions to the challenges and to bring to the discussion new challenges and solutions.

Since one of the main features of the research-based design is its participatory nature, the user's involvement is an integral part of the process. In this regard, participatory design workshops are organized during the different stages in order to validate initial ideas and discuss the prototypes at different stage of development.

===Product design===
{{See also|Product design}}
The results of the participatory design are analyzed in a [[design studio]] by the design researchers who use the feedback to redefine the design problems and redesign the prototypes. By keeping a distance from the stakeholders, in the product design phase the design researchers will get a chance to analyze the results of the participatory design, categorize them, use specific design language related to implementation of the prototypes, and finally make design decisions.

===Prototype as hypothesis===
Ultimately, the prototypes are developed to be functional on a level that they can be tested with real people in their everyday situations. The prototypes are still considered to be a hypothesis, prototypes as hypothesis, because they are expected to be part of the solutions for the challenges defined and redefined during the research. It remains to the stakeholders to decide whether they support the assertions made by the design researchers.

Research-based design is not to be confused with design-based research.&lt;ref&gt;Barab, S.A. &amp; Squire, K. (2004). Design-Based Research: Putting a Stake in the Ground. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 13(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Design-Based Research Collective. (2003). Design-based research: An emerging paradigm for educational inquiry. Educational Researcher, 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fallman, D. (2007). Why Research-Oriented Design Isn’t Design-Oriented Research: On the Tensions Between Design and Research in an Implicit Design Discipline. Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20(3), 193-200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leinonen, T., Toikkanen, T. &amp; Silfvast, K. (2008). Software as Hypothesis: Research-Based Design Methodology. In the Proceedings of Participatory Design Conference 2008. Presented at the Participatory Design Conference, PDC 2008, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; In research-based design, which builds on art and design tradition, the focus is on the artifacts, the end-results of the design. The way the artifacts are, the affordances and features they have or do not have, form an important part of the research argumentation. As such, research-based design as a methodological approach includes research, design, and design interventions that are all intertwined.

'''''Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind''''' ({{lang-fr|Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain}}) is a work by the [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]] [[Marquis de Condorcet]], written in 1794 while in hiding during the [[French Revolution]] and published posthumously.

==Description==
Condorcet's ''Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit'' (1795) was perhaps the most influential formulation of the idea of progress ever written. It made the Idea of Progress a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom, material affluence, and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions: that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities, showing that humanity's "present state, and those through which it has passed, are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind"; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences "no less certain, no less secure from political revolutions"; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/0011526041504506#.V-zkbUx9670&lt;/ref&gt;

Condorcet's writings were a key contribution to the French Enlightenment, particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others, knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding through 10 epochs (stages). None of Condorcet's writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for any man to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The enlightenment of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly utopian society. However, he stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race, religion, culture or gender.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, David (2004). Condorcet and Modernity. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-84139-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a quote from the 1795 English edition of his book: {{Quotation|Contempt for human sciences was one of the first features of Christianity. It had to avenge itself of the outrages of philosophy; it feared that spirit of investigation and doubt, that confidence of man in his own reason, the pest alike of all religious creeds. The fight of the natural sciences was even odious to it, and was regarded with a suspicious eye, as being a dangerous enemy to the success of miracles: and there is no religion that does not oblige its sectaries to swallow some physical absurdities.

The triumph of Christianity was thus the signal of the entire decline both of the sciences and of philosophy.
Had the art of printing been known, the sciences would have been able to preserve their ground; but the existing manuscripts of any particular book were few in number; and to procure works that might form the entire body of a science, required cares, and often journies (sic) and an expence (sic) to which the rich only were competent. It was easy for the ruling party to suppress the appearance of books which shocked its prejudices, or unmasked its impostures.

It usually appears above the [[heraldic crest|crest]] on a [[coat of arms]], though sometimes it appears as a secondary motto beneath the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]].&lt;ref name="WoodcockRobinson-p112"/&gt; The word ''[[slogan]]'' dates from 1513, though it is a variant of the earlier ''slogorn'', which was an [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''sluagh-ghairm''.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster-p1174"/&gt;

==Mottoes and heraldry==

The word ''slogan'' dates from 1513. It is a variant of the earlier ''slogorn'', which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic ''sluagh-ghairm'' (''sluagh'' "army", "host" + ''gairm'' "cry").&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster-p1174"&gt;Merriam-Webster (2003), p. 1174.&lt;/ref&gt; Slogans are used in [[heraldry]], most notably in Scottish heraldry. In Scottish heraldry slogans are used as mottoes, or secondary mottoes. Slogans usually appear above the crest on a coat of arms, though sometimes they appear as a secondary motto beneath the shield. There may be several possible origins for mottoes used in heraldry, however slogans are considered{{By whom|date=May 2009}} to have originated from [[battle cry|battle cries or war cries]]. There are several notable heraldic mottoes which are thought to originate from a war cries. For example, the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] contains the motto ''[[DIEU ET MON DROIT]]'' ("God and my right") which has been thought to originated as a war cry. As has the motto ''MONTJOYE SAINT-DENIS'' which appeared on the former French coat of arms (this motto is refers to the ''[[oriflamme]]'', the [[royal standard]] of the [[kings of France]], which was kept in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]]). Several mottoes found in Irish heraldry, which end in ''a boo'', are also thought to have originated as war cries. Examples of such [[Irish language|Irish]] mottoes are ''[[Crom a Boo|CROM A BOO]]'' of the Fitzgerald [[Earl of Leinster|earls of Leinster]]; and ''SHANET A BOO'' of the Fitzgerald [[earls of Desmond]].&lt;ref name="WoodcockRobinson-p112"&gt;Woodcock; Robinson (1988), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox-DaviesJohnston-p449–450"&gt;Fox-Davies; Johnston (2007), p. 449–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all slogans are actually authentic war cries though. Many slogans pertaining to [[Scottish clan chief]]s have been registered relatively recently at the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]]. Sometimes slogans are merely a name, such as ''A HOME A HOME A HOME'' of the [[Clan Home|Homes]], others refer to a rallying point for the clan, like ''CRUACHAN'' of the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]], some slogans refer to a prominent clansman like the [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] ''Fear eile airson Eachuinn'' ("Another for Hector"). In at least one case, a [[patron saint]] is used as a slogan, as in ''St Bennet and Set On'' of the [[Clan Seton|Setons]].&lt;ref name="WoodcockRobinson-p112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Innes-p60–61"&gt;Innes of Learney (1971), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of Grant use two slogans (or mottoes): ''CRAIG ELACHAIDH'' (which appears above the crest), and ''STANDFAST'' (which appears beneath on a scroll beneath the shield).&lt;ref name="WoodcockRobinson-p112"/&gt; Sometimes a [[Scottish clan chief|clan chief's]] slogan appears on his [[crest badge]] and in consequence on the crest badges worn by his clan members. In some cases the chief's slogan also appears on his [[heraldic standard|standard]], [[Guidon (heraldry)|guidon]] and [[Heraldic flag|pinsel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/375.html |title=Further Guidance on Flags |accessdate=2008-07-30 |work=The Court of the Lord Lyon (lyon-court.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9876">{{About|the ordinance in Seattle|the album named after the ordinance by ''[[A (band)|A]]''|Teen Dance Ordinance (album)}}
The '''Teen Dance Ordinance''' was a controversial [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] law which severely curtailed the ability of concert and club promoters to hold events for underaged patrons. During its existence from 1985 to 2002, it was routinely criticized for its severity (often labeled "[[wikt:draconian|draconian]]") and its effects on the local music scene and industry. After several unsuccessful attempts to repeal it through lobbying and later court action, it was finally repealed and replaced with the All-ages Dance Ordinance.

==History==
From 1977 to 1985, teen dances were unregulated in Seattle. Activities at underage clubs were attracting the attention of the public and a club called The Monastery was particularly notorious for allegations of [[sexual abuse]], [[child prostitution]], and drug and alcohol use. The Monastery was run by George Freeman and was ostensibly a non-profit church of the [[Universal Life Church]], whose dance events were "religious services". During daytime hours it was a youth center that attracted runaways and homeless youth. The Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO) was conceived and passed the [[Seattle City Council|City Council]] on July 29, 1985 to stop abuses at underage clubs. It was amended in 1988. Key among its provisions were:

* Age limits: Underage dances (allowing those under 18 to attend) may only admit patrons age 15-20 unsupervised. Anyone younger would require a parent or guardian [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]] and anyone older would need to be accompanying a youth under 18.
* Security requirement: Two off-duty police officers were required on premises, with one off-duty officer outside to patrol the area.
* [[Insurance]]: $1,000,000 in liability insurance was required;
* Exemptions: Non-profits and schools were exempt from these restrictions.&lt;ref name=Licata&gt;Licata, Nick. [http://www.ci.Seattle.wa.us/council/licata/up92.htm Urban Politics #92.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101021222/http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/council/licata/up92.htm |date=2006-01-01 }} Seattle City Council, Office of Councilman Nick Licata. September 9, 2000. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

With these requirements, teen dances outside of schools were virtually banned in the city, as no [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] would undertake the costs involved. For a city the size of Seattle, shows that would only allow 15- to 20-year-olds could not draw a large enough crowd for the event to break even. In addition to the $1 million insurance bond, hiring off-duty officers was a huge expense. The non-profit exemption meant the ordinance did not apply to the Monastery; it was closed using pre-existing [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] abatement laws. In the 15 years of the ordinance, almost no one applied for a promoter's license for youth events, and no one has been prosecuted with it.&lt;ref name=Licata /&gt;

While the ordinance only regulated "dances," the distinction between a concert and a dance was not outlined by law, and the police were accused of defining a dance so liberally that the dancing done in the audience of a concert was enough to qualify the entire event as a "dance." All-ages concerts were thus subject to being shut down by police who were vigilant in making sure promoters did not skirt the law. As a result, some nationally touring acts refused to do shows in Seattle because they insisted on all-ages audiences. With Seattle becoming an epicenter for [[alternative rock]] and the [[grunge]] scene in the early 90's, teens had to go to neighboring cities to attend concerts and dances.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Jennifer. [https://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/1999/03/vogel.html Guilty Feet.] ''Mother Jones''. March 1999. Retrieved June 20, 2006,&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the TDO said that the ordinance ensured the safety of underage patrons and discouraged gatherings where youth consumed drugs and alcohol. They also invoked the memory of the Monastery, where they said adults preyed upon vulnerable kids susceptible to offers of drugs or quick cash. Excluding adults from underage youth would, in their eyes, create a "bubble of safety."&lt;ref&gt;Paynter, Susan. [http://www.seattlepi.com/paynter/payn078.shtml Repeal teen dance law? Let's sit this one out]. ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer.'' August 7, 2000. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeal of the ordinance was a key goal of [[JAMPAC]], a musicians' and promoters' [[political action committee]] founded by [[Krist Novoselic]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Since its founding in 1995, the group lobbied the City Council to repeal the TDO.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Deborah.

The ordinance was a focal point for a vocal young activist community in Seattle, notably those consolidated as The All Ages Music Organization, and later by the Music and Youth Task Force, which allowed for youth and public officials to meet regularly to find resolution to conflicting points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Howland Jr., George. [http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0220/nc-howland.php A time to dance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427134646/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0220/nc-howland.php |date=2006-04-27 }}. ''The Seattle Weekly.''  May 15, 2002. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ordinance proposed to replace the TDO was passed by the City Council in 2000, however it was quickly vetoed by Mayor [[Paul Schell]]. The veto caused JAMPAC to launch a suit against the City of Seattle, claiming that the TDO's virtual outlawing of dance infringed on the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free expression. A judge however ruled for the City on JAMPAC's suit in May 2002, claiming there was no infringement on the First Amendment and that the matter is a political one for the Council to decide, not the courts. Nevertheless, during the course of the suit, Schell was voted out of office (in the aftermath of the disastrous [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO meetings of 1999]]) and the new mayor [[Greg Nickels]], a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Council. The new All-ages Dance Ordinance, written by members of the Music and Youth Task Force, was passed on August 12, 2002, replacing the TDO.

==All-Ages Dance Ordinance==

The new provisions of the All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) eased on restrictions to accommodate new youth events. They include:
* a definition of a ''dance'' as an event where dancing is the primary activity intended
* allowing all-ages events to occur absent any alcohol served
* requiring only the requesting of off-duty officers at an event, to be granted by the Seattle Police Guild
* elimination of the $1 million insurance requirement&lt;ref name=Howland&gt;Howland Jr., George. [http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0233/news-howland3.php Slow Dance.] ''The Seattle Weekly.''  August 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rules, while more liberal than before, still disappointed many activists who pushed for the TDO's repeal. They viewed the new ordinance as only moderate changes to the rules and not liberal enough to actually encourage all ages shows.&lt;ref name=Howland /&gt; Proponents of the TDO also criticize the new AADO, saying the new all-ages events are now ignored by the police, and that the new law is confusing and ignored by unlicensed promoters. [[Rave]]s have also been points of criticism; they have now been classified as ''concerts'' and are outside the scope of the ordinance while frequent use of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] by attendees have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Sharon Pian.

Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, in the aftermath of the [[Capitol Hill massacre]] where a gunman shot several partygoers after a rave, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' editorialized against the new dance rules and called for the city's all-ages dance rules to be "thoroughly re-examined and re-tooled."&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/2002892098_shooted27.html Soul-searching after Capitol Hill tragedy], ''Seattle Times'' editorial, March 26, 2006. Accessed June 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Local community leaders{{who|date=January 2015}} however have so-far ignored such pleas, noting that the incident was the work of a deranged gunman whose intent to kill could not be stopped with new city laws.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

"'''The Heresy of Paraphrase'''" is the title of a chapter in ''[[The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry|The Well-Wrought Urn]]'', a seminal work of the [[New Criticism]] by [[Cleanth Brooks]].  Brooks argued that meaning in poetry is irreducible, because "a true poem is a simulacrum of reality...an experience rather than any mere statement about experience or any mere abstraction from experience."  Brooks emphasized structure, tension, balance, and irony over meaning, statement, and subject matter.  He relied on comparisons with non-verbal arts in order to shift discussion away from summarizable content:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The essential structure of a poem (as distinguished from the rational or logical structure of the 'statement' which we abstract from it) resembles that of architecture or painting: it is a pattern of resolved stresses.  Or, to move closer still to poetry by considering the temporal arts, the structure of a poem resembles that of a ballet or musical composition. It is a pattern of resolutions and balances and harmonizations, developed through a temporal scheme.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Helene Paris David.jpg|thumb|right|"Pretty enough to start a war" will not do for [[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus#Quotations|Marlowe's mighty line]].  (Helen and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1788)]]
Proper criticism responds with suppleness and delicacy to such patterns, rather than paraphrasing their propositional content.

Central to "The Heresy of Paraphrase" was a vigorous critique of conventional distinctions between form and content:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The structure meant is certainly not 'form' in the conventional sense in which we think of form as a kind of envelope which 'contains' the 'content.' The structure obviously is everywhere conditioned by the nature of the material which goes into the poem.  The nature of the material sets the problem to be solved, and the solution is the ordering of the material...The relationship between the intellectual and the non-intellectual elements in a poem is actually far more intimate than the conventional accounts would represent it to be: the relationship is not that of an idea 'wrapped in emotion' or a 'prose-sense decorated by sensuous imagery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though Brooks applied this theory to his reading of poetry from many periods, subsequent literary scholars have suggested that the doctrine was shaped by the [[aesthetics]] of [[modernist literature]].  They point out that the New Criticism emerged at the peak of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s influence as both poet and critic.  [[Archibald Macleish]]'s "[[Ars Poetica (MacLeish)|Ars Poetica]]" (written eleven years before ''[[The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry|The Well Wrought Urn]]'') is often cited as prefiguring Brooks' doctrine:&lt;blockquote&gt;
A poem should be palpable and mute&lt;br /&gt;
As a globed fruit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Dumb&lt;br /&gt;
As old medallions to the thumb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Silent as the sleeve-worn stone&lt;br /&gt;
Of casement ledges where the moss has grown –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should be wordless&lt;br /&gt;
As the flight of birds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should be motionless in time&lt;br /&gt;
As the moon climbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Leaving, as the moon releases&lt;br /&gt;
Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,&lt;br /&gt;
Memory by memory the mind –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should be motionless in time&lt;br /&gt;
As the moon climbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should be equal to:&lt;br /&gt;
Not true&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For all the history of grief&lt;br /&gt;
An empty doorway and a maple leaf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For love&lt;br /&gt;
The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should not mean&lt;br /&gt;
But be.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Though many of the aesthetic assumptions of the New Criticism are now challenged or dismissed, the "heresy of paraphrase" is still commonly used to refer to reductive or utilitarian approaches to poetry.

{{Golden Dawn}}

'''The Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn''' ('''OSOGD''') is an esoteric community of magical practitioners, many of whom come from [[Paganism|pagan]] backgrounds. It is an initiatory teaching Order that draws upon the knowledge, experience, practices and spirit of the system of magical training and attainment developed by the original [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].

==History==
The OSOGD was founded by [[Sam Webster (writer)|Sam Webster]] in 2002 and based on the principles of the [[open-source software]] movement.&lt;ref name="wicker05"&gt;Wicker (2005), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization grew out of a series of workshops on ceremonial magic held by Webster in 2001.&lt;ref name="Kean09"&gt;Kean (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sam Webster,
{{quote|
The Open Source Order is founded on the principle that true spirituality is omnipresent and access to it cannot be owned or controlled by any group or individual. Sufficiently skilled practitioners can and do modify the practices to serve specific purposes or to take advantage of the century-plus development in the craft to improve their effect.&lt;ref name="gasperson"&gt;Gasperson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to ''The Manifesto of the Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn'',&lt;ref name="osogd02"&gt;OSOGD (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; the Order has undertaken to revise the teachings of the original [[Victorian era]] Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn system to work more effectively in the 21st century. This redaction of the original rituals has taken on the aspect of a number of principles, listed in the Manifesto as [[Open Source]] Magick, New Aeon, Freedom of Information, [[Thelema]], Duty, [[Universalism]], and Form and Function.&lt;ref name="osogd02"&gt;OSOGD (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In temple work, the OSOGD uses [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Enochian]] and [[Thelema|Thelemic]] godforms in preference to the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Archangel]]s typical of the original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. According to the Manifesto, OSOGD teaches "a progressively tiered system of spiritual development designed to invoke the [[Holy Guardian Angel|Higher or Divine Genius]] latent in every human being."&lt;ref name="osogd02"&gt;OSOGD (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
[[Image:OSOGDseal.jpg|frame|left|The Seal of the OSOGD]]
To actually join the Order, a person must have regular access to its Lodge, which is located in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The Order does not conduct distance initiations, and requires that all initiates attend initiation rituals in person.&lt;ref name="osogd02"&gt;OSOGD (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
The Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn draws heavily from Eastern sources, [[Thelema]], [[Paganism]], and the works of [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref name="osogd02"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28947">A '''{{lang|non|vǫlva}}''' or '''{{lang|is|völva}}''' ([[Old Norse]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], respectively; plural forms {{lang|non|vǫlur}} and {{lang|is|völvur}}, sometimes anglicized '''vala'''; also '''{{lang|non|spákona}}''' or '''{{lang|non|spækona}}''') is a female [[shamanism|shaman]] and [[Prophet|seer]] in [[Norse religion]] and a recurring motif in [[Norse mythology]].
[[File:Ed0048.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|The seeress speaks her prophecy in this illustration to a 19th-century Swedish translation of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''.]]

==Names and etymology==
{{wiktionary|vǫlva}}
The {{lang|non|vǫlur}} were referred to by many names. Old Norse {{lang|non|vǫlva}} means "wand carrier" or "carrier of a magic staff",&lt;ref&gt;Mercatante &amp; Dow 2004, II:893.&lt;/ref&gt; and it continues [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*walwōn}}, which is derived from a word for "wand" (Old Norse {{lang|non|vǫlr}}).&lt;ref name="hell"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym/1169.html Hellquist 1922:1081]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vala'', on the other hand, is a literary form based on {{lang|non|vǫlva}}.&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt;

Another name for the {{lang|non|vǫlva}} is {{lang|non|fjǫlkunnig}} (plenty of knowing) indicating she knew {{lang|non|[[seiðr]]}}, {{lang|non|[[prophecy|spá]]}} and {{lang|non|[[galdr]]}}. A practitioner of {{lang|non|seiðr}} is known as a {{lang|non|seiðkona}} "{{lang|non|seiðr}}-woman" or a {{lang|non|seiðmaðr}} "{{lang|non|seiðr}}-man".

A {{lang|non|spákona}} or {{lang|non|spækona}} "{{lang|non|spá}}-woman"&lt;ref&gt;The Tale of Norna-Gest&lt;/ref&gt; (with an [[Old English]] cognate, {{lang|ang|spæwīfe}})&lt;ref&gt;Hellquist 1922:851&lt;/ref&gt; is a specialised {{lang|non|vǫlva}}; a "seer, one who sees", from the Old Norse word {{lang|non|spá}} or {{lang|non|spæ}} referring to [[prophecy|prophesying]] and which is cognate with the present English word "spy", continuing Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*spah-}} and the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''{{PIE|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/speḱ-|(s)peḱ]]}}'' (to see, to observe) and consequently related to Latin {{wikt-lang|la|speciō}} ("I see") and [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa-Latn|spaśyati}} and {{lang|sa-Latn|paśyati}} ({{wikt-lang|sa|पश्यति}}, "to see").&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0939.html Hellquist 1922:851]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Odin og Völven by Frølich.jpg|thumb|"Odin and the ''Völva''" (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
Vǫlur practiced seiðr, spá and galdr, practices which encompassed [[shamanism]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[prophet|prophecy]] and other forms of indigenous magic associated with women. Seiðr in particular had connotations of ''[[ergi]]'' (unmanliness), a serious offense in Norse society.

Historical and mythological depictions of vǫlur show that they were held in high esteem and believed to possess such powers that even the father of the gods, [[Odin]] himself, consulted a vǫlva to learn what the future had in store for the gods. Such an account is preserved in the ''[[Völuspá]]'', which roughly translates to "Prophecy of the Vǫlva". In addition to the unnamed seeress (possibly identical with [[Heiðr]]) in the ''Vǫluspá'', other examples of vǫlur in Norse literature include [[Gróa]] in ''[[Svipdagsmál]]'', Þórbjǫrgr in the ''[[Saga of Erik the Red]]'' and [[Huld]] in ''[[Ynglinga saga]]''.

The vǫlur were not considered to be harmless.&lt;ref name="Harrison55"/&gt; The goddess who was most skilled in magic was [[Freyja]], and she was not only a goddess of love, but also a warlike divinity who caused screams of anguish, blood and death, and what Freyja performed in [[Asgard]], the world of the gods, the vǫlur tried to perform in [[Midgard]], the world of men.&lt;ref name="Harrison55"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:55&lt;/ref&gt; The weapon of the vǫlva was not the spear, the axe or the sword, but instead they were held to influence battles with different means, and one of them was the wand,&lt;ref name="Harrison55"/&gt; (see the section [[#Wands and weaving|wands and weaving, below]]).

==Early accounts==
{{Disputed-section|"Early accounts"|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Cimbrians and Teutons invasions.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The migrations of the Teutons and the [[Cimbri]].&lt;br /&gt;{{Battle red}} Cimbri and Teutons defeats.&lt;br /&gt;{{Battle blue}} Cimbri and Teutons victories.]]
The earliest descriptions of Germanic prophetesses appear in Roman accounts about the [[Cimbri]], whose priestesses were aged women dressed in white. They sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood in order to prophesy coming events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] in [[Geographica (Strabo)|Geographica]] 7.2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' (1, 50) [[Julius Caesar]] writes in the course of clashes with Germanic tribesmen under [[Ariovistus]] (58 BCE):
{{quote|When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore Ariovistus did not come to an engagement, he discovered this to be the reason{{spaced ndash}}that among the Germans it was the custom for their ''matrons'' to pronounce from lots and divination whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or not; that they had said, "that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans should conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new moon.}}

[[Tacitus]] also writes about prophetesses among the [[Germanic peoples]] in his [[Histories (Tacitus)|''Histories'']] 4, 61 - notably a certain [[Veleda]]: "by ancient usage the Germans attributed to many of their women prophetic powers and, as the superstition grew in strength, even actual divinity."

[[Jordanes]] relates in his ''[[Getica]]'' (XXIV:121) of [[Goths|Gothic]] [[wikt:haliurunna|''haliurunnas'']], witches who were driven into exile by King [[Filimer]] when the Goths had settled in [[Oium]] ([[Ukraine]]). The name is possibly a corruption of a [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''Halju-runnos'', meaning "hell-runners" or "runners to the realm of the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Scardigli, Piergiuseppe, ''Die Goten: Sprache und Kultur'' (München 1973) pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; These witches were condemned to seek refuge far away and, according to this account, engendered the [[Huns]].

The [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Paul the Deacon]], who died in [[Southern Italy]] in the 790s, wrote on how his people once had departed from southern Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:69&lt;/ref&gt; He tells of a conflict between the early Lombards and the Vandals. The latter turned to one Godan (presumably Odin), while Gambara, the mother of the two Lombard chieftains Ibor and Aio, turned to Godan's spouse Frea (presumably [[Frijjō|Freyja/Frigg]]). Frea helped Gambara play a trick on Odin and thanks to the Gambara's good relations with the goddess, her people won the battle.&lt;ref name="Harrison74"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:74&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed eyewitness account of a [[human sacrifice]] by what may have been a vǫlva was given by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] as part of his account of a [[diplomatic mission]] to [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 921. In [[Norse funeral#Ibn Fadlan's account|his description of the funeral]] of a [[Germanic kingship|Scandinavian chieftain]], a slave girl [[volunteering|volunteers]] to die with her [[slavery|master]]. After ten days of festivities, she is stabbed to death by an old woman (a sort of priestess who is referred to as "Angel of Death") and burnt together with the deceased in his boat (see [[Oseberg Ship]]).

[[File:Freya (1901) by Anders Zorn.jpg|thumb|right|Freya, "Freja" [alt.] (1901) by [[Anders Zorn]] ]]

==Viking society==
In Norse society, a vǫlva was an elderly woman who had released herself from the strong family bonds that normally surrounded women in [[Norse clans]]. She travelled the land, usually followed by a retinue of young people, and she was summoned in times of crisis. She had immense authority and she charged well for her services.&lt;ref name="meulen81"&gt;Steinsland, G. &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen, P. 1998:81&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many aristocratic Viking women wanted to serve [[Freyja]] and represent her in [[Midgard]]. They married Viking warlords who had [[Odin]] as a role model, and they settled in great halls that were earthly representations of [[Valhalla]].&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt; In these halls there were magnificent feasts with ritualized meals, and the visiting chieftains can be likened with the [[einherjar]], the fallen warriors who fought bravely and were served drinks by [[Valkyrie]]s. However, the duties of the mistresses were not limited to serving mead to visiting guests, but they were also expected to take part in warfare by manipulating weaving tools magically when their spouses were out in battle. Scholars no longer believe that these women waited passively at home, and there is evidence for their magic activities both in archaeological finds and in Old Norse sources, such as the ''[[Darraðarljóð]]''.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt;

It is difficult to draw a line between the aristocratic lady and the wandering vǫlva, but Old Norse sources present the vǫlva as more professional and she went from estate to estate selling her spiritual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/religion-magic-death-and-rituals/viking-seeresses/|title=Viking seeresses - National Museum of Denmark|work=National Museum of Denmark|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vǫlva had greater authority than the aristocratic lady, but both were ultimately dependent on the benevolence of the warlord that they served.{{inconsistent}} When they had been attached to a warlord, their authority depended on their personal competence and credibility.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt;

===Saga sources===
[[File:Faroe stamp 428 The Prophet.jpg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|A depiction of a vǫlva on a [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] stamp by [[Anker Eli Petersen]] (2003).]]
In ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'', toward the end of ''[[Norna-Gests þáttr]]'', Norna-Gest states that "spákonur traveled around the country-side and fore-told the fates of men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/nornages.htm The Tale of Norna-Gest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Landnámabók]], a Volva named ''Þuríðr Sundafyllir'' gained the epithet of "filler of inlets" during a famine in Iceland, when she used her magic powers to fill the fjords with fish.

''The [[Saga of Eric the Red]]'' relates that the settlers in [[Greenland]] c. 1000 were suffering a time of starvation. In order to prepare for the future, the ''vǫlva Þórbjǫrgr lítilvǫlva'' ("the little vǫlva") was summoned. Before her arrival the whole household was thoroughly cleaned and prepared. The high seat, which was otherwise reserved for the master and his wife, was furnished with down pillows.

The vǫlva appeared in the evening, dressed in a foot-length blue or black [[cloak]] decked with gems to the hem. In her hand she wielded a wand, the symbolic [[distaff]] (''seiðstafr''), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In the saga of [[Örvar-Oddr]], the seiðkona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (a wand which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant than the fact that it was intended to signify the otherness of the seiðkona.

The ''Saga of Eric the Red'' further relates that around her neck she wore a necklace of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of [[amadou]] from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the seiðr. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.

As the vǫlva entered the room, she was hailed with reverence by the household, and then she was led to the high seat, where she was provided with dishes prepared only for her. She had a [[porridge]] made of goat milk and a dish made of hearts from all the kinds of animals at the homestead. She ate the dishes with a brass spoon and a knife whose point was broken off.

The vǫlva was to sleep at the farm during the night and the next day was reserved for her dance. In order to dance the seiðr, she needed special tools. First, she positioned herself on a special elevated platform and a group of young women sat down around her. The girls sang special songs intended to summon the powers that the vǫlva wished to communicate with. The session was a success because the vǫlva was permitted to see far into the future and the famine was averted.

In the prologue of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', related by a vǫlva,&lt;ref&gt;Mercatante &amp; Dow 2004, II:893&lt;/ref&gt; the origin of [[Thor]]'s wife [[Sif]] is detailed, where she is said to be a ''spákona''. Snorri contextually correlates [[Sif]] with the oracular seeress [[Sibyl]] on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heimskringla.no/original/snorre/prologus.php The prologue of Heimskringla]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18947/18947-h/18947-h.htm#foreword The prologue of Heimskringla in translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological record===
[[File:Finds from a priestess' grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Finds from a vǫlva's grave in [[Köpingsvik]], [[Öland]]. There is an 82 cm long [[wand]] of iron with bronze details and a unique model of a house on the top. There is also a pitcher from Persia or Central Asia, and a West European bronze bowl. Dressed in a bear pelt, she had received a [[ship burial]] with both human and animal sacrifice. The finds are on display in the [[Swedish History Museum]] in [[Stockholm]].]]
Scandinavian archaeologists have discovered wands in about 40 female graves, and they have usually been discovered in rich graves with valuable [[Norse funeral#Grave goods|grave offerings]] which shows that the vǫlvas belonged to the highest level of society.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:56&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is a grave in [[Fyrkat]], Denmark which turned out to be the richest grave in the area.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; She had been [[Chariot burial|buried in a wagon]] from which the wheels had been removed.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; She had been plainly clad in what was probably only a long dress.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; Around her toes, she had toe rings, which suggests that she was buried without shoes or only in sandals so that the rings showed.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; At her head, she had a [[Gotland]]ic buckle which may have been used as a box, and she also owned objects from Finland and Russia.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; At her feet, she had a box which contained her magic tools, comprising a [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellet]] from an owl as well as small bones from birds and mammals, and in a pouch she had the seeds of [[Hyoscyamus niger]] ("henbane").&lt;ref name="Harrison57"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:57&lt;/ref&gt; If such seeds are thrown into a fire, they produce a hallucinogenic smoke which causes a sense of flying.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; In the grave there was also a small silver amulet that represented a chair made from a stump.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; When such small silver chairs are discovered in graves, they always belong to a woman, and it is possible that they represented objects such as the platform where the vǫlva performed her rituals and [[Hlidskjalf]] from which [[Odin]] watched across the world.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt;
[[File:Freyja in silver.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|The pendant, in the [[Swedish History Museum]] in [[Stockholm]].]]
Another notable grave was the [[Oseberg Ship]] in Norway that revealed two women who had received a sumptuous burial.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; One of the women was most likely a high-ranking lady who knew how to practice [[seiðr]] as she had been buried with a wand of wood.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; In the grave, there were also four [[cannabis]] seeds, which probably had been in the pillows that supported the corpses.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; Additional cannabis seeds were discovered in a small leather pouch.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt;

Around the ninth century, a vǫlva was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in [[Östergötland]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="Harrison58"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:58&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher.&lt;ref name="Harrison58"/&gt; There was also a silver pendant which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck.&lt;ref name="Harrison58"/&gt; This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as [[Freyja]]'s necklace, [[Brísingamen]]. The pendant may represent Freyja herself, the most prominent vǫlva of them all.&lt;ref name="Harrison58"/&gt;

In [[Birka]], a vǫlva and a warrior were once buried together. Above them, a spear was positioned in order to dedicate the dead couple to [[Odin]].&lt;ref name="Harrison62"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:62&lt;/ref&gt; They had probably served Freyja and Odin, two deities of war, and he had done so with his spear and she with her wand.&lt;ref name="Harrison62"/&gt;

===Wands and weaving===
{{main|Wand|Weaving (mythology)}}
In theory, invisible fetters and bonds could be controlled from a loom, and if a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:72&lt;/ref&gt; But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt; The men may have fought on the battle field in sweat and blood, but in a spiritual way, their women took part.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt; It is not by coincidence that archaeologists find weaving tools and weapons side by side.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt;

A distaff possessed magical powers, and in the world of the gods, the [[Norns]] twined the threads of fate.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt; In ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', norns arrive at the birth of [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] and twined his fate as a hero, and it is possible that these Norns were not divine beings but vǫlur.&lt;ref name="Harrison73"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:73&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the wands that have been excavated have a basket-like shape in the top, and they are very similar to distaffs used for spinning linen.&lt;ref name="Harrison73"/&gt; One theory for the origin of the word seiðr is "thread spun with a distaff", and according to this theory, practicing magic was to send out spiritual threads.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt; Since the Norsemen believed that the Norns controlled people's fate by spinning, it is very likely that they considered individual fates to be controllable with the same method.&lt;ref name="Harrison73"/&gt;

It is not a coincidence that women are called "[[peace-weaver]]s" in ''[[Beowulf]]'', and since [[Freyja]] had started the first war, it was on the part of the vǫlva to decide when to start wars by practicing magic.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt; This is probably why [[Harald Bluetooth]], who was at war with the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] apparently kept a vǫlva at Fyrkat.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt;

[[The Wife's Lament]] could be a poem about a peace-weaver.

===Sexual rites and drugs===
[[File:Freyr statue Rällinge crop.jpg|thumb|The [[phallus|ithyphallic]] [[Freyr#Rällinge statuette|Rällinge statuette]], interpreted as a Viking Age depiction of [[Freyr]].]]
Today, it is generally accepted among scholars that fertility was essential in Viking society, and the most famous find that testifies to such rites is a small phallic statuette that was found in Rällinge in Sweden in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:75&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of this statuette indicates that it was related to fertility rites and it is usually interpreted as Freyja's brother [[Freyr]].&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; [[Adam of Bremen]] tells of the phallic statue of Freyr in the [[Temple at Uppsala]] and of the ribald songs that were sung during the rituals.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; In ''[[Völsa þáttr]]'', there is an account on how a [[Stallion#Reproductive anatomy|horse's penis]] was worshipped by a pagan family, an account that has connections with an old Indo-Aryan sacrificial rite.&lt;ref name="Harrison75-78"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:75-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Some wands that have been excavated cannot be associated with distaffs, but instead appear to represent a [[phallus]], and moreover the use of magic had close associations with sexuality in Old Norse society.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; In the ''[[Lokasenna]]'', due to his interest in [[seiðr]], [[Loki]] is depicted accusing [[Odin]] of being ''[[ergi]]'', which suggests that he could be perceived as unmanly, cowardly and accepting the 'female' role in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; As early as 1902, an anonymous German scholar (he did not dare publish in his own name) wrote on how seiðr was connected with sex.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; He argued that the wand was an obvious phallic symbol and why magic should otherwise be considered taboo for men.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; It was possible that the magic practices included sexual rites.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; As early as 1920, it was noted that the name of the male magic practitioner Ragnvald Rettilbein referred to such practices, as ''rettilbein'' means "straight member".&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt;

The vǫlur were known for their art of seduction, which was one of the reasons why they were considered dangerous.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:79&lt;/ref&gt; One of the stanzas in ''[[Hávamál]]'' warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt; Freyja, who is the mistress of seiðr, has a free sexual life that gives her a bad reputation in certain myths.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt;

One of the methods for seducing men may have been the use of drugs.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt; In [[Fyrkat]], the grave of a vǫlva revealed the use of [[Hyoscyamus niger|henbane]], a drug which not only produces hallucinations but can also be a powerful [[aphrodisiac]].&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt; If Freyja was the goddess of love in [[Asgard]], the vǫlva was her counterpart in [[Midgard]].&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt;

===Other practices===
The vǫlur could also employ drums during their sessions as in [[Sami shamanism]].&lt;ref name="meulen82"&gt;Steinsland, G. &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen, P. 1998:82&lt;/ref&gt; All vǫlur were not surrounded by the same retinue and preparations as Þórbjǫrgr, but she could also perform the seiðr alone, which was called ''útiseta'' (literally, "sitting out").&lt;ref&gt;Blain 2001:61ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keyser 1854:275&lt;/ref&gt; This practice appears to have involved [[meditation]] or [[introspection]], possibly for the purpose of [[divination]]. Blain (2001) sees it as an aspect of seiðr reminiscent of [[shamanism]]. The term is derived from a 13th-century [[Law of Iceland]], which outlawed ''útiseta at vekja trǫll upp ok fremja heiðni'' "sitting out to wake up [[troll]]s and practicing heathenry". Although the theoretical legal punishment for this offense was death, nobody was convicted under it until a minor [[witch craze]] reached Iceland in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Blain 2001:62&lt;/ref&gt; Keyser (1854) describes it as "a peculiar kind of sorcery [...] in which the magician sat out at night under the open sky [...] especially to inquire into the future".

===Male practitioners===
{{main|ergi}}
[[File:Sejdmen.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|During the Christianization of Norway, King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] had seiðmenn tied up and thrown on a [[skerry]] at ebb.]]
During the Christianization of Norway, King Olaf Trygvasson had seidmen tied up and thrown on a skerry at ebb. Men who practiced sorcery or magic were not received with the same respect but killed like animals and tortured to death because they were dealing with a practice that was held to be in the domain of women.&lt;ref name="meulen81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison65"/&gt; This offense was considered ''[[ergi]]'', "unmanliness, sexually perverse". The ''Heimskringla'' relates that Ragnvaldr Rettilbein, one of [[Harald Fairhair]]'s sons by the [[Sami people|Sami woman]] Snæfrid was a seiðmaðr.&lt;ref name="meulen81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison65"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:65&lt;/ref&gt; The king had him burnt to death inside a house with a large group of fellow male practitioners.&lt;ref name="meulen81"/&gt;

In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', [[Loki]] taunts [[Odin]] for having practiced magic on [[Samsø]], something which was considered ''ergi''.&lt;ref name="Harrison65"/&gt;

==Disappearance==
Increasing conversions to Christianity began to displace the Norse religion, leading to the disappearance of the vǫlur;  aided by [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and civil laws enacted against them, as in this Anglo-Saxon [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]:

{{quotation|If any ''wicca'' (witch), ''wiglaer'' ([[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]]), [[false swearer]], ''[[morthwyrtha]]'' (worshipper of the dead) or any foul contaminated, manifest ''[[horcwenan]]'' ([[whore]]), be anywhere in the land, man shall drive them out.

We teach that every priest shall extinguish [[Pagan religions#Heathen|heathendom]] and forbid [[wilweorthunga]] ([[fountain worship]]), ''[[licwiglunga]]'' (incantations of the dead), ''[[hwata]]'' ([[omen]]s), ''[[galdra]]'' ([[magic and religion|magic]]), [[man worship]] and the abominations that men exercise in various sorts of [[witchcraft]], and in ''[[frithspottum]]'' ([[peace-enclosures]]) with elms and other trees, and with stones, and with many phantoms.|16th [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] enacted under [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] in the 10th century}}

They were persecuted and killed in the course of [[Christianization]], which also led to an extreme polarization of the role of females in Germanic society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Resurgence of the traditions of the vǫlur are apparent in Europe and the United States within Heathen reconstructionism and the Christian community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==In fiction==
The term Spaewife was used as the title for several fictional works: [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s poem "The Spaewife"; [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]]'s historical romance ''The Spaewife: A Tale of the Scottish Chronicles''; and [[John Boyce]]'s ''The Spaewife, or, The Queen's Secret'' (under the pen-name Paul Peppergrass).

===Melville===
Francis Melville describes a spae-wife as a type of [[elf]] in ''The Book of Faeries''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;No taller than a human finger, fairy spae wives are usually dressed in the clothes of a peasant. However, when properly summoned, the attire changes from common to magnificent: blue cloak with a gem-lined collar and black lambskin hood lined with catskin, calfskin boots, and catskin gloves. Like human spae wives, they can also predict the future, through [[runes]], tea leaves and signs generated by natural phenomena, and are good healers. They are said to be descended from the erectors of the [[standing stones]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
