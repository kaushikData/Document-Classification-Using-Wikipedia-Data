The '''2009 flu pandemic in Oceania''', part of an [[epidemic]] in 2009 of a new strain of [[influenza A virus subtype H1N1]] causing what has been commonly called [[swine influenza|swine flu]], has (as of 27 June 2009) afflicted at over 22,000 [[human|people]] in [[Oceania]], with 56 confirmed [[deaths]].  Almost all of the cases in Oceania have been in [[Australia]], where the majority of cases have resulted from internal community spread of the virus.  In addition, the government of [[New Zealand]], where most of the remainder of cases in Oceania have occurred, is on high alert for any people travelling into the country with flu-like symptoms.

New Zealand has had a well-developed Influenza Pandemic action plan since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/nz-influenza-pandemic-action-plan-2006 |title=New Zealand Influenza Pandemic Action Plan - 2006 |publisher=New Zealand Ministry of Health |date=September 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428171812/http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/nz-influenza-pandemic-action-plan-2006 |archivedate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this plan New Zealand immediately upgraded its influenza pandemic alert status to code yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzdoctor.co.nz/news?article=0977f2fa-2d51-45f6-b8dc-82b5fcabcf03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429231157/http://www.nzdoctor.co.nz/news?article=0977f2fa-2d51-45f6-b8dc-82b5fcabcf03 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-04-29 |title=Daily News |publisher=New Zealand Doctor Online |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2009-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national stockpile of 1.4 million doses of oseltamivir was released to regional health authorities. The initial response as specified in the Pandemic Action Plan is a policy of border control and cluster control via voluntary quarantine and treatment of contacts with oseltamivir. As of May 24, this policy appears to have been successful in preventing the Mexican Flu from spreading within New Zealand.

New Zealand had about 48,000 influenza cases in the 2008 flu season – 42% of which were type A – and approximately 100 deaths a year directly attributed to influenza viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10569496 |title=Big jump in suspected swine flu cases |work=National |publisher=New Zealand Herald |location=Auckland |first=Jacqueline |last=Smith |author2=Associated Press |date= 2009-04-29 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''99Rise''' is a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[social movement organization]] founded in 2012, that aims to "reclaim our democracy from the domination of big money."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.99rise.org/about|title=About 99Rise|newspaper=99Rise|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to their website, 99rise's 10 principles are: nonviolence, strategic unity, common message, [[Decentralization|decentralized]] structure, democratic cooperation, inclusion, [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], leadership as service, voluntarism, and open affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.99rise.org/our_principles|title=Our Principles|newspaper=99Rise|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structure wise, 99rise is a decentralized organization with distributed leadership stretching across the United States. 99Rise puts activists and organizers through 2-day detailed DNA trainings, Online Basic Trainings, and monthly Online Orientations in order to equip each member with the tools needed to continue to spread their organization's message.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.99rise.org/who|title=Who Are We?|newspaper=99Rise|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the formation of the movement, 99rise members have garnered media attention by protesting during [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] hearings and by interrupting [[Donald Trump]] at the 2016 GOP debate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/04/06/99rise-protesters-charged-with-class-a-misdemeanor-in-federal-court/|title=99Rise protesters charged with Class A misdemeanor in federal court|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4150974/republican-debate-donald-trump-heckler/|title=Watch Donald Trump Get Heckled by an Anti-Big-Money Protester|last=Alter|first=Charlotte|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategy ==
99Rise plans on achieving their goal to reclaim democracy from the domination of big money through a five phase approach:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/04/02/reader-poll-whats-the-proper-punishment-for-99rise-protesters/|title=Reader poll: What’s the proper punishment for 99Rise protesters?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.99rise.org/strategy|title=How do we win?|newspaper=99Rise|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (Before April 2016) Build the movement. 99Rise prepared each activist through encompassing trainings, team building exercises, and leadership meetings.
# (April 2016 - September 2016) Participate in forms of civil disobedience to get the attention of political leadership during the 2016 election. For example, 99Rise disrupted the Supreme Court on April 1, 2015 and Donald Trump at the GOP debate.
# (September 2016 - December 2016) Mobilize members to get out and elect representatives and a president who will be their champion for the causes they are fighting for.
# (January 2017- December 2017) Hold Congress, the President, and state legislatures accountable when it comes to meeting their demands to reclaim democracy. If the governing bodies do not meet their demands for constitutional and legislative reform, then participate in forms of civil disobedience and/or mass noncooperation.
# (January 2017 - November 2018) Monitor and enforce the reform agenda until it is enacted. Further escalation of civil disobedience if necessary.

== Leadership ==
Kai Newkirk is the co-founder and most visible member of 99Rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/130178-who-was-donald-trumps-heckler-at-the-gop-debate-kai-newkirk-disrupts-for-an-important-reason|title=Who Was Donald Trump's Heckler At The GOP Debate? Kai Newkirk Disrupts For An Important Reason|last=Yang|first=Melissah|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Newkirk understands the difficulties of 99rise's mission, he stresses that there are important smaller victories that can be achieved to restore some integrity back into the political process. Newkirk wants to push for the adoption of disclosure laws to address the problem of dark money and wants to create a democracy voucher system which would give a tax credit to voters to let every voter direct $50 or $100 to a candidate of their choosing. He believes that these two victories would be a step in the right direction towards achieving their ultimate goal of reclaiming democracy from the power of big money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=101534597&amp;S=R&amp;D=f5h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4zOX0OLCmr06ep7RSsqu4TK6WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGnsEq0qbVIuePfgeyx43zx|title=Is there a pathway to ending corporate rule in America?|last=Engler|first=Mark|date=April 2015|work=Issue 481, p33, 1p|access-date=November 15, 2016|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They chose this day to disrupt the court because they were condemning the ruling in the Citizens United case which happened five years ago from this day. In a report following the incident, 99Rise members also noted that a Princeton study concluded the average American had "near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page, "Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens". Princeton University. Retrieved 2016-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt; They rationalized that there disturbance of the court was one way they could make an impact, or draw attention towards public policy that they find unjust. Immediately following the disruption, the activists were escorted out of the courtroom and were charged with making a harangue or oration.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellew|first=Chelsea Elizabeth|date=2015-12-04|title=Combating Corruption in Campaign Finance in the United States: Why a Grass Roots Approach Is the Only Solution|ssrn=2699349|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals charged were Andrew Batcher, Irandira Gonzales, Margaret Johnson, Alexandra Flores-Quilty, Katherine Philipson, Curt Ries, and Mary Zeiser. The 8th member in the courtroom, Ryan Clayton, allegedly used a concealed camera to film the incident.

==== April 1, 2015 ====
A group of five 99rise activists protested during another [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] hearing. The 99rise members stood up and said, "We rise to demand democracy.

=== GOP Debate Interruption ===
During the 2016 GOP debate, Kai Newkirk, one of the cofounders of 99rise, stood up and interrupted Donald Trump.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/watch-protestor-heckles-donald-trump-at-cnn-republican-debate/|title=WATCH: Protestor Heckles Donald Trump at CNN Republican Debate (UPDATED)|website=www.mediaite.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are conflicting reports as to what Newkirk said, sources claim he spoke out for fair elections rather than billionaire controlled ones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He was immediately removed from the venue following the disruption.

The '''Achang''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|阿昌族}}|p={{linktext|Āchāngzú}}}}), also known as the '''Ngac'ang''' (their own name) or '''Maingtha''' ({{lang-my|မိုင်းသာလူမျိုး}}) are an [[ethnic group]]. They form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]].  They also live in [[Burma]].

The Achang number 27,700, of whom 27,600 are from [[Yunnan]] province, especially [[Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture|Dehong Autonomous Prefecture]]. The Achang speak a [[Burmish languages|Burmish]] ([[Burmese language|Burmese]]-related) language called [[Achang language|Achang]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} but there is no indigenous writing system to accompany it.  [[Chinese character]]s are often used instead. Many Achang also speak the [[Tai Lü language]], mainly to make commercial transactions with [[Dai people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_23859.htm |work=China Culture |title=Achang Ethnic Minority |year=2003 |publisher=Ministry of Culture |location=P.R.

Speaking a distinct dialect, the Husa Achang (戶撒) living in [[Longchuan County, Yunnan|Longchuan County]] (also in Dehong) consider themselves to be distinct and filed  an unsuccessful application in the 1950s as a separate nationality. The Husa were more [[Sinicized]] than other Achang. For example, Confucian-styled ancestral memorial tablets are common in Husa homes. Most traditional Husa believe in a mixture of [[Theravada Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]].

== History ==
The ancestors of the Achang were some of the first inhabitants of the province of Yunnan.{{citation-needed|date=September 2016}} Their ancestors lived near the [[Mekong|Lancang river]]{{citation-needed|date=September 2016}} and during the 12th century they began to emigrate towards the border the west of the river.{{citation-needed|date=September 2016}}
By the 13th century, some of them settled down in the area of Longchuan, whereas others settled around Lianghe.{{citation-needed|date=September 2016}} During the Ming and Qing dynasties they were governed by local village heads.{{citation-needed|date=September 2016}}

== Culture ==
A great part of the history and  traditions of the Achang has been transmitted from generation to generation through music and songs. Music is one of the mainstays of their culture, and they usually  finish all celebrations with songs and dances.
Unmarried young people usually comb their hair with two braids that gather on their head. The typical clothes of the Achang vary according to village. Married women dress in long skirts, whereas unmarried women wear trousers.
The men usually use the colors blue, or black to make their shirts, buttoned to a side. Unmarried men surround their head with a fabric of white color, whereas married men wear blue.
In Buddhist funerals of the Achang, a long fabric tape of about 20 meters is tied to the coffin. During the ceremony, the monk in charge of the ritual, walks in front as opposed to holding the tape. By doing this, the monk helps directs the soul of the deceased so that the soul of the deceased arrives at its final destiny. The deceased is buried without any metallic elements, not even jewels, since it is believed that those elements contaminate the soul for future reincarnation.

'''Afro-Dominicans''' are Dominicans of predominant Black African ancestry. They represent 5.26% of the [[Dominican Republic]]'s population, according to the 1996 electoral census based on Dominican identity cards data,&lt;ref name="History-of-the-Dominican-Republic-MoyaPons"/&gt; or 10.9%&lt;ref name=1960census/&gt; of the Dominican population, according to the 1960 population census (the last one in which race was queried).&lt;ref name="History-of-the-Dominican-Republic-MoyaPons"/&gt;

The majority of Black Dominicans descend from [[West Africa]]ns and [[Central Africa]]ns who arrived from the sixteenth to the early nineteenth century as a result of [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]], while many others descend from black freedman who came from the [[United States]] during the 19th century and black immigrants from the [[Commonwealth Caribbean|Anglo]] and [[French West Indies|French Caribbean]] islands who arrived during the 20th century.

== History ==
'''Early years: transition from Indigenous to African forced labor'''
[[File:Spanish Caribbean Islands in the American Viceroyalties 1600.png|thumb|right|280px|Spanish Caribbean with The Captaincy General of Santo Domingo in the center.]]
In 1502 (or 1503), the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]] finally acquiesced to the [[Conquistador|colonists]]' demands for enslaved Africans. The [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo colony]], the only European possession yet in America, had already produced a devastating effect on the [[Taíno|Taino]], [[Lucayan people|Lucayan]] (Arawaks), and [[Island Caribs|Kalinga]] (Caribs) populations. A decade of intense exploitation and deadly waves of plagues had reduced the indigenous populations to levels that even the Spaniards considered dangerous. As the Hispaniolan Tainos (and [[Cigüayos]]) declined during the first couple of years of colonization, the [[Christopher Columbus]] Administration had gone against the wishes of [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]] and had begun the first European slave trade on the western side of [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Raids that cleared out from Santo Domingo under the disguise of pacification and to evangelize nearby islanders had brought in other Amerindians to the colony. They were a large number of enslaved Lucayos from the Bahamas and Kalingas from the eastern islands. Now toiling alongside native Hispaniolans, these war captives became the first enslaved foreign workers on the island of [[Hispaniola|Aytí]], one of the indigenous names for the island that Columbus called Hispaniola.  By the turn of the century, not even the captured neighbors could supply the labor demands of the mines and plantations.  Rudimentary mining techniques and the always backbreaking mass-production of food-stuff required an ever-growing number of coerced workers. Expanding the colonization project to Puerto Rico and requesting the Crown permission to purchase enslaved Africans were the only two solutions colonists seemed capable of conceiving.  Ferdinand I of Aragon, widowed and freed from Isabel's more cautious hand, granted both wishes to the embattled colonists in the Indies.  It was never a liberal expansion nor an open trade, however. Though unrestrained by religious piety, Ferdinand, who was the ideal Prince in Machiavelli's imagination, was wary in the extreme of potential Conquistador-owned kingdoms (medieval style) in his new possessions, and of slave rebellions in the colonies.  So, the first group of enslaved Africans to arrive at the [[Ozama River]] were not [[Piezas de Indias]] purchased from the Portuguese traders, but a select group of seasoned [[Black Ladinos]].&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=country&amp;category=&amp;publisher=&amp;type=COUNTRYPROF&amp;coi=DOM&amp;rid=&amp;docid=4954ce1923&amp;skip=0|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Dominican Republic|work=Minority Rights Group International – MRGI|year=2007|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="antislavery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.antislavery.org/breakingthesilence/slave_routes/slave_routes_dominicanrepublic.shtml|title=Slave Routes: Dominican Republic|publisher=Antislavery.org|accessdate=3 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214054119/http://old.antislavery.org/breakingthesilence/slave_routes/slave_routes_dominicanrepublic.shtml|archivedate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profit too was meant to stay within his kingdom.  Indian resistances, flights, and diseases, however, forced the crown to open the market to thousands of bozales, enslaved Africans directly from the continent.&lt;ref name="Andrés-Gallego2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Andrés-Gallego|title=La esclavitud en la América española|trans-title=Slavery in Spanish America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2s7KNZsq7bsC&amp;pg=PT19|accessdate=14 January 2016|year=2010|publisher=Encuentro|language=es|isbn=978-84-9920-504-5|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1522, the first major slave rebellion was&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt; led by 20 Senegalese Muslims of [[Wolof people|Wolof]] origin, in an ingenio (sugar factory) east of the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] colony.&lt;ref name= antislavery/&gt; Many of the insurgents fled to the mountains and established what would become the first autonomous African [[Maroon (people)|Maroon]] community in America.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt; With the success of this revolt, slave revolts continued and leaders emerged among the African slaves, including people already baptized Christian by the Spanish, as was the case of Juan Vaquero, Diego de Guzmán and Diego del Campo. The rebellions and subsequent escapes led to the establishment of African communities in the southwest, north and east of the island, including the first communities of African ex-slaves in western Hispaniola that was Spanish administered until 1697, when it was sold to France and became [[Saint-Domingue]] (modern-day Haiti). This caused some concern among slaveholders and contributed to the Spanish emigration to other places. Even as sugarcane increased profitability in the island, the number of escaped Africans continued to rise, mixing with [[Taíno people|Taíno]] people of these regions, and by 1530, Maroon bands were considered dangerous to the Spanish colonists, who traveled in large armed groups outside the plantations and left the mountainous regions to the Maroons (until 1654 with the conquest of [[Jamaica]] by the [[Privateer|Corsairs]] of British Admiral [[William Penn]] and general [[Robert Venables]]).

With the discovery of precious metals in South America, the Spanish abandoned their migration to the island of Hispaniola to emigrate to South America and Mexico in order to get rich, for they did not find much wealth there. Thus, they also abandoned the slave trade to the island, which led to the collapse of the colony into poverty.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt; Still, during those years, slaves were used to build a cathedral that in time became the most oldest in the Americas. They build the monastery, first hospital and the [[Alcázar de Colón]], and the ''Puerta de las Lamentaciones'' ({{lang-es|Gate of Mercy}}). In the 1540s, Spanish authorities ordered the African slaves building a wall to defend the city from attacks by pirates who ravaged the islands.&lt;ref name= antislavery/&gt;

After 1700, with the arrival of new Spanish colonists, the African slave trade resumed. However, as industry moved from sugar to livestock, racial and caste divisions became less important, eventually leading to a blend of cultures—Spanish, African, and indigenous—which would form the basis of national identity for Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=P.

At the end of the eighteenth century, fugitive African slaves from Saint-Domingue, the western French colony of the island fled east to Santo Domingo and formed communities such as San Lorenzo de Los Mina, which is currently part of the "city" of Santo Domingo. Fugitives arrived from other parts of the West Indies as well, especially from the [[Lesser Antilles]], dominated by French, English, Dutch, etc.&lt;ref name= colonialzone&gt;[http://www.colonialzone-dr.com/people_history-sanchez.html Francisco del Rosario Sánchez One of the Padres de la Patria / Fathers of the Patriotism] – Colonial Zone-Dominican Republic (DR) – Retrieved 3 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, Haitian revolutionary leader [[Toussaint Louverture]], abolished slavery in the east of Santo Domingo, freeing about 40,000 slaves, and prompting much of the elite of that part of the island to flee to [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. However, slavery was re-established in 1809 when the Spanish recovered the area.&lt;ref name= antislavery/&gt; At the same time, the French governor Ferrand imported a second group of Haitian slaves to build the French colonial enclave Puerto Napoleon (Samana).&lt;ref name= sunorigen&gt;{{cite web|author=Bolívar M.

Slavery was again abolished in 1822 by Haitian president [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], during the Haitian [[unification of Hispaniola]] which began in February of that year.&lt;ref name= antislavery/&gt;&lt;ref name= colonialzone/&gt;

In 1824, [[African American]] [[free negro|freed people]] began to arrive under the Haitian administered island, benefiting from the favorable pro-African immigration policy of Boyer since 1822, called the [[Haitian emigration]]. Called the [[Samaná Americans]], they mostly settled in [[Puerto Plata Province]] and the [[Samaná Peninsula]] regions.

In 1844, one Afro-Dominicans [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] freed the country along with [[Matías Ramón Mella]] and [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] of the Haitian rule.&lt;ref name= colonialzone/&gt;

The slave trade involved nearly all of Africa's west coast inhabitants to be forcibly taken to the new world. Most slaves tended to come from mostly the [[Kongo people|Kongo]] people of West-Central Africa (present-day [[Angola]], [[Republic of Congo]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), along with the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] (originating from west from [[Nigeria]]), [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Akan people|Akan]] and [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] tribes.

Others African ethnic groups arrived to colonial Santo Domingo during the slavery´s period were: [[Wolof people|Wolof]] (imported from [[Senegal]]), [[Aja people|Aja]] (also called ''[[Arará]]s'' in Santo Domingo and imported from [[Dahomey]], current [[Benin]]), [[Ambundu]]  (from the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], in north Angola), Bran (originating from [[Brong-Ahafo Region]], west from [[Ghana]]), [[Fulbe people|Fulbe]], [[Kalabari tribe|Kalabari]] (originating from slave port from [[Calabar]], in Nigeria), Terranova (slaves bought probably in [[Porto-Novo, Benin]]), Zape (originating from [[Sierra Leone]]), [[Bambara people|Bambara]] and [[Biafada people|Biafada]] (this latter was originating from [[Guinea-Bissau]]) people.

The Wolof were imported to Santo Domingo from [[Senegal]] in the first half of the sixteenth century, until the import of this ethnic group was prohibited after his rebellion in 1522.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt; Many of the slaves were also Ajas, usually taken in [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]], Benin. The Ajas arrived in Santo Domingo, were well known for having made religious [[Fraternity|brotherhoods]], integrated exclusively for them, the ''San Cosme''  and ''San Damian''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130908231035/http://uval.lacoctelera.net/post/2011/04/14/etnias-africanas-la-esclavitud-santo-domingo El solitario de la vega real: Etnias africanas en la esclavitud en Santo Domingo] (The solo of The vega real: Ethnic African slavery in Santo Domingo).

The National Institute of Statistics (INE) does not collect racial data since the Census of 1960.&lt;ref name="Historia-Dominicana"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Moya Pons|authorlink=Frank Moya Pons|title=Historia de la República Dominicana |volume=2|publisher=CSIC|pages=50–52|location=Santo Domingo|year=2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that census, the ethnic features were obtained by direct observation of the people registered by the enumerator, without any questions asked. About 73% of the population was classified as [[mestizo]] (note that in the 1920, 1935, 1950 and 1960 censuses referred to mixed-race people as mestizo, never as mulatto),&lt;ref name="Historia-Dominicana"/&gt; 16% was classified as white, and 11% was classified as black (1,795,000 of people).&lt;ref name="Historia-Dominicana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="one.gob.do"&gt;Fuente: Encuesta Latin American Public Opinion Project, LAPOP,{{cite web|url=http://www.one.gob.do/index.php?module=uploads&amp;func=download&amp;fileId=3876|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729060352/http://www.one.gob.do/index.php?module=uploads&amp;func=download&amp;fileId=3876|archivedate=29 July 2013|publisher=Oficina Nacional de Estadística|title=La variable étnico racial en los censos de población en la República Dominicana|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Silvio Saillant, "today.'

Although, most of Black Dominicans are descendants of slaves imported to the country and who speak Spanish, there are also two Afro-communities that have English as their mother tongue: [[Samaná Americans]] and [[Cocolo]]s. Samaná Americans from the [[Samaná Peninsula]], are descendants, of freed slaves from the United States, who entered the country in 1824 when it was under Haitian rule, because of the favorable pro-African immigration policy of Haitian president [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], constitute the most sizable group of native English speakers in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahorasecreto.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-dominican-republics-african.html|title=African American – Latino World: The Dominican Republic's African-American Descendants|publisher=ahorasecreto.blogspot.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theroot"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Henry|last1=Louis Gates Jr.|authorlink1=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|first2=Kristin|last2=Britanik|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2013/10/dominicans_from_samana.html|title=Dominicans and Black American Roots?|publisher=theroot.com|date=18 October 2013|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021021640/http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2013/10/dominicans_from_samana.html|archivedate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of its distinctive heritage, the community, whose singular culture distinguishes them from the rest of Dominicans, refers to itself as Samaná Americans, and is referred to by fellow Dominicans as "los americanos de Samaná". Another Afro-group is the called Cocolo, descendants of those who came to the island from the English-speaking islands in the eastern Caribbean to work in the sugar plantations in the eastern part of the island between the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, they have formed communities in [[San Pedro de Macorís]] and [[La Romana Province|La Romana]].

=== Geographic distribution ===
Though, African ancestry is common throughout the Dominican Republic, today it is more prevalent in eastern areas such as [[San Pedro de Macorís Province|San Pedro de Macorís]], [[La Romana Province|La Romana]], and the [[Samaná Peninsula]], as well as along the Haitian border, particularly the southern parts of the border region; it is least prevalent in the [[Cibao Valley]] (especially within the ''Sierra de Zamba'' region), and to a lesser extent, in some rural communities in [[El Seibo Province|El Seibo]] and [[La Altagracia Province|La Altagracia]] provinces, and the western half of the [[Distrito Nacional|National District]] as well. However, in the 19th and early 20th century, African ancestry was higher in the southwestern region than in the eastern region, due to the impact of the Afro-Antillean and Haitian immigration during the 20th century.

[[File:Cocolos in Dominican Republic.PNG|thumb|Dominican Republic’s provinces where people of Antillean, Bahamian, and U.S. ancestry predominates.]]
Dominicans of Afro-Antillean and African American ancestry lives concentrated in Puerto Plata, Samaná, Hato Mayor, San Pedro de Macorís, La Romana and El Seibo provinces.

Dominicans of Haitian ancestry live scattered across the country, however, communities in the border provinces of Elías Piña and Independence where they predominate among the population, highlighting the presence of [[Association football|European football]] fields, a [[Haiti#Sports|very popular sport in Haiti]].

=== Haitian immigration ===
{{Main article|Haitians in the Dominican Republic}}

Haitian immigration is the most important of the immigrations to the Dominican Republic since its independence.

====Overview====
Haiti is more impoverished than the Dominican Republic. So, in 2003, 80% of all Haitians were poor (54% in extreme poverty) and 47.1% were illiterate. The country of nine million people has a fast-growing population, but over two-thirds of the jobs lack the formal workforce. Haiti's GDP per capita was $1,300 in 2008, or less than one-sixth of the Dominican figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html|title=Haiti: Economy overview|work=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have migrated to the Dominican Republic, with some estimates of 800,000 Haitians in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Diógenes|last=Pina|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/03/dominican-republic-deport-thy-darker-skinned-neighbour/|title=Dominican Republic: Deport Thy (Darker-Skinned) Neighbour|publisher=Ipsnews.net|date=21 March 2007|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe they are more than a million. Usually working in low paid and unskilled in building construction, household cleaning, and in plantations.&lt;ref name="oas"/&gt;

Children of illegal Haitian immigrants are often [[Statelessness|stateless]] and they are denied services, as their parents are denied Dominican nationality, and therefore are considered transient residents, due to their illegal status and undocumented, and children often have to choose only Haitian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000052/005242.htm|title=Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the United States: Protect rights, reduce statelessness|publisher=Caribbean Net News|agency=Reuters|date=19 January 2007|deadurl=y|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708193320/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000052/005242.htm|archivedate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain necessary medical care for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals cannot deny medical services based on nationality or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of births are to Haitian mothers.

====History====
Historically, Haiti was wealthier than the Dominican Republic. However, the lack of free lands in Haiti, as land was held by a small group of landlords, motivated Haitian peasants to settle in the borderland region, within the Dominican Republic. Through the years, especially after 1899, the Haitian government claimed the territory populated by Haitians, and under a treaty in 1929 several towns and cities in Central Hispaniola officially became Haitian, comprising 4,572&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A Dominican census in 1935 revealed that 3.6% of the population was Haitian. In 1936, the Haitian government claimed more territory and the Dominican Republic ceded another 1,628&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to Haiti; the next year, the Dominican dictatorship ordered the ''Dominicanization of the border'' ({{lang-es|Dominicanización fronteriza}}) and conducted the Parsley Massacre.

In 1937, Trujillo, in an event known as the ''Masacre del Perejil'' ([[Parsley Massacre]]), ordered the Army to kill Haitians living on the border. The Army killed about 10,000 to 15,000 Haitians over six days, from the night of October 2, 1937, to October 8, 1937. To avoid leaving evidence of the Army's involvement, the soldiers used [[machete]]s instead of bullets. The soldiers of Trujillo interrogated anyone with dark skin, using the [[shibboleth]] "parsley" to differentiate Haitians from Afro-Dominicans when necessary, the "r" of parsley was difficult pronunciation for Haitians. As a result of the slaughter, the Dominican Republic agreed pay to Haiti the amount of $750,000, later reduced to $525,000. The genocide sought to be justified on the pretext of fearing infiltration, but was actually also a retaliation, commented on both in national currencies, as well as having been informed by the Military Intelligence Service (the dreaded SIM), the government Haitian cooperating with a plan that sought to overthrow Dominican exiles.

In 2005 Dominican President [[Leonel Fernández]] criticized collective expulsions of Haitians were "improperly and inhumane." After a delegation from the [[United Nations]] issued a preliminary report stating that it found a profound problem of racism and discrimination against people of Haitian origin, the Dominican Foreign Minister, [[Carlos Morales Troncoso]], gave a formal statement saying "Our border with Haiti has its problems, this is our reality, and this must be understood. It's important not to confuse national sovereignty with indifference, and not to confuse security with [[xenophobia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Diógenes Pina|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/10/dominican-republic-govrsquot-turns-deaf-ear-to-un-experts-on-racism/|title=Dominican Republic: Gov’t Turns Deaf Ear to UN Experts on Racism|publisher=IPS News Agency|date=31 October 2007|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]] that struck Haiti in 2010, the number of Haitians doubled to 2&amp;nbsp;million, most of them illegally crossed after the border opened for international aid. [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated in 70,000 Haitian immigrants legal and 1,930,000 illegal living in Dominican Republic.

== Cultural contributions ==
African cultural remnants seen in the Dominican Republic in many different aspects, including music, dance, magic-religious beliefs, cuisine, economy, entertainment, motor habits, and language.

=== Music ===
[[File:Merengue dancing.jpg|thumb|right|Merengue dance.]]
Perhaps the greatest influence of African slaves is observed in music and dance. Such influence comes from the dances, that, like the ''calenda'', practiced in the Dominican Republic, as elsewhere in America, from the early years of slavery. We must Father Labat, who toured the West Indies in the eighteenth century, a fairly thorough calenda.&lt;ref name = jmarcano/&gt;

This dance derives, according to research by the folklorist [[Fradique Lizardo]], several Dominican popular rhythms. One of the most widespread is the Música de palos (Music of sticks), name that designates both the pace and the membranophones used. National Rhythms with obvious African imprint are sarandunga,&lt;ref name=jmarcano/&gt; Música de Gagá (Ganga's music, arrived from Haiti), Baile de Palos (dance of Sticks), Música de Congos (Music of Congos), Cantos de Hacha (Songs of axe),&lt;ref name=mindspring&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindspring.com/~adiascar/musica/afro-dom.htm|title=Tradición Musical Afro-Dominicana|trans-title=Afro-Dominican Musical Tradition|language=es|first=Jose|last=Radhamés Veras|publisher=mindspring.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''los congos'', ''la jaiba'' (the crab), el ''chenche matriculado'' (the chenche enrolled), etc. The ''salve'', which in the words of the U.S. ethnomusicologist [[Martha Ellen Davis (ethnomusicologist)|Martha Davis]], is the most typical of the traditional Dominican genres, has two styles: one distinctly Spanish, amétrico and antiphonal, and another polyrhythmic, strongly hybridized between the Spanish and African styles. Among African instruments are the ''los palos'' (the sticks), ''balsié'', and the ''gallumba''.&lt;ref name = jmarcano/&gt;

It is important to also mark other musical instruments Dominicans of African origin such as the Palo mayor (mainmast), the canoita, los timbales (present in the [[bachata (music)|bachata]], also called bongos), and the tambora (Key instrument in the [[merengue music]], the Dominican national dance).&lt;ref&gt;[http://historiadominicana.com.do/cultura/folklore/369-la-discriminacion-de-la-cultura-africana-en-la-musica-dominicana.html Historia Dominicana. Conferencia: "La discriminación de la cultura africana en la música dominicana"] (Dominican History. "Discrimination of African culture in the Dominican music"). Wrote by Alejandro Paulino. General Archive of the Nation, 25 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, the Bachata is a hybrid of the [[bolero]] (especially the bolero rhythm) of the Dominican Republic with other musical influences of African origin and other musical styles like the [[son (music)|son]], the merengue and the [[chachachá]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buenastareas.com/ensayos/Origen-De-La-Bachata/4295004.html Buenas tareas] (Good tasks)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are also music genres Dominican widespread across the country, whose origin is uncertain, being considered of Spanish and African origin, depending of [[musicologists]] and historians. Such is the case of the merengue music. So, [[Luis Alberti]], one of the musicians considered as fathers of merengue, thinks that the roots of this music genre are purely Spanish. F. Lizardo, Dominican folklorist, by contrast, thinks that this origin is in the Bara tribe of [[Madagascar]], who came to the island in the eighteenth century and brought a dance called ''merengue'' that has spread throughout the Caribbean. A very similar pace, adds Lizardo, arrived today with the Yoruba of Dahomey. In the African polyrhythm was also the merengue. Also often linked to the origin of merengue a dance called URPA or UPA, a native of Havana and arrived in the Dominican Republic between 1838 and 1849. The dance sailed through the Caribbean coming to Puerto Rico where he was well received. One of the movements of this dance is called ''merengue'' which apparently is the way selected to call the dance, and came to the Dominican Republic where he evolved into the genre of merengue. However, the Cuban UPA is also a dance whose origin appears to be in [[West Africa]]. In fact, in early ls, despite its rise among the masses, the upper class did not accept the merengue for long, because apparently, their connection with African music. Another cause that weighed on the repudiation and attacks the merengue were literary texts that accompany it, usually risqué.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciao.es/Merengue__Opinion_715565 Opinión sobre el merengue] (Opinion on the merengue). Retrieved 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominican folk music is intimately tied to religious culture, and interpreted primarily in the  ''fiesta de santos'' (party of saints), also known, according to the area of the country, as ''velaciones'' (vigils), ''velas'' (candles) o ''noches de vela'' (sleepless nights). Other popular rhythms are of Spanish origin, such as the ''mangulina'' and the ''carabiné.''&lt;ref name=jmarcano/&gt; Some of the most popular recording artists of these genres include [https://drjazzfestival.com/enerolisa-y-su-grupo-salve/ Enerolisa Nuñez] "The queen of Salve" and [https://g.co/kgs/GX6QJ6 Bembesito]. 

=== Religion ===
Although most black Dominicans are [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], magical-religious beliefs prevails among black Dominicans. Layers reflect African Christian syncretism operated since colonial times. The most characteristic feature is the [[Dominican Vudú]], which  relates directly to the magical activity.

Funeral rites contain many features of African descent that are shared with other American countries. A typical example is the ''baquiní'' o velorio del angelito.&lt;ref name = jmarcano/&gt;

{{wide image|Afro-Dominicans in church.jpg|800px|Afro-Dominicans attending church service.}}

=== Institutions and cuisine ===
In the economic field include various institutions of mutual aid, existing both in the fields and in the cities. In rural areas, these institutions are in the form of groups of farmers who come together to collaborate on certain agricultural tasks such as planting, clearing of forests, land preparation, etc. Are called ''juntas'' (boards) o ''convites'' and have similar characteristics to Haitian combite closely related to the dokpwe of the [[Fon people]] of [[Dahomey]]. These tasks are accompanied by songs and musical instruments that serve as encouragement and coordination at work. All board members are required to reciprocate the assistance and collaboration in the work of others. After the day is a festival that is the responsibility of the landowner.&lt;ref name = jmarcano/&gt;

Another institution of mutual aid, of African origin, is revolving credit system that goes by the name of St. corresponding to [[Susu (savings)|esusu]] and Yoruba. As in Nigeria and other parts of Afroamerica, the San is composed preferably female. It consists, as is well known, in the establishment of a common fund to which each participant's San, contributes with a sum monthly or weekly. Each partner receives, on a rotating basis, the total value of the box, starting with the organized.

Some Dominican cuisine and dishes containing some products of African origin. Among the former are the guandul, the ñame and the funde. Typical African dishes seem to be the [[mangú]], prepared with green plantains and derivatives cocola kitchen, the fungí and the calalú. A common drink among the black slaves was the [[guarapo (drink)|guarapo]], made of [[sugar cane juice]] .&lt;ref name = jmarcano/&gt;

=== Buildings ===
African slaves were forced to build a cathedral that in time became the oldest in America. They built their monastery, first hospital and the [[Alcázar de Colón]]. In the 1540s, the Spanish authorities ordered the African slaves to build a wall to defend the city from attacks by pirates who ravaged the islands. They also built the ''Puerta de las Lamentaciones'' (Gate of wailing).&lt;ref name= antislavery/&gt;

== Racial discrimination and consciousness==

That idea of black inferiority compared to the white was assumed by the whites because of their pro-slavery and, sometimes aggressive behavior with blacks, eventually would also be assumed by them, into believing, also, that their European culture was superior to the cultures from Africa and subjecting them to same (although many Afro-Dominican were able to maintain his cultures). Also, during the rule of Haiti (1822–44), the government of this country developed a black centrism, centrism that Dominicans refused. Moreover, Haitians made Dominicans feel as a distinct people racially, culturally and linguistically, while forbidding them to them use their customs. Dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]], who ruled between 1930 and 1961, tenaciously promoted the anti-Haitian sentiment and used racial persecution and nationalistic fervor against Haitians. He is considered and blamed for creating the many racial categories that avoided the use of the word "black"&lt;ref name=diariolibre&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/afrodominicanos-pugnan-por-su-identidad-AKdl138844|title=Afrodominicanos pugnan por su identidad|trans-title=Afro-Dominicans fight for their identity|language=es|publisher=diariolibre.com|date=13 June 2007|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1955, he promotes an emigration from Spain to his country to "whiten" the population, increasing the white population over the black population, which he considered inferior.&lt;ref name="Emigración canaria"&gt;Hernández González, Manuel. La emigración canaria a América (Canary emigration to Americas). Page 27–31, 109–110. First Edition January, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice continued under President [[Joaquín Balaguer]], who often complained that Haitian immigration in the Dominican Republic was ''blackening'' the country. In 1990, he was blamed for blocking the presidential aspirations of leading black candidate [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]], spreading rumors that he was actually Haitian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Franco|first=Franklin|authorlink=Franklin Franco|url=http://hoy.com.do/pena-gomez-balaguer-y-el-racismo-iii/|title=Peña Gómez, Balaguer y el racismo (III)|trans-title=Peña Gómez, Balaguer and racism (III)|language=es|newspaper=Hoy.com.do|date=2 September 2005|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An envoy of the [[UN]] in October 2007 found that there was racism against blacks in general, and particularly against Haitians, which proliferate in every segment of Dominican society. According to a study conducted by the Dominican Studies Institute [[CUNY]], about 80% of the contemporary Dominican population has ancestry from West and Central Africa in different degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torres-Saillant|first=Silvio|title=The Tribulations of Blackness: Stages in Dominican Racial Identity|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=May 1998|jstor=2634170|subscription=yes|volume=25|issue=3|pages=126–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of terms are used to represent a range of skin tones, such as ''moreno'', ''canelo'', ''Indian'', ''indiesito'', ''blanquito'', and ''rubio''.

Ramona Hernández, director of the Dominican Studies Institute at [[City College of New York]] asserts that the terms were originally a defense against [[racism]]: "During the Trujillo regime, people who had dark skin were rejected, so they created their own mechanism to fight against the rejection".&lt;ref name = diariolibre/&gt;

'''Al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad Amuli''' (944 - 1020) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaydiyyah]] sect.

Al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad's ancestor in the tenth degree was the [[Twelve Imams|Twelver imam]] [[Hasan bin Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;The line of descent was al-Hasan bin Ali - Zaid - al-Hasan - al-Qasim - Muhammad - Harun - Muhammad - al-Husayn - Harun - al-Husayn - al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a disciple of Abu Abdallah al-Basri and the Qadi Abd al-Jabbar, and a learned expert on the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ei2/mu-tazila.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad was accepted as imam in [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] and [[Dailamites|Deylaman]] in [[Persia]], and had connections with the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] area of [[Yemen]]. After 1013, no local imam was appointed for many years in the Yemeni highland. In Zaidi [[historiography]], al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad is sometimes listed as such, although he never visited Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;List in Cornelis van Arendonk, ''Les débuts de l'mamat zaidite au Yemen''. Leiden 1960; Cesare Ansaldi, ''Il Yemen nella storia e nella leggenda''. Rome 1933, p. 134;  http://www.hukam.net/family.php?fam=2.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Langa in Deylaman in 1020, being succeeded by his brother [[Abu Talib Yahya]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Brockelmann, ''Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur'', Vol. I.

'''Mir Nasir Khan Talpur''' was the last [[Amir]] of the land that included [[Sind province|Sindh]] and parts of present-day [[Balochistan]] and was one of the most active administrators after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]]. He made [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]  the capital of his empire and constructed two forts in the city known as the Pakka Qilla (Brick Fort) and the Kacha Qilla (Mud Fort) and he also built the Maula Ali Qadam Gah (The footsteps of Ali(A.S)), a Shia shrine at the center of the city. He was a strong follower of the [[Sufi]] tradition. He donated a lot of his personal wealth to the Tomb of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]] at [[Bhit|Bhit Shah]]. He and his 30,000 forces were defeated by the forces of the [[British Empire]] led by [[Charles James Napier|Charles Napier]] at the [[Battle of Miani]].

Mir Nasir Khan Talpur's defeat was an ill omen for the last [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]].

'''Arameans in Israel''' ({{lang-arc|ܐܪ̈ܡܝܐ}}, {{Hebrew|ארמיא}}; ''{{transl|arc|ʼaramáyé}}'') are persons residing in [[Israel]] who identify as [[Arameans]] (or Aramaeans), a [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] people who originated in what is now western, southern and central [[Syria (region)|Syria region]] (Biblical [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]) during the [[Late Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A0BdsFRX55cC&amp;pg=PA112]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fsmitha.com"&gt;[http://www.fsmitha.com/h1/ch03-hyk2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] in the [[Middle East]] (particularly in [[Syria]] and [[Israel]]) still espouse an Aramean ethnic identity to this day and a minority still speak [[Western Aramaic]] dialects or languages, although the [[Eastern Aramaic]] of the ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] is far more widely spoken. Most of the self-identified Aramaeans in Israel are of [[Maronite]] community. The Maronite residents of [[Jish]], a subset of [[Maronites in Israel]], relate to themselves as Aramean Christian Maronite peoples.&lt;ref name=aramaiccenter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aramaic-center.com/about.html |title=Aramaic Maronite Center |publisher=Aramaic-center.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2014, self-identified Arameans in Israel used to be registered as ethnic Arabs or without ethnic identity. However, since September 2014, Christian families or clans who can speak Aramaic and/or have an Aramaic family tradition are eligible to register as ethnic Arameans in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yalon|first1=Yori|title='Aramean' officially recognized as nationality in Israel|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=20169|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=Israel Hayom|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, it was published by Ha'aretz that the number of Israeli Christians, eligible to register as Arameans is 13,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/literature/study/.premium-1.2944154]&lt;/ref&gt; Yaakov Halul from [[Jish]] in the [[Galilee]] was formally defined as the first Aramean on his Israeli identification in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-israeli-christian-child-registers-as-aramean/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Aramaean people originated in what is present-day western, southern and central [[Syria (region)|Syria]] (Biblical [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]) during the [[Late Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fsmitha.com"/&gt;

In the early 13th century BC (according to a literal [[chronology of the Bible]]), much of the [[Land of Israel]] came under Aramean rule for eight years, as written in the [[Book of Judges]], until [[Othniel]] defeated the forces led by [[Chushan-Rishathaim]], the King of [[Aram-Naharaim]]. Other entities mentioned in the Hebrew Bible include [[Aram Damascus]] and [[Aram Rehob]].

Large groups of Arameans migrated to [[Babylonia]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] during the 11th and 10th centuries BC, where they established small semi-independent Aramaic kingdoms before being absorbed into the native population. In the [[Levant]] and in [[Mesopotamia]] conquered Aramean populations were forcibly deported throughout the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian Empire]]{{dubious|The example given is Neo-Assyrian, not Neo-Bab.|date=November 2016}} e.g. under the rule of the 8th-century [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]].

Some [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] in the [[Middle East]] (particularly in [[Syria]] and [[Israel]]) still espouse an Aramean ethnic identity to this day and a minority still speak [[Western Aramaic]] dialects or languages, although the [[Eastern Aramaic]] of the ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] is far more widely spoken.

==Recognition in Israel==
[[File:Flag of the Syriac-Aramaic People.svg|thumb|right|[[Aramean flag]]]]
In September 2014, Ministry of the Interior [[Gideon Sa'ar]] instructed the PIBA to recognize Arameans as an ethnicity separate from [[Israeli Arabs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-neither-arab-nor-jew-israel-s-unheard-minorities-speak-up-1.6464684 Neither Arab nor Jew: Israel's unheard minorities speak up, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Ministry of the Interior's guidance, people born into Christian families or clans who can speak [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and have Aramaic cultural heritage within their family are eligible to register as Arameans. About 200 Christian families were thought to be eligible prior to this decision.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lis|first1=Jonathan|title=Israel recognizes Aramean minority in Israel as separate nationality|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.616299|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an August 9, 2013 [[Israel Hayom]] article, at that time an estimated 10,500 persons were eligible to receive Aramean ethnic status according to the new regulations, including 10,000 Maronites (which included 2,000 former SLA members), and 500 [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]], while 1,500 members of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]] are of different ethnicity, and officially registered as "[[Assyrians in Israel|Assyrians]]", the indigenous people of northern Iraq, north east Syria, south east Turkey and the fringes of north west Iran, who are migrants from these regions to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/107811]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to receive the "Aramean" ethnic status in Israel was 2 year old Yaakov Halul in [[Jish]] on October 20, 2014.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Marissa|title=In first, Israeli Christian child registers as Aramean|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-israeli-christian-child-registers-as-aramean/|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=The Times of Israel|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, it was published by Ha'aretz that the number of Israeli Christians, eligible to register as Arameans is 13,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/literature/study/.premium-1.2944154]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
The [[Arameanism|recognition]] of the [[Aramean]] ethnicity caused mixed reactions among Israeli minorities, the Christian community, and among the general Arab Israeli population. 

While some celebrated the success of their long legal struggle to be recognized as a non-Arab ethnic minority, other members of the Arab community in Israel denounced it as an attempt to divide [[Arab Christians]].&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Ariel|title=Israeli Greek Orthodox Church denounces Aramaic Christian nationality|url=http://www.jpost.com/Christian-News/Israeli-Greek-Orthodox-Denounce-Move-to-Differentiate-Christians-from-Arabs-376493|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=Jerusalem Post|date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] officially denounced the move.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Post"/&gt; 

Many in Israeli academia advocate the recognition of the Aramean identity and have called on the government of Israel to promote the awareness regarding this issue on the basis of the international principle of ethnic self-determination as espoused by [[Wilson's 14 points]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/15717#.VLZWApv9ka4]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the staunchest supporters of the recognition of the Aramean identity is Father [[Gabriel Naddaf]], who is one of the leaders of the Christians in Israel. He advocated on behalf of his Aramean followers and thanked the Interior Ministry's decision as a "historic move".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/185214#.VLZaQZv9ka4]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boomerang Generation''' is a term applied in [[Western culture]] to young adults graduating high school and college in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Reed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/the_p_word/newsid_8057000/8057167.stm |title='Boomerang' generation back home |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Jayson [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-13-analysis-boomerang_N.htm Analysis: 'Boomerang' generation mostly hype] USA Today 3/14/2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MICHELLE HIRSCH,[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Issues/Life-and-Money/2010/06/12/The-Boomerang-Generation-More-Reasons-to-Move-Back-Home.aspx The Boomerang Generation: More Reasons to Move Back Home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204080345/http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Issues/Life-and-Money/2010/06/12/The-Boomerang-Generation-More-Reasons-to-Move-Back-Home.aspx |date=December 4, 2010 }} June 12, 2010  The Fiscal Times&lt;/ref&gt; They are so named for the percentage of whom choose to share a home with their parents after previously living on their own—thus [[boomerang]]ing back to their parents' residence. This arrangement can take many forms, ranging from situations that mirror the high dependency of pre-adulthood to highly independent, separate-household arrangements.

The term can be used to indicate only those members of this age-set that actually do return home, not the whole generation. In as much as home-leaving practices differ by [[economic class]], the term is most meaningfully applied to members of the [[middle class]].

==Introduction==
{{Disputed section|date=June 2009}}
The parental expectation of having an "[[Empty nest syndrome|empty nest]]", traditional in the United States and some other industrialized cultures, has increasingly given way in the 1990s and 2000s to the reality of a "cluttered nest" or "crowded nest". The latter term was popularized by Kathleen Shaputis's 2004 book ''The Crowded Nest Syndrome: Surviving the Return of Adult Children'',&lt;ref name="Shaputis"&gt;Shaputis, Kathleen. ''The Crowded Nest Syndrome: Surviving the Return of Adult Children''. Clutter Fairy Publishing, 2004. Print. {{ISBN|978-0-9726727-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes a critical view of the trend.

[[The University of Western Ontario|University of Western Ontario]] professor Roderic Beaujot discusses the phenomenon of delayed home-leaving at length. He cites [[Statistics Canada|Canadian census statistics]] showing that, in 1981, 27.5% of Canadians aged 20–29 lived with their parents; in 2001, the figure had grown to 41%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vifamily.ca/library/cft/delayed_life.html Delayed Life Transitions: Trends and Implications] accessed on June 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the proportion of adults ages 20 to 34 living with their parents has increased from 9% in 1960 to almost 17% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Fields J. and L.M. Casper, ''America's families and living arrangements'', 2000, US Census Bureau, Current Population Reports, as cited in Nijole Benokratis, ''Marriages and Families'', 6th edition, Pearson, 2008, p.371&lt;/ref&gt; However, US [[Census bureau|census]] data also suggest that the rate at which adult children have been living with parents has been steady since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hh-fam.html Families and Living Arrangements, table AD-1] accessed on June 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Census Bureau reported a 5 percent point increase in the number of young men (ages 24–34) living with their parents for the period between 2005 (14%) and 2011 (19%). For the same period, the number of young women living with their parents increased from 8% in 2005 to 10% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/boomerang_generation_us_census.html Boomerang generation: U.S. Census shows more young adults moving in with parents]&lt;/ref&gt;

The coming of age of this generation coincide with the economic downturn starting with the collapse of the [[stock market bubble]] in 2000. This led to rising [[unemployment]] until 2004, the same time this generation was entering the workforce after high school or college graduation.  Additionally, in the [[new economy]], where [[globalisation]]-induced phenomena like [[outsourcing]] have eliminated many jobs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/economy/jan-june04/jobs_3-11.html Jobs moving overseas] accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/04/10.21.04/outsourcing_jobs.html U.S. underestimates jobs lost to outsourcing, labor experts assert] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916141619/http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/04/10.21.04/outsourcing_jobs.html |date=September 16, 2006 }} from Cornell News accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/world/20060611-100706-2930r.htm Job outsourcing 'serious problem'] from the Washington Times accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Oct04/Bronf.outsourcing.rpt.lm.html Bureau of Labor Statistics grossly underestimates U.S. jobs lost to outsourcing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909204208/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Oct04/Bronf.outsourcing.rpt.lm.html |date=September 9, 2006 }} from Cornell News accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[real wages]] have fallen over the last twenty years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&amp;ID=273&amp;cat=Arts Amid Plenty, the Wage Gap Widens] from the Milken Institute accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/business/04charts.html?ei=5090&amp;en=7286ff0309ded7bd&amp;ex=1296709200&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print When It Comes to Pay, It Helps to Be the One Signing the Checks] from the New York Times accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rn/1997-98/98rn48.htm  Is Youth Worse Off Than Two Decades Ago?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910064759/http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rn/1997-98/98rn48.htm |date=September 10, 2006 }} from the Parliament of Australia accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and a college degree no longer ensures job stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=119869 Is Job Stability in the US Falling?

Moving back home allows them the option of unpaid [[internship]]s and additional schooling without the burden of paying rent at market rates (or paying rent at all).

An increase in divorce rates as well as a delay in initial marriage are other contributing factors in young adults returning to reside with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardjlg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Goldfarb.BoomerangGeneration.pdf|title=Who Pays for the Boomerang Generation?|last=Goldfarb|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation differs from previous ones in that many members expect to remain with their parents for some years while maintaining their own social and professional lives. Home-leaving remains a priority for most in the Boomerang Generation, though financial burden (and the comforts of financial stability in their parents'  homes) often delays the fruition of that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/29/boomerang-millennials-get-cozy-at-home/|title=‘Boomerang’ Millennials Get Cozy at Home|last=Sussman|first=Anna Louie|date=2015-07-29|website=WSJ|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trend==
The phenomenon of boomeranging/delayed home-leaving has generated considerable inquiry and debate, including academic studies at reputable universities; full-length books, such as ''The Hands-On Guide to Surviving Adult Children Living at Home'' by Christina Newberry;&lt;ref name="Newberry"&gt;Newberry, Christina. ''The Hands-On Guide to Surviving Adult Children Living at Home''. Nuru Guides, 2012. Print. {{ISBN|978-0981390055}}&lt;/ref&gt; articles in national newspapers; documentaries, such as ''Generation Boomerang'';&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|3572052|Generation Boomerang (2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and major motion pictures, such as ''[[Failure to Launch]]'' (2006) starring [[Matthew McConaughey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McConaughey|first=Matthew|title=Failure to Launch|date=2006-03-10|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427229/plotsummary|last2=Parker|last3=Deschanel|last4=Bartha|first2=Sarah Jessica|first3=Zooey|first4=Justin|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===

Economic instability is the primary justification for this phenomenon, as articulated in Kimberly Palmer's 2007 ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' article "The New Parent Trap: More Boomers Help Adult Kids out Financially".&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Kimberly. "[https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/your-money/2007/12/12/the-new-parent-trap.html?PageNr=1 The New Parent Trap: More Boomers Help Adult Kids out Financially]." ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', Dec. 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the term Boomeranger has been used to draw reference to those Gen-Xers and Gen-Yers of the Boomerang Generation who have either returned to an earlier, more modest lifestyle or have simply moved back home with parents and other loved ones, in response to the [[Great Recession]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Where the young person and his/her parents can tolerate the arrangement, it provides tremendous financial relief to the young person. Such co-residence can be a valuable form of insurance, particularly for youths from poorer families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp677.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Moving Back Home: Insurance Against Labor Market Risk'', March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; It may also provide non-negligible income to the parents, though in many cultures, the boomeranger retains all or nearly all of their disposable income for [[disposable and discretionary income|discretionary income]] purchases.

Though inter-generational cohabitation is ''[[terra incognita]]'' for many in modern industrialized Western societies and therefore challenging, those who attempt it can benefit from the experience.  The arrangement tends to force all involved to communicate and negotiate in ways they did not when the children were pre-adults.  In the best case, this can lead to healthy adult relationships between parents and children.

This can benefit parents when they reach old age.  In societies where it is common for children to live with their parents into adulthood, such as Asian and Hispanic cultures, children more frequently take care of aging parents rather than devolving the responsibility on a third party, such as a nursing home. Whether the Boomerang Generation will follow suit remains to be seen, as the older [[Baby Boom]] generation ages. And let's not forget that the recession has affected the Baby Boomers as well, perhaps even more so than their children, as many lost significant investments and savings intended for retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/2011/10/31/the-recessions-impact-on-baby-boomer-retirement|title=The Recession's Impact on Baby Boomer Retirement|last=Brandon|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102144155/http://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/2011/10/31/the-recessions-impact-on-baby-boomer-retirement|archive-date=2011-11-02|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, we can only hope the cohabitation of parents and their adult children can be mutually beneficial in terms of easing the financial burden. While the boomerangers may live rent free, it is common for them to take on other financial responsibilities in return, such as groceries or utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/03/PewSocialTrends-2012-BoomerangGeneration.pdf|title=The Boomerang Generation Feeling OK about Living with Mom and Dad|last=Parker|first=Kim|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, 20% of adults in their 20s and early 30s were residing with their parents, which is twice the amount of the previous generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/magazine/its-official-the-boomerang-kids-wont-leave.html|title=It’s Official: The Boomerang Kids Won’t Leave|last=Davidson|first=Adam|date=2014-06-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many reasons cited for the need for parental support, one of the greatest contributing factors is said to be student loan debt. 45% of 25-year-old college graduates currently owe $20,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/business/some-parents-shouldering-student-loans-fall-on-tough-times.html|title=Some Parents, Shouldering Student Loans, Fall on Tough Times|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|date=2012-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some families, the financial instability of the mid 2000s caused a decrease in funds allocated for higher education, therefore decreasing parental financial contributions and causing the need for more loans to cover educational costs. And while student loans are more frequently taken out in the student’s name, some parents who took out loans are facing substantial debt and are now relying on their adult children to provide financial assistance while they pay them off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-parents-use-retirement-savings-for-college-tuition-1488559632|title=Should Parents Use Retirement Savings for College Tuition?|last=Schoenberger|first=Chana R.|date=2017-03-03|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===

Critics of the practice of boomeranging, such as Shaputis,&lt;ref name="Shaputis"/&gt; worry about the negative effect this trend has on the financial and social independence of the children.

Those who return home from the unrestrictive nature of college dorm life may have difficulty readjusting to their parents' domestic expectations.  Where living space is shared, gatherings with friends can be limited in frequency or scope.  Dating is similarly constrained and can be impaired by the stigma of the young adult's perceived inability to function independently of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/home-stretch-what-happens-when-twentysomethings-move-back-in-with-their-parents-7658253.html|title=Home stretch: What happens when twentysomethings move back in with|date=2012-04-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bunda people''' or (also ''Ambuun'', ''Mbuun'') in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] are an ethnic group that mostly live in [[Idiofa Territory]], [[Kwilu District]] of [[Bandundu Province]]. They speak the [[Mpuono language]], spoken by an estimated 165,000 people as of 1972.{{sfn|Ethnologue}}

==Location==
The Belgian colonial administration originally gave Idiofa Territory the name of "Babunda Territory" after the Bunda people, who formed the majority of the population.{{sfn|Schwetz|1924|p=73}}
They are still the most important group in the center of Idiofa territory.{{sfn|Plan stratégique}}
The Bunda are the majority of the population of the administrative center of [[Idiofa]].{{sfn|Munzumi|2006|p=20}}
There are also Bunda populations in [[Bulungu Territory]] and [[Gungu Territory]].{{sfn|RDC Ministère du Plan|2005}}

==Economy==
The Bundu territory has a tropical climate with alternating dry and rainy seasons.
The region has abundant water resources, the most important rivers being the [[Lubwe River|Lubwe]], [[Loange River|Loange]], [[Kamtsha River|Kamtsha]] and the [[Piopio River|Piopio]].
Precipitation in the rainy season is so intense that it is a major obstacle to farming and a time when food may be scarce.
Hunting and fishing are individual activities during this period.
Food is abundant in the dry season, the main season for communal hunting and fishing.{{sfn|Munzumi|2006|p=20}}

A '''call girl''' or '''female escort''' is a [[sex worker]] who (unlike a [[street prostitution|street walker]]) does not display her profession to the general public; nor does she usually work in an institution like a [[brothel]], although she may be employed by an [[escort agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/27/most-sex-workers-jobs-health-education-charities-survey|title=Most sex workers have had jobs in health, education or charities – survey|first=Diane|last=Taylor|date=27 February 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7819984.stm "Is the number of trafficked call girls a myth?"]. [[BBC NEWS]]. (9 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The client must make an appointment, usually by calling a [[telephone number]].
Call girls often advertise their services in small ads in magazines and via the Internet, although an intermediary advertiser, such as an escort agency, may be involved in promoting escorts, while, less often, some may be handled by a [[pimp]].&lt;ref&gt;Diane Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/11/gender.uk Nice and sleazy does it], ''The Guardian'' (11 May 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
Call girls may work either '''incall''', where the client comes to them, or '''outcall''', where they go to the client. Some [[porn stars]] are known to escort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When porn stars become escorts: Lucrative new trend could also be risky|author=Dickson, EJ|date=February 23, 2014|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/02/24/when_porn_stars_become_escorts_lucrative_new_trend_could_also_be_risky/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In this book Gardner has captured the lives and everyday experiences of [[Indian people|Indian]] workers living in [[Bahrain]]. These people are mainly migrant workers and constitute about half of the country. Gardener has also told these workers' personal stories and how the "sponsorship system" in this country binds a worker to a particular sponsor.&lt;ref name="University of Puget Sounds" /&gt;

==Reviews==
In a book-analysis published by the ''University of Puget Sounds'', it was written—
&lt;blockquote&gt;Armed with his interviews and research, Gardner goes beyond merely describing the system and boldly suggests changes that could improve the lot of the workers, without stemming the labor flow that is key to such cities’ wealth. Gardner explains that for the Middle Eastern states, the exploitative practices are a means to build industries and cities that will ensure the region’s international success, even as the oil runs out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==

===Reporting===
According to the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) as of 2014, "U.S. citizens and Westerners continue to report incidents of crime, including robberies and attempted robberies."  Cases of sexual assault are believed to be underreported "because victims are customarily blamed".&lt;ref name=OSAC/&gt; (For example, in 2009, a 23-year-old woman was sentenced to a year in prison and 100 lashes for adultery after being raped by five men. In 2007, a 19-year-old victim of rape by seven men receiving a sentence of six-months in jail and 200 lashes.&lt;ref name=OSAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia 2013 Crime and Safety Report|url=https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=13573|website=OSAC Bureau of Diplomatic Security|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Foreign affairs ministries of other countries{{which|date=January 2017}} have stated{{when|date=January 2017}} that there is a low rate{{quantify|date=January 2017}} of crime in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=DFAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=fco/&gt;&lt;ref name=dfa/&gt;

===History===
While as late as the 1980s the kingdom could and did boast of being "practically crime-free," the crime rate among jobless youth grew by 320% from 1990 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Arab News|title=Downward spiral of unemployment and juvenile delinquency |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Downward-spiral-of-unemployment-and-juvenile-delinquency-637.html|date=17 April 2004|
accessdate=3 October 2014|quote=The high rate of unemployment among youth seems to be the cause of the growing crime rate. According to a report released by The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency at the end of 2003 crime rates among jobless youth grew by 320 % from 1990 to 1996. By 2005 the crime rate is expected to grow by 136%. This figure is particularly significant since until just a few years ago Saudi Arabia had a low crime rate, so much so that the country could  boast being practically crime-free.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Convictions for drug possession rose from 4,279 in 1986 to 17,199 in 2001.{{sfn|Bradley|2005|p=148}} Credited with rising crime are a "population boom, rapid social change, and massive unemployment" leading to "a breakdown in traditional forms of social control and constraint.{{sfn|Bradley|2005|pp=142—3|ps=... a population boom, rapid social change, and massive unemployment are bringing a new and frightening social reality to Saudi Arabia. ...a breakdown in traditional forms of social control and constraint}}

==Types of crime==

===Theft===
Petty [[theft]] is a problem especially in crowded areas.&lt;ref name=DFAT/&gt; The nation has strict laws prohibiting [[drug trafficking]]; drug trafficking is a capital crime. Despite strict laws, however, illicit trafficking takes place in considerable amounts through underground channels especially marijuana, cocaine and homegrown psychedelic drugs.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html Saudi Arabia] [[The World Factbook]]&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia is a signatory to all three international conventions on drug control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/egypt/en/country_profile_saudiarabia.html Country Profiles - Saudi Arabia] [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]&lt;/ref&gt; To curb [[money laundering]], improved anti-money laundering laws have been enacted.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The country has implemented all the forty recommendations of the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) for combating money laundering and all eight recommendations of the FATF regarding terror financing. A Financial Intelligence Unit exists for the purpose of monitoring flows of funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiembassy.net/2004News/Press/PressDetail.asp?cIndex=193 First independent human rights organization in Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121163639/http://www.saudiembassy.net/2004News/Press/PressDetail.asp?cIndex=193 |date=November 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common crime in 2002 was theft, which accounted for 47% of total reported crime.&lt;ref name="ISUS674"/&gt; Saudi Arabia is a [[Human trafficking in Saudi Arabia|destination point]] for workers from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] who are subjected to conditions which include involuntary servitude, non-payment of wages, confinement and withholding of passports as a restriction on their movement. [[Domestic worker]]s are particularly vulnerable because some are confined to the house in which they work and are unable to seek help. Saudi Arabia is also a destination country for children [[Human trafficking|trafficked]] from other [[Middle East]]ern countries like [[Yemen]], [[Africa]]n countries like [[Nigeria]], [[Mali]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]], and [[Sudan]] and [[Asia]]n nations like [[Singapore]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.priyo.com/business/2012/03/03/saudi-observing-crime-trend-am-47517.html|title=Saudi observing crime trend among some Bangladeshi workers|author=priyodesk|date=3 March 2012|website=news.priyo.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322002438/http://news.priyo.com/business/2012/03/03/saudi-observing-crime-trend-am-47517.html|archivedate=22 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=12 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] for the purpose of forced begging and involuntary servitude as street vendors. Some Nigerian women were reportedly trafficked into Saudi Arabia for commercial sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

===Terrorism===
{{main|Terrorism in Saudi Arabia}}
Threat of [[Islamic terrorism]] is a matter of concern.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/opinion/watching-a-saudi-succession.html  Watching a Saudi Succession] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 2000 to 2004, when a number of expatriate workers were killed in car bombings, questions arose over the seriousness and sincerity of Saudi efforts to prevent or investigate attacks.  Before May 2003, the only public statements of any investigation or prosecution of attacks were Saudi accusations against the (mainly British) western expatriates themselves. Saudis arrested and detained several, claiming they were 'alcohol traders' fighting a turf war over the illegal distribution of alcohol.  According to author Thomas Hegghammer, "today, few outside Saudi Arabia believe that alcohol traders carried out the bombings", as the suspects were well-paid professionals with no prior record of violent crime, no forensic evidence was provided against them, and attacks of a very similar nature on western nationals  continued despite the arrests of the alleged perpetrators.&lt;ref name=Hegghammer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegghammer|first1=Thomas|title=Jihad in Saudi Arabia: Violence and Pan-Islamism since 1979|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNLODP6w6GkC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=John+R.+Bradley+saudi+arabia+compound+riyadh+2003&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DM9S2UhDzd&amp;sig=MjBFMdbno8nGrymkcEzyAczUlZs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=98-YU66iHNWeyATdt4HIDA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20R.%20Bradley%20saudi%20arabia%20compound%20riyadh%202003&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 26 foreigners were killed in a [[Riyadh Compound Bombings|May 2004 attack]] by three car bombs on foreign residential compounds in Riyadh,   American intelligence sources quoted by the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', stated the operation "depended on a significant level of `insider` knowledge of the compounds," and this and other evidence indicates that [[al-Qaeda]] has infiltrated even the elite National Guard, which was involved in compound security.&lt;ref name=Gedye&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gedye|first1=Robin|first2=John R|last2=Bradley|title=Bomber 'moles' in Saudi forces|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/4187344/Bomber-moles-in-Saudi-forces.html|accessdate=11 June 2014|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=16 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombers wore uniforms of security forces, in both the May 2003 compound bombing and another in November.{{sfn|Bradley|2005|pp=113—4}}

While attacks by militants have decreased dramatically since late 2004, there are continued reports of terrorist planning. The [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] (DFAT) of the [[Government of Australia]] claimed they received reports that terrorists are masterminding attacks against assets belonging to the [[Politics of Saudi Arabia#Central government|Government of Saudi Arabia]], oil infrastructure, [[List of airports in Saudi Arabia|aviation infrastructure]], embassies, hotels, shopping malls and many Western interests such as residential housing complexes, gatherings of foreign tourists for recreational or cultural activities etc.&lt;ref name=DFAT/&gt; The [[United States Department of State]] reported "There is an on-going security threat due to the continued presence of terrorist  groups, some affiliated with [[al Qaida]], who may target Western interests, housing compounds, and other facilities where Westerners congregate".&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1012.html Saudi Arabia] [[United States Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrorism in Saudi Arabia|Terrorist attacks in the country]] targeted both native people and foreigners. DFAT further stated "Terrorist attacks could occur at any time, anywhere in Saudi Arabia, including in [[Riyadh]], [[Khobar]], and other major cities".&lt;ref name=DFAT/&gt;

The kingdom has taken successful efforts to rehabilitate terrorists. Saudi Arabia has the best terrorist rehabilitation program in the world. Their terrorist recidivism rate is about 3 to 4%. In order to have such a low terrorist recidivism rate, the Saudi Arabian’s well-designed strategies to counter the effects new terrorist recruits endure during indoctrination to a terrorist organization. The effects that Saudi Arabia terrorist rehabilitation program targets are as follows: authorization, isolation, training, and dehumanization. By knowing these steps, the rehabilitation programs reverse the effects of the terrorist authorization, isolation, dehumanization, and training to become successful in criminal rehabilitation. The rehabilitation programs help violent offenders positively reintegrate in the free society by supporting the creation of positive peer and familial relationships. These programs help to reconnect family with the offender or aid in the creation of a family&lt;ref&gt;Lankford, Adam &amp; Gillespie, Katherine. (2011). Rehabilitating Terrorists Through

===Murder===
In 1988, the "reported" [[murder]] rate in Saudi Arabia was .011 per 100,000 population, sexual offenses were .059 per 100,000 population, and thefts were .005 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="TCC95"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a total of 599 crimes were reported in Saudi Arabia, or .06 crimes for every 100,000 people. By 2006 those numbers had gone down{{dubious|date=November 2014}} with [[murder]] at .010 per 100,000 population, sexual offenses at .046 per 100,000, and thefts offenses at .04{{dubious|date=November 2014}} per 100,000.

In 2015, the UN office of drugs and crime reported the murder rate in Saudi Arabia to be 1.5 per 100,000, with 472 recorded offences.&lt;ref&gt;https://data.unodc.org/#state:1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sharia law==
The Saudi legal system is based on [[Sharia]] or Islamic law and thus often prohibits many activities that are not crimes in other nations,  such as alcohol or pork consumption, public displays of non-Islamic religious symbols or text, affection between opposite sex outside of marriage, "indecent" artwork or media images, sorcery, homosexuality, cross-dressing, and fornication or adultery.  One of the main organizations enforcing traditional Islamic morality in the kingdom is the "Religious Police" or [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice]].  It is difficult to know, with any certainty, how many people have been charged or punished for violating these laws.

However, some Western countries or human rights defenders criticized Saudi corrections system for punishing offenders. In fact, many of those punishments came originally from Islam and it should be applied for anyone who commits crime. The article "Islamic Law Across Cultural Borders: The Involvement of Western Nationals in Saudi Murder Trials" by Esmaeili &amp; Gans (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Esmaeili|first1=H|last2=Gans|first2=J|title=Islamic Law Across Cultural Borders: The Involvement of Western Nationals in Saudi Murder Trials|journal=Denver Journal of International Law &amp; Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=2|page=145-174}}&lt;/ref&gt;, discussed several important points regarding the three-major types of punishments that should be under the Shariaa's law. These three are "Hudud" (limit or boundary), "Qisas" "retaliation", and "Tazirat" "discretionary punishments" (Esmaeili &amp; Gans, 2000, p.153).They proved that these punishments "are fixed by the Quran and Sunnah and cannot be altered by any judicial authority" (Esmaeili &amp; Gans, 2000, p.153). 

The first punishment called Hudud (limit or boundary) and that includes; life imprisonment, lashing, stoning to death for those who have illegal sexual intercourse, and hand amputation for thefts but it depends on the situation (Esmaeili &amp; Gans, 2000). Those punishments and other that Hudud must be occur is not for all crimes but in fact it attaches only for a limited crime, under several steps and the presence of witnesses. 

The second punishment called Qisas (retaliation) and that includes; murder and assault. Esmaeili and Gans (2000) stated that "the courts have no initial sentencing role" because Qisas followed eye for an eye method or the law of retaliation, which means "the offender is punished in the same way, and by the same means, as the crime that she or he committed" (p. 153). So, the death penalty punishment is for murder crimes.

The third punishment called Tazirat (discretionary punishments) and it depends on the balance of the crime (Esmaeili &amp; Gans, 2000). In this category the King’s approve is not required as the previous categories. So, if a person commits any sin that considered under Islamic law, the judge can punish him or her. Practicing Tazirat punishment such as "lashing, prison, or banishment, is specified in written form" (Esmaeili &amp; Gans, 2000, p.153).

[[Pashto]] and [[Dari language|Dari]] are both the [[official language]]s of the country.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt; 
Dari, which is known as the Afghan Persian, functions as the [[lingua franca]]. Pashto is widely used in the region south of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains and the [[Indus River]] in neighboring Pakistan.

[[Islam in Afghanistan|Islam]] is the religion of more than 99% of Afghanistan's citizens.

The remaining 1% or less practice other religions such as [[Sikhism in Afghanistan|Sikhism]] and [[Hinduism in Afghanistan|Hinduism]]. Excluding urban populations in the principal cities, most People are organized into tribal and other kinship-based groups, who follow their own traditional customs, for instance Pashtuns [[Pashtunwali]]. The majority of the country's population lives in [[rural area]]s and is involved in [[Agriculture in Afghanistan|agricultural activitie]]s.

The recent estimate in the above chart is some what supported by the below national [[opinion poll]]s, which were aimed at knowing how a group of about 804 to 8,706 local residents in Afghanistan felt about the current war, political situation, as well as the economic and social issues affecting their daily lives. Ten [[statistical survey|survey]]s were conducted between 2004 and 2015 by the [[The Asia Foundation|Asia Foundation]] (a sample is shown in the table below; the survey in 2015 did not contain information on the ethnicity of the participants) and one between 2004 and 2009 by a combined effort of the broadcasting companies [[NBC News]], [[BBC]], and [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]].&lt;ref name="AsiaFoundation"&gt;See:

It is the language resorted to when people of different ethnic groups need to conduct business or otherwise communicate. Pashto is widely used in southern and eastern areas of the country where ethnic Pashtuns are the majority, including by majority of the [[Afghans in Pakistan]]. The [[Afghan National Anthem]] is recited in Pashto.

[[Uzbek language|Uzbeki]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmeni]] are spoken in certain parts of the northern provinces, mainly among the Uzbek and Turkmen tribes. Smaller number of Afghans are also fluent in [[Urdu]], Balochi, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and other languagees.

Almost the entire Afghan population is Muslim, with less than 1% being non-Muslim. Despite attempts to secularize Afghan society, Islamic practices pervade all aspects of life. Likewise, Islamic religious tradition and codes, together with traditional practices, provide the principal means of controlling personal conduct and settling legal disputes. Islam was used as the main basis for expressing opposition to the modernization of Afghanistan by [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]] in the 1920s. It was also used by the [[mujahideen]] during the 1980s [[Soviet–Afghan War]] and by the [[Taliban]] today.

The '''Didinga''' (diDinga) occupy the [[Didinga Mountains]] region in [[Budi County]], [[Eastern Equatoria State]] in [[South Sudan]]. They live in the valleys, on the plateaus and slopes, and on the adjacent plains of the region. Their neighbors include the [[Toposa people|Toposa]], the [[Boya people|Boya]], [[Ketebo people|Ketebo]], Logir, Teuth and [[Dongotona]] peoples - groups with whom the Didinga have had frequent conflicts due to economic pressures.

==Language and history==
{{main|Didinga language}}
The Didinga, Boya, [[Tennet people|Tennet]], [[Murle people|Murle]] and [[Mursi people|Mursi]] of Southwest Ethiopia share a language that distinguishes them from all other groups in the Sudan. Their language, often called the Murle-Didinga language, is also spoken by a group living in southwest Ethiopia. The Didinga claim to have lived in southwest [[Ethiopia]] two hundred years ago. During their migration to the Didinga Hills, the Didinga, Murle, Tennet and Boya were one group. They lived in harmony in Sudan until a hunting-party dispute caused the Murle to leave. Later, a [[famine]] caused the Boya to withdraw. Today, though the groups have separated, their language remains the same. Their most urban town is [[Chukudum]], a historic town that hosted the first Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) National Convention in 1994.

During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983–2005) tensions with the [[Dinka people]] built up after the Dinka-dominated SPLA forces moved into the area in 1985.
They came to a head in 1999 when the Didinga officer [[Peter Lorot]] was passed over for promotion in favor of a [[Dinka people|Dinka]], assassinated his rival and took to the woods with his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The fighting with Lorot's forces displaced about 16,800 people from Chukudum to nearby villages in the highlands. The "Chukudom Crisis" was resolved in August 2002 during a Peace Conference organized  by  the  [[New Sudan Council of Churches]].&lt;ref name=UNIMU2005&gt;{{cite web

An attempt by the SPLA in June 2006 to disarm Lorot's militia was ignored, with the group threatening to start fighting again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Lifestyle==

For many years, the Didinga enjoyed a quiet, rural life. They took great pride in raising [[cattle]] and owned large herds that were supervised by the young single Didinga men. However, in 1963, a political disturbance which lasted until 1973 caused many Didinga to leave their cattle behind and to migrate to [[Uganda]]. While in Uganda, for the first time in their lives, Didinga were exposed to large-scale [[farming]]. Also, their children were introduced to education. These experiences created in the people the desires to make money and to gain knowledge, things which had been unimportant in the Hills.

When they returned to Sudan in 1973, the people were filled with a new vision for a more advanced life. They hoped to incorporate into their own culture many of the ideas and concepts they had learned in Uganda. They were met, however, with a drastic decrease in the numbers in their herds: clansmen who had remained in the Hills had failed to restock the cattle during the disturbance. Today, many Didinga are still working to enlarge their herds. They purchase cattle either through the exchange of grain or beer, or with money.

At present, farming and the desire for an education are as important to the Didinga as the herding of cattle is. The [[traditional values]] associated with raising cattle remain embedded in all Didinga. Many still take great pleasure in owning large herds. Their new-found hope for change that was brought back from their temporary migration also remains instilled in their daily lives.
The Didinga use their cattle not only as a means of wealth, but also for their milk that is consumed daily and made into butter. Didinga also consume fresh blood drawn from the necks of cattle with miniature arrows. The Didinga do not fish at all, because the eating of fish is taboo in their culture.

The Didinga live in scattered homesteads, with each clan grouped together. Homes are round with cone-shaped roofs. During certain seasons and during [[grazing]] periods, the Didinga also live in rustic camps.
An important aspect of Didinga society is the organization of 'Nyekerehet' (age-grades) for boys. Every three to five years, boys who are around eight years old are placed together to form a new "age-grade." These boys work and play together until they are married.

==Beliefs==
Their traditional beliefs and religious practices include having a tribal [[rainmaking|rainmaker]] who is entrusted with performing certain rituals to bring rain. Didinga also worship and sacrifice to spirits and gods and place great importance upon the worship of dead ancestors.

'''Germans''' ({{lang-bg|немци}}, ''nemtsi'' or германци, ''germantsi'') are a minority [[ethnic group]] in '''[[Bulgaria]]''' ({{lang-de|Bulgarien}}).

==Early settlement==
Many Germans passed through Bulgaria during the eastern [[Crusades]], as Bulgaria lies on the direct land route from [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] to the [[Levant]] and the [[Holy Land]]. They were usually met with hostility as they were negatively disposed to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (which ruled Bulgaria at the time of the [[First Crusade|First]] and [[Second Crusade]]s) and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. Crusaders led by the [[Franks|Frankish]] noble [[Renier of Trit]] established the short-lived [[Duchy of Philippopolis]] around what is today [[Plovdiv]], but in 1205 the Latins were routed by [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]], their emperor [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin IX of Flanders]] was captured by the Bulgarians and died in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]. Kaloyan's daughter [[Maria of Bulgaria, Latin Empress|Maria]] was betrothed to the second [[Latin Empire|Latin Emperor]], [[Henry of Flanders]], who she is thought to have poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fine, Jr. | first = John V.A. | year = 1987 | title = The Late Medieval Balkans | publisher = [[University of Michigan]] Press | location = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] | isbn = 0-472-08260-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[ore]] [[miner]]s (called саси, ''sasi'' in Bulgarian) are known to have settled in the ore-rich regions of [[Southeastern Europe]].

==Liberated Bulgaria (post–1878)==
Following the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878 and its restoration as a [[History of Independent Bulgaria|sovereign monarchy]], all four Bulgarian monarchs were of German descent: Prince [[Alexander of Battenberg|Alexander I of Battenberg]], as well as [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]], [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] and [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]], all three of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. German intellectuals, such as architects [[Friedrich Grünanger]] and [[Viktor Rumpelmayer]], arrived in Bulgaria to foster its cultural development.

Until [[World War II]], there also existed a small but notable rural German population in several villages scattered in northern Bulgaria. [[Banat Swabians]] (part of the larger group of the [[Danube Swabians]]) from [[Austria-Hungary]] began to settle in the village of [[Bardarski Geran]], [[Vratsa Province]], beginning with seven families in 1893, with their total number later exceeding 90 families. In 1936, they numbered 282. In Bardarski Geran, the Germans built a separate [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] Roman Catholic church around 1930 due to conflicts with the local [[Banat Bulgarians]], who had founded the village in 1887. In 1932, a German school was established in Bardarski Geran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Банатските българи |last=Нягулов |first=Благовест |year=1999 |location=София |publisher=Парадигма |language=Bulgarian |chapter=Банатските българи в България |isbn=954-9536-13-0 |pages=91, pp. 120–125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its peak year, 1935, it had a total of 82 students, of whom 50 Germans and 32 Bulgarians.&lt;ref name=schulen&gt;{{cite book |title=Geschichte, Entwicklung und Sprachwerbetätigkeit der deutschen Schulen in Bulgarien im Zeitraum 1900–1939 |language=German |url=http://bibserv7.bib.uni-mannheim.de/madoc/volltexte/2006/1209/pdf/Diss_Dokument.pdf |last=Slavtcheva-Raiber |first=Anna |publisher=Universität Mannheim |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Danube Swabian colonists from the Banat settled in another Banat Bulgarian village, [[Gostilya]], [[Pleven Province]], as well as in [[Voyvodovo, Vratsa Province]], which they shared with [[Evangelicalism|Evangelist]] [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]] and Banat Bulgarians. Another notable German colony was [[Tsarev Brod]] (old name Endzhe), [[Shumen Province]], founded before 1899,&lt;ref name=zb&gt;Sorge, ''Die einstige deutsche Kolonie''…&lt;/ref&gt; where the Germans lived with many other nationalities and had a private German school.&lt;ref name=schulen/&gt; In the beginning of the 20th century, it was inhabited by around 70 German families, and consisted of [[Dobrujan Germans]], [[Bessarabia Germans]]&lt;ref name=imirkat&gt;{{cite book |title=Католиците в България (1878-1989). Историческо изследване |last=Елдъров |first=Светлозар |publisher=IMIR |language=Bulgarian |year=2002 |location=София }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Banat Swabians.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, ''Handwörterbuch…''&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of World War II, Germans in Tsarev Brod constituted the bulk of the village's 420 Catholic [[parish]]ioners.&lt;ref name=imirkat/&gt;

A German community was also present in [[Southern Dobruja]], a region before 1913 and since 1940 part of Bulgaria, and particularly in the village of Ali Anife (Kalfa), today [[Dobrevo]], [[Dobrich Province]], which was inhabited by Dobrujan Germans since 1903 and in 1943 still had 150 Catholics. It was briefly named Germantsi (“Germans”) in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Католиците между двете световни войни (1918–1944) |chapter=Глава III. 1. Никополската епархия&amp;nbsp;– консолидация под външен натиск |publisher=IMIR |language=Bulgarian }}&lt;/ref&gt; German sources list its population in 1939 as 285, of whom 129 Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Von der Urheimat und Auswanderung der Deutschen in Bessarabien |year=1938 |last=Stumpp |first=Karl |language=German |publisher=Kurier-Verlag |location=[[Stuttgart]] |oclc= 20272199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those colonists came from [[Kherson]] and [[Crimea]] ''(see [[Crimea Germans]])'' in modern [[Ukraine]]. They built a church described as a "magnificent Catholic place of worship unmatched in the district"; the church was inaugurated on 23 October 1911.&lt;ref name=imirkat/&gt;

Besides rural populations, Germans also settled in Bulgaria's larger cities as part of the group of the so-called "Lower Danubian Levantines", the [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]]ans in the vibrant port and merchant cities of northern Bulgaria, such as [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], [[Varna]], [[Veliko Tarnovo]], [[Svishtov]] and [[Vidin]]. In the 1860s and 70s, the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] citizens in Ruse numbered 200–300.&lt;ref name=imirkat/&gt; The first Bulgarian census in 1883 counted 476 Germans in Ruse alone, making them the fifth-largest ethnic group in that city.&lt;ref name="ohrenzeuge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Angelova|first=Penka|title=Elias Canetti: Der Ohrenzeuge des Jahrhunderts|publisher=Internationale Elias-Canetti-Gesellschaft Rousse|year=2006|chapter=Die Geburtsstadt von Elias Canetti|url=https://www.archives.government.bg/tda/docs/canetti_izlojba_ruse.pdf|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the German population in Bulgaria was resettled within the borders of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] according to Hitler's ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' policy. As a result, 2,150 ethnic German Bulgarian citizens were deported from the country in 1943, including 164 from Bardarski Geran and 33 from Gostilya.&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a handful of Bulgaria's rural German population remained: for example, in 2003 there were only two elderly German women remaining in Bardarski Geran, Maria Dauerbach and Franziska Welsch;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webarchiv-server.de/pin/archiv03/0103ob07.htm |title=Bulgarien: Das etwas andere Dorf.

The '''Hero thrill show''' fundraising event helps ensure that the children of [[Philadelphia]] Police Officers and Firefighters that are killed or severely disabled in the line of duty can receive financial assistance in order to complete their education. 

==History==
Created in 1954 because of an explosion that took the lives of ten firefighters, the Police and Firefighter Thrill Show has assisted over 800 students graduate from various colleges and universities. With the help of these scholarships, there are currently 50 students attending colleges throughout the United States.

The main source of funding is through the sale of tickets and proceeds coming from the annual Hero Thrill Show, which is held in the [[Wachovia Spectrum Complex]]. Throughout the year, the Hero Thrill Show, which is typically held the second weekend in September has included major contributions from local celebrities, sport figures, and police and firefighters.  

On January 20, 2006 the President of  the Hero Scholarship Fund announced that "After carefully comparing revenues over the past several years, including decreases as well as the expense and difficulty in putting on the show, it has been decided to discontinue the show...." *   In April, 2006, James J. Binns, a Philadelphia Lawyer, founded the Hero Thrill Show Inc., which assumed production of the Hero Thrill Show and the administration of funds generated by the Hero Thrill Show.   The Board of Directors is chaired by Mr. Binns and is composed of the Police Commissioner, Fire Commissioner, President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge Number 5, President of the International Association of Firefighters, Local 22 and a number of Philadelphia Business Leaders.

The first show which featured a 15-hour [[rodeo]], raised $78,000 with western movie stars [[Gene Autry]], [[Roy Rogers]], [[Dale Evans]], and [[Tex Ritter]] attending. For decades the Thrill Show was performed at JFK Stadium (originally Municipal Stadium).  When this Philadelphia landmark was torn down, the show moved first to the Civic Center, and then to the Convention Center.  It has returned to its old home and is now performed on the grounds of the stadium complex on Broad Street in South Philadelphia. The past few years has shown a dramatic growth with the event blooming into a vast family affair with tens of thousand of fans enjoying a carnival, car show, concert, and fire works show. In 2006, the event raised $360,000 in scholarship money.

2011, is the 6th anniversary of the Hero Thrill Show under the leadership of the Hero Thrill Show, Inc. The performers and exhibitors are all active Police Officers and Firefighters who continue the tradition that was started in 1954 by risking their lives performing daredevil demonstrations utilizing equipment that is standard issue in the departments.

==Recent attendance==
In 2006, under the leadership of the Hero Thrill Show, Inc., attendance jumped to over 13,000 spectators. Attendance has steadily increased over the past 5 years. 2010 was another banner year with crowds in excess of 50,000 in attendance. Funds generated are being used to defray the cost of college education for the children of police and firefighters that have been killed while on duty.

===2012 Thrill Show===
The 2012 Grand Marshal was [[A. Thomas Schomberg]], the world-renowned sculptor of the "ROCKY" statue that is situated at the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Philadelphia's own Bob Pantano, who hosts the first and longest running radio dance party in the nation on 98.1 [[WOGL]], entertained the crowd with music for the five-hour fundraiser.

The families of police officers Brian Lorenzo, Bradley Fox and Moses Walker and firefighters Daniel Sweeney and Robert Neary will benefit from the 2012 fundraiser.

===2011 Thrill Show===
The 2011 Grand Marshal was '''Gerald Tommaso DeLouise''' better known by his stage name '''[[Burt Young]]'''. An American actor, painter and author, he is best known for his [[Academy Award]]-nominated role as [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s brother-in-law and best friend Paulie in the ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' film series. Philadelphia's own Bob Pantano, who hosts the first and longest running radio dance party in the nation on 98.1, entertained the crowd with music for the five-hour fundraiser.

The 2011 Hero thrill show brought back the Highway Patrol Motorcycle Drill Team, the elite K-9 Unit, the Strike Force Bicycle Stunt Team and the Philadelphia Police &amp; Fire Pipes and Drums. Philly’s famous sports team mascots The [[Phillie Phanatic]], [[Swoop (Philadelphia Eagles)|Swoop]] and [[Hip Hop (mascot)|Hip Hop]] as well as the Sixers Dancers and [[Philadelphia Eagles Cheerleaders|Eagles Cheerleaders]] made special appearances. Guests were to be able to participate or watch the action-packed [[Sonny Hill]] basketball shootout competition as well.

The '''Italian National Institute of Statistics''' (Italian: '''''Istituto Nazionale di Statistica'''''; '''Istat''') is the main producer of official statistics in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.istat.it/en/about-istat |title=About Italian National Institute of Statistics |publisher=Istat |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include the [[census]] of population, economic censuses and a number of social, economic and environmental surveys and analyses. Istat is by far the largest producer of statistical information in Italy, and is an active member of the European Statistical System, coordinated by [[Eurostat]].

Its publications are released under [[creative commons]] "Attribution" (CC BY) license.

==History==
Istat was created in 1926 as "Central Institute of Statistics" (Istituto Centrale di Statistica), to collect and organize essential data about the nation. It took its current denomination with the reform of 1989. This also gave Istat statutory responsibility for the coordination and standardization of official statistics collected or published under the aegis of the national statistical system [[SISTAN]], whose membership includes the statistical offices of ministries, national agencies, [[Regions of Italy|regions]], [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]], [[comune|communes]], chambers of commerce, and similar bodies.
Since 4 August 2009, [[Enrico Giovannini]], former Chief statistician of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), has been the President of the institute.

They were members of the [[National Lawyers Guild]] and its DC chapter.  Forer was an expert in the "Lost Laws" of Washington, DC, enacted in 1872–1873, that outlawed segregation at business places.&lt;ref name=MetroScene&gt;

==Career==

===New Deal===

[[File:1099 14th Street – National Labor Relations Board - sign.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque outside [[1099 14th Street]] NW in Washington, D.C., the [[National Labor Relations Board|NLRB]] HW (2013), whete Forer worked in the 1930s]]

In the 1930s, like his friend David Rein, Forer worked for the [[National Labor Relations Board]] and the [[Office of Price Administration]] during the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref name=Quigley /&gt;

===1940s: NLG vs. HUAC===

In 1946, David Rein joined Joseph Forer as private practice law partners in Washington, DC.  Together, they "represented more than 100 persons who had been termed 'unfriendly' witnesses by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] of the Senate subcommittee headed by the late senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]."&lt;ref name=Rein&gt;

| date = 15 August 1975
| accessdate = 20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As historian Joan Quigley describes:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the late 1940s, while Congress and the executive branch trawled for evidence of disloyalty and subversion, Rein and Forer immersed themselves in difficult and disfavored causes: opposing the [[Mundt-Nixon Bill]]; defending labor unions and alleged Communists; upholding the Bill of Rights.  Rein ... represented [[Gerhard Eisler]] ... As progressives and New Deal veterans, Forer and Rein also nurtured ties to the [[National Lawyers Guild]], which [[HUAC]] had branded a Communist front in 1944.&lt;ref name=Quigley /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Forer was chairman of the District Affairs Committee of the DC chapter of the National Lawyers Guild.&lt;ref name=Caplan&gt;

Historian Maarten Zwiers wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Joe Forer ... was senior partner in Forer and Rein, the Communist Party's leading law firm in the capital.  He had defended people accused of communist sympathies before [[James Eastland|Eastland]]'s [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Internal Security Subcommittee]] on several occasions ...&lt;ref name=Zwiers&gt;

He also refers to him as "the Communist Party's lawyer."&lt;ref name=Zwiers /&gt;

Historian Marvin Caplan wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a staff attorney at a [[HUAC]] hearing asked Joe Forer how many times he had appeared before the committee, Forer couldn't remember.  Too many times, he said, to be able to give an exact figure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Attorney [[Victor Rabinowitz]] recalled in his memoir that Forer's circle of communist-supportive lawyers stretched to New York City (headquarters of the National Lawyers Guild).  They included [[Harry Sacher]], [[Abraham Unger|Abe Unger]], David Freeman, David Rein, and Rabinowitz himself, "all lawyers active in the representation of witnesses before congressional committees."  He explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger and Freeman were attorneys for the (Communist) Party; Sacher had been lead defense in the prosecution of Communist party leaders under the Smith Act; I was a member of the Party and the others were close to it if not members.  We certainly weren't making Party policy, but our views would have some influence on the Party and its members.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz&gt;

In 1948, [[Lee Pressman]] joined Forer in representing [[Gerhard Eisler]] and four others (Irving Potash, vice president of the [[International Fur &amp; Leather Workers Union|Fur and Leather Workers Union]]; [[Ferdinand Smith|Ferdinand C. Smith]], secretary of the [[National Maritime Union]]; Charles A. Doyle of the [[Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union|Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union]], and John Williamson, labor secretary of the [[CPUSA]]).  On May 5, 1946, Pressman and Forer received a preliminary injunction so their defendants might have hearings with examiners unconnected with the investigations and prosecutions by examiners of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Lost Laws and ''DC v. John R. Thompson Co.''===

====Mary Church Terrell====

[[File:Mary Church Terrell - NARA - 559207.tif|thumb|right|150px|Painting of [[Mary Church Terrell]] by [[Betsy Graves Reyneau]], 1888–1964]]

In May 1949, Dr. [[Mary Church Terrell]] decided to take on the issue of desegregation head-on.  She consulted Forer.  Forer led the [[National Lawyer Guild]]'s DC chapter in submitting an opinion in their favor. With such advice, Dr. Terrell and colleagues [[Clark F. King]], [[Essie Thompson]], and [[Arthur F. Elmer]] entered the segregated Thompson's Restaurant, next door to the offices of Forer and Rein's office on 14th Street, NW, in Washington, DC, between H Street and New York Avenue and across the street from the [[Trans-Lux Theatre]]. When refused service, Terrell &amp; Co. sued.

Attorney Ringgold Hart, representing Thompson, argued on April 1, 1950, that District laws were unconstitutional.

Regardless, Forer's research found that the [[U.S. Congress]] had jurisdiction over DC and so could overrule segregation; [[Charles H. Houston]], dean of [[Howard University]] Law School concurred.

====District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co.====

[[File:Oblique facade 2, US Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supreme Court of the United States]].]]

The case ''[[District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co.]]'' reached the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].  Forer and Rein argued the case.  On June 8, 1953, the court ruled that segregated eating places in Washington, DC, were unconstitutional.

The ''Washington Post'' recounted in 1985, "Four days after the Supreme Court ruled, Mary Terrell and the three other original complainants went back to Thompson's. Joe Forer followed them in.  As he recalls the moment, the manager, himself, came over and personally, even obsequiously, carried Mary Terrell's tray to the table."&lt;ref name=Caplan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Other cases===

Forer and Rein served the rights of striking workers, foreign-born aliens (with leftist leanings, e.g., [[Gerhard Eisler]]), and servicemen. They won for the [[National Council for American-Soviet Friendship]] the right to contest in court its designation by the attorney general as a "subversive organization."  They also represented members of the press on strike against the ''Washington Post'' in 1975.&lt;ref name=Rein /&gt;

In 1960–1961, Forer and [[John Abt]] represented the [[CPUSA]] in ''Communist Party of the United States vs. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U.S. 1 (1961).''&lt;ref&gt;

===FBI target===

In 1977, a release of internal memos of the [[FBI]] revealed, according to the ''Washington Post'', that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An Oct. 4, 1951 memo to Hoover said that a search of trash at the Washington offices of [[National Lawyers Guild|guild]] lawyers Joseph Forer and David Rein had uncovered a draft resolution urging President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] to authorize a citizens' investigation of the FBI because of its alleged excesses in loyalty checks.&lt;ref&gt;

===Retirement===

Forer retired from practice with Rein in July 1978.&lt;ref name=Rein /&gt;

==Personal and death==

Forer's daughter, [[Jane F. Gentleman]], is a notable statistician.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?n=florence-forer&amp;pid=3346353|title=Florence Forer|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 29, 2005|department=Paid death notices|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.soph.uab.edu/awards/norwoodaward/firstaward|title=First Annual Janet L.

[[Lifestyle (sociology)|Lifestyle]] changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of [[media (communication)|media]]. Media – [[film]]s, [[television show]]s, [[magazine]]s, and more recently, the [[Internet]] (i.e. [[Blogs|self-written blogs]] and popular [[website]]s) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world. Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate. [[Celebrity endorsements]] are prevalent. Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the [[wealth]]y and [[celebrity|famous]], whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement.  At the dawn of the media age, the newspaper, popular magazines like ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination.  After its creation, the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends, not just by celebrities but by the average person. The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news, perspectives and communication. Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a [[web address]] where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide. The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible. The rise of [[user-generated content]] is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an [[online journal]], whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film.  With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared. Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of [[word-of-mouth]] and have tapped into [[social media]], including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Tumblr]] to make their wares known. [[Douglas Kellner]] writes, "Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of "us" and "them.""&lt;ref name=Kellner&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellner|first=Douglas|title=CULTURAL STUDIES, MULTICULTURALISM, AND MEDIA CULTURE|url=http://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/papers/SAGEcs.htm|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity-endorsed beauty and health products==
Media affects how people diet. Commercials advertise special [[diet pill|pill]]s, [[Juice fasting|juice fasts]], [[raw diet]]s, and all-soy diets. Celebrities [[Celebrity endorsement|endorse]] food products and diets that promise dramatic results in little time. Audiences are impressionable depending on their age range. [[Salma Hayek]], who has been using juice cleanses for 15 years promises health with her own line, Cooler Cleanse. [[Jennifer Aniston]] is famous for her [[yoga]]-body and has revealed her secret, which the public has taken as a big health influence. So Feminine provides health and lifestyle advice taken from celebrities and their personal assistants/trainers. Reality star [[Kim Kardashian]] endorsed QuickTrim, a [[Weight loss drug|weight-loss product]] designed to get rid of unwanted weight. Recent news articles claim that the product is unhealthy, and Kardashian is facing a lawsuit for her endorsement. Along with cleanses are celebrity [[beauty products]]. Salma Hayek has a [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]]-exclusive line of hair care and cosmetic products, called Nuance. Admirers of Hayek who covet her beauty have hope that her products will make them look appealing. Websites such as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and Celebrity Beauty Buzz list favorite skincare and makeup products of celebrities so readers can purchase the same products in hopes of achieving similar results. Health articles note that the meticulous science process is often forgotten in favor of the newer-is-better trend taking over mass media. Harvard School of Public Health states, "With [media reports'] emphasis on short, "newsworthy" pieces, the media often only report the results of single studies, and many stories are chosen simply because the results run contrary to current health recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard School of Public Health|title=The Nutrition Source: Deciphering Media Stories on Diet|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/nutrition-news/media/|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular magazines and websites often focus on what's new in the world of celebrity health and beauty routines and forgo substantial research in order to bring to the masses what the public are truly interested in; quick, easy-way-out health fixes such as these juice cleanses and detox diets.

Celebrity endorsements are effective due to their high profile presence in the media. Their [[physical attractiveness]] is central to their ability to sell products to an impressionable audience. Celebrities are also effective because they are what many people aspire to be or look like. Celebrities act as symbols of personal desire. "In an attempt to communicate the merits of their product or brand," says Michael A. Kamins, Ph.D., New York University, "advertisers have often chosen to use endorsement as a promotional strategy." Additionally, "the use of celebrity spokespeople has always been a favorite strategy among agencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamins|first=Michael, A.|title=An Investigation into the "Match-Up" Hypothesis in Celebrity Advertising: When Beauty May be Only Skin Deep|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=19|issue=1|pages=4–13|year=1990|jstor=10.2307/4188750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamins informs that advertisers are well aware of how easily celebrities influence consumer habits; it is the combination of their physical appeal and their high status that draws in the public. He explains, "Indeed, a considerable amount of research exists both in the social sciences and in marketing supporting a strategy by showing that a physically attractive source facilitates attitude change toward issues, products, and ad-based evaluations."

Research suggests that there is a link between the product itself and the image of the celebrity. The celebrity, in this case, indeed acts as a symbol of the product. The physical attractiveness of the celebrity endorser improves the appearance of the product, or rather, the advertisement. In simpler terms, it makes a bigger impact on the audience if "the characteristics of the product 'match-up' with the image conveyed by the celebrity," as suggested by Kamins' research. He continues, "This 'match-up' hypothesis suggests that the visual imagery contained in the ad conveys information over and above that contained in explicit verbal arguments." A journal notes that the match up hypothesis "specifies that perceivers distinguish multiple types of good looks, and that in advertising, certain beauty ideals are more appropriately paired with specific products than with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solomon|first=Michael, R. |author2=Richard D. Ashmore |author3=Laura C. Longo|title=The Beauty Match-up Hypothesis: Congruence between Types of Beauty and Product Images in Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=December 1992|volume=XXI|issue=4|pages=23–24|jstor=10.2307/4188855|doi=10.1080/00913367.1992.10673383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another journal further explains, "In the match-up hypothesis, the message conveyed by the image of the celebrity and the message about the product ought to converge in effective advertisements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahle|first=Lynn R.|author2=Pamela M. Homer |title=Physical Attractiveness of the Celebrity Endorser: A Social Adaptation Perspective|journal=Journal of Consumer Research |date=March 1985|volume=11|issue=4|pages=954–961|jstor=2489220|doi=10.1086/209029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, research also notes that physical attractiveness is the key detail when analyzing [[consumer behavior]]. If a celebrity is less than attractive according to society's standards, the advertising campaign may potentially be less effective. Still, advertisements starring celebrities are generally effective due to their popularity and presence in media.

There are times when physical attractiveness of the celebrity is not relevant, and that is when the product showcased in the advertisement does not claim to enhance the consumer's appearance. Under this circumstance, the "match-up" hypothesis does not apply because the product is not particularly attractive. Attractive products include luxurious sports cars, designer clothing, anti-aging products, beauty products (i.e. foundation that smooths fine lines, blemishes, pigmentation, and promises a flawless canvas onto which the rest of a woman's makeup may be applied), hair care (i.e. shampoos, conditioners, and shine-enhancing serums that boast rare ingredients and professional results), modern-day technology products such as everything Apple produces (iPhone, Mac computers) and the brands that strive to mimic these products' sleek appearances, etc. "Unattractive" products include toilet paper, household cleaning items, groceries and food, personal hygiene products, music, movies, etc. Though, it can be debated that music and movies do not depend on the attractiveness of its performers; attractiveness vs. talent in the respected fields depends on many factors regarding the consumers, such as age and gender.

B. Zafer Erdogan says, "Because of their fame, celebrities serve not only to create and maintain attention, but also to achieve high recall rates for marcoms messages (marketing communication) in today's highly cluttered environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erdogan|first=B. Zafer|title=Celebrity Endorsement: A Literature Review|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|year=1999|volume=15|issue=4|pages=291–314|doi=10.1362/026725799784870379|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1362/026725799784870379#preview|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This serves as proof that advertising agencies use celebrities to cut through the clutter that is [[mass media]]. Having celebrities in their advertising campaigns helps them promote their products in the sense that notable figures are what gets the attention of the public, rather than the product itself.

==The beauty ideal and plastic surgery==
Among the many [[beauty product|beauty]] and health products advertised and media showcasing celebrity beauty as the most desired beauty, is the frustration that comes with consumers using these products and not achieving the results they want. In a psychological study which aimed to examine the correlation of the acceptance of cosmetic surgery and prevalence of celebrity influence, researchers found that there was an extremely significant association between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swami|first=Viren, et all|title=Acceptance of cosmetic surgery and celebrity worship: Evidence of associations among female undergraduates|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=47|issue=8|year=2009|pages=869–872|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909003134|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Celebrity worship]]" is when a person has formed a strong adoration towards a celebrity and sees him or her as a role model. The study shows that this worship is considered a normal aspect of [[self-identity]] as it is usually formed as the identity is being developed. Worship of the celebrity may give people a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment. The study mentions that "'entertainment-social' celebrity worship reflects the social aspects of parasocial attachment, and is driven by an attraction to a favourite celebrity because of their perceived ability to entertain. For some individuals, a compromised identity structure may lead to psychological absorption (intensive and compulsive feelings) with a celebrity, or what has been termed 'Intense-personal' attitudes. In extreme cases, this absorption may become addictive, leading to 'Borderline-pathological' attitudes and behaviours that serve to maintain an individual's satisfaction with the parasocial attachment."

Additionally, this concept of celebrity worship may be used as symbols exemplary of the person's physical ideal. That is, they believe that their physical attractiveness will bring them thinks equal to or similar to the celebrity's level of popularity and exterior happiness. To them, physical attractiveness will bring that happiness, and cosmetic surgery can help them attain this. The study explains that "celebrities may represent prominent and unique social comparison targets, whose physical attractiveness and condition provide information about socially-idealised standards of beauty."

Notably, celebrity worship makes people more prone to [[mental health]] problems such as high levels of [[neuroticism]], [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and an overall strong sense of worry. Being fixated on how a celebrity looks can increase anxiety because it causes the person to constantly compare themselves to them, thus creating unnecessary worry and high maintenance of their appearance, and eventually depression due to the fact that they cannot look like or be their [[role model]]. These people are likely to seek procedures such as plastic surgery in order to become exaggerated versions of themselves in hopes of becoming as physically appealing as their celebrity role model, and hopefully happier as a result. They consider [[plastic surgery]] a cure, or a fix, for their unhappiness. Therefore, they see it as acceptable.

==The effect of blogs and Internet==
Style blogs showcase slender young women posing in the latest fashions. Young girls see these and want to emulate their style. The Thin Ideal comes into play. [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s popular lifestyle blog/website Goop is geared towards parents, specifically women. She provides spirituality articles, family meal recipes, glimpses into her Hollywood life, and child-raising tips. Women and mothers read her blog and are consumed by the glamorous appeal. Paltrow advises wardrobe changes every season and provides essential-clothing suggestions that are far out of reach for the average women. [[Nylon Magazine]] is a colorful [[fashion magazine]] for [[pre-teens]] and teenagers who aim to live fashionably. The magazine dispenses beauty advice for how you can look like your favorite television star and promotes expression of style. Its influence is prevalent in the [[blogosphere]]. Young women with blogs take photos of themselves in their daily outfits. They often cite Nylon, among other sources, as one of their influences. Kellner states, "Media images help shape our view of the world and our deepest values: what we consider good or bad, positive or negative, moral or evil. Media stories provide the symbols, myths, and resources through which we constitute a common culture and through the appropriation of which we insert ourselves into this culture."&lt;ref name=Kellner/&gt; Fashion and beauty blogs focus on the values of looking a certain way, or what society deems as "stylish." These websites bring together people with the same goals – i.e. looking good – and cultivate a culture in which the beauty myth is prevalent.

In addition to blogs, social networking cites such as Facebook play a role in media influence. Many celebrities and clothing stores have Facebook profiles in which fans subscribe to receive a constant stream of news from these pages on their Facebook news feeds. Celebrities promote their latest films, television appearance, favorite charities, self-endorsed items, and those who are subscribed to them remain in-the-know and are kept up to date of their glamorous, high-profile words. Clothing stores update their pages with photos of their seasonal collections, showcasing attractive young models dressed in their fashions, thus creating images of desire in their impressionable audiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32811">{{Legality of cannabis by US state}}
In '''2018''', [[U.S. state]]s proposed or are expected to propose '''cannabis reform legislation''' for [[medical marijuana]] and non-medical adult use. State-level legalization remains at odds with cannabis' status as a [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I narcotic]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] at the Federal level, and the [[Cannabis policy of the Donald Trump administration]] appeared to become more hostile than that of the previous administration, with the early January rescission of the [[Cole Memorandum]].

States expected to be most likely to propose legislation to fully legalize include Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.&lt;ref name=Lee2018&gt;{{citation|title=Vermont, New Jersey, Michigan?

==Federal==
In the House of Representatives, Democratic Representatives [[Barbara Lee]] of California and  Representative [[Ro Khanna]], of the same state, introduced the Marijuana Justice Act, the counterpart of a Senate Bill 1689 which was introduced in 2017 by Senator [[Cory Booker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=In rebuff to Sessions, federal Marijuana Justice Act filed in House: This is not just any marijuana legalization bill|author=Phillip Smith|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=January 19, 2018|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/01/19/in-rebuff-to-sessions-federal-marijuana-justice-act-filed-in-house/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Marijuana Justice Act of 2017|work=Harvard Law Review|date=January 10, 2018|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2018/01/marijuana-justice-act-of-2017/}} 131 Harv.

A bipartisan bill, the Sensible Enforcement Of Cannabis Act, was introduced in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|title=Bipartisan bill offered in House to protect marijuana users in legal weed states|author=Lydia Wheeler|date=February 15, 2018 |url=http://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/374130-bipartisan-bill-offered-in-house-to-protect-marijuana-users-in-legal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March, Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] announced he would introduce the [[Hemp Farming Act of 2018]]. It would expand the experimental hemp production allowed under the 2014 farm bill, removing hemp from [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I controlled substances]] and making it an ordinary agricultural commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=McConnell announces hemp legislation with Ky.

==State==
In summary, Vermont passed legislation legalizing cannabis statewide in January, the first time legalization occurred via legislature, not initiative. Utah legalized medical cannabis without THC restrictions for some patients in March. Industrial hemp laws were passed in Alaska, Kansas and Oklahoma in April, and a New Mexico Supreme Court decision ordered the [[promulgation]] of a 2017 hemp bill. Oklahoma legalized medical cannabis in June.

===Alaska===
Senate Bill 6, allowing industrial hemp farming, was passed unanimously by both chambers of the state legislature, with passage in the House occurring on February 19, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Alaska Legislature passes bill to legalize industrial hemp|author=Casey Grove|publisher=Alaska Public Media|date=February 21, 2018|url=https://www.alaskapublic.org/2018/02/21/alaska-legislature-passes-bill-to-legalize-industrial-hemp/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=AK House unanimously pass bill to legalize industrial hemp|publisher=[[KTVA]]|date=February 19, 2018|url=http://www.ktva.com/story/37541525/ak-house-unanimously-pass-bill-to-legalize-industrial-hemp}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law by the governor on April 13.&lt;ref&gt;https://legiscan.com/AK/bill/SB6/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona===
An initiative to legalize hemp, defined as cannabis with less than 0.4% THC, was listed by the Secretary of State as a potential November, 2018 ballot measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=2018 Initiatives, Referendums &amp; Recalls|publisher=Arizona Secretary of State|accessdate=2018-04-26|url=http://apps.azsos.gov/election/2018/general/initiatives.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Arizona Industrial Hemp Initiative (2018)|publisher=Ballotpedia|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Industrial_Hemp_Initiative_(2018)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado===
House Bill 1295 passed both houses of the state legislature, unanimously in the Senate, by April. It would "regulate hemp like any other food ingredient". A provision of the bill prohibits pharmaceutical companies from "interfering" with distribution or sale of naturally occurring (CBD-containing) hemp products.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pass the hemp: Colorado prepares to regulate the plant like any other food ingredient|author=Alicia Wallace|date=April 25, 2018|work=The Cannabist|publisher=''The Denver Post''|url=https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/04/25/colorado-hemp-food-ingredient-bill/104230/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connecticut===
In April, HB 5394, a bill to "require multiple state agencies to coordinate and develop a plan to legalize and regulate cannabis sales by October 1" was referred from the Appropriations Committee to the state General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=Merry Jane|title=Connecticut Legislative Committee Advances Recreational Cannabis Bill|date=April 8, 2018|author=Chris Moore|url=https://merryjane.com/news/connecticut-legislative-committee-advances-recreational-cannabis-bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Connecticut lawmakers advance marijuana legalization bill|author=JACQUELINE THOMSEN |work=[[TheHill]]|date=April 5, 2018|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/381865-connecticut-lawmakers-to-vote-on-marijuana-legalization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that document, three paragraphs were dedicated to egalitarianism of all forms, of which, one was concentrated entirely upon racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/uploadedfiles/%7B49743C45-C509-4DF0-A51C-2785B45916AB%7D_singapore.pdf |title=The Declaration of Commonwealth Principles, 1971 |accessdate=2007-07-24 |date=22 January 1971 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The impending collapse of the breakaway government of [[Rhodesia]] (then styled as '[[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]]' under the [[Internal Settlement]]) was seen as demanding a restatement of the Commonwealth's principles of racial equality, and so the Lusaka Declaration was made to further expound and clarify the Heads of Governments' position.

The first article of the declaration demanded [[Egalitarianism|legal equality]] 'without any distinction or exclusion based on race, colour, sex, descent, or national or ethnic origin'.&lt;ref name="Lusaka Declaration text"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/35776/lusaka.htm |title=Lusaka Declaration on Racism and Racial Prejudice |accessdate=2007-07-24 |date=7 August 1979 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930123038/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/35776/lusaka.htm |archivedate=30 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It later stated that no degree of respect for separate cultures could justify racial discrimination,&lt;ref name="Lusaka Declaration text" /&gt; and that the 'infamous policy' of [[Apartheid]] was an 'affront to humanity', and that it was the duty of the Commonwealth to effect its 'total eradication'.&lt;ref name="Lusaka Declaration text" /&gt;  To compensate for the effects of past [[colonialism]] and racism, it was agreed that special provisions may be made to achieve social and economic redress,&lt;ref name="Lusaka Declaration text"/&gt;  paving the way for [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform]] in [[Zimbabwe]].  In addition to demanding respect and equality for indigenous peoples, the Lusaka Declaration also demanded equal respect for immigrant communities.&lt;ref name="Lusaka Declaration text" /&gt;

The declaration was accompanied by the CHOGM's general [[communiqué]], which explicitly iterated these principles with regards to Zimbabwe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 1980 |title=The Lusaka Communique, Commonwealth Heads of Government, August 1979, on Rhodesia |journal=African Affairs |volume=79 |issue=314 |page=115 |jstor=721635}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which led to the invitation of [[Abel Muzorewa]] to take part in the [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House Conference]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2924">The '''Maale people''', (also spelled Male and pronounced Maa-lee), are a small ethnic group of approximately 95,000 located in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]] at the border between north and south Omo of [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Aswegen, Jacobus. 2008.

The Maale people are maintaining [[Maale language|their language]] vigorously, despite exposure to outside pressures and languages.&lt;ref&gt;Aswegen, Kobus van. 2008. The maintenance of Maale in Ethiopia. ''Language Matters : Studies in the Languages of Africa'' 39(1): 29-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

Many of the practices related to the women of the Maale have been documented by Thubauville (2010), including the differences between traditional and contemporary practices.

They have a gender role called ''ashtime''. There are opposing scholarly interpretations of the role and significance of this. Epprecht believes that they are [[gender assignment|male assigned at birth]] individuals who behave as women and also have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;Epprecht, Marc. Heterosexual Africa?: The History of an Idea from the Age of Exploration to the Age of AIDS, p.61-62. Ohio University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; But he admits that the description by Donham (who had actually lived and worked among the Maale), is quite different, that the duty of an ''ashtime'' was to allow the king to have sex "protected from even the merest whiff of female sexuality at key moments in the ritual life of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;p. 196. Epprecht, Marc. 2006. “Bisexuality” and the politics of normal in African ethnography. ''Anthropologica'' 48: 187-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manchu''' (Manchu: {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ&lt;br&gt;ᡤᡳᠰᡠᠨ}} ''manju gisun'') is a critically [[endangered language|endangered]] [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language spoken in [[Manchuria]]; it was the native language of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s and one of the official languages of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1911) of China. Most Manchus now speak [[Mandarin Chinese]]. According to data from [[UNESCO]], there are 10 native speakers of Manchu out of a total of nearly 10 million ethnic Manchus. However, recently, many Manchu have started to learn the language{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. Now, several thousand can speak Manchu as a second language through governmental primary education or free classes for adults in classrooms or online.&lt;ref name="takungpao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chinanews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ifeng"/&gt;

The Manchu language enjoys high historical value for historians of China, especially for the Qing dynasty. Manchu-language texts supply information that is unavailable in Chinese, and when both Manchu and Chinese versions of a given text exist they provide controls for understanding the Chinese.{{sfnb|Fletcher|1973|p=141}}

Like most Siberian languages, Manchu is an [[agglutinative language]] that demonstrates limited [[vowel harmony]]. It has been demonstrated that it is derived mainly from the [[Jurchen language]] though there are many [[loan word]]s from Mongolian and Chinese.  Its script is vertically written and taken from the [[Mongolian alphabet]] (which in turn derives from [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] via [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur]] and [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]]).&lt;!-- Manchu, like Hindi, Russian, etc. employs [[grammatical gender]] through the use of vowel inflections.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}--&gt; Although Manchu does not have the kind of [[grammatical gender]] that many [[Indo-European languages]] do, some gendered words in Manchu are distinguished by different stem vowels, as in ''ama'' "father" vs. ''eme'' "mother".

==Writing system==
The Manchu language uses the [[Manchu alphabet|Manchu script]], which was derived from the traditional [[Mongolian writing systems|Mongol script]], which in turn was based on the vertically written pre-Islamic [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur script]]. Manchu is usually [[Romanization|romanized]] according to the system devised by [[Paul Georg von Möllendorff]] in his Manchu grammar. Its ancestor, [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]], used the [[Jurchen script]], which is derived from the [[Khitan script]], which in turn was derived from [[Chinese characters]]. There is no relation between the [[Jurchen script]] and the [[Manchu alphabet|Manchu script]].

Chinese Characters can also be used to [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transliterate Manchu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All the Manchu vowels and the syllables commencing with a consonant are represented by single Chinese characters as are also the syllables terminating in ''i, n, ng'', and ''o''; but those ending in ''r, k, s, t, p, I, m'' are expressed by the union of the sounds of two characters, there being no Mandarin syllables terminating with these consonants. Thus the Manchu syllable ''am'' is expressed by the Chinese characters ''a-muh'' (8084, 7800) ({{lang|zh|阿木}} ''a mù''), and the word ''Manchu'' is, in the [[Kangxi Dictionary|imperial Manchu dictionary]], spelled in the following manner: ''Ma'' (7467) ''-a'' (8084) ''gan'' (2834) ({{lang|zh|瑪阿安}} ''mǎ ā ān'') —Man; ''—choo'' (1303) ''a'' (11767) ({{lang|zh|諸烏}} ''zhū wū'') ''chu''; —Manchu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Teaching==
Mongols learned their script as a syllabary, dividing the syllables into twelve different classes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation of the Ts'ing wan k'e mung, a Chinese Grammar of the Manchu Tartar Language; with introductory notes on Manchu Literature: (translated by A.

Today, the opinion on whether it is alphabet or syllabic in nature is still split between different experts. In China, it is considered syllabic and Manchu is still taught in this manner. The alphabetic approach is used mainly by foreigners who want to learn the language. Studying Manchu script as a syllabary takes a longer time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Despite the alphabetic nature of its script, Manchu was not taught phoneme by phoneme per letter like western languages are; Manchu children were taught to memorize all the syllables in the Manchu language separately as they learned to write, like Chinese characters. Manchus when learning, instead of saying I, a---la; I, o---lo; &amp;c., were taught at once to say la, lo, &amp;c. Many more syllables than are contained in their syllabary might have been formed with their letters, but they were not accustomed to arrange them otherwise. They made, for instance, no such use of the consonants I, m, n, and r, as westerners do; hence if the Manchu letters s, m, a, r, t, are joined in that order a Manchu would not able to pronounce them as English speaking people pronounce the word smart.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zppFAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Meadows 1849], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The Qing dynasty referred to the Manchu language in various Chinese titles such as "Qingwen" 清文,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q6JBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Saarela 2014], p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Qingyu" 清語 ("Qing language") and [[Standard Chinese|Guoyu]] 國語 ("national language"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EtNVMUx9qIIC&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Elliot 2006], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; which was used by previous non-Han dynasties to refer to their languages.  The "national" was also applied to the Manchu writing as in Guowen 國文 in addition to Guoyu 國語.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QiM2pF5PDR8C&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rhoads 2000], p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Manchu language version of the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], the term "Chinese language" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to all three Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, not just one language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=12 |url=http://mcx.sagepub.com/content/32/1/3.abstract |archivedate=25 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf |jstor=20062627 |doi=10.1177/0097700405282349 |title=Reinventing China: Imperial Qing Ideology and the Rise of Modern Chinese National Identity in the Early Twentieth Century |last1=Zhao |first1=Gang |last2= |first2= |volume=32 |number=Number 1 |date=January 2006 |website= |publisher=Sage Publications |deadurl=yes |accessdate=23 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guoyu now refers to [[Standard Chinese]].

==History and significance==

While Northern Tungus languages like [[Evenki language|Evenki]] retain traditional structure, the Chinese language is a source of major influence upon Manchu, which is southern Tungusic, altering its form and vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Ramsey1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Robert Ramsey|title=The Languages of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E_5nR0SoXoC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01468-X|pages=213–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1635 [[Hong Taiji]] renamed the [[Jurchen people]] and [[Jurchen language]] as "Manchu".

Manchu began as a primary language of the [[Qing dynasty]] Imperial court, but as Manchu officials became increasingly sinicized, many started losing the language. Trying to preserve the Manchu identity, the imperial government instituted Manchu language classes and examinations for the [[Eight Banners|bannermen]], offering rewards to those who excelled in the language. Chinese classics and fiction were translated into Manchu, and a body of [[Manchu literature]] accumulated. {{sfnb|von Möllendorff|1890}} As the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] (reigned 1722–1735) explained, "If some special encouragement … is not offered, the ancestral language will not be passed on and learned."&lt;ref name=rhoads&gt;Edward J. M. Rhoads, ''Manchus &amp; Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861–1928.'' University of Washington Press, 2000. Pages 52–54. {{ISBN|0-295-98040-0}}. Partially available [https://books.google.com/books?id=QiM2pF5PDR8C on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the use of the language among the bannermen was in decline throughout the 1700s.  Historical records report that as early as 1776, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] was shocked to see a high Manchu official, Guo'ermin, not understand what the emperor was telling him in Manchu, despite coming from the Manchu stronghold of Shengjing (now [[Shenyang]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yu Hsiao-jung, [http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/colloque/diaporamas/yu2.pdf Manchu Rule over China and the Attrition of the Manchu Language] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619102136/http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/colloque/diaporamas/yu2.pdf |date=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 19th century even the imperial court had lost fluency in the language. The [[Jiaqing Emperor]] (reigned 1796 to 1820) complained about his officials being good neither at understanding nor writing Manchu.&lt;ref name=rhoads/&gt;

By the end of the 19th century the language was so moribund that even at the office of the Shengjing (Shenyang) general, the only documents written in Manchu (rather than Chinese) would be the memorials wishing the emperor long life; at the same time period, the archives of the [[Hulan District|Hulan]] banner detachment in Heilongjiang show that only 1% of the bannermen could read Manchu, and no more than 0.2% could speak it.&lt;ref name=rhoads/&gt; Nonetheless, as late as 1906–1907 Qing education and military officials insisted that schools teach Manchu language, and that the officials testing soldiers' [[marksmanship]] continue to conduct an oral examination in Manchu.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads (2000), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the language for the official documents declined throughout the Qing history as well.
Especially at the beginning of the dynasty, some documents on sensitive political and military issues were submitted in Manchu but not in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/17/world/asia/18manchu_side.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Manchu Language Lives Mostly in Archives], by David Lague. The [[New York Times]], March 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, some Imperial records in Manchu continued to be produced until the last years of the dynasty,&lt;ref name=rhoads/&gt; which was overthrown in 1912.
A large number of Manchu documents remain in the archives, important for the study of Qing-era China.  Today, written Manchu can still be seen on architecture inside the [[Forbidden City]], whose historical signs are written in both [[Chinese character|Chinese]] and Manchu.

A [[Jiangsu]] Han Chinese called Shen Qiliang wrote books on Manchu grammar like 清書指南 (Manju bithe jy nan) and 大清全書 (Daicing gurun-i yooni bithe). He was born to a father who was a naval officer for the Qing and his grandfather was an official of the Ming dynasty, before rebels murdered him. Shen Qiliang himself fought against the Three Feudatories as part of the Qing army. He then started learning Manchu and writing books on Manchu grammar from Bordered Yellow Manchu Bannermen in 1677 after relocating to Beijing. He translated the Hundred Family Names and Thousand Character Classic into Manchu and spent 25 years on the Manchu language. Shen wrote: "I am a Han. But all my life I have made a hobby of Manchu." Shen never had to learn Manchu as part of his job because he was never an official so he seems to have studied it of his own will. Most Han people were not interested in learning non-Han languages so it is not known why Shen was doing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adolphson  |first=Mikael S. |editor-last=Hanan  |editor-first=Patrick |date=2003 |title=Treasures of the Yenching: Seventy-fifth Anniversity of the Harvard-Yenching Library : Exhibition Catalogue |issue=Issue 1 of Harvard-Yenching Library studies |volume=Volume 1 of Harvard-Yenching Library studies: Harvard Yenching Library |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OksPvlsQOZEC&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Chinese University Press |page=84 |isbn=9629961024 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Han Chinese at the [[Hanlin Academy]] studied the Manchu language in the Qing.

The [[Qianlong Emperor]] commissioned projects such as new Manchu dictionaries, both monolingual and multilingual like the [[Pentaglot Dictionary|Pentaglot]]. Among his directives were to eliminate directly borrowed loanwords from Chinese and replace them with [[calque]] translations which were put into new Manchu dictionaries. This showed in the titles of Manchu translations of Chinese works during his reign which were direct translations contrasted with Manchu books translated during the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s reign which were Manchu transliterations of the Chinese characters.

The Pentaglot was based on the ''Yuzhi Siti Qing Wenjian'' 御製四體清文鑑 ("Imperially-Published Four-Script Textual Mirror of Qing"), with Uyghur added as fifth language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Lexicography : A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911: A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911|issue=|first1=Heming|last1=Yong|first2=Jing|last2=Peng|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYFBtTUZFxEC&amp;pg=PA398#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=398|isbn=0191561673|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four language version of the dictionary with Tibetan was in turn based on an earlier three language version with Manchu, Mongolian, and Chinese called the 御製滿珠蒙古漢字三合切音清文鑑 ("Imperially-Published Manchu Mongol Chinese Three pronunciation explanation mirror of Qing"), which was in turn based on the 御製增訂清文鑑 ("Imperially-Published Revised and Enlarged mirror of Qing") in Manchu and Chinese, which used both Manchu script to transcribe Chinese words and [[Transcription into Chinese characters|Chinese characters to transcribe]] Manchu words with [[fanqie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Lexicography : A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911: A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911|issue=|first1=Heming|last1=Yong|first2=Jing|last2=Peng|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYFBtTUZFxEC&amp;pg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=397|isbn=0191561673|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European scholarship===
A number of European scholars in the 18th century, frustrated by the difficulties in reading Chinese, with its [[Hanzi|complicated writing system]] and the [[Classical Chinese|classical]] writing style, considered Manchu translations, or parallel Manchu versions, of many Chinese documents and literary works as a great help to understanding them. Among them was [[Joseph-Anna-Marie de Moyriac de Mailla|de Moyriac de Mailla]] (1669–1748), who benefited from the existence of the parallel Manchu text when translating the historical compendium ''Tongjian Gangmu'' (''Tung-chien Kang-mu''; [[:zh:资治通鉴纲目|《通鑒綱目》]]); [[Jean Joseph Marie Amiot|Amiot]] (1718–1793) consulted Manchu translations of Chinese works as well, and wrote that the Manchu language "would open an easy entrance to penetrate … into the labyrinth of Chinese literature of all ages."&lt;ref name=repo1844&gt;Anonymous, "Considerations on the language of communication between the Chinese and European governments", in ''The Chinese Repository'', vol XIII, June 1844, no. 6, pp. 281–300.

[[File:Kangxi-Lugou-rebuilding-stele-text-fragment-3582.jpg|thumb|The [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s stele near [[Lugou Bridge]], with parallel Chinese and Manchu text]]
Study of the Manchu language by Russian sinologists started in the early 18th century, soon after founding of the [[Chinese Orthodox Church#Russian Mission|Russian Orthodox Mission]] in Beijing, to which most of early Russian sinologists were connected.&lt;ref name=gorelova&gt;Liliya M. Gorelova, "Manchu Grammar." Brill, Leiden, 2002. {{ISBN|90-04-12307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illarion Kalinovich Rossokhin (Razsokhin) (died 1761) translated a number of Manchu works, such as ''The history of Kangxi's conquest of the Khalkha and Oirat nomads of the Great Tartary, in five parts'' (История о завоевании китайским ханом Канхием калкаского и элетского народа, кочующего в Великой Татарии, состоящая в пяти частях), as well as some legal treatises and a Manchu–Chinese dictionary. In the late 1830s, Georgy M. Rozov translated from the Manchu the ''History of the Jin (Jurchen) Dynasty''.&lt;ref name=larichev&gt;''История золотой империи''. (''The History of the Jin (Jurchen) Dynasty'') Russian Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch. Novosibirsk, 1998.  2 {{ISBN|5-7803-0037-2}}. [http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus11/Zinschi/red.htm Editor's preface] {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school to train Manchu language translators was started in [[Irkutsk]] in the 18th century, and existed for a fairly long period.&lt;ref name=larichev/&gt;

A European author remarked in 1844 that the transcription of Chinese words in Manchu alphabet, available in the contemporary Chinese–Manchu dictionaries, was more useful for learning the pronunciation of Chinese words than the inconsistent [[Romanization of Chinese|romanizations]] used at the time by the writers transcribing Chinese words in English or French books.&lt;ref name=repo1844/&gt;

In 1930, the German sinologist Eric Hauer argued forcibly that knowing Manchu allows the scholar to render Manchu personal and place names that have been "horribly mutilated" by their Chinese transliterations and to know the meanings of the names. He goes on that the Manchu translations of Chinese classics and fiction were done by experts familiar with their original meaning and with how best to express it in Manchu, such as in the Manchu translation of the ''[[Peiwen yunfu]]''. Because Manchu is not difficult to learn, it "enables the student of Sinology to use the Manchu versions of the classics […] in order to verify the meaning of the Chinese text".{{sfnb|Hauer|1930|p=162-163}}

==Current situation==
[[File:An Activity of Manchu Language by the Government and students in Changchun.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.36|"Banjin Inenggi" and Manchu linguistic activity by the government and students in [[Changchun]], 2011]]
Currently, very few native Manchu speakers remain; in what used to be [[Manchuria]] virtually no one speaks the language, the entire area having been completely [[sinicization|sinicized]]. As of 2007, the last native speakers of the language were thought to be 18 octogenarian residents of the village of [[Sanjiazi]] ({{manchu|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡳᠯᠠᠨ&lt;br&gt;ᠪᠣᡠ᠋}}|v=ilan boo|a=ilan bou}}), in [[Fuyu County, Heilongjiang|Fuyu County]], in [[Qiqihar]], [[Heilongjiang]] Province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/18/world/asia/18manchu.html Chinese Village Struggles to Save Dying Language], By David Lague. The New York Times, March 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  A few speakers also remain in [[Dawujia]] village in [[Aihui District]] of [[Heihe]] Prefecture.

The [[Xibe people|Xibe]] (or Sibe) are often considered to be the modern custodians of the written Manchu language. The Xibe live in [[Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County]] near the [[Ili River|Ili]] valley in [[Xinjiang]], having been moved there by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] in 1764. Modern written Xibe is very close to Manchu, although there are slight differences in the writing system which reflect distinctive Xibe pronunciation. More significant differences exist in morphological and syntactic structure of the spoken Xibe language. For one example among many, there is a [[converbs|"converb"]] ending, -''mak'', that is very common in modern spoken Xibe but unknown in Manchu.

Recently, there have been increased efforts to revive the Manchu language. Revival movements are linked to the reconstruction of ethnic Manchu identity in the Han-dominated country. The Manchus mainly lead the revival efforts, with support from the state, NGOs and international efforts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Identity reproducers beyond the grassroots: The middle class in the Manchu revival since 1980s|journal=Asian Ethnicity|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Facing the Decline of Minority Languages: The New Patterns of Education of Mongols and Manchus|journal=The Central European Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revivalism began in the post-[[Mao Zedong|Mao]] era when non-Han ethnic expression was allowed. By the 1980s, Manchus had become the second largest minority group in [[China]]. People began to reveal their ethnic identities that had been hidden due to 20th century unrests and the fall of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Language revival was one method the growing numbers of Manchus used in order to reconstruct their lost ethnic identity. Language represented them and set them apart from other minority groups in the “plurality of ethnic cultures within one united culture”. Another reason for revivalism lay in the archives of the Qing Empire – a way to translate and resolve historical conflicts between the Manchus and the state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, the people wanted to regain their language for the rituals and communication to their ancestors – many shamans performing do not understand the words they use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Manchus conducted most revival efforts. Manchu associations can be found across the country, as well as in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Consisting of mostly Manchus and Mongols, they act as the link between the people, their ethnic leaders and the state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide large support through “Manchu classes”. Manchu is now taught in certain primary schools as well as in universities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was reported that [[Heilongjiang University]] Manchu language research center in no.74, Xuefu Road, [[Harbin]], listed Manchu as an [[academic major]].  It is taught there as a tool for reading Qing Dynasty archival documents.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125452110732160485

The state also runs programs to revive minority cultures and languages – [[Deng Xiaoping]] promoted bilingual education. However, many programs are not suited to the ethnic culture or to passing knowledge to the younger generations. The locals often look at programs run by the government with distrust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other support can be found internationally and through the use of the Internet. Post-[[Cultural Revolution]] reform allowed for international studies to be done in China. The dying language and ethnic culture of Manchus gained attention, providing local support for reviving the Manchu language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Websites facilitate communication of language classes or articles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Younger generations also take to the Internet to spread and promote their unique identity through popular media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite the increased efforts to revive the Manchu language, there are many obstacles standing in the way. Even with increased awareness of ethnic identities, many Manchus choose to give up their language – some opting to learn Mongol instead. Manchu language is still thought of as a foreign language in a Han- dominated Chinese speaking country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Obstacles are also found when gaining recognition from the State. Resistance through censorship prevented the performing of Baijin festivals, a festival in recognition of a new reconstructed Manchu identity, in Beijing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Currently, several thousand people can speak Manchu as a second language through primary education or free classes for adults.&lt;ref name="chinanews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ifeng"/&gt;

==Dialects==
Dialects of Manchu include a variety of its historical and remaining spoken forms throughout [[Manchuria]], and the city of [[Peking]] (the capital of the former [[Qing dynasty]], when Manchu was referred to as the "national language"). Notable historical Manchu dialects include [[Peking]], [[Ningguta]], [[Acheng District|Alcuka]] and [[Mukden]] dialects.

The [[Beijing dialect|Chinese Northern Mandarin dialect spoken in Peking]] had a major impact on the phonology of the dialect of Manchu spoken in that city, and because Manchu phonology was transcribed into Chinese and European sources based on the sinicized pronunciation of Manchus from Peking, the original authentic Manchu pronunciation is unknown to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=The+reconstruction+of+the+original+pronunciation+became+one+of+the+most+important+problems+for+Manchu+linguistics.+The+investigation+of+the+Manchu+sound+system+has+not+been+successful+in+every+respect+up+to+now+because+the+phonation+which+became+known+to+us+in+the+past+century+from+Chinese+and+European+transcriptions,+do+not+reproduce+the+real+phonetic+value+of+the+graphemes.+These+transcriptions+were+mastered+and+made+widespread+by+the+Peking+(Beijing)+Manchus+whose+pronunciation+was+influenced+to+a+large+degree+by+the+Northern+dialect+of+the+Chinese+language.&amp;dq=The+reconstruction+of+the+original+pronunciation+became+one+of+the+most+important+problems+for+Manchu+linguistics.+The+investigation+of+the+Manchu+sound+system+has+not+been+successful+in+every+respect+up+to+now+because+the+phonation+which+became+known+to+us+in+the+past+century+from+Chinese+and+European+transcriptions,+do+not+reproduce+the+real+phonetic+value+of+the+graphemes.+These+transcriptions+were+mastered+and+made+widespread+by+the+Peking+(Beijing)+Manchus+whose+pronunciation+was+influenced+to+a+large+degree+by+the+Northern+dialect+of+the+Chinese+language.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v0T3U9_5MMOZyASVz4CgAw&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA|title=Manchu Grammar, Part 8|volume=7 |editor-first=Liliya M.|editor-last=Gorelova|year=2002|publisher=Brill|location=|page=77|isbn=9004123075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30kHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=These+transcriptions+were+mastered+and+made+widespread+by+the+Peking+(Beijing)+Manchus+whose+pronunciation+was+influenced+to+a+large+degree+by+the+Northern+dialect+of+the+Chinese+language.&amp;dq=These+transcriptions+were+mastered+and+made+widespread+by+the+Peking+(Beijing)+Manchus+whose+pronunciation+was+influenced+to+a+large+degree+by+the+Northern+dialect+of+the+Chinese+language.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2ET3U9WwCMKryATmjYDYDw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ|title=Cahiers de linguistique: Asie orientale, Volumes 31-32 |year=2002 |publisher=Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales, Centre de recherches linguistiques sur l'Asie orientale |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manchus of Peking (Beijing) were influenced by the Chinese dialect spoken in the area to the point where pronouncing Manchu sounds was hard for them, and they pronounced Manchu according to Chinese phonetics, whereas the Manchus of [[Aigun]] (in Heilongjiang) could both pronounce Manchu sounds properly and mimic the sinicized pronunciation of Manchus in Peking (Beijing), because they learned the Pekinese (Beijing) pronunciation from either studying in Peking or from officials sent to Aigun from Beijing, and they could tell them apart, using the Chinese influenced Pekinese pronunciation when demonstrating that they were better educated or their superior stature in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpEyQ1tUYTkC&amp;q=The+Manchus+of+Peking+who+now+read+Manchu+like+the+Chinese+do,+viz.+with+all+phonetic+peculiarities+characteristic+of+the+local+Chinese+dialect,+have+great+difficulties+in+pronouncing+certain+Manchu+sounds+').+The+Manchus+of+the+Aigun+region,+who+at+the+time+of+my+living+amongst+them+still+used+Manchu+Lit.+and+Manchu+Sp.+as+family+languages,+did+not+feel+similar+difficulties.+The+Pekinese+pronunciation+was+well+known+to+them+e.+g.+from+high+officials+who+brought+these+fashions+from+Peking+and+from+local+young+men+who,+although+knowing+Manchu+from+childhood,+after+their+stay+Peking+for+completion+of+their+education,+became+familiar+with+this+pronunciation.&amp;dq=The+Manchus+of+Peking+who+now+read+Manchu+like+the+Chinese+do,+viz.+with+all+phonetic+peculiarities+characteristic+of+the+local+Chinese+dialect,+have+great+difficulties+in+pronouncing+certain+Manchu+sounds+').+The+Manchus+of+the+Aigun+region,+who+at+the+time+of+my+living+amongst+them+still+used+Manchu+Lit.+and+Manchu+Sp.+as+family+languages,+did+not+feel+similar+difficulties.+The+Pekinese+pronunciation+was+well+known+to+them+e.+g.+from+high+officials+who+brought+these+fashions+from+Peking+and+from+local+young+men+who,+although+knowing+Manchu+from+childhood,+after+their+stay+Peking+for+completion+of+their+education,+became+familiar+with+this+pronunciation.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SMn8U-vEBtXMsQTA5oC4DQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6wEwAA|title=Archives polonaises d'etudes orientales, Volumes 8-10 |first=S.

====Characteristics of Peking dialect====
Phonetically, there are some characteristics that differentiate the Peking accent from the standard spelling form of Manchu. 
* There are some occasional vowel changes in a word. For example {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠴᡳᠮᠠᡵᡳ}} (''cimari'' /t͡ʃʰimari/) is pronounced /t͡ʃʰumari/, {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠣᠵᠣᡵᠠᡴᡡ}} (''ojorakū'' /ot͡ʃoraqʰʊ/) is pronounced /ot͡ɕiraqʰʊ/, and {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡤᡳᠰᡠᠨ}} (''gisun'' /kisun/) is pronounced /kysun/.
** In particular, when the vowel /o/ or diphthong /oi/ appears at the beginning of a word, it is frequently pronounce /ə/ and /əi/ respectively in Peking accent. For example, {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠣᠩᡤᠣᠯᠣ}} (''onggolo'' /oŋŋolo/) is pronounced /əŋŋolo/, {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠣᡳᠯᠣ}} (''oilo'' /oilo/) is pronounced /əilo/.
* [[Diphthongization]] of vowels. /ə/ becomes /əi/ (such as {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡩᡝᡥᡳ}} ''dehi'' /təxi/ pronounced /təixi/), /a/ becomes /ai/ (such as {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡩᠠᡤᡳᠯᠠᠮᠪᡳ}} ''dagilambi'' /takilampi/ pronounced /taikilami/), and /i/ becomes /iu/ (such as {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠨᡳᡵᡠ}} ''niru'' /niru/ pronounced /niuru/, and {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠨᡳᠴᡠᡥᡝ}} ''nicuhe'' /nit͡ʃʰuxə/ pronounced /niut͡ʃʰuxə/).
* /oi/ becomes /uai/, especially after /q/ (g). For example, {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡤᠣᡳ᠌ᠮᠪᡳ}} ''goimbi'' /koimpi/ becomes /kuaimi/.
* Disappearance of vowels under certain conditions. The vowel /i/ following consonant /t͡ʃʰ/ (c) or /t͡ʃ/ (j) usually disappears. For example, {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡝᠴᡳᡴᡝ}} ''ecike'' /ət͡ʃʰikʰə/ is pronounced /ət͡ʃʰkʰə/, and {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡥᠣᠵᡳᡥᠣᠨ}} ''hojihon'' /χot͡ʃiχon/ is pronounced /χot͡ʃχon/. There are also other cases where a vowel disappears in Peking accent. For example, {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡝᡴᡧᡝᠮᠪᡳ}} ''ekšembi'' /əkʰʃəmpi/ is pronounced /əkʰʃmi/, and {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠪᡠᡵᡠᠯᠠᠮᠪᡳ}} ''burulambi'' /purulampi/ is pronounced /purlami/.

==Grammar==

===Syntax===
Manchu phrases are all head-final. This means that the head-word of a phrase (e.g. the [[noun]] of a [[noun phrase]], or the [[verb]] of a [[verb phrase]]) always falls at the end of the phrase. Thus, adjectives and adjectival phrases always precede the noun they modify, and the arguments to the verb always precede the verb. As a result, Manchu sentence structure is [[subject–object–verb|subject–object–verb (SOV)]].

Manchu uses a small number of case-marking particles{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} that are similar to those found in Korean, but also has a separate class of true postpositions. Case-markers and postpositions can be used together, as in the following sentence:
: {{transl|mnc|''bi tere niyalma+i emgi gene+he''}}
: I that person+GEN with go+PAST
: I went with that person

In this example, the postposition {{transl|mnc|''emgi''}}, "with", requires its nominal argument to have the genitive case, and so we have the genitive case-marker {{transl|mnc|''i''}} between the noun {{transl|mnc|''niyalma''}} and the postposition.

Manchu also makes extensive use of [[converb]] structures, and has an inventory of converbial suffixes that indicate the relationship between the subordinate verb and the finite verb that follows it. For example, given the following two sentences (which have finite verbs):
: {{transl|mnc|''tere sargan boo ci tuci+ke''}}
: that woman house ABL go.out+PAST.FINITE
: That woman came out of the house.
: {{transl|mnc|''tere sargan hoton de gene+he''}}
: that woman town DAT go+PAST.FINITE
: That woman went to town.

These two sentences can be combined into a single sentence using converbs, which will relate the first action to the second. For example,
: {{transl|mnc|''tere sargan boo ci tuci+fi, hoton de gene+he''}}
: that woman house ABL go.out+PAST.CONVERB, town DAT go+PAST.FINITE
: That woman, having come out of the house, went to town.
: {{transl|mnc|''tere sargan boo ci tuci+me, hoton de gene+he''}}
: that woman house ABL go.out+IMPERFECT.CONVERB, town DAT go+PAST.FINITE
: That woman, coming out of the house, went to town.
: {{transl|mnc|''tere sargan boo ci tuci+cibe, hoton de gene+he''}}
: that woman house ABL go.out+CONCESSIVE.CONVERB, town DAT go+PAST.FINITE
: That woman, though she came out of the house, went to town.

===Cases===
Manchu has five cases. The cases are marked by particles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manchu grammar|last=Goreleva|first=Liliya|publisher=Brill|year=2002|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=163–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be written either with the noun to which they apply or separately. The particles do not obey the rule of vowel harmony, yet they are also not truly postpositions.

[[nominative case|nominative]] – one of the principal syntactic cases; used for the subject of a sentence, no overt marking&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[accusative case|accusative]] (''be'') – one of the principal syntactic cases; indicate participants/direct object of a sentence. Direct objects can sometimes also take the nominative. It is commonly felt that the marked accusative has a definite sense, like using a definite article in English. Written separate from the word it follows.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accusative can be used in the following ways:
* nominative-accusative strategy - indicates opposition between syntactic roles (subject = nominative; object - accusative)
''i    boo     '''be'''     weile-mbi''

he house ACC build-IMPF

“He builds a house”
* transitive verbs
''fe   kooli           '''be'''     dahame       yabu-mbi''

old regulations ACC according.to act-IMPF

“(Someone) acts according to old regulations”
* transitive verb (negative form)
* indicate when agent is caused to perform an action
* indicate motion that is happening&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[genitive case|genitive]] (''i'' or ''ni'') – one of the principal syntactic cases; used to indicate possession or means by which something is accomplished.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Its primary function is to indicate the possessive one.

e.g. possessor of an object

''boo     '''i'''        ejen''

house GEN master

“the master of the house”

e.g. persons relationships

''han   '''i'''        jui''

khan GEN child

“the khan’s child”

Other functions of genitive are:
* attributive – nouns followed by genitive marker indicates attributives; also used for participles and verbs 
* adverb – the noun is repeated with the addition of the genitive marker (i)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[dative case|dative]]-[[locative case|locative]] (''de'') – used to indicate location, time, place, or indirect object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The primary function is to indicate semantic role of recipient:

''ere niyalma '''de'''    bu-mbi''

this man      DAT give-IMPF

“(Someone) gives to this man”

Other functions:
* agent of a passive verb
* indicate person who is in possession of something
* indicate sources of something
* indicate instrument of action (verbs in past tense, talking about other’s)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[ablative case|ablative]] (''ci'') – used to indicate the origin of an action or the basis for a comparison.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

e.g. starting point in space or time

''boo-'''ci'''         tuci-ke''

house-ABL go.away-PART

“(Someone) went away from the house”

e.g. comparison of objects

''ere erin  '''ci'''     oyonggo   ningge  akū''

this time ABL important SBSTR COP.NEG (there.is.not)

“There is no time more important than the present”

''deri''-form - used in Classical Manchu; different scholars have specified different meanings:
* in the place of ''ci''
* comparisons
''encu hehe-ši (ma. hehe-si) '''deri''' fulu      tua-mbi (ma. tuwa-mbi)''

other woman-PL                  from better consider-IMPF

“(He) began to consider her better than other women”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Less used cases:{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
* [[initiative case|initiative]] – used to indicate the starting point of an action. suffix ''-deri''
* [[terminative case|terminative]] – used to indicate the ending point of an action. suffix ''-tala''/''-tele''/''-tolo''
* [[indefinite allative case|indef. allative]] – used to indicate 'to a place, to a situation' when it is unknown whether the action reaches exactly to the place/situation or around/near it. suffix ''-si''
* [[indefinite locative case|indef. locative]] – used to indicate 'at a place, in a situation' when it is unknown whether the action happens exactly at the place/situation or around/near it. suffix ''-la''/''-le''/''-lo''
* [[indefinite ablative case|indef. ablative]] – used to indicate 'from a place, from a situation' when it is unknown whether the action is really from the exact place/situation or around/near it. suffix ''-tin''
* [[distributive case|distributive]] – used to indicate every one of something. suffix ''-dari''
* [[Essive-formal case|formal]] – used to indicate a simile ("as/like"). suffix ''-gese''
* [[identical case|identical]] – used to indicate that something is the same as something else. suffix ''-ali''/''-eli''/''-oli'' (apparently derived from the word ''adali'', meaning "same")
* [[orientative case|orientative]] – used to indicate "facing/toward" (something/an action), showing only position and tendency, not movement in. suffix ''-ru''
* [[revertive case|revertive]] – used to indicate "backward" or "against (something)". From the root 'ca' (see ''cargi'', ''coro'', ''cashu-n'', etc.) suffix ''-ca''/''-ce''/''-co''
* [[translative case|translative]] – used to indicate change in the quality/form of sth. suffix ''-ri''
* [[indefinite accusative case|in. accusative]] – used to indicate that the touch of the verb on the object is not surely complete. suffix ''-a''/''-e''/''-o''/''-ya''/''-ye''/''-yo''

In addition, there were some suffixes, such as the primarily adjective-forming suffix ''-ngga''/''-ngge''/''-nggo'', that appear to have originally been case markers (in the case of ''-ngga'', a [[genitive case]] marker), but which had already lost their productivity and become fossilized in certain lexemes by the time of the earliest written records of the Manchu language: e.g. ''agangga'' "pertaining to rain" as in ''agangga sara'' (an umbrella), derived from Manchu ''aga'' (rain).

==Phonology==
{{More footnotes|date=December 2008}}
{{Weasel|date=December 2008}}
Written Manchu was close to being called an "open syllable" language because the only consonant that came regularly at the end of native words was {{IPA|/n/}}, similar to the situation in [[Beijing dialect|Beijing Mandarin]], [[Northeastern Mandarin]], [[Jilu Mandarin]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. This resulted in almost all native words ending in a vowel. In some words, there were vowels that were separated by consonant clusters, as in the words ''ilha'' ('flower') and ''abka'' ('heaven'); however, in most words, the vowels were separated from one another by only single consonants. This open syllable structure might not have been found in all varieties of spoken Manchu, but it was certainly found in the southern dialect that became the basis for the written language. It is also apparent that the open-syllable tendency of the Manchu language had been growing ever stronger for the several hundred years since written records of Manchu were first produced: consonant clusters that had appeared in older forms, such as ''abka'' and ''abtara-mbi'' ('to yell'), were gradually simplified, and the words began to be written as{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} ''aga'' or ''aha'' (in this form meaning 'rain'){{Dubious|Should be separate words|date=July 2011}} and ''atara-mbi'' ('to cause a commotion').

Manchu has twenty consonants, shown in the table using each phoneme's representation in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], followed by its romanization in italics. {{IPA|/p/}} was rare and found mostly in loanwords and [[onomatopoeia]]e, such as ''pak pik'' ('pow pow'). Historically, {{IPA|/p/}} appears to have been common, but [[sound change|changed]] over time to {{IPA|/f/}}. {{IPA|/ŋ/}} was also found mostly in loanwords and onomatopoeiae and there was no single letter in the [[Manchu alphabet]] to represent it, but rather a digraph of the letters for {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}. {{IPA|[ɲ]}} is usually transcribed with a digraph ''ni'', and has thus often been considered a sequence of phonemes {{IPA|/nj/}} rather than a phoneme of its own, though work in Tungusic historical linguistics suggests that the Manchu palatal nasal has a very long history as a single [[segment (linguistics)|segment]], and so it is shown here as phonemic.

Early Western descriptions of Manchu phonology labeled Manchu ''b'' as "soft p", Manchu ''d'' as "soft t", and Manchu ''g'' as "soft k", whereas Manchu ''p'' was "hard p", ''t'' was "hard t", and ''k'' was "hard k". This suggests that the phonological contrast between the so-called voiced series (''b, d, j, g'') and the voiceless series (''p, t, c, k'') in Manchu as it was spoken during the early modern era was actually one of aspiration (as shown here) or [[tenseness]], as in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].

Unusually, {{IPA|/s/}} was affricated to {{IPA|[ts]}} in some or all contexts. {{IPA|/tʃʰ/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} were palatalized before /i/ or /y/ to {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}}, {{IPA|[tɕ]}}, and {{IPA|[ɕ]}}, respectively. {{IPA|/kʰ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} were backed before /a/, /ɔ/, or /ʊ/ to {{IPA|[qʰ]}} and {{IPA|[q]}}, respectively. Some scholars analyse these [[uvular]] realizations as belonging to phonemes separate from {{IPA|/kʰ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}, and they were distinguished in the Manchu alphabet, but are not distinguished in the romanization.

===Vowels===

In this vowel system, the "neutral" vowels (''i'' and ''u'') were free to occur in a word with any other vowel or vowels. The lone front vowel (''e'', but generally pronounced like [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] [ɤ] ) never occurred in a word with either of the regular back vowels (''o'' and ''a''). The relatively rare vowel transcribed ''ū'' (possibly pronounced {{IPA|[ʊ]}}){{Dubious|date=July 2009}} was usually found as a back vowel; however, in some cases, it was found occurring along with the front vowel ''e''. Much disputation exists over the exact pronunciation of ''ū''. Erich Hauer, a German sinologist and Manchurist, proposes that it was pronounced as a front rounded vowel initially, but a back unrounded vowel medially.&lt;ref&gt;Li (2000), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; William Austin suggests that it was a mid-central rounded vowel.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, William M., "The Phonemics and Morphophonemes of Manchu", in ''American Studies in Altaic Linguistics'', p. 17, [[Nicholas Poppe]] (ed.), Indiana University Publications, Vol. 13 of the Uralic and Altaic Series, Bloomington IN 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern Shibe (Xibe) pronounce it identically to ''u''.

===Loanwords===
Remarkably Manchu was able to absorb a large number of nonnative sounds into the language from Chinese. There were special symbols used to represent the vowels of Chinese loanwords. These sounds are believed to have been pronounced as such, as they never occurred in native words. Among these, was the symbol for the high unrounded vowel (customarily romanized with a ''y'') found in words such as ''sy'' (Buddhist temple) and ''Sycuwan'' (Sichuan). Chinese [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] were also represented with consonant symbols that were only used with loanwords such as in the case of ''dzengse'' (orange) (Chinese: ''chéngzi'')  and ''tsun'' (inch) (Chinese: ''cùn''). In addition to the vocabulary that was borrowed from Chinese, the Manchu language also had a large amount of loanwords from other languages such as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], for example the words  ''morin'' (horse) and ''temen'' (camel).

===Vowel harmony===
The [[vowel harmony]] found in the Manchu language was traditionally described in terms of the philosophy of the ''[[I Ching]]''. Syllables with front vowels were described as being as "[[Yin and yang|yin]]" syllables whereas syllables with back vowels were called "[[Yin and yang|yang]]" syllables. The reasoning behind this was that the language had a kind of sound symbolism where front vowels represented feminine objects or ideas and the back vowels represented masculine objects or ideas. As a result, there were a number of word pairs in the language in which changing the vowels also changed the gender of the word. For example, the difference between the words ''hehe'' (woman) and ''haha'' (man) or ''eme'' (mother) and ''ama'' (father) was essentially a contrast between the front vowel, [e], of the feminine and the back vowel, [a], of the masculine counterpart.

==In popular culture==
The Manchu language was spoken in the Korean film ''[[War of the Arrows]]''. [[Ryu Seung-ryong]], cast in the role of Jyushinta, and [[Moon Chae-won]], who played Choi Ja-in, speak Manchu often in the film. It was also spoken in the film ''[[Flying Swords of Dragon Gate]]'', in which it was called [[Tatar language|Tartar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">The '''murder of Sherry Ann Duncan''' was a sensational crime that occurred in 1986 in [[Thailand]]. It is best known for the false incrimination of four suspects, some of whom died in prison during their nine years of incarceration, before being acquitted in 1995.

Duncan, a sixteen-year-old Thai-American student, was abducted after leaving her school in [[Bangkok]] on 22 July 1986; her body was found a few days later in wetlands in [[Samut Prakan Province]]. Four men were arrested, eventually convicted of murder, and sentenced to death in 1990. Later re-investigations by the [[Crime Suppression Division]] found evidence of false testimony by a key witness, and that the men had made forced confessions under duress. The convictions were overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Thailand|Supreme Court]] in 1995, but by then one of the wrongly accused men had died in prison, one had sustained permanent spinal injuries, and another died from tuberculosis shortly after release.

Two men were arrested and convicted for the murder. They implicated Suwiboon Patpongpanit for hiring them; she was convicted by the [[Court of First Instance (Thailand)|Court of First Instance]] but later acquitted by the Supreme Court in 1999 due to insufficient evidence. The police officer who led the original investigation, Police Colonel Mongkol Sripho, was retroactively dishonourably discharged for fabricating evidence, but he had already retired and emigrated to the United States, and was not brought to face criminal charges.

In 2003, the Civil Court awarded the scapegoats and/or their descendants 26 million [[baht]] in damages. The case is often raised as an example of police corruption and the problems facing Thailand's justice system. It was adapted into a film (titled ''Sherry Ann'' and directed by Charoon Wattanasin) by [[Five Star Production]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gagliardi|first1=Jason|title=Botched murder inquiries haunt Thai police|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/431547/botched-murder-inquiries-haunt-thai-police|accessdate=25 March 2018|work=South China Morning Post|date=19 October 2003|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ย้อนคดีเชอรี่แอน "แพะในตำนาน" 17ปีคดีประวัติศาสตร์ จ่าย26ล้านไถ่บาป “ตำรวจ”ยื้อจนสุดทาง|url=https://www.matichonweekly.com/scoop/article_20990|website=Matichon Weekly|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=th-TH|date=12 January 2017|orig-year=originally published 10 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nepalis in Russia''' comprises residents from [[Nepal]] in [[Russia]], including temporary expatriates and permanent residents, as well as their locally born descendants.

==Migration history==
Nepalese students moved to then-[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and other countries that were formally under the [[Soviet Union]]. The USSR trained thousands of students from developing countries in a variety of fields. Over 6,000 Nepalis have graduated from Russian and former Soviet universities as lawyers, journalists, doctors and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalnepali.com.np/profile.php/ JIBA LAMICHHANE - Service Through Enterprise]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the students have married and settled there. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Nepalese entrepreneurs who settled down in Russia took the lead in investing in private hydropower projects and many other ventures in their home country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/2004/12/10/Business/1507/ From Russia with love]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ni'mat Allah al-Harawi''' (also known as '''Niamatullah''';&lt;ref&gt;Other variants include: Allah Ni'mat, Khawaja Nimatullah of Herat, Khwaja Niamatullah, Khwaja Nimat Allah Harawi, Khwaja Nimatullah Heravi, Khwajah Ni'mat Allah ibn Khwajah Habib Allah of Herat, Khwajah Nimat Ullah Harawi, Naimatulla, Naimatullah, Ne´mat-Allâh Heravî, Neamat-Allah Heravi, Neamet Ullah, Nematullah Harvi, Ni'matullah, Niamat Ullah, Niamatullah Heravi, Niamatullah Hirvi, Nimat Allaah, Nimatullah, Ni'matullah al-Harawi.&lt;/ref&gt; {{flourished|1613|1630}}) was a chronicler at the court of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahangir]] where he compiled a [[Persian language|Persian]] history of the [[Pashtun people|Afghans]], the ''Makhzan-i-Afghani''.&lt;ref&gt;''Maghzan'' means storehouse.&lt;/ref&gt; Its translated copies appear as ''The History of the Afghans''.

The original material for the book was provided by Haibat Khan of Samana, under whose patronage Nimatullah made the compilation c. 1612.&lt;ref&gt;B. Dorn, History of the Afghans, translation of Makhzan-e Afghani, pp ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The original material was later published separately as ''Tarikh-i-Khan Jahani Makhzan-i-Afghani''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Stewart, A Descriptive catalogue of the oriental library of late Tipoo Sultan of Mysore, pp 18&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of both books are the same, but the later part contains an additional history of Khan Jehan Lodhi.

The material is part fictional, part historical. The book is a major source of tradition relating to the origins of the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]. It also covers Pashtun rulers in [[Bengal]], contemporary events, and Pashtun [[hagiography]]. It plays a large part in various theories which have been offered about the possibility that [[Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites|the Pashtun people might be descended from the Israelites]], through the [[Ten Lost Tribes]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Origin theories==
The Bani-Israelite theory about the origin of the Pashtuns is based on Pashtun oral traditions; the tradition itself was documented in the ''Makhzan-i-Afghani'', which is the only written source addressing Pashtun origins. The ''Makhzan'' traces the Pashtuns' origins from the Patriarch [[Abraham]] down to a king named King Talut (Saul). ''Makhza''n to this point agrees with testimony provided by Muslim sources or Hebrew Scriptures, showing King Saul around B.C. 1092 in Palestine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} It is beyond this point that the description comes under serious doubt.{{by whom|date=July 2016}}

==The Pashtun ancestry==
According to Nimat Allah, [[Qais Abdur Rashid|Qais]] was the ancestor of most of the existing Pashtun tribes. He met [[Muhammad]] and embraced [[Islam]], receiving the Muslim name of Abdur Rashid.  He had three sons, [[Ghourghusht]], [[Sarban (son of Qais)|Sarban]] and [[Bitan]] (Baitan). [[Karlan]], the fourth legendary ancestor, is wrongly attributed as Qais's fourth son. In fact he was his grandson of [[Ghourghusht]] and the son of [[burhan]]

==English translations==
A translation appeared in 1836 by [[Bernhard Dorn]] which had two parts.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental Translation Fund, London&lt;/ref&gt; There is another partial translation from 1958, Nirodbhusan Roy titled, ''Niamatullah's History of the Afghans''. A translation in two volumes by S. M. Imamuddin appeared in [[Dhaka]], 1960–62.

The Office of the Special Prosecutor of [[Ghana]] was established after an act of the [[Parliament of Ghana]] passed the Office of Special Prosecutor Bill in 2017.&lt;ref name=pass&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/media-center/news/4184-parliament-passes-office-of-special-prosecutor-bill-2017|title=Parliament Passes Office of Special Prosecutor Bill,, 2017 - Government of Ghana |website=www.ghana.gov.gh |language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office serves as an independent investigating and prosecution body to make inquiries into corruption, bribery, or other criminal cases at the national level whether they be in public or private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ghananewsonline.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/OFFICE-OF-THE-SPECIAL-PROSECUTOR-BILL.pdf |title=Office of The Special Prosecutor Bill, 2017 Memorandum |date=|website=Ghana news online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Purpose ==

The [[New Patriotic Party|NPP]] Government intended to lessen the burden on existing anti-corruption agencies and remove the institutional roadblocks that exist as hindrances to the fight against corruption. With the end result being to make anti-corruption agencies in the country more effective at discharging their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/opinion/2018/January-3rd/the-special-prosecutor-and-the-fight-against-corruption-in-ghana-some-thoughts.php|title=The Special Prosecutor and the Fight Against Corruption in Ghana: Some Thoughts|last=Gyampo|first=Yaw|date=|website=My Joy Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, government experts have expressed the ineffectiveness of the Attorney-General as an effective prosecution and law enforcement tool in the fight against corruption because the appointment and dismissal of the  Attorney-General is determined by the president.&lt;ref name=pass /&gt;

Therefore, the Office of the special prosecutor serves as the autonomous body to handle sensitive cases which the Attorney General will otherwise be ineffective at handling.

[[File:Victoria Square prayer meeting.jpg|thumb|right|A prayer meeting in [[Victoria Square, Birmingham]]]]
A '''prayer meeting''' is a meeting of [[Layperson#Clerical context|lay people]] for the purpose of [[prayer]] as a group. Prayer meetings are normally conducted outside regular services by one or more members of the [[clergy]] or other forms of church leadership, but they may also be initiated by decision of non-leadership members as well.

==Location==

Prayer meetings may be held in public places, private homes, or small or large agreed-upon meeting places. Public prayer meetings may sometimes represent more than one religious faith, especially where the purpose for the prayer meeting involves a city or larger social unit.

The choice of venue depends on the intended participants, the purpose of the prayer meeting, and the size of the prayer meeting. Prayer meetings can consist of fewer than a dozen people. At the other end of the scale, the largest prayer meetings may involve several thousand people.

Prayer meetings are most commonly held at [[Church (building)|churches]] or [[mosque]]s on days other than the normal day of worship. This is most common where only regular church or mosque members are expected to attend, although the public is usually welcome to attend a prayer meeting.

The smallest prayer meetings can be held at any agreed-upon place which is accessible to the group for religious purposes. Very large prayer meetings may be held in convention centers or arenas.

==Schedule==

A prayer meeting may be held on any day of the week. Many churches and mosques schedule weekly prayer meetings. Wednesday evenings are particularly popular for Christian prayer meetings, as a time convenient to most church members and the date farthest away from Saturday or Sunday services. All of these prayer meetings are usually scheduled well in advance.

Prayer meetings may also be scheduled to coincide with breakfast or a related special event.

Special prayer meetings may be called on short notice during times of common crisis or concern. For example, a prayer meeting may be called if a church member is involved in a serious accident. A special prayer meeting on a larger scale is often called after a major disaster has hit the local community. In times of national mourning, small prayer meetings may be called all over the country during the following days, with one or more larger prayer meetings, possibly televised, near the location of the tragedy.

==Purpose==
Prayer meetings provide social support to those who attend. The prayers during the prayer meeting sometimes ask their deity for a positive outcome in times of uncertainty. The prayer meeting, in a Christian's perspective, is the driving force of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Spurgeon, Charles H. “Prayer Meetings.” ''Spurgeon Gems'', 27 Aug. 1914, www.spurgeongems.org/prayer/chs3421.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; It is where the church comes together to find comfort, learn how to be devoted, and seek answers.

Some prayer meetings are targeted at repentance, either of those attending or of another person or organization which is not in attendance. The latter type of prayer meetings is also a form of protest against the sinful behavior of the targeted person or organization.

In the years before widespread [[news media]], prayer meetings were also a primary source of news and information (including firsthand accounts) about the events leading to the meeting being called. At the same time as the news was received, the prayer meeting offered ways to deal with changing circumstances. This still continues in modern times. However, the impact of such a prayer meeting is now much stronger among the worshipers than among the general public.

'''Salburun''' ([[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] : Салбуурун) is a traditional kind of hunt in [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrghyzstan]] and [[Central Asia]], involving [[falconry]], [[archery]] and sometimes [[mounted archery]], as well as hunting with [[Taigan]].

At the end of Salburun contests, the winners of the different disciplines receive an award; the main disciplines are:
:* Hunting with eagles,
:* Hunting with Taigan,
:* Taigan races,
:* Mounted archery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gezitter.org/interviews/32846_yadro_natsionalnyih_igr__v_manase/ Interview of the president of Salburun Federation], 3 September 2014, in Russian&lt;/ref&gt;

Salburun comes from the nomadic tradition of hunting and protecting herds from predators such as wolves. Festivals have been organised in Central Asia since 1997. After the festival of 2006 in [[Tong District|Tong district]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], international reactions to the violence of the event led the Salburun Federation to rethink the rules and take measures for animal defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ru.sputnik.kg/culture/20150303/1014543698.html Article on sputnik.ru], 3 March 2015, in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a petition has been launched to end wolf baiting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupyforanimals.net/salburun-which-means-hunters-zest-in-kyrgyz-language-has-been-held-annually-since-1997.html Occupy for Animals website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Salburun is one of the [[Worldwide Nomad Games]]' disciplines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">The '''Sandhi''' (or '''Sindhi''') '''Muslims''' are a community found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]]. They are one of a number of communities of pastoral [[nomad]]s found in the [[Banni Grasslands Reserve|Banni]] region of [[Kutch]].&lt;ref name=Lal&gt;''People of India: Gujarat Volume XXI, Part Three'', edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen, pp. 1241-1245&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The Sandhi are said to have emigrated about 300 years ago, from [[Sindh]] to Kutch and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. In Saurashtra, they are found mainly in [[Junagadh district]]. They speak [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], with many [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] loanwords.&lt;ref name=Lal/&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Sandhi are an [[endogamous]] community, and are divided into 82 clans. They do not practice clan [[exogamy]], except the Hala and Shetha clans. Their major clans include the [[Sandh]], [[Samejo|Sameja]],[[Jirka|Jiruka]],Jokhiya,Jakhra, [[Samma (tribe)|Samma]], Sumra,[[Jadeja]], Nareja, Juneja, Daudani, Dal, Gothi, [[Solanki (clan)|Solanki]], Virsa, [[Theba (Sindhi tribe)|Theba]], Nayi, Bughiya, Bafars, Hala, Shetha, Vindhani, Pariya (Visar) and [[Khokhar]]. Some of these clans such as the Jadeja, Nareja and Solanki claim [[Rajput]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=Lal/&gt;

The Sandhi of Kutch are a community of [[Maldhari]] cattle breeders. They take their cattle to the bazaars of [[Bhuj]]. They also raise goats and buffaloes. Like other Kutchi communities, many of them have migrated to other parts of [[India]] in search of employment. They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s and most follow the [[Hanfi]] mazhab and [[Barelvi]] maslak. In Saurashtra, the Sandhi are mainly farmers, living in their own settlements. They have a statewide association, the Akhil Saurashtra Sindhi Muslim Vikas Jamat, which deals with community issues.&lt;ref name=Lal/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1218">The '''Shira''' or '''Sira''' people, the ''Eshira'', are a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] [[ethnic group]] of [[Gabon]] primarily living in the forests and grasslands south of the [[Ogooué River]] and west of its tributary the [[N'Gounié River|N'Gounié]].

The Eshira migrated into the area sometime in the 18th century, after wars with the [[Kele people (Gabon)|Kele]] and other groups. During the 19th century they traded [[slavery|slave]]s with the [[Nkomi people|Nkomi]], and were highly regarded for their [[tobacco]] and [[Raphia (palm)|raphia]] cloth. Their numbers were greatly reduced by [[smallpox]] epidemics in 1865 and 1898.

[[Paul du Chaillu]] travelled through Eshira areas in 1858 and 1864, and recorded that each clan controlled its own affairs. [[Mulenda]] of the [[Kamba clan]] was the most important of the chiefs; he owned 300–400 slaves, and died of smallpox in 1885. The [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] established a mission in 1895.

Subgroups of the Eshira include the [[Punu people|Punu]].

'''Simon LeVay''' (born 28 August 1943) is a British-American [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]]. He is renowned for his studies about brain structures and [[sexual orientation]].

==Personal life==
LeVay was born on 28 August 1943 in [[Oxford]], England. He is openly gay.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gendersex.net/blog/archives/allen-garland-double-edged-sword-of-genetic-determinism/ |title=Allen, Garland E.

==Education and career==
*[[University of Cambridge]], England (B.A., Natural Sciences, 1966)
*[[University of Göttingen]], Germany (PhD, Neuroanatomy, 1971)
*[[Harvard Medical School]] (Postdoctoral Research Fellow, 1972–1974)

LeVay held positions in [[neurobiology]] at the [[Harvard Medical School]] from 1974 to 1984. He then worked at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] from 1984 to 1993 while holding an Associate Professorship in Biology at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. Much of his early work focused on [[visual cortex]] in animals, especially cats. In 2003 he was a lecturer and the Director of Human Sexuality Studies at [[Stanford University]].

==INAH3 research==

In 1991, LeVay published "A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men" in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. This article reported a difference in average size between the third [[:wikt:interstitial|Interstitial]] Nucleus of the Anterior [[Hypothalamus]] ([[INAH 3|INAH3]]) in the brains of heterosexual men and homosexual men: INAH3 was more than twice as large in heterosexual men as in homosexual men. The INAH3 size of homosexual men was the same as that of women. LeVay wrote that "This finding indicates that INAH is dimorphic with sexual orientation, at least in men, and suggests that sexual orientation has a biological substrate." LeVay added, "The existence of 'exceptions' in the present sample (that is, presumed heterosexual men with small INAH 3 nuclei, and homosexual men with large ones), hints at the possibility that sexual orientation, although an important variable, may not be the sole determinant of INAH 3 size. It is also possible, however, that these exceptions are due to technical shortcomings or to misassignment of subjects to their subject groups."&lt;ref name="inah3"&gt;LeVay S (1991). A difference in hypothalamic structure between homosexual and heterosexual men. ''Science, 253,'' 1034–1037.&lt;/ref&gt;

LeVay's finding was widely reported in the media.&lt;ref name="angier"&gt;Angier, Natalie (30 August 1991). Zone of Brain Linked to Men's Sexual Orientation. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; LeVay openly related his research to his own homosexuality and to his mourning over his lover's death from [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosario, Vernon (1997). ''Science and Homosexualities''. Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-91502-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; LeVay cautioned against misinterpreting his findings in a 1994 interview: "It’s important to stress what I didn’t find. I did not prove that homosexuality is [[Genetics|genetic]], or find a genetic cause for being gay. I didn't show that gay men are born that way, the most common mistake people make in interpreting my work. Nor did I locate a gay center in the brain. The INAH3 is less likely to be the sole gay nucleus of the brain than a part of a chain of nuclei engaged in men and women's sexual behavior."&lt;ref&gt;David Nimmons, "Sex and the Brain", ''[[Discover Magazine]]'', March 1994, http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/sexandthebrain346/?searchterm=levay&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of LeVay questioned the accuracy and appropriateness of his measurements, observing that the structures are difficult to see in tissue slices and that he measured in volume rather than cell count.&lt;ref name="barinaga"&gt;Barinaga, Marcia (30 August 1991). Is homosexuality biological? ''Science''&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Ordover writes that LeVay has been criticized for "his small [[sample size]] and for compiling inadequate sexual histories."&lt;ref name="ordover"&gt;Ordover, Nancy (2003).

[[File:SS Heliopolis postcard - Egyptian Mail.jpg|thumb|250px|The SS ''Heliopolis'' in 1907 was the first ship to bring Spanish immigrants to Hawaii.]]
'''Spanish immigration to Hawaii''' began in 1907 when the Hawaiian government and the [[Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association]] (HSPA) decided to supplement their ongoing importation of Portuguese workers to Hawaii with workers recruited from Spain. Importation of Spanish laborers, along with their families, continued until 1913, at which time more than 9,000 Spanish immigrants had been brought in, most recruited to work primarily on the Hawaiian [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s.

==Early immigration==
Perhaps the first Spanish immigrant to take up residence in Hawaii was [[Francisco de Paula Marín]] (1774-1837), a self-promoting adventurer who knew several languages, and served King [[Kamehameha I]] as an interpreter and military advisor.&lt;ref name="cutter1980" /&gt; Later Marin may have advised Kamehameha's son Kauikeaouli ([[Kamehameha III]]) on Hawaii's fledgling cattle industry, as Marin had spent time in [[Spanish California]], and Kauikeaouli visited there in 1832 to observe the California cattle industry first-hand. Kauikeaouli was greatly impressed with the horsemanship and cattle handling skills of the Spanish [[vaquero]]s of California, and he invited several of them to Hawaii to teach those skills to his own people. The native Hawaiians these vaqueros trained became the "Paniolo", or "Hawaiian [[cowboy]]s", who carry on a tradition of horsemanship and cattle ranching to the present day.&lt;ref name="mills2013" /&gt; There were no doubt other Spanish adventurers who arrived throughout the mid-19th century on [[whaling ships]], but their numbers would have been few. Spanish immigrants to Hawaii in fact were so few prior to 1900 that they were counted only as "Other Foreigners" in the Hawaiian [[census]] returns.&lt;ref name="census_records" /&gt;

==Immigration of 1907 to 1913==
The rise in the late 1800s of the [[sugar]] industry in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] created a huge demand for laborers to work on the sugarcane plantations. The Hawaiian government, with the support of the plantation owners, initially brought in contract laborers from [[China]] to fill this need, but public sentiment gradually turned against continued importation of the Chinese, and Portuguese workers were recruited to take their place.&lt;ref name="coman1903_chinese" /&gt; However, the high cost associated with shipping Portuguese laborers and their families to Hawaii, and the reality that many Portuguese remained on the plantations only long enough to fulfill their contractual obligations, led the [[Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association]] (HSPA) to encourage the government to consider alternate sources of labor. Spain in particular was felt to be a viable source of contract workers, who were culturally more acceptable than many of the other ethnic groups that had already been brought in.&lt;ref name="wright1903" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lozano1984" /&gt;

The importation of Spanish laborers to Hawaii began in 1907, when the British steamship SS ''Heliopolis'' arrived in Honolulu Harbor with 2,246 immigrants from the [[Málaga]] province of [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="fernandez1" /&gt; However, rumored poor accommodations and food on the voyage created political complications that delayed the next Spanish importation until 1911, when the SS ''Orteric'' arrived with a mixed contingent of 960 Spanish and 565 Portuguese immigrants, the Spanish having boarded at [[Gibraltar]], and the Portuguese at [[Oporto]] and [[Lisbon]]. However, the two groups argued and fought with each other during the long voyage, ''"so much so that they had to be separated. The women . . . went as far as hair pulling."''&lt;ref name="orteric1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="orteric2" /&gt; Although Portuguese immigration to Hawaii effectively ended after the arrival of the ''Orteric'', the importation of Spanish laborers and their families continued until 1913, ultimately bringing to Hawaii a total of 9,262 Spanish immigrants.&lt;ref name="fernandez2" /&gt;

Despite hopes that the Spanish immigrants who came to Hawaii would stay and continue to work on the sugarcane plantations, most emigrated to the mainland United States, generally California, as soon as they could in search of greater opportunity.&lt;ref name="lozano1984" /&gt; So much so that the U.S. census for 1930 listed only 1,219 residents (0.3% of the population) of Spanish ancestry still remaining in Hawaii. Although the Spanish tended to move on, they were quickly supplanted by Spanish-speaking immigrants from the Philippines and Puerto Rico, who by 1930 made up, respectively, 17.1% and 1.8% of the population. By comparison, residents of Portuguese ancestry in 1930 made up 7.5% of the population.&lt;ref name="census1930" /&gt;

==How they came to Hawaii==
Six ships between 1907 and 1913 brought over 9,000 Spanish immigrants from the Spanish mainland to Hawaii. Although many of the Portuguese immigrants who preceded them to Hawaii arrived on small wooden [[sailing ship]]s of less than a thousand [[gross tonnage]] capacity, all of the ships involved in the Spanish immigration were large, steel-hulled, passenger [[steamship]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3172">'''''Statsföretag''''' was a Swedish government holding company and [[national wealth fund]] for more than 20 years. The company was created by the [[Swedish Parliament]] to centralize and consolidate state ownership of [[public commercial assets]] especially within heavy industries such as [[shipyard]], [[Steel industry|steel]] and [[forestry industry|forestry]]. During the economic crisis of the 1970s in [[Sweden]], several other assets were [[nationalized]] and the activities of the company became organized along multiple industrial segments.

After severe losses, the company was restructured in 1983 and renamed Procordia, with a number of industrial assets such as [[:sv:Sveaskog|ASSI]], [[LKAB]] and [[SSAB]] transferred and held directly by [[Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation (Sweden)|the Ministry of Industry]]

In 1987, the company was partially privatized and the state participation reduced to 81%. The company shares were listed on October 15, 1987 on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]]. In 1990 Procordia was merged with the pharmaceutical company [[Pharmacia]] and the food company Provendor owned by [[Volvo]]. Consequently, the main owners became [[Volvo]] and the Swedish government. The government shares were held through the wholly owned national wealth fund [[Fortia AB|Fortia]] and subsequently [[Förvaltningsaktiebolaget Stattum|Stattum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/08D0FF12-7902-4165-A054-A8643A4C851B | title=Ekonomisk värde och samhällsnytta – förslag till en ny statlig ägarförvaltning | publisher=[[Statens offentliga utredningar|SOU]] 2012:14 | year=2012 | location=Stockholm |language=sv | isbn=978-91-38-23700-7| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117063423/https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/08D0FF12-7902-4165-A054-A8643A4C851B | archivedate=November 17, 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, with the acquisition of [[Swedish Match]] the company was divided into two separate sub-holdings, being the pharmaceutical segment in Pharmacia and the food segment in Branded Consumer Products. Volvo became the main owner in Branded Consumer Products and ultimately the sole owner in 1994, changing the name to Procordia Food. In 1995 Procordia Food was acquired by  the Norwegian food company [[Orkla ASA|Orkla]] and Pharmacia merged with the US pharmaceutical company Upjohn and became [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]].

In January 1999, [[Förvaltningsaktiebolaget Stattum|Stattum]], the Swedish [[National wealth fund|National Wealth Fund]] sold the Swedish government's remaining 7% in the pharmaceuticals group [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]] in a EUR 1.8bn share offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://media.publicwealthofnations.com/2016/11/Privatisation-International-Euromoney.pdf | title=Sweden: bold, novel approach | publisher=[[Euromoney|Euromoney Institutional Investor]] | work=Privatisation International | date=December 2000 | accessdate=June 23, 2018 | author=[[James Sassoon]] and Martin Pellback, [[UBS Warburg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tausūg''' or '''Suluk''' people are an ethnic group of the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. The Tausūg are part of the wider political identity of Muslims of Mindanao, Sulu and Palawan. Most of the Tausugs have converted into the religion of Islam whose members are now more known as the [[Moro people|Moro]] group, who constitute the third largest ethnic group of [[Mindanao]], [[Sulu]] and [[Palawan]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} The Muslim Tausugs originally had an [[independent state]] known as the [[Sulu Sultanate]], which once exercised sovereignty over the present day provinces of [[Basilan]], [[Palawan]], [[Sulu Province|Sulu]], [[Tawi-Tawi]], the eastern part of the [[States of Malaysia|Malaysian state]] of [[Sabah]] (formerly [[North Borneo]]) and [[North Kalimantan]] in Indonesia.

==Etymology==
"Tausug" means "the people of the current", from the word ''tau'' which means "man" or "people" and ''sūg'' (alternatively spelled ''sulug'' or ''suluk'') which means "[sea] currents".&lt;ref name="haskins"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Haskins|title =The Filipino Nation: , or Tausug could also mean, strong people from the word "tau" means - people, "sug" from the word " kusug - strong. The Philippines : lands and peoples, a cultural geography|publisher =Grolier International|year =1982|page=190|isbn =9780717285099}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Tausūg'' was derived from two words ''tau'' and ''sūg'' (or ''suluk'' in [[Malay language|Malay]]) meaning "people of the current", referring to their homelands in the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. ''Sūg'' and ''suluk'' both mean the same thing, with the former being the phonetic evolution in Sulu of the latter (the L being dropped and thus the two short U's merging into one long U). The Tausūg in Sabah refer to themselves as Tausūg but refers to their ethnic group as "Suluk" as documented in official documents such as birth certificates in [[Sabah]], which are written [[Malay language|Malay]].

==History==

===Pre-Islamic era===
Prior to the establishment of the sultanate, the Tausug lived in communities called a ''banwa''. Each banwa is headed by a leader known as a ''panglima'' along with a healer called a ''mangungubat''. The panglima is usually a man with a strong political and physical leadership among the community folks. The healer may either be a man or a woman, and they are specialized in contacting the spiritual realm. The healers are also exempted from practicing traditional marriage as they can have sensual relationships with the same sex, a common trait in numerous tribes throughout the Philippines archipelago and northern Borneo in pre-Islamic and pre-Christian times. Each banwa is considered as an independent state, the same with the city-states of other regions in Asia. The Tausug during the era had trade relations with other neighboring Tausug banwas, the Yakan of Basilan, and the nomadic Sama Bajau.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;https://www.slideshare.net/CarlaFaner/tausug-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sultanate era===
{{main article|Sultanate of Sulu}}
[[File:Late 19th Century Flag of Sulu.svg|thumb|left|The flag of the Sulu Sultanate in the late 19th century.]]
The history of Sulu begins with [[Makhdum Karim|Karim-ul Makhdum]], a Muslim missionary, who arrived in Sulu in 1380. He introduced the [[Islamic]] faith and settled in Tubig Indangan, Simunul, until his death. The Mosque's pillars at Tubig-Indangan, which he built, still stand. In 1390, [[Rajah Baguinda|Rajah Baguinda Ali]] landed at Buansa, and extended the missionary work of Makhdum. The Johore-born Arab adventurer [[Sharif ul-Hāshim of Sulu|Sayyid Abubakar Abirin]] arrived in 1450, married Baguinda's daughter, Dayang-dayang Paramisuli. After Rajah Baguinda's death, Sayyid Abubakar became Sultan, thereby introducing the [[sultanate]] as a political system (the [[Sultanate of Sulu]]). Political districts were created in Parang, Pansul, Lati, Gitung, and Luuk, each headed by a ''[[panglima]]'' or district leader. After Sayyid Abubakar's death, the sultanate system had already become well established in Sulu. Before the coming of the Spaniards, the ethnic groups in Sulu — the Tausug, [[Samal people|Samal]], [[Yakan]], and [[Bajau]] - were in varying degrees united under the Sulu sultanate, considered the most centralised political system in the Philippines. Called the "[[Spanish–Moro conflict]]", these battles were waged intermittently from 1578 till 1898, between the Spanish colonial government and the [[Moro people|Bangsamoro]] people of [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[File:Sulu Sultanate.png|thumb|right|The Sulu Sultanate at its greatest extent.]]
In 1578, an expedition sent by Gov [[Francisco de Sande]] and headed by Capt. Rodriguez de Figueroa began the 300-year warfare between the Moro Tausūg and the Spanish authorities. In 1579, the Spanish government gave de Figueroa the sole right to colonise Mindanao. In retaliation, the Moro raided Visayan towns in Panay, Negros, and Cebu for they know the Spanish will get foot soldiers in this areas. These were repulsed by Spanish and Visayan forces. In the early 17th century, the largest alliance composed of the Maranao, Maguindanao, Tausūg, and other Moro and Lumad groups, was formed by [[Muhammad Kudarat|Sultan Kudarat]] or Cachil Corralat of Maguindanao, whose domain extended from the Davao Gulf to Dapitan on the Zamboanga peninsula. Several expeditions sent by the Spanish authorities suffered defeat. In 1635, Capt Juan de Chaves occupied Zamboanga and erected a fort. In 1637, Gov Gen Hurtado de Corcuera personally led an expedition against Kudarat, and temporarily triumphed over his forces at Lamitan and Iliana Bay. On 1 January 1638, de Corcuera, with 80 vessels and 2000 soldiers, defeated the Moro Tausūg and occupied Jolo mainly staying inside captured Cottas. A peace treaty was forged. The victory did not establish Spanish sovereignty over Sulu, as the Tausūg abrogated the treaty as soon as the Spaniards left in 1646.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also Paulo Bonavides, Political Sciences (Ciência Política), p. 126. {{verification needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But later Sultanate of Sulu totally gave up its rule over south [[Palawan]] to [[Spain]] in 1705 and over Basilan in 1762. In the last quarter of the 19th century Moros in the Sultanate of Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty, but these areas remained partially controlled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian settlements in Zamboanga and Cotabato (the latter is under [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]]), until they had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish–American War.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1737, Sultan [[Alimud Din I]] for personal interest, entered into a "permanent" peace treaty with Gov Gen F. Valdes y Tamon; and in 1746, befriended the Jesuits sent to Jolo by King Philip. The "permission" of Sultan Azimuddin-I (*the first heir-apparent) allowed the Catholic Jesuits to enter Jolo, but was argued against by his young brother, Raja Muda Maharajah Adinda Datu Bantilan (*the second heir-apparent). Datu Bantilan did not want the Catholic Jesuits to disturb or dishonor the Moro faith in the Sulu Sultanate kingdom. The brothers then fought, causing Sultan Azimuddin-I to leave Jolo and head to Zamboanga, then to [[Manila]] in 1748. Then, Raja Muda Maharajah Adinda Datu Bantilan was proclaimed as Sultan, taking the name as Sultan Bantilan Muizzuddin. He was a "saviour" to the Sulu Sultanate kingdom in 1748. If he had not fought against his brother for permitting the Catholic Jesuits to enter Jolo and spread their "Catholic Doctrine" throughout Sulu, it might have become a Catholic area today.{{by whom|date=October 2015}}{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[File:Tausūg horsemen in Sulu, taken on 30 December 1899 from issue of Leslie s Weekly.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Tausūg horsemen in [[Sulu]], taken on 30 December 1899.]]
In 1893, amid succession controversies, Amir ul Kiram became Sultan Jamalul Kiram II, the title being officially recognised by the Spanish authorities. In 1899, after the defeat of Spain in the Spanish–American War, Col. Luis Huerta, the last governor of Sulu, relinquished his garrison to the Americans. (Orosa 1970:25-30). Prior to modern times, the Tausūg were under the [[Sultanate of Sulu]]. The system is a [[patrilineal]] system, consisting of the title of [[Sultan]] as the sole sovereign of the Sultanate (in Tausūg language: ''Lupah Sug'', literally: "Land of the Current"), followed by various [[Maharajah]] and [[Raja]]h-titled subdivisional princes. Further down the line are the numerous ''Panglima'' or local chiefs, similar in function to the modern [[Philippine]] political post of the Baranggay ''Kapitan'' in the [[Baranggay]] system. Of significance are the Sarip ([[Sharif]]) and their wives, Sharifah, who are [[Hashemite]] descendants of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. They are respected as religious leaders, though some may take up administrative posts.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[File:MatSalleh-Photo.jpg|thumb|right|Mat Salleh (marked with an "X"), a [[Bajau people|Bajau]]-Suluk warrior widely known in [[North Borneo]] (present day [[Sabah]]).]]
In the northern area of [[Borneo]] in Sabah, most of the recognised citizens have lived in the area since the rule of the Sultanate of Sulu.&lt;ref name="Sabahan natives list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.gov.my/main/en-GB/Home/About|title=Sabah's People and History|quote=The [[Kadazan-Dusun]] is the largest ethnic group in Sabah that makes up almost 30% of the population.

===Modern era===

====Philippines====
{{main article|Moro conflict in the Philippines}}
A "policy of attraction" was introduced, ushering in reforms to encourage Muslim integration into Philippine society. "Proxy colonialism" was legalised by the Public Land Act of 1919, invalidating Tausūg ''pusaka'' (inherited property) laws based on the Islamic [[Shariah]]. The act also granted the state the right to confer land ownership. It was thought that the Muslims would "learn" from the "more advanced" Christian Filipinos, and would integrate more easily into mainstream Philippine society. In February 1920, the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives passed Act No 2878, which abolished the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, and transferred its responsibilities to the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes under the Department of the Interior. Muslim dissatisfaction grew as power shifted to the Christian Filipinos. Petitions were sent by Muslim leaders between 1921 and 1924, requesting that Mindanao and Sulu be administered directly by the [[United States]]. These petitions were not granted. Realising the futility of armed resistance, some Muslims sought to make the best of the situation. In 1934, Arolas Tulawi of Sulu, Datu Manandang Piang and Datu Blah Sinsuat of Cotabato, and Sultan Alaoya Alonto of Lanao were elected to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. In 1935, two Muslims were elected to the National Assembly.

The Tausūg in Sulu [[Philippine resistance against Japan#Moro resistance on Mindanao and Sulu|fought against the Japanese occupation of Mindanao and Sulu during World War II]] and eventually drove them out. The Commonwealth sought to end the privileges the Muslims had been enjoying under the earlier American administration. Muslim exemptions from some national laws, as expressed in the administrative code for Mindanao, and the Muslim right to use their traditional Islamic courts, as expressed in the Moro Board, were ended. It was unlikely that the Muslims, who have had a longer cultural history as Muslims than the Filipinos as Christians, would surrender their identity.&lt;!-- Fearing government persecution, he went to the hills. On "death row," he was finally pardoned by Pres Marcos on 11 September 1968.--&gt; This incident contributed to the rise of various separatist movements - the Muslim Independence Movement (MIM), Ansar El-Islam, and Union of Islamic Forces and Organizations (Che Man 1990:74-75). In 1969, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) was founded on the concept of a Bangsa Moro Republic by a group of educated young Muslims. In 1976, negotiations between the Philippine government and the MNLF in Tripoli resulted in the Tripoli Agreement, which provided for an autonomous region in Mindanao. [[Nur Misuari]] was invited to chair the provisional government, but he refused. The referendum was boycotted by the Muslims themselves. The talks collapsed, and fighting continued. On 1 August 1989, Republic Act 673 or the Organic Act for Mindanao, created the Autonomous Region of Mindanao, which encompasses Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

====Malaysia====
[[File:Mustapha Harun.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mustapha Harun]] is the first governor of [[Sabah]], which is of Tausūg-[[Sama-Bajau|Bajau]] descent.]]
Most of the Tausūgs in Malaysia had lived since the rule of the Sultanate of Sulu on parts of Sabah with some of them were actually descendant of a Sulu princess (''Dayang Dayang'') who had escaped from the Sulu Sultan in the 1850s when the Sultan tried to make the princess as a wife although the Sultan already have many [[concubinage|concubine]].&lt;ref name="despised"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Opinion/Columnists/One-Mans-Meat/Profile/Articles/2014/05/26/Despised-for-the-wrong-reasons/|title=Despised for the wrong reasons|author=Philip Golingai|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=26 May 2014|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate themselves from the newly arrived Tausūg immigrants from the Philippines, most of them preferred to be called as "Suluk".&lt;ref name="racism or anger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2013/07/17/racism-or-anger-over-social-injustice/|title=Racism or anger over social injustice?|author=[[Daphne Iking]]|publisher=The Star|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Kids on the Water.JPG|thumb|right|Tausūg refugee children on the water.]]
The Tausūg currently number about 953,000 in the Philippines. They populate the Filipino province of [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] as a majority, and the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Basilan]], [[Tawi-Tawi]], [[Palawan]], [[Metro Cebu|Cebu]] and [[Metro Manila|Manila]] as minorities. Much of these Filipino-Tausūgs have work in neighbouring Sabah, Malaysia as construction labourers in search for better lives. However, many of them have violate the law by [[Illegal immigrants in Malaysia|overstaying illegally]] and involved in criminal activities.&lt;ref name="racism or anger"/&gt; The Filipino-Tausūgs are not recognised as a native to Sabah.&lt;ref name="citizen" group="note"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fausto Barlocco|title=Identity and the State in Malaysia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mU9JAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=snippet&amp;q=immigrant&amp;f=false|date=4 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-93239-0|pages=77–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The native Tausūgs who had lived since the Sulu Sultanate era in Sabah had settled in much of the eastern parts, from [[Kudat]] town in the north, to [[Tawau]] in the south east.&lt;ref name="Sabahan natives list"/&gt; They number around 300,000 with many of them had [[Interracial marriage|intermarried]] with other ethnic groups in Sabah, especially the Bajaus. Most prefer to use the Malay-language ethnonym ''Suluk'' in their birth certificates rather than the native Tausūg to distinguish themselves from their newly arrived Filipino relatives in Sabah. Migration fuelled mainly from Sabah also created a substantial Suluk community in [[Klang Valley|Greater Kuala Lumpur]]. While in [[Indonesia]], most of the communities mainly settled in the northern area of [[North Kalimantan]] like [[Nunukan Regency|Nunukan]] and [[Tarakan, North Kalimantan|Tarakan]], which lies close to their traditional realm. There are around 12,000 &lt;small&gt;(1981 estimate)&lt;/small&gt; Tausūg in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/49638616/Languages-of-Indonesia Languages-of-Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The overwhelming majority of Tausūgs follow [[Islam]], as Islam has been a defining aspect of native Sulu culture ever since Islam spread to the southern Philippines. They follow the traditional Sunni Shafi'i section of Islam, however they retain pre-Islamic religious practices and often practice a mix of [[Islam]] and [[Animism]] in their [[adat]]. A Christian minority exists. During the Spanish occupation, the presence of Jesuit missionaries in the [[Sulu Archipelago]] allowed for the conversion of entire families and even tribes and clans of Tausūgs, and other Sulu natives to Roman Catholicism. For example, [[Azim ud-Din I of Sulu]], the 19th sultan of Sulu was converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and baptised as Don Fernando de Alimuddin, however he reverted to Islam in his later life near death.

Most assimilated Filipino celebrities and politicians of Tausūg descent also tend to follow the Christian religion of the majority instead of the religion of their ancestors. For example, [[Maria Lourdes Sereno]], the 24th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines is of patrilineal Tausūg descent is a born-again Christian. Singer [[Sitti]] is of Tausūg and Samal descent (she claims to be of Mapun heritage, also native to Sulu), is also a Christian.

==Traditional Political Structure==
The political structure of the Tausug is affected by the two economic divisions in the ethnic group, mainly ''parianon'' (people of the landing) and guimbahanon (hill people). Before the establishment of the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], the indigenous pre-Islamic Tausug were organized into various independent communities or community-states called ''banwa''. When Islam arrived and the sultanate was established, the banwa was divided into districts administered by a ''panglima'' (mayor). The panglima are under the sultan (king). The people who held the stability of the community along with the sultan and the panglimas are the ''ruma bichura'' (state council advisers), ''datu raja muda'' (crown price), ''datu maharaja adensuk'' (palace commander), ''datu ladladja laut'' (admiral), ''datu maharaja layla'' (commissioner of customes), ''datu amir bahar'' (speaker of the ruma bichara), ''datu tumagong'' (executive secretary), ''datu juhan'' (secretary of information), ''datu muluk bandarasa'' (secretary of commerce), ''datu sawajaan'' (secretary of interior), ''datu bandahala'' (secretary of finance), ''mamaneho'' (inspector general), ''datu sakandal'' (sultan's personal envoy), ''datu nay'' (ordinance or weapon commander), ''wazil'' (prime minister). A ''mangungubat'' (curer) also has special status in the community as they are believed to have direct contact with the spiritual realm.

The community's people is divided into three classes, which are the nobility (the sultan's family and court), commoners (the free people), and the slaves (war captives, sold into slavery, or children of slaves).&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

==Languages==
{{main article|Surigaonon language|Tausug language}}
[[File:Tausugmap.jpg|thumb|right|A map of the Sulu Archipelago showing the areas in which Tausug is the primary and secondary language spoken.]]
The Tausug language is called "[[Sinug]]" with "Bahasa" to mean Language. The [[Tausug language]] is related to [[Bicolano language|Bicolano]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Visayan languages]], being especially closely related to the [[Surigaonon language]] of the provinces [[Surigao del Norte]], [[Surigao del Sur]] and [[Agusan del Sur]] and the [[Butuanon language|Butuanon]] language of northeastern [[Mindanao]] specially the root '''Tausug''' words without the influence of the Arabic language, sharing many common words. The Tausūg, however, do not consider themselves as [[Visayans|Visayan]], using the term only to refer to Christian [[Visayan languages|Bisaya]]-language speakers, given that the vast majority of Tausūgs are [[Muslims]] in contrast to its very closely related '''[[Surigaonon people|Surigaonon]]''' brothers which are predominantly [[Roman Catholics]]. Tausug is also related to the [[Waray-Waray language]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Tausug also speak [[Chavacano language|Zamboangueño ''Chavacano'']], other [[Visayan languages]] (especially [[Cebuano language]] because of the mass influx of [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] migrants to Mindanao), and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] in the Philippines; [[Malay language|Malay]] in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia; and [[English language|English]] in both Malaysia and Philippines as second languages.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Malaysian Tausūg, descendants of residents when the [[Sulu Sultanate]] ruled the eastern part of [[Sabah]], speak or understand the Sabahan dialect of Suluk, [[Malaysian language]], and some English or [[Simunul]]. Those who come in regular contact with the [[Bajau]] also speak Bajau dialects. By the year 2000, most of the Tausūg children in Sabah, especially in towns of the west side of Sabah, were no longer speaking [[Tausug language|Tausūg]]; instead they speak the Sabahan dialect of Malay and English.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Cultures==
Tausūgs are superb warriors and craftsmen. They are known for the ''[[Pangalay]]'' dance (also known as ''Daling-Daling'' in Sabah), in which female dancers wear artificial elongated fingernails made from brass or silver known as ''janggay'', and perform motions based on the [[Apsara|Vidhyadhari]] (Bahasa Sūg: ''Bidadali'') of pre-Islamic [[Buddhist]] legend. The Tausug are also well known for their ''pis syabit'', a multi-colored woven cloth traditionally worn as a headress or accessory by men. Nowadays, the ''pis syabit'' is also worn by women and students. In 2011, the ''pis syabit'' was cited by the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the traditional craftsmanship category that the government may nominate in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ichcap.org/eng/ek/sub3/pdf_file/domain5/105_Pis_syabit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Darfur report - Page 5 Image 1.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Tent city of 40,000 in [[Darfur]]. ]]
A '''tent city''' is a temporary housing facility made using [[tents]] or other temporary structures.  Informal tent cities may be set up without authorization by [[homelessness|homeless]] people or protesters. As well, state governments or military organizations set up tent cities to house refugees, evacuees, or soldiers. Tent cities set up by homeless people may be similar to [[shanty town]]s, which are informal settlements in which the buildings are made from scrap building materials.

==Military==
In the military, the term "tent city" usually refers to temporary living quarters erected on deployed military bases, such as those found in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] or [[Iraq]]. Depending on the branch of service and the length of time the tent city has been in place, the living space may be equipped with most modern amenities. For sanitary reasons, military tent cities place toilet, shower, and laundry facilities at least {{convert|50|ft|m|0|sp=us}} from living quarters. Also, tents are typically divided into clusters of 8-10 to prevent the rapid spread of fire, which is of utmost concern because of the tent and bedding materials.

==Environmental disasters==
Since [[Hurricane Katrina]] made landfall in August 2005, the term has been used to describe temporary housing sites set up for [[Gulf Coast]] residents who were left homeless by the storm. Some of the tents that were built by [[Seabees]] and funded by the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) are wooden structures covered by tents. With the exception of indoor plumbing, most of the tents have heat, air, and lights. The tent city can hold as many as 250 occupants. Displaced residents are only expected to stay for three to six months.

====Camp Hope: Las Cruces, New Mexico====
Camp Hope is an alternative transitional living project, for the homeless, in the form of camping. It is located on the Mesilla Valley Community of Hope (MVCH) campus and is an alliance  of agencies that address homelessness in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], [[New Mexico]]. The tent city can house 50 people that would otherwise be on the streets, providing them a safe place to seek direct services, healthcare, and find jobs and housing. Camp Hope has provided the homeless with the opportunity to be right next to all the Direct Services the agencies on the MVCH campus provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hopevillagelascruces.wordpress.com/|title=Hope Village Las Cruces|work=Hope Village Las Cruces|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camp was founded in November 2011 with temporary permission from the city of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]. The camp was supposed to disband in March 2012, but there was no funding available to build another shelter and the City Council stated that the tent city benefited the city.

In 2013, with help from engineering students from [[New Mexico State University]], the site was rezoned as a planned unit development (PUD) that sanctioned a permanent campground along with a number of other uses on the non-profit's campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tentcityurbanism.com/2014/04/camp-hope-las-cruces-nm.html|title=Tent City Urbanism: Camp Hope — Las Cruces, NM|author=Andrew Heben|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December 2006, homeless people formed an impromptu tent city on the St. Vincent de Paul property in the 1400 block of Fourth Avenue N. of St. Petersburg in [[Saint Petersburg, Florida]] when dozens of homeless moved off of public land across the street from the society. In early January 2007, city officials noted city codes that prohibit living in tents and gave the society one week to evict the occupants of the tent city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/01/08/Southpinellas/Pickets_greet_mayor_a.shtml | title=Pickets greet mayor at church | publisher=St. Petersburg Times | author=Robert Farley | date=2007-01-08 | accessdate=2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Olympia, Washington====
Camp Quixote, a homeless encampment began as a protest movement of homeless people and homeless advocates against criminalizing "anti-social" legislation that was passed by the city in January 2007 - specifically referring to the ordinance restricting people from sitting on sidewalks. City officials ordered the camp to disband. The Olympia Unitarian Universalist Congregation offered the encampment sanctuary on its property, being familiar with the Seattle faith-based network of homeless encampments.  What began as a protest surrounding homelessness quickly became a faith community protest.  The church community protested the city's insistence of dismantling the community on the grounds that churches maintain a specific land use right that allows t hem to offer sanctuary to the poor (Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA). Eventually, the adversarial protest turned to negotiation with local municipalities, with new ordinances condoning Camp Quixote with specific regulations and a ninety-day limit; option to move to other faith communities' property.  Because of the ardent support of a volunteer team PANZA, the tent city is soon to be transformed into  permanent supportive housing, Quixote Village - winter 2013.

====Seattle, Washington====
[[File:Nickelsville 01.jpg|thumb|Nickelsville toward the end of its stay in [[University District, Seattle|Seattle's University District]].]]
Homeless people have long resorted to seeking shelter in tents, but these communities are one of the first known to be organized by a sponsoring organization (a partnership between the Seattle Housing and Resource Effort and Women's Housing Equality and Enhancement League (SHARE/WHEEL)), and are one of the first in a major U.S. city to be largely accepted by local governments. Contrary to some stereotypes regarding the homeless, many residents of Tent City are employed, mostly in temporary or day labor jobs, but have insufficient income to obtain more permanent housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anitraweb.org/homelessness/faqs/tentcities.html The SHARE/WHEEL Tent City Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312092510/http://anitraweb.org/homelessness/faqs/tentcities.html |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Tent City and Tent City 2, both created in the late 1990s, were created illegally and opposed by the City of Seattle. After being tolerated for some time, they were eventually forced to shut down. In March 2002, as a result of a legal battle, city attorney Tom Carr and SHARE/WHEEL attorney Ted Hunter signed a court ordered [[consent decree]] with SHARE, allowing Tent City only on private land (by invitation) and setting standards for its operation.

Based on the consent decree Tent City 3 was created and rotates around the Metro Seattle Core. [[Tent City 4]] was created in May 2004 as an attempt to expand beyond the consent decree and use public land and resources, something the consent decree does not allow. This attempt was unsuccessful and Tent City 4 has since been relocated to eastern King County where it is church sponsored. Tent City rules do not allow [[drug abuse|drug]] or alcohol use, and evicts anyone caught stealing or committing other crimes within the camp. Tent City 3 stayed an average of three weeks at each encampment before 2004, while Tent City 4 has stayed in place for as long as 100 days. Tent City 3's stays have since then averaged between 60 and 90 days, with 90 days or so being a common length of stay. Cities have been adopting code amendments that limit stays to 60–90 days.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====King County, Washington====
{{main|Tent City 4}}

Tent City 4 (TC4) is a homeless encampment of up to 100 people created in May 2004 in eastern [[King County, Washington|King County]] outside of Seattle. Residents are adult men and women, although there is a provision for quartering minor dependents in emergency situations. Residents may have their own tents or single men or women may stay in gender specific community tents. [[Dumpster]]s and portable toilets are provided by SHARE and there is a portable shower.  The community currently relocates every three to four months on the property of Eastern King County churches upon invitation.  Proponents state that the average length of residency per inhabitant is six weeks, with fewer long-term than short-term members.&lt;ref name=TC4FAQ&gt;[http://www.northshoreucc.org/NUCC%20Website/TC4FAQ.htm Tent City 4 Background Information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724104520/http://www.northshoreucc.org/NUCC%20Website/TC4FAQ.htm |date=2006-07-24 }}. Northshore United Church of Christ. Retrieved on June 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents challenge this claim citing SHARE'S testimony to King County and City of Seattle elected officials that they do not keep any data on residents in order to protect their privacy. While the percentage varies based on the occupants, many of the residents work part or full-time for area businesses as [[day labor]]ers or permanent employees.&lt;ref name=TC4FAQ/&gt; Tent City 9 governance consists of an Advisor similar to an executive, and a rotating Executive Committee elected by the community in a one-person, one vote structure.

Tent City 4 has differentiated itself from other temporary encampments since 2004 due to its standard of requiring a signed "Code of Conduct" and performing warrant checks and sex offender checks on all potential residents.&lt;ref name=TC4FAQ/&gt;  By signing the "Code of Conduct" the residents agree to abstain from drugs and alcohol while at the camp and share responsibility for site security and maintenance.

Tent City 4 advocates cite statements from local police and newspapers that there have been no increases in crime in the areas that Tent City 4 has been located in&lt;ref name=kcso&gt;Tuinstra, Rachel.

In July 2007 the [[Washington Court of Appeals]] upheld the [[King County Superior Court]] ruling against SHARE and NUCC allowing the city to collect the fines levied. Tent City 4 had hoped to relocate to the First Evangelical Lutheran Church in [[Bothell, Washington|Bothell]] and received permits to do so on August 11,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.bothell.wa.us/dept/CM/PIO/NewsEvents/releases/2006/081106TentCity.html City of Bothell Issues Transitory Accommodations Permit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828200034/http://www.ci.bothell.wa.us/dept/CM/PIO/NewsEvents/releases/2006/081106TentCity.html |date=2006-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected the permit due to the number of conditions on the permit and instead moved to a backup site at Woodinville Unitarian Universalist Church (WUUC) after receiving a permit from King County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/eastsidenews/2003193712_tentcity12e.html|title=The Seattle Times: Eastside News: Tent city heads to backup site|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition Park, Camden, New Jersey====
A community of 50 to 150 people had taken up residence in [[Camden, New Jersey]], nestled on the right side of the ramp of I676 West exit 5A.  Although attempts have been made to find housing for the population, no one in the community has been placed.  Transition Park’s Mayor and City Council continued to protect their community and seek medical attention for those in need. In May 2010, residents were forced out of the city and into local missions.

Under the leadership of Amir Khan, the pastor of Solid Rock Worship Center in Clementon, NJ, and founder of the Nehemiah Group, a faith-based nonprofit organization that Khan and his son Micah run, 54 residents of Tent City were moved to the Wingate by Wyndham Hotel in Mount Laurel in May 2010 with the help of volunteers. Pastor Khan asked his congregation and local business members for help and was able to raise $250,000 to provide some homeless people of Camden's Tent City  with housing and human services for at least one year.

Although these homeless men and women were initially moved to a hotel and received a spa treatment upon arrival, months later drugs and alcohol are taking a toll on their adjustment to life in their new environments. On a positive side, Lorenzo Banks, the ex-self-appointed Mayor of Tent City and James Boggs, another Tent City leader got jobs providing homeless outreach for Volunteers of America-Delaware Valley in Collingswood, NJ. Although several people also enrolled in community college, mental illness, addiction issues and a lack of affordable housing illustrate the road blocks to a healthy life for Tent City residents over the long-term.

By September 13, 2010, 19 of the original 54 were removed from the "hotel program" and many former Tent City residents continue to move from one street corner or overpass to another, continuing the homelessness issue in Camden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/transition-tent-city-camden-2010-5|title=Welcome To "Transition Park", The Horrible Tent City In Camden, NJ|date=6 May 2010|work=Business Insider|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transitionpark.com/ Official Website of Transition Park Tent City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910001328/http://www.transitionpark.com/ |date=2010-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20100612_Tough_times_for_former_residents_of_Camden_s_Tent_City.html|title=Tough times for former residents of Camden's Tent City|work=philly-archives|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courierpostonline/access/2031630381.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=May+12%2C+2010|title=Courier-Post: Archives|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37001384/|title=N.J.’s Tent City closes as homeless go to hotel  - US news - Giving - NBC News|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courierpostonline/access/2124269471.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Aug+16%2C+2010|title=Courier-Post: Archives|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/20100506_As_Camden_s_Tent_City_closes__residents_get_spa_treatment.html#ixzz10k7liM3y As Camden's Tent City closes, residents get spa treatment]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708162546/http://dailyme.com/story/2010091300000796/tent-city-denizens-back-encampment.html Some former Tent City denizens back in another encampment]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Toronto, Ontario====
[[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada's largest city, was also home to its own "Tent City" until September 2002, when the residents of Tent City were evicted by the owner of the property, [[Home Depot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/09/24/tentcity_eviction020924.html "Homeless evicted from Toronto's 'tent city'"], [[cbc.ca]], September 25, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was situated in the downtown core of Toronto, near the waterfront, and was home to hundreds of people who were homeless.

Tent City was mainly self-governed, as police would not usually enter it unless a major crime was committed. One of the oldest residents of Tent City became the appointed "Mayor Karl Schmidt" and oversaw the operation of the city and helped deal with the crime that did occur. In one instance a resident who was leaving Tent City sold his shelter twice to two separate individuals, making a profit for himself and leaving the buyers to resolve the dispute. There were also citizens who turned to theft in order to make money. Despite these conditions, there were some residents who felt more secure in Tent City than they did in the government shelters and chose to live in a self-regulated area where they could defend themselves.

When Tent City was closed, [[Home Depot]] evicted the residents with private security guards and the support of the Toronto Police Service. A formal property claim system was instituted where individuals were allowed to briefly return to the site to retrieve personal property before being permanently removed from the area. This action was criticized by activist groups as an attempt by Home Depot to clear land to develop a downtown big box outlet, however, the Ontario Municipal Board had previously ruled that a store could not be built on the site. After the eviction, the City of Toronto made shelter spaces available for each of the roughly 110 people removed.  Three years later, at the end of 2005, the land remained undeveloped, and Home Depot has since opened a downtown outlet at [[Gerrard Square]], a mall that sits on the corner of Pape and Gerrard.

Toronto introduced rent supplement programs in the following year (2002–2004) by which 115 residents were given access to mainstream apartment units.

Journalist [[Shaughnessy Bishop-Stall]] voluntarily abandoned his middle class lifestyle to live in Tent City for a year. He received very little outside assistance and [[begging|begged for money]] to sustain himself. He detailed his experiences in a book, ''Down to This: Squalor and Splendour in a Big-city Shantytown''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/book_awards/2005/down_to_this.htm ''Down to This: Squalor and Splendour in a Big-city Shantytown''], [[City of Toronto Book Awards]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, fire and disease outbreaks were constant concerns. Since the late 1990s, Saudi authorities have started using fireproof tents to reduce the risks of a major fire.

===Klondike and Nome Gold Rushes===
During the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in Alaska and Canada 1896&amp;ndash;1899 several tent camps were built along the routes to the gold fields especially on the popular Dyea/Skagway route where it met Lake Bennett and Lake Lindeman the head of Yukon River. At the [[Nome Gold Rush]], between 1899 and 1909, a tent city sprung up that was 30 miles long, on the beaches and on the treeless coast of [[Nome, Alaska]] between Cape Rodney and Cape Nome.

===Persepolis===
For the festivities of the [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy]] the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], built a luxurious tent city in the desert next to the ruins of [[Persepolis]] to accommodate his international guests. The event took place October 12–16, 1971. The tent city was inspired by the tent city of the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] meeting between [[Francis I of France]] and [[Henry VIII of England]] that took place in 1520.

===Kent State University===
On May 12, 1977, a tent city was erected and maintained for a period of more than 60 days by a group of several dozen protesters on the campus of [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio]], [[United States]].  The protesters, led by the May 4 Coalition but also including community members and local clergy, were attempting to prevent the university from erecting a gymnasium annex on part of the site where the [[Kent State shootings]] occurred in May 1970, which they believed would alter and obscure that historical event. Law enforcement finally brought the tent city to an end on July 12, 1977, after the forced removal and arrest of 193 people. The event gained national press coverage and the issue was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.may41970.com/Tent%20City/gym.htm|title= Tent City and Gym Struggle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.library.kent.edu/special-collections-and-archives/gym-annex-controversy-tent-city-records|website=Kent State University Libraries : Special Records and Archives|title=Gym Annex Controversy (Tent City) records}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/sw-us/1977-81/SW_005_August_1977.pdf|title=Tent City at Kent State|publisher=Socialist Worker|author=Patterson, Doug|page=11|date=August 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners were routinely released from custody prior to completing their sentence due to the overcrowding.  In a study conducted in 1993 it was estimated that construction of a new facility would cost approximately $70,000,000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Sheriff Arpaio, concerned about the cost of a new facility and reasoning that military tents were good enough for the men and women of the U.S. armed forces who fought in the [[Gulf War]], ordered that tent jails be constructed using inmate labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcso.org/JailInformation/TentCity.aspx MCSO: Tent City Jail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117161910/http://www.mcso.org/JailInformation/TentCity.aspx |date=2015-01-17 }} ''dead link''&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of [[Korean War]]-era tents donated by the [[United States armed forces]], and a 50&amp;nbsp;ft (15.4 m) [[observation tower]] with a vacancy sign mounted on the front. The final cost of the project was approximately $100,000 and it is capable of housing over 2,400 inmates.

[[File:WithdrawnOffshoreAreas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Federal offshore areas withdrawn from oil and gas leasing.]]

The '''U.S. offshore drilling debate''' is an ongoing debate in the [[United States]] on whether or not, the extent to which, in which areas, and under what conditions, further [[offshore drilling]] should be allowed in U.S.-administered waters. 
[[Image:PlatformHolly.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Oil drilling platform about two miles (3 km) off the coast of California, near Santa Barbara.]]
The issue saw increased coverage when President [[George W. Bush]] in July 2008 lifted a 1990 executive order by [[George H. W. Bush]] banning offshore drilling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush lifts executive ban on offshore oil drilling|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/14/bush.offshore/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-09-27 | date=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time calling for drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name='la'&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush 43 urges offshore drilling that Bush 41 banned|author=Johanna Neuman|author2=Richard Simon |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/presidentbush/2008/06/bush-43-urges-o.html|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of offshore drilling became central in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], not least because of the [[oil price increases since 2003]]. It is also being debated in terms of both environmental issues and [[U.S. energy independence]]. As of September 2008, President [[Barack Obama]] is for limited offshore drilling as part of an extensive energy independence overhaul.&lt;ref name='la'/&gt;

Bush's energy policy was named "drill and veto" by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U.S. House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pelosi: Bush Administration’s Energy Policy is ‘Drill and Veto’|url=http://www.house.gov/pelosi/press/releases/May08/drill-veto.html|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]]|accessdate=2008-09-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080802174732/http://www.house.gov/pelosi/press/releases/May08/drill-veto.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands (DRILL) Act (H.R. 6515) is one of the bills discussed in the Congress about drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Action on Gas Prices &amp; Energy Independence|url=http://speaker.gov/issues?id=0031#13|publisher=[[Nancy Pelosi]]|accessdate=2008-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002112628/http://speaker.gov/issues?id=0031#13|archive-date=2008-10-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Florida, many counties, cities, chambers of commerce, and other local agencies have passed resolutions against oil drilling in Florida waters.&lt;ref&gt;Map of Resolutions Passed Against Offshore Oil Drilling in Florida http://www.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=106172446447503097421.000480838fe1fe5d92709&amp;z=6&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2010, President Obama announced that he was opening new areas in U.S. coastal waters to offshore drilling for gas and oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/31/AR2010033100024.html |author=Juliet Eilperin and Anne E.

Broder and Clifford Krauss |title=U.S. Halts Plan to Drill in Eastern Gulf |publisher=New York Times |date=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

As interpreted by the federal courts, the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] gives the federal government certain regulatory power over "[[navigable waters]]" of the United States.  The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 and Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, along with the 1960 Supreme Court decision in ''United States v. States of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida'', divided ownership of the [[tidelands]] of the United States between state and federal governments.  States own the sea and seabed out to {{convert|3.5|mi|km}}, except Texas and Florida which own out to {{convert|10.5|mi|km}}. The federal government owns the remainder of the [[territorial waters]].

The 28 January 1969 [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] at a [[Unocal Corporation|Unocal]] [[Drilling rig|rig]], which spilled {{convert|3|e6USgal|m3}} of [[petroleum]] off the coast of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]], resulted in drilling bans in offshore California and Florida.&lt;ref name='wp'&gt;{{cite news|title=Offshore Drilling Backed as Remedy for Oil Prices|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/13/AR2008071302052.html|author=Steven Mufson|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2008-09-27 | date=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshore drilling has continued in offshore Texas and Louisiana. In 2006, an {{convert|8300000|acre|km2|adj=on}} area in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] known as lease 181 was opened for exploration.&lt;ref name='wp'/&gt; The existing moratorium on leasing on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]] expired in 2012, and the debate is on whether or not to extend it.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2018, a new federal initiative to expand offshore drilling suddenly excluded Florida, but although this would be favored by Floridians, concerns remain about the basis for that apparently arbitrary exception being merely politically motivated and tentative. No scientific, military, or economic basis for the decision was given, provoking continuing public concern in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Compton, Glenn, ''[http://thebradentontimes.com/reasons-not-to-drill-for-oil-offshore-of-florida-p19415-137.htm 10 Reasons Not to Drill for Oil Offshore of Florida]'', The Bradenton Times, Sunday, January 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}}

==Positive Effects of Off-Shore Oil Rigs==
===Energy independence===
{{main|United States energy independence|North American energy independence}}
[[Image:Imported Crude Oil as a Percent of US Consumption 1950-2003.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Imported crude oil as a percent of U.S. consumption.]] 
A common argument in favor of offshore drilling is it reduces United States dependency on imported oil. Geopolitically, the U.S. would be less vulnerable to sanctions by oil-producing countries hostile to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It would also make the United States less vulnerable to a stop in a country's oil exports, due to, for example, a civil war or an invasion of that country. The debate often makes references to the [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1979 energy crisis]].

===Fuel price===
One motivation of increased offshore drilling is to reduce the current fuel prices. In 2007, the [[Energy Information Administration]] at the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Dep. of Energy]] analyzed the effect of lifting the ban on oil and gas leasing on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oil Drum |url=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4621#more |title=Presidential Energy Debate Fact Check #1: Is Offshore Drilling the Answer? |publisher=The Oil Drum |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; With leasing beginning in 2012, the agency projected that production of oil would not be expected to start before 2017, and that as a result US oil production by 2030 would be 7% higher than it would be otherwise. The effect on fuel prices, however, would be "insignificant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/otheranalysis/ongr.html |title=EIA - Impacts of Increased Access to Oil and Natural Gas Resources in the Lower 48 Federal Outer Continental Shelf |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] estimated that with increased offshore leasing and drilling, the price of oil would only drop about 3–4 cents in 15 to 20 years.&lt;ref name="sierra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node/2179 |title=California Knows: Offshore Drilling Doesn’t Make 'Cents'. |author=Metropulos, Jim |publisher=Sierra Club California |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade deficit===
Oil produced from offshore drilling reduces oil imports, and thus lessens the U.S. [[trade deficit]]. From mid-2017 to early 2018, crude oil imports increased from $45 per barrel to $62 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price?type=wti|title=Oil Price |publisher=Business Insider |date=2018-03-07 |accessdate=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the trade deficit was already massive before its increase due to increasing oil prices, it is important to consider all options to lower the deficit including expanded national oil production.

==Negative Effects of Off-Shore Oil Rigs==

===Military training===
In 2005, U.S. Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] stated that offshore drilling would disrupt military training and weapons testing, if done in an area of the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/ntn55182.htm |title=Alexander's Gas &amp; Oil Connections - Offshore drilling is incompatible with military missions in Gulf of Mexico |publisher=Gasandoil.com |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Relations===
Although offshore drilling has long been banned in federal waters off the state of [[Florida]], [[Cuba]] has been drilling its own offshore area near Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1853252,00.html Time (23 October 2008): ''How Cuba's oil could change the US embargo'']. Retrieved 17 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject became an issue in the 2008 presidential race, with assertions and denials of the reality of Cuban offshore drilling.  On 31 October 2008, Brazilian and Cuban presidents [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] and [[Raul Castro]] attended a ceremony at which the Brazilian oil company [[Petrobras]] agreed to drill for oil in Cuban offshore waters near Florida.&lt;ref&gt;"Petrobras signs with Cuba", ''World Oil'', December 2008, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2011 Petrobas had withdrawn from the agreement due to poor prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petrobas abandons oil exploration in Cuba|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/03/10/petrobras-abandons-oil-exploration-in-cuba-all-eyes-set-on-repsol-ypf|publisher=MercoPress|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Russia has begun drilling in the black sea with a Chinese-made oil rig, Scarabeo 9. Since the rig wasn't built in the U.S. and was agreed to before the imposition of additional sanctions by the E.U. in 2014, Russia has been able to avoid sanctions and operate the rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanctions-Proof Oil Rig Thwarts U.S. Policy From Cuba to Russia|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/sanctions-proof-oil-rig-thwarts-u-s-policy-from-cuba-to-russia|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil spills===
Offshore facilities pose an environmental risk of [[oil spills]].  On April 20, 2010, an underwater blowout and subsequent explosion and fire [[Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion|destroyed]] the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' rig owned by [[Transocean|Transocean Ltd.]] and operating in the Gulf of Mexico under lease to energy giant [[BP]], resulting in the largest oil spill in United States history. 5 million barrels of oil were spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, leading to $21.5 billion (or $4300 per barrel) of clean-up costs paid by [[BP]].

[[File:BP Oil spill Costs.jpg|thumb|BP Oil spill costs broken down by category]]
To the right are the costs of the BP oil spill broken down by category. 
The image doesn't include the $15+ million in tax breaks that BP was able to save. Also, BP has continued to pay out settlements since the graphic was created in 2011 so the orange section in the graph should be larger than it is.

===Negative Externalities of Oil Spills===
Oil spills create numerous [[negative externalities]] that hurt the local and national economy of the place where the oil spill occurred. 
# Economy loses money due to decreased production of fisherman: when oil spills occur they lead to the death of many fish in the affected areas. Not only does this affect endangered species and impact the local ecosystem, it also decreases profits of fisherman and thus suppresses the economy. Additionally, the reputation of the fisherman to be able to provide a certain amount and quality of fish is damaged. This further hurts them economically since people won't trust them as much to deliver on their promises and so won't be willing to pay as much for their services. This type of loss is a [[reputational risk]], which is hard to measure but still certainly a negative externality.
# Local businesses lose income from decreased tourism: When an oil spill happens, the waters become dirty and people are less likely to want to vacation in the location where the spill happened. This causes a decrease in profits gained by local businesses due to tourists. Additionally, the place suffers from a decrease in its [[brand valuation]]: for example, in the BP oil spill, Florida's reputation for high-quality, natural marine-based resources was tarnished, and so they lost interest from tourists and hotels and local business made less profits than they would have without the oil spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negative Externalities and Oil Spills: A Case for Reduced Brand Value to the State of Florida|url=https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/155411/2/jaae453ip2.pdf|publisher=https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/155411/2/jaae453ip2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Health costs of cleanup workers in the front line: When an oil spill happens, the company that operates the rig must hire clean up staff to fix the spill. The hazardous conditions that stem from leaking oil are damaging to the workers' health, often causing them to develop [[respiratory disease]] and other health complications that can permanently impact their health.
# Costs of wildlife and breeding grounds lost: These also impact tourism, as one of the main reasons people vacation to places with natural resources is to see wildlife. Additionally, throwing off the balance of the ecosystem by disrupting breeding grounds and killing endangered species can have wide-reaching effects economically on the supply of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIST OF NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES OF OIL SPILL|url=http://simplyeducate.me/2013/08/30/list-of-negative-and-positive-externalities-of-oil-spill/|publisher=Patrick Regoniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Negative Externalities For Wiki Project.jpg|thumb|Picture of how to correct for negative producer externality]]

This picture shows how the market can correct for a negative production externality. Once the externality is taken into account, it shifts the producer curve up in the graph, making it more expensive to produce the same amount of the good. The socially optimal quantity is lower than the market quantity, and socially optimal price is higher. By shifting the demand curve up and reaching this new equilibrium, the [[deadweight loss]] (the shaded triangle in the graph) can be avoided.

===Positive Externalities of Oil Spills===
There are some [[positive externalities]] that oil spills create, but these are outweighed by the [[negative externalities]].
# Thousands of workers are hired for the cleanup: Though this can damage the workers' health as was previously stated, hiring thousands of workers involves paying them salaries which increases the flow of money into the economy. The workers derive economic benefit from salary that they wouldn't have otherwise had and the economy benefits from their additional spending and consumption.
# Millions of dollars are spent by the party responsible on other necessities, such as products to clean the water, portable toilets, hotel rooms for the clean-up workers, etc. This influx of money into the public economy from a private company is a [[positive externality]] of oil spills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://environment.knoji.com/negative-and-positive-externalities-of-the-gulf-oil-spill/|title=Negative and Positive Externalities of the Gulf Oil Spill |publisher=Patric Regoniel |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal [[Minerals Management Service]] gave permission to BP and dozens of other oil companies to drill in the Gulf of Mexico without first getting required permits that assesses threats to [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/us/14agency.html?hp | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Said to Allow Drilling Without Needed Permits | first=Ian | last=Urbina | date=2010-05-13 | accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the BP Oil spill, BP was sued by the [[Defenders of Wildlife]] and the Southern Environmental Law Center for imperiling 32 threatened or endangered species. These included the sperm whale, gulf sturgeon, manatee and five kinds of sea turtles, in addition to the surrounding water and habitats that were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://defenders.org/press-release/bp-be-sued-over-harm-endangered-species | work=Defenders.org | title=BP TO BE SUED OVER HARM TO ENDANGERED SPECIES| date=2010-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With every oil spill, endangered species in the area get closer to extinction.

==Public opinion==
Polls by independent national polling concerns in the US generally show majorities in favor of offshore drilling.

The Pew Research Center, which had documented a large and sharp drop in support for allowing more offshore drilling following the ''Deepwater Horizon'' spill in 2010 (down to 44% in favor versus 52% against), found that by March 2012, support for increased offshore drilling had returned to its pre-Deepwater Horizon level, with 65% in favor versus 31% against.&lt;ref&gt;Pew Research Center, [http://www.people-press.org/2012/03/19/as-gas-prices-pinch-support-for-oil-and-gas-production-grows/ As prices pinch, support for oil and gas production grows], 19 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of CNN polls 2008-2011 showed that support for increased offshore drilling dropped from 75% before the ''Deepwater Horizon'' spill to 57% shortly after. By April 2011, support had increased to 69%, versus 31% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Opinion Research Corp., [http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/04/18/rel6g.pdf], 19 Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gallup organization found 50% support for increased offshore drilling in May 2010, a month after the ''Deepwater Horizon'' explosion. By March 2011, that support had increased to 60% in favor versus 37% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Saad, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/146615/oil-drilling-gains-favor-americans.aspx U.S. Oil drilling gains favor with Americans], Gallup, 14 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study conducted in 2018 by the Pew Research Center found that 51% of Americans now oppose expanded offshore oil rigs versus 42% favoring expanded offshore oil rigs. This represents a 10% decline in those favoring offshore oil rigs since 2014. Generally, people who live within 25 miles of the coastline oppose offshore oil drilling more so than those who live farther from the coast. Also, Democrats oppose additional rig development at a rate of 71%, while only 22% of Democrats favor more offshore oil rigs. On the other hand, 70% of Republicans favor increased offshore drilling in comparison to 25% opposition. Lastly, younger people (aged 18–49) oppose increased offshore drilling at a rate of 58%, compared to only 42% opposition for people aged older than 49. 
&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Jones, [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/30/more-americans-oppose-than-favor-increased-offshore-drilling/ UMore Americans oppose than favor increased offshore drilling], Pew Research Center, 15 Jan. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youth voice''' refers to the distinct ideas, opinions, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, [[knowledge]], and [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s of [[youth|young people]] as a collective body. The term '''youth voice''' often groups together a diversity of perspectives and experiences, regardless of backgrounds, identities, and cultural differences. It is frequently associated with the successful application of a variety of [[youth development]] activities, including [[service learning]],&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, J., McIntyre-Craig, C., &amp; Myers, C. (2000). "Youth voice: The essential element of service-learning," In C. Myers and M. Bellener (Eds.) ''Embedding service-learning into teacher education: Issue briefs.''

(pp. 131-156): Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and leadership training.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, J., Nicola, S. &amp; Menke, T. (2006) "[http://www.joe.org/joe/2006december/tt6.shtml Listening to the Youth Voice in Planning Leadership Development Programs]," ''Journal of Extension. 44''6. December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research has shown that engaging youth voice is an essential element of effective organizational development among community and youth-serving organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Zeldin, S.

== Applications ==
Many [[youth organizations]] and community activities cite youth voice as an important factor to their successful operations.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) [http://www.commonaction.org/publications.htm Washington Youth Voice Handbook] Olympia, WA: CommonAction(2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[Positive Youth Development]] also promotes youth voice by striving to inspire confidence and social engagement for young people.&lt;ref name="Lerner PYD"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lerner|first=R.M.|author2=Almerigi, J.B. |author3=Theokas, C. |author4=Lerner, J.V. |title=Positive Youth Development|journal=Journal of Early Adolescence|year=2005|volume=25|issue=1|pages=10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[School]]-oriented youth voice efforts include the [[VicSRC]], an Australian [[student voice]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A.

==Movement==
A broad international movement exists to promote youth voice, born from earlier [[youth service]] and [[youth rights]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2004) [http://www.nylc.org/rc_downloaddetail.cfm?emoid=14:176 "The Youth Voice Movement: A New Vision for the Future, or a Lost Dream of the Past?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135712/http://www.nylc.org/rc_downloaddetail.cfm?emoid=14:176 |date=September 28, 2007 }} ''The Generator'', Spring 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] was the first international mechanism to stipulate the systemic engagement of youth voice. Specific aims are stated in Articles 5 and 12 that clearly acknowledge the youth have a voice, that youth voice is constantly changing, and that all areas of our society are morally responsible for engaging youth voice. Annual events which center on youth voice include [[Global Youth Service Day]] and the [[National Service Learning Conference]].

== Criticism ==
[[Ephebiphobia]] and [[adultism]] have been identified as the factors preventing widespread recognition of youth voice throughout communities.&lt;ref&gt;Felix, A. (2003) [http://www.ysa.org/yvi/resources/MakingYouthVoiceACommunityPrinciple.pdf Making Youth Voice a Community Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221181122/http://www.ysa.org/yvi/resources/MakingYouthVoiceACommunityPrinciple.pdf |date=February 21, 2007 }} ''Youth Service Journal'', October 2003, Youth Service America.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is commonly acknowledged that "little quantitative research has been conducted regarding the issue of youth voice",&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, J., &amp; Caldwell, L. L. (2001). [http://rptsweb.tamu.edu/Faculty/Witt/conpubs/Caldwell%20Teen%20Center.PDF "Increasing youth voice through participation in a recreation-based teen center"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230102920/http://rptsweb.tamu.edu/Faculty/Witt/conpubs/Caldwell%20Teen%20Center.PDF |date=December 30, 2006 }}. College Park, PA: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; while the qualitative research on youth voice is often seen as minimally effective, as well, due to a limited scope focused on [[youth participation]] in decision-making and opinion-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Beilenson, J. (1993). "Looking for young people, listening for youth voice." ''Social Policy, 24''1, pp 8–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K. &amp; Perkins, D. (2005) [http://www.joe.org/joe/2005october/a5.shtml "Determining the Quality of Youth-Adult Relationships Within Community-Based Youth Programs"], ''Journal of Extension. 43''(5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth voice also faces criticism from the [[youth rights]] movement that it does not go far enough, or that it is using youth.  Critics claim that youth voice advocates only advance a shallow analysis of [[ageism]] and propose solutions that do not go far enough to give youth any substantive power in society.  Coupled with [[youth service]] this can lead to young people being pressured to help fix adult problems without ever addressing the problems youth face.&lt;ref&gt;Koroknay-Palicz, Alex. [http://oneandfour.org/archives/2006/02/a_critique_of_t.html "A Critique of the Youth Service Movement"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045853/http://oneandfour.org/archives/2006/02/a_critique_of_t.html |date=September 28, 2007 }}.
