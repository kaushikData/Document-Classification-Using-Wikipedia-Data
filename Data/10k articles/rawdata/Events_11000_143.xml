The '''1984 Guinean coup d'état''' was the bloodless [[Military of Guinea|military]] [[coup d'état|coup]] that took place in [[Guinea]] on 3 April 1984, led by Colonel [[Lansana Conté]].&lt;ref name=coup&gt;{{web cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/04/world/guinea-s-military-assumes-control-seals-off-nation.html|title=GUINEA'S MILITARY ASSUMES CONTROL; SEALS OFF NATION|author=|date=4 April 1984|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It led to the deposition of [[List of Prime Ministers of Guinea|Prime Minister]] [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who held the office since 1972, and assumed interim presidential powers on 26 March, when the long-time [[List of Presidents of Guinea|President]] [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] died during an emergency heart operation at the [[Cleveland Clinic]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/27/obituaries/ahmed-sekou-toure-guinean-president-62-dies-conakry-guinea-march-26-upi.html|title=AHMED SEKOU TOURE, GUINEAN PRESIDENT, 62, DIES|author=|date=27 March 1984|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/28/obituaries/ahmed-sekou-toure-a-radical-hero.html|title=Ahmed Sekou Toure, a Radical Hero|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=March 28, 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The coup==
Colonel Conté announced the dissolution of the ruling [[Democratic Party of Guinea – African Democratic Rally|Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG), the [[National Assembly (Guinea)|National Assembly]] and all mass organizations, suspension of the [[Constitution of Guinea|Constitution]], creation of the [[Military Committee of National Restoration]] (CMNR) as the ruling [[Military junta|junta]],&lt;ref name=coup/&gt; and ordered release of political prisoners held at [[Camp Boiro]] [[concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/12/world/in-post-coup-guinea-a-jail-is-thrown-open.html|title=IN POST-COUP GUINEA, A JAIL IS THROWN OPEN|author=|date=12 April 1984|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conté was named new President on 5 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/06/world/colonel-is-named-guinean-president.html|title=COLONEL IS NAMED GUINEAN PRESIDENT|author=|date=6 April 1984|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Eventually, a power struggle developed between Conté and a fellow member of the CMNR, [[Diarra Traoré]] (who briefly served as Prime Minister in April–December 1984), with the latter being executed in the aftermath of a failed coup attempt in July 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/06/world/coup-attempt-foiled-in-guinea-army-searches-for-rebel-leader.html|title=COUP ATTEMPT FOILED IN GUINEA; ARMY SEARCHES FOR REBEL LEADER|author=|date=6 July 1985|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/08/world/leader-of-guinea-uprising-to-be-shot-president-says.html|title=LEADER OF GUINEA UPRISING TO BE SHOT, PRESIDENT SAYS|author=|date=8 July 1985|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conté took advantage of the coup attempt to execute several of Ahmed Sekou Touré's close associates, including his half-brother [[Ismaël Touré]] (former chief prosecutor at Camp Boiro), [[Mamadi Keïta]], [[Siaka Touré]] (former commander of Camp Boiro), [[Moussa Diakité]],{{sfn|Lewin|2009|pp=27}} and [[Abdoulaye Touré]] (former [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Guinea)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIiHwg3Y5u4C&amp;pg=PA195|page=195|chapter=Toure, Al Jajj Abdoulaya|title=Historical dictionary of Guinea|author=Thomas O'Toole, Janice E. Baker|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2005|ISBN=0-8108-4634-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conté remained in power until his death on 22 December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jFamnEzZhIYHzv_eUXSc1TxAMfkA "Guinea's long-time military leader Conte dies"], AFP, 23 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/23/africa/AF-Guinea-Obit-Conte.php "Guinea's dictator, Lansana Conte, dies"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 23 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which was almost immediately followed by another [[2008 Guinean coup d'état|coup d'état]], led by Captain [[Moussa Dadis Camara]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jaQPxwTr7Ls-HVfZkk2xle0dPUhQD9589THO0 "Military-led group announces coup in Guinea"], Associated Press, 23 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/world/death-of-guinea-dictator-prompts-coup-20081223-741k.html "Death of Guinea dictator prompts 'coup'"], AFP (''Sydney Morning Herald''), 23 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1984 Llŷn Peninsula earthquake''' struck the [[Llŷn Peninsula]] in [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]] on Thursday 19 July 1984 at 06:56 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (07:56 [[British Summer Time|BST]]). It measured 5.4 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]], and is the largest onshore earthquake to occur in the UK since instrumental measurements began.&lt;ref name="BGS3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/education/faqs/faq9.html |title=BGS FAQ What are the largest two instrumental, onshore earthquakes? |publisher=[[British Geological Survey|BGS]] |accessdate=10 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009144245/http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/education/faqs/faq9.html |archivedate=9 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BGS1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/historical/historical_listing.htm#19841907|title=19 July 1984 Lleyn Peninsula|publisher=BGS|accessdate=10 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609145252/http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/historical/historical_listing.htm#19841907|archive-date=9 June 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects were felt throughout Wales, most of England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. There were many reports of minor damage to chimneys and masonry throughout Wales and England, the biggest concentration of damage being in [[Liverpool]], which is located around 65 miles north-east of the [[epicentre]].&lt;ref name="BGS1"/&gt; Minor injuries were also reported in the areas surrounding the epicentral area, and rockslides occurred at [[Tremadog]] in Gwynedd.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqarchives/significant/sig_1984.php |title=USGS Significant earthquakes of the world 1984 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |accessdate=10 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012201021/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqarchives/significant/sig_1984.php |archivedate=12 October 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was followed by many [[aftershock]]s in the following months, the largest measuring 4.3 on the Richter scale, which itself was felt as far away as [[Dublin]], in Ireland.&lt;ref name="BGS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/macroseismics/manchester_earthquake_sequence.htm|title=Manchester Earthquake Sequence report (Mentions this event) |publisher=BGS| accessdate= 10 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Bond''' (22 April 1938 – 5 June 2015) was an Australian businessman noted for his high-profile business dealings, including his central role in the [[WA Inc]] scandals of the 1980s, and what was at the time the biggest corporate collapse in Australian history; for his bankrolling the successful challenge for the [[1983 America's Cup]], the first time the [[New York Yacht Club]] had ever lost it in its 132-year history; and also for a criminal conviction that saw him serve four years in prison. The prestigious Alan Cup road hockey tournament is held at Bond University in his name.

==Career==
Born in London and raised in Australia from the age of 12, Bond began his career as a [[signwriter]] and formed what became the Bond Corporation in 1959. He became a public hero in his adopted country after bankrolling challenges for the [[America's Cup]], which resulted in his selection in 1978 as [[Australian of the Year]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis, Wendy]]|title=Australians of the Year|publisher=Pier 9 Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-74196-809-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (awarded jointly with [[Galarrwuy Yunupingu]]). His ''[[Australia II]]'' syndicate won the [[1983 America's Cup]], which had been held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851, thus breaking the longest winning streak in the history of sport.

==Conviction for fraud==
In 1992, Bond was declared bankrupt with personal debts totalling A$1.8 billion. He was subsequently convicted of fraud and imprisoned after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in Bell Resources to deceptively siphon off A$1.2 billion into the coffers of Bond Corporation. The funds were used to shore up the cash resources of the ailing Bond Corporation, which spectacularly collapsed, leaving Bell Resources in a precarious situation.

==Return to corporate activity==
Following release, he became active in various mining investments, predominately in Africa, including Madagascar Oil PLC and Global Diamond Resources, of [[Lesotho]] and was included in [[BRW (magazine)|''Business Review Weekly'']]'s "Rich 200 List" in 2008.

On 24 and 25 April 2017, the [[Nine Network]] aired a heavily fictionalised TV mini-series, [[House of Bond]], based on Bond's rise and fall.

==Early life==

Alan Bond was born on 22 April 1938, the son of Frank and Kathleen Bond&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tovey|first1=Josephine|title=Obituary: Alan Bond, 1938-2015|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/obituary-alan-bond-19382015-20150605-ghgnia.html|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Hammersmith]] district of [[London]], England. In 1950, aged 12, he emigrated to Australia with his parents and his older sister Geraldine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Bond, entrepreneur and businessman |url=http://www.beda.co.uk/bond2/ |work=beda.co.uk |accessdate=29 January 2012 |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205021540/http://www.beda.co.uk/bond2/ |archivedate=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; living in [[Fremantle]], near Perth. At age 14, he was charged with stealing and being unlawfully on premises. At age 18, he was arrested for being unlawfully on premises and reportedly admitted planning a robbery.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name=barrysmh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Paul|title=Alan Bond dead: Paul Barry's account of a man who tricked Australia|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/alan-bond-dead-paul-barrys-account-of-a-man-who-tricked-australia-20150604-ghgzxm|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]-based Bond made his fortune initially in property development and at one time was one of Australia's most prominent businesspeople. In 1970 he bought three America's Cup challenge yachts from Sir [[Frank Packer]].

[[Bond University]], 5 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased [[QTQ-9]] [[Brisbane]] and settled an outstanding [[slander and libel|defamation]] dispute the station had with the [[Queensland]] premier, [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] by paying out [[Australian dollar|A$]]400,000. He said in a television interview several years later that he paid because "Sir Joh left no doubt that if we were going to continue to do business successfully in Queensland then he expected the matter to be resolved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reviving the Fourth Estate: Democracy, Accountability and the Media|first=Julianne|last=Schultz|page=104|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Bond purchased [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s renowned painting, ''[[Irises (painting)|Irises]],'' for $54 million—the highest price ever paid for a single painting. However, the purchase was funded by a substantial loan from the auctioneer, [[Sotheby's]], which Bond failed to repay. The transaction was criticised by art dealers as possibly a manipulated sale designed to artificially inflate values generally (which it seems to have done).&lt;ref name=nytiris&gt;Reif, Rita [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/arts/a-27-million-loan-by-sotheby-s-helped-alan-bond-to-buy-irises.html A $27 Million Loan by Sotheby's Helped Alan Bond to Buy 'Irises'] New York Times, 18 October 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was subsequently re-sold in 1990 to the [[Getty Center|J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=947&amp;handle=li ''Irises'', image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609143415/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=947&amp;handle=li |date=9 June 2007 }} at the J. Paul Getty Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1987, he built and developed the Bond Centre in [[Hong Kong]]. It was later bought by the [[Lippo Group]] of Indonesia and is now known as the [[Lippo Centre (Hong Kong)|Lippo Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2012646468/ Bond Centre] at [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purchasing the Nine Network===

In 1987, Bond paid $1 billion for the Australia-wide Channel Nine television network from [[Kerry Packer]]'s [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited|PBL]]. In a 2003 interview with [[Andrew Denton]], Bond described the negotiations as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...when we first sat down, we said, 'We're either going to sell our stations to you for $400 million, or you're going to sell your stations to us.' And [Kerry Packer] said, 'Well, I don't really want to sell my stations.' And I said, 'Oh, is that right?' So, anyway, after much discussion, Kerry thumped the table and said, 'Listen, if you can pay me $1 billion, I'll sell them to you, otherwise bugger off'. ... [T]hen I rang the [[National Australia Bank]]. I said, 'Look, I'm in discussions here to buy these television stations. Kerry will sell to me, and what I want to do is put our stations together and then, with [[Sky Racing|Sky Channel]], I'm going to float it off as a separate entity and raise the capital to pay for it... [Packer] said $1 billion [was his asking price], but I think I'll get it for $800 million.' ... [The bank manager] duly rang back and said yes. I said, 'Thank God. I'll go and have some further negotiations with Kerry,' which I did. And true to his word, he never budged one penny off it. So I settled the deal with $800 million and a $200 million note. So he put his own $200 million in. So I had $1 billion. And we put our other two stations up as collateral, which were worth probably $400 million."&lt;ref name="Rope"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s981486.htm Alan Bond interview transcript] from [[Enough Rope]], ABC TV interview with Andrew Denton, 3 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact, the agreed price was $1.05 billion. Packer took $800 million in cash and $250 million in subordinated debt in Bond Media.
Once Bond went bankrupt, Packer was able to turn the debt into a 37% equity in Bond Media, which now included Channel 9 in Brisbane, and was worth about $500 million. It was valued at $1 billion, but had $500 million in debt on the books.
Still, Packer was quoted as saying "You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I've had mine".&lt;ref name="Rope"/&gt;

===Bankruptcy===

In 1992, Bond was declared bankrupt after failing to repay a $194 million personal guarantee on a loan for a [[nickel]] mining project. His debts reportedly totalled $1.8 billion at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/15/business/alan-bond-is-declared-bankrupt-in-australia.html|title=Alan Bond Is Declared Bankrupt in Australia|date=15 April 1992|accessdate=9 June 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, his family bought him out of bankruptcy, with creditors accepting a payment of A$12 million, a little over half a cent per dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/people/alan-bond-dies-van-gogh-305661|title=Australian Tycoon Alan Bond, Who Bought Vincent van Gogh's Irises for Record $54 Million in 1987, Is Dead at 77|agency=ArtNet News|first=Amah-Rose|last=Abrams|date=8 June 2015|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Bond was sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in Bell Resources to deceptively siphon off A$1.2 billion into the coffers of Bond Corporation. The funds were used to shore up the cash resources of the ailing Bond Corporation, which spectacularly collapsed, leaving Bell Resources in a precarious situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/03/bond-m11.html|title=Australian businessman Alan Bond walks free from jail|first=Mike|last=Head|agency=World Socialist Web Site|date=11 March 2000|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/news/alan-bond-dead-bond-corps-demise-left-bad-taste-in-the-west-20150605-ghhjb1|title=Alan Bond dead: Bond Corp's demise left bad taste in the West|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=9 June 2015|work=Financial Review|first=Julie-anne|last=Sprague}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Bond was stripped of his 1984 honour as an [[Order of Australia|Officer of the Order of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Mickelburough, Peter "[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/social-leaders-stripped-of-honours-after-falling-from-grace/story-fni0fit3-1226658920443 Social leaders stripped of honours after falling from grace]", ''[[Herald Sun]]'', 6 June 2013.

===Return to investment activities===

In 2003, Bond was inducted into the [[America's Cup Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sail-world.com/Alan-Bond---America-s-Cup-Hero-remembered-by-Mad-Dog-and-Chink/135096|title=Alan Bond—America's Cup Hero remembered by Longley and Simmer|first=Richard|last=Gladwell|agency=Sail World|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, Bond had worked closely with his son Craig and longtime business partner Robert Quinn through Strategic Investments Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Mottram, Linda; Daniel, Zoe [http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s508667.htm Bond's latest venture in liquidation][[AM (ABC Radio)|ABC Radio AM]] report, 20 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Damian &amp; Mary Fagan, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4465580/Bond-on-comeback-trail.html Bond on comeback trail] The Telegraph (UK), 17 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interests related to the Bond family also control [[Global Diamond Resources]] plc (formerly Lesotho Diamond Corporation) which is developing the Kao diamond pipe in the [[Lesotho|Kingdom of Lesotho]]. In 2007, the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] rejected an attempt by Bond to sue freelance journalist [[Paul Barry]] over an article Barry wrote about his dealings in Africa with the Lesotho Diamond Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/21/2040263.htm Court dismisses case against journalist Paul Barry] [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 22 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Bond had claimed that the article had several false statements. In 2008 Bond appealed but this, too, was rejected by the same court which found Mr Bond's claims had no reasonable prospects of success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/23/2282706.htm Bond loses Federal Court appeal], [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 23 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Bond was involved in a long-running defamation case against ''[[The West Australian]]'' newspaper and journalists Mark Drummond and Sean Cowan over a series of articles published in December 2005, in which it was alleged that Bond's friend and business partner Robert Leslie Nelson was moving to hide Bond's involvement in Lesotho Diamond Corporation, Madagascar Oil and a gold company.&lt;ref name="Lesotho WASC"&gt;{{cite AustLII|WASC|121|2008|litigants=Bond v West Australian Newspapers Ltd |parallelcite= |date=25 June 2008 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Western Australia|Supreme Court]] (WA)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During that case, Bond tried to have the journalists convicted of contempt of court after some electronic documents disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Gosch, Elizabeth (27 March 2008).

In 2008, Bond made a return to the ''[[Business Review Weekly]]''{{'}}s "Rich 200 List", in 157th spot, with an estimated wealth of $265 million—thanks primarily to his stakes in Madagascar Oil and Global Diamond Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rich surprise: Alan Bond bounces back|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 May 2008|url=http://business.smh.com.au/rich-surprise-alan-bond-bounces-back-20080528-2ixw.html|accessdate=28 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704093836/http://business.smh.com.au/rich-surprise-alan-bond-bounces-back-20080528-2ixw.html|archivedate=4 July 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}

==Family==

In 1955, Bond married Eileen Hughes, a member of a prominent [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family in [[Fremantle]]—her cousin is car dealer [[John Hughes (motor dealer)|John Hughes]]. She and Bond were both 17 and she was pregnant at the time. Bond, who had been raised [[Protestantism|Protestant]], converted to Catholicism for the marriage.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt; The couple had four children: John, Craig, Susanne and Jody. Bond and Eileen divorced in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Caroline|title=Why Alan Bond Split With Eileen|url=http://www.divorcesolicitors.com.au/divorce-solicitors-articles/1992/4/11/why-alan-bond-split-with-eileen/|work=The Sun Herald|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=11 April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanne, an equestrian showjumper who had been a member of the Australian showjumping team for seven years, died in 2000 from a suspected accidental overdose of prescription medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowth|first=Adrienne|title=Coronial inquiry launched into the death of Alan Bond's daughter|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s149401.htm|publisher=abc.net.au|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=7 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Bond married [[Diana Bliss]], a public relations consultant and theatre producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People in the News|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uHsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OK0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3103,3927852&amp;dq=alan-bond|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=The Argus-Press|date=16 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 2012, Bliss was found dead in the couple's swimming pool.

==Illness and death==

On 2 June 2015, Bond underwent open-heart surgery at a private hospital in Perth to replace and repair his [[heart valve]]s.

== In popular culture ==
The Australian TV miniseries ''[[House of Bond]]'' (2017) is based on Bond's life and in it he is portrayed by [[Ben Mingay]].

The [[Crowded House]] song "Whispers and Moans" from the album [[Woodface]] makes a reference to "Alan's sound investments" towards the end of the song, an ironic reference to Alan Bond's financial conduct &lt;ref&gt;https://www.frenzforum.com/topic/whispers-and-moans-puzzle&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aurora Space Station''' is a technology concept for a private commercial [[space station]] in low Earth orbit that was announced on 5 March 2018 by [[Orion Span]], a startup aerospace company in California, USA. The concept envisions a capacity of six people: two crew and four tourists.&lt;ref name='Space hotel'&gt; [https://www.space.com/40207-space-hotel-launch-2021-aurora-station.html Luxury Space Hotel to Launch in 2021].

Maureen O'Hare, ''CNN News''. 5 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

No launch contract has been signed for deployment of the modules nor crewed vehicles,&lt;ref name='Space hotel'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Startup&gt;[http://spacenews.com/startup-announces-plans-for-low-cost-commercial-space-station/ Startup announces plans for low-cost commercial space station].

==Overview==

Frank Bunger, the founder and CEO of Orion Span, stated that the Aurora Station would offer to [[space tourist]]s a 12-day stay for US$9.5 million.&lt;ref name='Space hotel'/&gt;&lt;ref name='CNN OHare'/&gt; He said that the design concept is such that the station would not require extravehicular activities (spacewalks) for assembly and operation. Orion Span plans to design, test and build the station in Houston, Texas. &lt;ref name='Space hotel'/&gt; The company has yet to sign a launch contract, but stated that this commercial station would be deployed in [[low Earth orbit]] in 2021,&lt;ref name='Space hotel'/&gt; and start to receive passengers in 2022.&lt;ref name='CNN OHare'/&gt; Bunger said that travelers will be required to complete a three-month training program before launch.&lt;ref name='CNN OHare'/&gt; Guests would be able to free-float, look out windows, practice [[hydroponics]], and play in a '[[Holodeck|hologram deck]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/luxury-space-hotel-could-be-running-four-years-ncna863366 This luxury space hotel could be up and running in four years].

'''Bilbao BBK Live''' is a rock and pop [[music festival]] that takes place annually in the city of [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]]. Since its beginnings, the festival is held in its entirety on a special complex built specifically for the event on the slopes of [[mount Cobetas]], located southwest from the city.

The first edition was organized by [[Basque people|Basque]] musical promoter Last Tour International and sponsored by the [[Bilbao City Hall]] in the year 2006 under the name ''Bilbao Live Festival''. Since the following year, the festival has been sponsored by local savings bank [[Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa]], who gave it its current name. The festival is the first of its kind and size to happen in the region. In the 2011 edition, the festival exceeded 100,000 visitors for the first time, doubling the 2006 attendance.&lt;ref name="2011stats"&gt;{{cite news |title= Kobetas conquista su cima|first= Josu|last= Olarte|url= http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/v/20110711/cultura/kobetas-conquista-cima-20110711.html|newspaper= [[El Correo]]|date= 11 July 2011|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 event was reported to left an economical impact estimated in over 17.5 million [[euro]]s in the city.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{cite news |title=El BBK Live cosecha 17,5 millones de euros, 1,3 más que en su edición de 2011|url= http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/07/18/paisvasco/1342606532.html|newspaper= [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date= 18 July 2012|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Organization and first edition ===
After an unsuccessful attempt to establish a [[Circuito Urbano Bilbao|street circuit]] in the city for the [[Formula Renault 3.5]] in July 2005, the city Government decided to fill in the summer events calendar with an open-air music festival.&lt;ref name="first edition"&gt;{{cite news |title= El primer gran festival de rock y pop de Bilbao presenta en julio a 25 grupos en el monte Cobetas |author= José Mari Reviriego |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/pg060201/prensa/noticias/Vizcaya/200602/01/VIZ-VIZ-079.html |newspaper= [[El Correo]]|date= 1 February 2006 |accessdate= 22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2006, it approached local musical promoter Last Tour International, responsible for the organization of the [[Azkena Rock Festival]], celebrated in nearby [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] since 2002. The newborn festival received the name of ''Bilbao Live Festival'', and had a budget of 4.2 million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref name="first edition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guns N' Roses y Placebo encabezarán un Bilbao Live que apuesta por la electrónica |url=http://elpais.com/diario/2006/05/16/paisvasco/1147808415_850215.html |newspaper=[[El País]] |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly developed area in mount Cobetas was chosen as the location, which included two main stages for the rock acts, two [[electronic music]] tents, one [[pop music]] tent, and several bars and shops.&lt;ref name="first edition"/&gt; Over 40 national and international bands participated in the first edition, celebrated during three days between 13–15 July 2006. The headliners included [[United States|American]] [[hard rock]] band [[Guns N' Roses]], [[United Kingdom|British]] bands [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]] and [[Pretenders (band)|Pretenders]], and [[Argentinian]]s [[Andrés Calamaro]] and [[Ariel Roth]], former members of rock band [[Los Rodríguez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guns'n'Roses, Placebo y Pretenders, figuras destacadas del primer Bilbao Live Festival |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/pg060515/actualidad/cultura/200605/15/ECD_livefestivalbilbao.html |newspaper=El Correo |date=15 May 2006 | accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2006balance"&gt;{{cite news |title=Más de 51.000 personas se dieron cita en la primera edición del Bilbao Live Festival |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/pg060717/actualidad/vizcaya/200607/17/ECD_bilbao-live.html |newspaper=El Correo |date=17 July 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 51,000 people attended this first edition, and was considered a "success".&lt;ref name="2006balance"/&gt; LTI representative, Alfonso Santiago praised the organization and the music acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No hubo un concierto malo |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/pg060718/prensa/noticias/Vizcaya/200607/18/VIZ-SUBARTICLE-066.html |newspaper=El Correo |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defined the festival as a "good starting point".&lt;ref name="2006balance"/&gt; The festival was well received by critics, the authorities, and the general public, and a second edition for the next year was confirmed on 28 July 2006, with the possibility of making it a "permanent musical event" of the city's cultural offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El Bilbao Live Festival volverá a celebrarse en 2007 |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/pg060728/actualidad/sociedad/200607/28/ECD_bilbao_live.html |newspaper=El Correo |date=28 July 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El Ayuntamiento de Bilbao apuesta por repetir el festival de Cobetas |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/pg060718/prensa/noticias/Vizcaya/200607/18/VIZ-VIZ-065.html |author=José Mari Reviriego |newspaper=El Correo |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BBK sponsorship and consolidation ===
[[File:Bilbao - BBK 1 (Gran Via).jpg|thumb|200px|BBK, the main sponsor since 2007.]]
In early 2007, local savings bank [[Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa]] decided to become an official sponsor for the festival, as part of the actions for its 100th anniversary celebration campaign. As a result, the festival's name was changed to ''Bilbao BBK Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/prensa/20070224/cultura_viz/festival-bilbao-live-adelanta_20070224.html |title=El festival Bilbao Live se adelanta a junio y tendrá en exclusiva a Red Hot Chili Peppers| newspaper=El Correo |date=24 February 2007 |author=G. Carrera |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other sponsorship renamings, where the sponsor's name is usually dropped in an informal context, this festival is commonly referred to as "the BBK Live" or simply "the BBK". The second edition enjoyed a "significant budget rise", and the area designated for the stages and camping was also increased from 70,000 to 110,000 m².&lt;ref name="2007edition"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20070223/vizcaya/chili-pepers-encabeza-cartel_200702231306.html |title=Red Hot Chili Pepers encabeza el cartel del 'Bilbao Live Festival' que se adelanta a junio |date=23 February 2007 |newspaper=El Correo |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 edition was also the first (and currently only) to be celebrated in June, a decision took based on the "European summer festival calendar".&lt;ref name="2007edition" /&gt; An extra date was also added, spanning two weekends, 21-22 and 28–29 June. American bands [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Metallica]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[New York Dolls]], [[My Chemical Romance]], and British [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]] were among the international headliners for this edition, meanwhile local rock band [[Fito &amp; Fitipaldis]] stood out among [[Spanish rock|Spanish acts]], and received the largest audience of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/237491/l/ |title=Cerrado el cartel del Bilbao BBK Live con ocho nuevas incorporaciones |newspaper=[[20 Minutos]] |author=D. Cabezas |date=23 May 2007 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 95,000 people attended the event, and produced an economical impact estimated in 13 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20080629/cultura/monte-20080629.html |title=Monte Pop |newspaper=El Correo |first=Josu|last=Olarte |date= |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dusty Hill ZZ Top BBK Live 2008 I.jpg|thumb|[[Dusty Hill]] in the 2008 edition.]]
For the 2008 edition, the festival moved back to its original dates in the first weekend of July and a three-day programme. This edition was headlined by American acts [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[ZZ Top]], and British bands [[The Police]], [[The Prodigy]], and [[Madness (band)|Madness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20080411/cultura/bilbao-live-paso-ficha-20080411.html |title=El Bilbao BBK Live da 'un paso más' y ficha a Madness |newspaper=El Correo |first=Isabel|last=Ibáñez |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This year saw the introduction of a new festival in the city; [[Kobetasonik]] was focused in [[heavy metal music]], was headlined by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Judas Priest]], and was held two weeks before BBK Live in the same venue at mount Cobetas. Bilbao BBK Live 08 was attended by a little less than 80,000 people, well below the expected 95,000. Rain and difficult access to the site, available only through shuttle buses provided by a private party instead of the city's public buses as in past editions, were seen as factors for the decrease in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20080708/opinion/exito-total-20080708.html |title=Éxito total |newspaper=El Correo |author= |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the edition was still considered a success, and despite a project of moving the festival to a new location at an abandoned [[amusement park]] in [[mount Artxanda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20080716/mas-actualidad/sociedad/propone-trasladar-bilbao-live-200807161443.html |title=El PP propone trasladar el Bilbao Live al antiguo parque de atracciones de Artxanda |newspaper=El Correo |first=María|last=Rego |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the organization decided to stick to Cobetas, and promised improvements in the area and services for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20080709/cultura/recinto-kobetamendi-sera-mejorado-20080709.html |title=El recinto de Kobetamendi será mejorado para las futuras ediciones del Bilbao BBK Live |newspaper=El Correo |first=Isabel|last=Ibáñez |date= |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth edition, held between 9–11 July 2009 suffered greatly from the [[2008–2012 Spanish financial crisis|financial crisis]] that struck Spain in that period. As a result, the line-up was considerately "less commercial", as defined by the organization. Headliners included [[Depeche Mode]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Editors (band)|Editors]], and second-timers [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], among others.&lt;ref name="2009 lineup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/bilbaobbk/2009/ |title=Bilbao BBK Live '09 |publisher=efestivals.co.uk |date=16 June 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival received over 52,600 visitors, a "foreseen decrease",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20090708/cultura/mejor-cartel-posible-tiempos-20090708.html |title="El mejor cartel posible" en tiempos de crisis |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |first=Isabel|last=Ibáñez |newspaper=El Correo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although considered a "step back", the continuity of the festival was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20090713/mas-actualidad/cultura/asistencia-personas-confirma-continuidad-200907131547.html |title=La asistencia de más de 52.000 personas confirma la continuidad del BBK Live |newspaper=El Correo |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition saw an increase of foreign visitors, a 5-point increase  from the past edition, totaling 14,6%. Foreign attendees came principally from [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. This was mainly due to a special offer aimed to anyone with a postal address outside of Spain, with a three-day ticket for £40, one third of the standard price.&lt;ref name="2009 lineup"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20090714/cultura/live-vuelve-internacional-20090714.html |title=El BBK se vuelve más internacional |date=14 July 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |newspaper=El Correo |author=Jon Fernández}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20090514/cultura/bilbao-live-oferta-bonos-20090514.html |title=El Bilbao Live oferta bonos a 53 euros en Reino Unido |newspaper=El Correo |date=14 May 2009 |first=Isabel|last=Ibáñez |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The 2012 edition is said to have left an economical impact estimated in over 17.5 million euros, taking into account the expenditures of the general public, organization, sponsors, and artists during the three days of the festival. This indicates an increase of 1.3 million when compared to the previous edition.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt; During festival days, the city's hotels had an occupancy rate of 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/v/20110705/vizcaya/hoteles-bilbao-recibiran-live-20110705.html |title=Los hoteles de Bilbao recibirán el BBK Live con un 95% de ocupación |date=5 July 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |newspaper=El Correo}}&lt;/ref&gt; LTI spokesman, Alfonso Santiago, stated that Bilbao has established itself as the third Spanish concert capital, behind [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/v/20110427/cultura/importante-haya-promotores-apuesten-20110427.html |title=Es importante que haya promotores que apuesten por la ciudad y que las instituciones apoyen sus iniciativas |date=27 April 2011 |first=Óscar|last=Cubillo |newspaper=El Correo |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boroondara Eisteddfod''' is a music competition held annually in the [[Boroondara City Council|City of Boroondara]], [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], [[Australia]].

== History ==
The first Eisteddfod was held in 1991 as the Camberwell Eisteddfod, under the auspices of the then-[[City of Camberwell]]. It was formed to provide a musical competition for the area, following the closure of the Hartwell Eisteddfod.&lt;ref name="sscminutes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes of the Boroondara Services Special Committee 18 July 2011|url=https://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/-/media/Files/Your%20Council/Meetings%20and%20Agendas/Council/2011%20Special%20Services%20Committee/2011%2007%2018%20SSC%20minutes.pdf|publisher=City of Boroondara|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2016council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boroondara Council Meeting Agenda 26 April 2016|url=https://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/-/media/Files/Your%20Council/Meetings%20and%20Agendas/Council/20160426/Report5%20Boroondara%20Eisteddfod|publisher=City of Boroondara|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venues included the City of Camberwell Ballroom and Balwyn Community Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Live Theatre Directory|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/120514851/|accessdate=8 June 2016|publisher=The Age|date=25 June 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the events surrounding the sacking of the Camberwell Council in 1993, the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government's]] investigation into the council examined the circumstances under which the event was established. It found that the expenditure on the 1992 Eisteddfod "likely...was illegal" due to its failure to be properly authorised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation into Camberwell Council|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1992-94No33.pdf|website=Parliament of Victoria|publisher=Office of Local Government|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Eisteddfod continued.

Following council amalgamations in 1994, Camberwell became part of the new City of Boroondara and the Eisteddfod was renamed to account for this change.&lt;ref name="sscminutes"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hawthorn Town Hall redevelopment ===
During the redevelopment of the [[Hawthorn Town Hall]] into a regional arts centre, the Eisteddfod's main venues became unavailable. This necessitated moving events to other venues across Boroondara, including the [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]], [[Camberwell Town Hall]] and [[Kew Court House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Come along to the Eisteddfod|url=https://bulletin.boroondara.vic.gov.au/come-along-to-the-eisteddfod/|publisher=City of Boroondara|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eisteddfod moved back to the newly-refurbished Hawthorn Arts Centre in 2015.

== Sections ==
In 2016, the Eisteddfod ran 39 separate sections, catering for solo and group performers.

'''''Cannibal Holocaust''''' is a 1980 Italian [[cannibal film|cannibal]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Ruggero Deodato]] and written by [[Gianfranco Clerici]]. It stars [[Robert Kerman]] as Harold Monroe, an anthropologist from [[New York University]] who leads a rescue team into the [[Amazon rainforest]] to locate a crew of filmmakers. Played by [[Carl Gabriel Yorke]], [[Francesca Ciardi]], [[Perry Pirkanen]], and [[Luca Barbareschi]], the crew had gone missing while filming a documentary on local cannibal tribes. When the rescue team is only able to recover the crew's lost cans of film, an American television station wishes to broadcast the footage as a sensationalized television special. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions and objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. 

Influenced by the documentaries of [[Mondo film|Mondo]] director [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]],&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ortolani" /&gt; ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was inspired by Italian media coverage of [[Red Brigade]] terrorism. The coverage included news reports that Deodato believed to be staged, an idea which became an integral aspect of the film's story.&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt; Approximately half of the film consists of the documentary crew's lost footage, the presentation of which innovated the [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage genre]] that was later popularized in American cinema by ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''. Noted for its [[Realism (arts)|realism]], ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was filmed primarily on location in the Amazon rainforest of [[Colombia]] with [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous]] tribes interacting with American and Italian actors.&lt;ref&gt;''Cinema Inferno: Celluloid Explosions from the Cultural Margins''. Weiner, Robert G.; Cline, John (Editors). Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-7656-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cannibal Holocaust'' achieved notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a great deal of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to be seized by a local [[Magistrate#Continental Europe and its former colonies|magistrate]], and Deodato was arrested on [[obscenity]] charges. He was later charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumors that claimed several actors were killed on camera. Although Deodato was cleared of these charges, the film was banned in Italy, Australia, and several other countries due to its graphic content, including [[sexual assault]] and genuine [[Cruelty to animals|violence toward animals]]. Although some nations have since revoked the ban, it is still upheld in several countries. In retrospective analyses, the film's violence has been noted as commentary on ethics in journalism, exploitation of developing countries, and the nature of modern society versus uncivilized society, although these interpretations have also been met with criticism.&lt;ref name="David Carter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.savagecinema.com/cannibalholocaust.html | title=Savage Cinema | author=Carter, David | publisher=Savage Cinema | accessdate=6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewhitelies.co.uk/features/articles/cannibal-holocaust-16541 |title=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Review |author=Bitel, Anton |publisher=Little White Lies |accessdate=20 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110233913/http://www.littlewhitelies.co.uk/features/articles/cannibal-holocaust-16541 |archivedate=10 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodall"/&gt;

==Plot==
In 1979, an American film crew disappears in the [[Amazon rainforest]] while filming a [[Documentary film|documentary]] about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at [[New York University]], agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on the local Yacumo tribe and takes a young male hostage in order to help negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via [[floatplane]] and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel.

After several days of trekking through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group is initially greeted with hostility and learns that the filmmakers caused great unrest among the people. The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the [[Ya̧nomamö]] and the [[Sanumá|Shamatari]]. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank, where they save a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from death. The Ya̧nomamö invite Monroe and his team back to their village in gratitude, yet they treat the outsiders with suspicion. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river. A group of Ya̧nomamö women emerge from the riverbank to take him to a shrine, where he discovers the skeletal remains of the filmmakers. Angered, he confronts the Ya̧nomamö in the village, during which time he plays a tape recorder. The intrigued natives agree to trade it for the filmmakers' surviving reels of film.

Back in New York, executives of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. The executives first introduce him to Alan's work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, ''The Last Road to Hell'', which depicts executions in several war-torn countries. One of the executives tells Monroe that Alan staged such dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the jungle. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he quickly dies and is left behind. The remaining four locate the Yacumo in a clearing, where Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew forces the tribe into a hut and burns it down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe criticizes the staged scenes and poor treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.

Monroe finishes viewing the footage and expresses his disgust to the station executives regarding their decision to air the documentary. To convince them otherwise, he shows them the remaining, unedited footage that only he has seen. The final two reels begin with the film crew locating and capturing a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men take turns raping and filming. They later encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of [[virginity]]. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö in revenge for the girl's rape and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him to prevent his escape so that the team can film how the natives mutilate his corpse. As the three surviving team members try to escape the scene, Faye is captured, and Alan insists that they attempt to rescue her. Mark continues to film as she is stripped naked, gang-raped, beaten, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursue and kill the last two team members as the camera drops to the ground in front of Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order the footage to be destroyed. As Monroe leaves the station, he ponders to himself who the "real cannibals" are.

==Production==
===Development===
[[File:Ruggero Deodato 2008.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Director [[Ruggero Deodato]]]]
Production on ''Cannibal Holocaust'' began in 1979, when director [[Ruggero Deodato]] was contacted by German film producers to make a film similar to ''[[Ultimo mondo cannibale|Last Cannibal World]]'', which he had also directed. He accepted the project and immediately went in search of a producer, choosing his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two first flew to Colombia to scout for filming locations. [[Leticia, Colombia]] was chosen as the principal filming location after Deodato met a Colombian documentary filmmaker at the airport in [[Bogotá]], who suggested the town as a location ideal for filming. Other locations had been considered, specifically those where [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s ''[[Burn!]]'' had been shot, but Deodato rejected these due to lack of suitable [[rainforest]].&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt; Leticia was only accessible by aircraft, and from there, the cast and crew had to travel by boat to reach the set.&lt;ref name="Gelend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; The locale presented many problems for the production, in particular the heat and sudden rain storms, which sporadically delayed filming.&lt;ref name="Gelend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Offizi"&gt;{{cite video | people = D'Offizi, Sergio (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deodato said he conceived of the film while talking to his son about news coverage of the terrorism of the [[Red Brigades]]. Deodato thought that the media focused on portraying violence with little regard for [[journalistic integrity]] and believed that the media staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensationalized footage. He reflected this behavior in the film team in ''Cannibal Holocaust'', whom he said symbolized the Italian media.&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;

The Italian screenwriter [[Gianfranco Clerici]] wrote the script under the working title ''Green Inferno''. He had collaborated with Deodato in his previous films ''Ultimo mondo cannibale'' and ''[[The House on the Edge of the Park]]'', the latter of which was filmed before ''Cannibal Holocaust'' but released afterward. The names of certain characters in the film were changed from Clerici's screenplay: the name "Mark Williams" was changed to "Mark Tomaso", and "Shanda Tommaso" was changed to "Faye Daniels".&lt;ref name="script"&gt;Clerici, Gianfranco. ''Cannibal Holocaust''. Screenplay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roadtohell"&gt;"The Last Road to Hell: Alternate Version" (supplementary material on DVD release of ''Cannibal Holocaust''). DVD. [[Grindhouse Releasing]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerici also wrote several scenes that did not make the film's final cut, one of which depicted a group of Ya̧nomamö cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to [[piranha]]s in the river. This scene was to take place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari.&lt;ref name="script"/&gt; Attempts were made to film this scene, but the [[underwater camera]] did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene are its only known depiction.&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;

===Casting===
For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors from the [[Actors Studio]] in New York City. [[Luca Barbareschi|Luca Giorgio Barbareschi]] and [[Francesca Ciardi]] were cast in part because they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal to a wider audience and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries.&lt;ref name="Euro"&gt;{{Citation| last = Gyory| first= Michel| title= Making and Distributing Films in Europe: The Problem of Nationality| publisher= European Audiovisual Observatory| year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Euro"/&gt;

Deodato also hired [[Perry Pirkanen]] and another actor from the Actors Studio to play Jack Anders and Alan Yates, respectively. The latter dropped out shortly before the production team left for the Amazon, although he appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates.&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt; [[Casting director]] Bill Williams subsequently chose [[Carl Gabriel Yorke]] to replace him for the role. Yorke, a [[stage actor]] who had studied under [[Uta Hagen]], was chosen in part because he was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was a [[Actors' Equity Association|non-Union]] production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the alias Christopher Savage, but ultimately decided against doing so.&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Yorke |first=Carl Gabriel |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |title=Alan Yates Uncovered |location=Palo Alto, California |date=12 May 2005 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Kerman]] had years of experience working in [[adult film]]s under the pseudonym R. Bolla, including the well-known ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]''. Kerman was recommended to Deodato for his previous film, ''[[The Concorde Affair]]'', in which Kerman played an air traffic controller. Kerman went on to star in the Italian [[cannibal film]]s ''[[Eaten Alive!]]'' and ''[[Cannibal Ferox]]'', both directed by [[Umberto Lenzi]]. Kerman's girlfriend at the time was cast as one of the station executives, as the production needed an actress to be available in both New York City and Rome.&lt;ref name="Exposed"/&gt;

===Direction===
Deodato drew influence from the works of [[Paolo Cavara]], [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]] and [[Franco Prosperi]], documentary filmmakers of whom Deodato was a fan.&lt;ref name="Ortolani"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Riz Ortolani|Ortolani, Riz]] (interviewee) |date=2003 |title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust |medium=Documentary |location=Italy |publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt; Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several Mondo films, which are documentaries similar to the one made in ''Cannibal Holocaust''. These documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic content from around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato followed suit in ways of similar content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings. Although fictional, Deodato created a similar exposé of worldly violence, such as Cavara's, Prosperi's and Jacopetti's ''[[Mondo Cane]]''.&lt;ref name="Ortolani" /&gt;

Deodato filmed ''Cannibal Holocaust'' using the ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' technique he learned from his mentor [[Roberto Rossellini]], a style which production designer Massimo Antonello Gelend called "hyperrealistic".&lt;ref name="Gelend"&gt;{{cite video |people=Gelend, Antonio (interviewee) |date=2003 |title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust |medium=Documentary |location=Italy |publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian David Kerekes contends that the film's sense of reality is based on the direction and the treatment of the film team's recovered footage, noting that the "shaky hand-held camerawork commands a certain realism, and 'The Green Inferno,' the ill-fated team's film-within-a-film here, is no exception," and that "this very instability gives the 'Green Inferno' film its authentic quality."&lt;ref name="killing for culture"/&gt; David Carter of the cult horror [[webzine]] ''Savage Cinema'' says that Deodato's methods added a [[First-person narration|first-person]] quality to the film team's footage, writing: "The viewer feels as if they are there with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them."&lt;ref name="David Carter"/&gt; Deodato was proud of other aspects of the [[cinematography]], namely the numerous moving shots using a standard, shoulder-mounted [[movie camera|camera]], foregoing the use of a [[steadicam]].&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;

Kerekes noted the animal slaughter and inclusion of footage from ''The Last Road to Hell'' as adding to the sense of reality of the film.&lt;ref name="killing for culture"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerekes |first=David |author2=Slater, David |title=Killing for Culture: Death Film from Mondo to Snuff |date=January 1996 |publisher=Creation Books |location=UK |isbn=1-871592-20-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyd Kaufman]] of [[Troma Entertainment]] compares these scenes to [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s theory of [[Montage sequence|montage]], saying, "In ''Cannibal Holocaust'', we see the actors kill and rip apart a giant sea turtle and other animals. [...] The brain has been conditioned to accept that which it's now seeing as real. This mixture of real and staged violence, combined with the handheld camerawork and the rough, unedited quality of the second half of the movie, is certainly enough to convince someone that what they are watching is real."&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaufman |first=Lloyd | editor-last=Slater | editor-first=Jay |title=Eaten Alive!: Italian Cannibal and Zombie Movies | chapter=''Cannibal Holocaust'': Review by Lloyd Kaufman |year=2002 |publisher=Plexus Publishing |location=London |pages=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deodato says he included the execution footage in ''The Last Road to Hell'' to draw further similarities to ''Cannibal Holocaust'' and the [[Mondo film]]making of [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]].&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;

Certain scenes in ''Cannibal Holocaust'' have also been noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film ''[[Savana violenta]]'', specifically the scene in which Monroe bathes naked in the river and the scene of the forced abortion rite. The ''cinéma vérité'' style used heavily in ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was also used before in Climati's first Mondo film, ''[[Ultime grida dalla savana]]'', in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions. Another scene, in which a native man is captured, tortured, and murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.&lt;ref name = "Goodall"/&gt;

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began on 4 June 1979. The scenes featuring the film team were shot first with handheld [[16mm]] cameras in a ''cinéma vérité'' style that mimicked an observational documentary. After shooting with the film team was completed, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest and then to [[New York City|New York]] to film exterior shots in the city. The interior shots of New York were later filmed in a studio in Rome.&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comment"/&gt; Production on the film was delayed numerous times while filming in the Amazon. After the original actor to play Alan Yates dropped out, filming was halted for two weeks as new casting calls began, and the crew awaited the arrival of Yorke from New York City.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; During principal filming with Kerman, the father of the actor who played Miguel was murdered, and production was again halted as the actor flew back to [[Bogotá]] to attend his father's funeral.&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;

Tensions on the Amazonian set were high, due in part to the location and to the nature of the production itself. Yorke describes the set as having "a level of cruelty unknown to me,"&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; while Kerman described Deodato as remorseless and uncaring;&lt;ref name="Comment"/&gt; he and Deodato got into long, drawn-out arguments every day of shooting, usually because of remarks made by Deodato.&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comment"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]], [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=12 November 2000 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cast members also experienced unscrupulous payment practices, which further heightened tensions. Yorke's first payment for the film came in the form of [[Colombian peso]]s and was less than what had been agreed upon. Yorke refused to continue shooting until he was paid fairly in [[United States dollar]]s. The native extras also went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes, including a scene in which they were forced to stay inside a burning hut for a prolonged period of time.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; Robert Kerman also noted unfair treatment of the natives by Deodato, stating, "He was a sadist. He was particularly sadistic to people that couldn't answer back, people that were Colombian, [and] people that were Italian but could be sent home."&lt;ref&gt;The Gore-Met (December 2005). "A Forbidden Feast of Flesh". Rue Morgue Magazine #52, 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular aspect that led to disagreement amongst the cast and crew was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the [[coati]]mundi was filmed,&lt;ref name="Exposed"/&gt; and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle,&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt; and crew members vomited off camera when a [[squirrel monkey]] was killed for the film.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content and did not want to bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{listen|pos=Right|filename=Main Theme.ogg|title="Cannibal Holocaust (Main Theme)"|description=Thirty second audio sample of the theme from ''Cannibal Holocaust''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The film's soundtrack was composed entirely by Italian composer [[Riz Ortolani]], whom Deodato specifically requested because of Ortolani's work in ''Mondo Cane''. Deodato was particularly fond of the film's main theme, "Ti guarderò nel cuore," which was given lyrics and became a worldwide [[pop music|pop]] hit under the title "[[More (Mondo Cane theme)|More]]." The music of ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is a variety of styles, from a gentle melody in the "Main Theme," to a sad and flowing score in "Crucified Woman," and faster and more upbeat tracks in "Cameraman's Recreation," "Relaxing in the Savannah," and "Drinking Coco," to the sinister-sounding "Massacre of the Troupe." The instrumentation is equally mixed, ranging from full orchestras to electronics and synthesizers.&lt;ref name="moviegrooves"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moviegrooves.com/shop/cannibalholocaustsoundtrack.htm | title=Cannibal Holocaust soundtrack | publisher=Movie Grooves | accessdate=13 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613160548/http://www.moviegrooves.com/shop/cannibalholocaustsoundtrack.htm |archivedate=13 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
''Cannibal Holocaust'' [[premiere]]d on 7 February 1980 in the Italian city of [[Milan]]. Although the courts later confiscated the film based on a citizen's complaint, the initial audience reaction was positive.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview 2"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]], [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=12 November 2000 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the film, director [[Sergio Leone]] wrote a letter to Deodato, which stated, "[Translated] Dear Ruggero, what a movie! The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything seems so real that I think you will get in trouble with all the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Jay | editor-last=Slater | editor-first=Jay |title=Eaten Alive!: Italian Cannibal and Zombie Movies | chapter=''Cannibal Holocaust'': Review by Jay Slater |year=2002 |publisher=Plexus Publishing |location=London |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ten days before it was seized, the film had grossed approximately $2 million.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt; In Japan, it grossed $21 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of that time after ''[[E.T. the Extraterrestrial]]''.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt; Because of its several subsequent re-releases, some claim the film has grossed $200 million worldwide.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt;

===Critical response===
Critics remain split on their stances of ''Cannibal Holocaust''. Supporters of the film cite it as a serious and well-made [[social commentary]] on the modern world. Sean Axmaker praised the structure and setup of the film, saying, "It's a weird movie with an awkward narrative, which Deodato makes all the more effective with his grimy sheen of documentary realism, while Riz Ortolani's unsettlingly lovely, elegiac score provides a weird undercurrent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/content/film/features/feature_1134529705 |title=Digital Delirium | author=Axmaker, Sean |publisher=Super Unleaded Design, Inc. |accessdate=15 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418041555/http://www.staticmultimedia.com/content/film/features/feature_1134529705 |archivedate=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Buchanan of [[Allmovie]] said, "While it's hard to defend the director for some of the truly repugnant images with which he has chosen to convey his message, there is indeed an underlying point to the film, if one is able to look beyond the sometimes unwatchable images that assault the viewer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/cannibal-holocaust-v132995/review | title=Cannibal Holocaust &gt; Review | author=Buchanan, Jason |publisher=[[Allmovie]] | accessdate=16 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detractors, however, criticize the over-the-top gore and the genuine animal slayings and also point to an alleged [[hypocrisy]] that the film presents. Nick Schager criticized the brutality of the film, saying, "As clearly elucidated by its shocking gruesomeness — as well as its unabashedly [[racism|racist]] portrait of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] folks it purports to sympathize with [the real indigenous peoples in Brazil whose names were used in the film—the [[Ya̧nomamö]] and Shamatari—are not fierce enemies as portrayed in the film, nor is either tribe truly cannibalistic, although the Ya̧nomamö do partake in a form of post-mortem ritual cannibalism]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chagnon |first=Napoleon A. |authorlink=Napoleon Chagnon |editor=George and Louise Spindler |title=Yanomamö |origyear=1968 |edition=5th |date=15 November 1996 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |location=Fort Worth, Texas |isbn=0-15-505327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; — the actual savages involved with ''Cannibal Holocaust'' are the ones behind the camera."&lt;ref name="Schager"/&gt;

Robert Firsching of Allmovie made similar criticisms of the film's content, saying, "While the film is undoubtedly gruesome enough to satisfy fans, its mixture of nauseating mondo animal slaughter, repulsive sexual violence, and pie-faced attempts at socially conscious moralizing make it rather distasteful morally as well."&lt;ref name="AllMovie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v132995 |title=Cannibal Holocaust &gt; Overview |author=Firsching, Robert |publisher=Allmovie |accessdate=16 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slant Magazine]]'''s Eric Henderson said it is "artful enough to demand serious critical consideration, yet foul enough to christen you a pervert for even bothering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=1848 |title=Film Review:Cannibal Holocaust |author=Henderson, Eric |publisher=Slant Magazine |accessdate=15 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181453/http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=1848 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' has received accolades in various [[publication]]s as well as a [[cult following]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/controversialfilms13.html |title=The Most Controversial Films of All-Time |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British film [[magazine]] ''[[Total Film]]'' ranked ''Cannibal Holocaust'' as the tenth greatest horror film of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/shock-horror-1 |title=Shock Horror! |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the film was included in a similar list of the top 25 horror films compiled by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/10/25-best-horror-films/?pid=1623 |title=25 Best Horror Films of All Time |publisher=Wired |accessdate=10 November 2010 |first=Jon |last=Snyder |date=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also came in eighth on [[IGN]]'s list of the ten greatest [[grindhouse]] films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/778/778253p1.html | title=IGN Top 10 Grind House Films |publisher=IGN Entertainment |accessdate=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretations===
''Cannibal Holocaust'' is seen by some critics as [[social commentary]] on various aspects of modern civilization by comparing Western society to that of the cannibals. David Carter says "''Cannibal Holocaust'' is not merely focused on the societal taboo of [[Cannibalism|flesh eating]]. The greater theme of the film is the difference between the civilized and the uncivilized. Though the graphic violence can be hard for most to stomach, the most disturbing aspect of the film is what Deodato is saying about modern society. The film asks the questions 'What is it to be 'civilized'?' and 'Is it a good thing?'"&lt;ref name="David Carter"/&gt; Mark Goodall, author of ''Sweet &amp; Savage: The World Through the Shockumentary Film Lens'', also contends the film's message is "the rape of the natural world by the unnatural; the exploitation of 'primitive' cultures for western entertainment."&lt;ref name="Goodall"/&gt;

Deodato's intentions regarding the Italian media coverage of the Red Brigades have also fallen under critical examination and has been expanded to include all [[sensationalism]]. Carter explores this, claiming that "[The lack of journalistic integrity] is shown through the interaction between Professor Monroe and the news agency that had backed the documentary crew. They continually push Monroe to finish editing the footage because blood and guts equal [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]."&lt;ref name="David Carter"/&gt; Lloyd Kaufman claims that this form of exploitative journalism can still be seen in the media today and in programming such as [[reality television]].&lt;ref name="Kaufman"/&gt; Goodall and film historians David Slater and David Kerekes have also suggested that Deodato was attempting to comment on the documentary works of Antonio Climati with his film.&lt;ref name="Goodall"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodall |first=Mark |title=Sweet and Savage: The World Through the Shockumentary Film Lens |year=2006 |publisher=Headpress |location=[[London]], UK |isbn=1-900486-49-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="killing for culture"/&gt;

Despite these interpretations, Deodato has said in interviews that he had no intentions in ''Cannibal Holocaust'' but to make a film about cannibals.&lt;ref name="Kaufman"/&gt; Actor [[Luca Barbareschi]] asserts this as well and believes that Deodato only uses his films to "put on a show".&lt;ref name="Luca"&gt;{{cite video | people = Barbareschi, Luca (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kerman contradicts these assertions, however, stating that Deodato did tell him of political concerns involving the media in the making of this film.&lt;ref name="Exposed"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]], [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Robert Kerman Exposed |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=15 November 2000 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These interpretations have also been criticized as hypocritical and poor justification for the film's content, as ''Cannibal Holocaust'' itself is highly sensationalized. Firsching claims that "The fact that the film's sole spokesperson for the anti-exploitation perspective is played by porn star [[Robert Kerman]] should give an indication of where its sympathies lie",&lt;ref name="AllMovie"/&gt; while Schager says Deodato is "pathetically justifying the unrepentant carnage by posthumously damning his eaten filmmaker protagonists with a 'who are the real monsters – the cannibals or us?' anti-imperialism morale".&lt;ref name="Schager"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nickschager.com/nsfp/2005/08/cannibal_holoca.html | title=The Nick Schager Film Project: Cannibal Holocaust | author=Schager, Nick |publisher=Nick Schager Film Project |accessdate=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Since its original release, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' has been the target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine [[Animal cruelty|cruelty to animals]], issues which find ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust 25th Anniversary Edition |others=[[Ruggero Deodato|Deodato, Ruggero]] |type=back cover |publisher=[[VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company)]] |location=UK |id=VIP666SE |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine named ''Cannibal Holocaust'' as the 20th most controversial film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever |url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/25-most-controversial-movies-ever |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=882 |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc. |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snuff film allegations===
Ten days after its premiere in Milan, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was confiscated under the orders of a local magistrate,&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, Don: ''Horror Movie Freak'', p. 189 (Krause Publications, 2010). {{ISBN|978-1-4402-0824-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ruggero Deodato was arrested and charged with obscenity. As all copies were to be turned over to the authorities, the film was distributed internationally via subterfuge.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt; In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in [[France]], the magazine ''[[Photo (French magazine)|Photo]]'' suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made ''Cannibal Holocaust'' a [[snuff film]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Geoff: ''The Spectacle of The Real: From Hollywood to 'Reality' TV and Beyond'' (Intellect Ltd., 2005). {{ISBN|1-84150-120-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the ''Photo'' article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;
[[Image:CannibalHolocaustimpale.jpg|right|thumb|The film's impalement scene was one of several scenes examined by the courts to determine whether the violence depicted was staged or genuine.]]
Compounding matters was the fact that the supposedly deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;

To prove his innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get in contact with the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian television show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in her mouth and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;

===Censorship===
Although the snuff film allegations were disproven, the Italian courts decided to ban ''Cannibal Holocaust'' due to the genuine animal slayings, citing animal cruelty laws. Deodato, Franco Palaggi, Franco Di Nunzio, Gianfranco Clerici, producer Alda Pia and [[United Artists|United Artists Europa]] representative Sandro Perotti each received a four-month suspended sentence after they were all convicted of obscenity and violence. Deodato fought in the courts for three additional years to get his film unbanned. In 1984, the courts ruled in favor of Deodato, and ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was granted a rating certificate of VM18 for a cut print. It would later be re-released uncut.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"&gt;{{cite video | people = Deodato, Ruggero (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt;

''Cannibal Holocaust'' also faced censorship issues in other countries around the world. In 1981, video releases were not required to pass before the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] (BBFC), which had power to ban films in the United Kingdom. ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was released [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-video]] there, thus avoiding the possible banning of the film. In 1983, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] compiled a list of 72 video releases that were not brought before the BBFC for certification and declared them prosecutable for obscenity. This list of "[[Video nasty|video nasties]]" included ''Cannibal Holocaust'', which was successfully prosecuted and banned. The film was not approved for release in the UK until 2001, albeit with nearly six minutes of mandated cuts. In 2011, the BBFC waived all but one of these previous edits and passed ''Cannibal Holocaust'' with fifteen seconds of cuts. It was determined that the only scene that breached the BBFC's guidelines was the killing of a [[coati]]mundi, and the BBFC acknowledged that previous cuts were reactionary to the film's reputation.&lt;ref name="bbfc ch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannibal Holocaust|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/cannibal-holocaust |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|accessdate=23 December 2013|date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was also banned in [[Australia]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[New Zealand]], and several other countries in 1984.&lt;ref name="Refused"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=15 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] in Australia revoked the ban, passing ''Cannibal Holocaust'' with an R18+ rating for the uncut print, including the consumer advice, "High level sexual violence, high level violence, animal cruelty." In 2006, the film was rejected for classification and banned in its entirety by the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|OFLC]] in New Zealand. Cuts to retain an R18 classification were offered by the Office, but they were eventually refused.&lt;ref name="Refused"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvlb.org.nz/nz/pages/publication-details.html?title=39285 | title=Cannibal Holocaust | publisher=Film and Video Labelling Body of NZ | accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal cruelty===
Many of the censorship issues with ''Cannibal Holocaust'' concern the on-screen killings of animals. Deodato himself has condemned his past actions,&lt;ref name="Interview 2"/&gt; saying "I was stupid to introduce animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/4101 |title=Pointless Cannibal Holocaust Sequel in the Works |publisher=Fangoria |accessdate=13 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221071540/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/4101 |archivedate=21 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although six animal deaths appear onscreen, seven animals were killed for the production, as the scene depicting the monkey's death was [[Take|shot twice]], resulting in the death of two monkeys. Both of the animals were eaten by indigenous cast members, who consider monkey brains a delicacy.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; The animals that were killed onscreen were:

* a [[coati]] (mistaken for a [[muskrat]] in the film), killed with a knife
* a large [[turtle]], [[Decapitation|decapitated]] and its limbs, shell, and entrails removed
* a [[Brachypelma vagans|tarantula]], killed with a [[machete]]
* a [[boa constrictor]], also killed with a machete
* a [[common squirrel monkey|squirrel monkey]], decapitated with a machete
* a [[pig]], shot in the head with a shotgun at [[point blank range]]

Film historian Andrew DeVos has argued that the animal deaths have been harshly condemned because of the film's classification as exploitation, whereas animal mutilations in films perceived by critics to be classics or [[art film]]s are often ignored. DeVos cites several examples of this double standard, including ''[[The Rules of the Game]]'', ''[[El Topo]]'', and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeVos |first=Andrew |editor-last=Weiner |editor-first=Robert G. |editor-last2=Cline |editor-first2=John |title=Cinema Inferno: Celluloid Explosions from the Cultural Margins |chapter=The More You Rape Their Senses, the Happier They Are: A History of ''Cannibal Holocaust'' |year=2010 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc. |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBFC made a similar conclusion regarding the censorship of scenes in which the deaths were quick and painless, noting, "Removing these sequences would be inconsistent with the BBFC's decisions to permit quick clean kills in several other films, such as ''Apocalypse Now''."&lt;ref name="bbfc ch" /&gt;

==Legacy==
{{See also|Found footage (film technique)}}
''Cannibal Holocaust'' was innovative in its plot structure, specifically with the concept of the "found footage" being brought back to civilization and later viewed to determine the fate of the crew that shot it.&lt;ref name="Kaufman"/&gt; This was later popularized as a [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|distinct style]] in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood cinema]] by ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'' and ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', both of which use similar storytelling devices. Each film uses the idea of a lost film team making a documentary in the wilderness, and their footage returned. Advertisements for ''The Blair Witch Project'' also promoted the idea that the footage is genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Sánchez |first=Eduardo |subjectlink=Eduardo Sánchez (director) |last2=Myrick |first2=Dan |subjectlink2=Daniel Myrick |interviewer=Joshua Klein |title=The Blair Witch Project |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-blair-witch-project,13607/ |date=22 July 1999 |work=[[The Onion]] |accessdate=16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deodato has acknowledged the similarities between his film and ''The Blair Witch Project'', and though he holds no malice against the producers, he is frustrated at the publicity that ''The Blair Witch Project'' received for being an original production.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle" /&gt; The producers of ''The Last Broadcast'' have denied that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Weiler | first=Lance |subjectlink=Lance Weiler |interviewer=Guido Henkel |title=The Facts About The Last Broadcast |date=9 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the film was cited by director [[Paco Plaza]] as a source of inspiration for the found footage films ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' and ''[[REC 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Heller-Nicholas|first=Alexandra |title=Found Footage Horror Films: Fear and the Appearance of Reality |publisher=McFarland |year= 2014 |isbn= |pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cannibal Holocaust'' has been regarded as the apex of the [[cannibal genre]],&lt;ref name="killing for culture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Jay | editor-last=Slater | editor-first=Jay |title=Eaten Alive!: Italian Cannibal and Zombie Movies | chapter="The Cannibal/The Zombie" |year=2002 |publisher=Plexus Publishing |location=London |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harper|first=Jim |title=Italian Horror |year=2002 |publisher=Midnight Marquee Press, Inc. |location=Baltimore |pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it bears similarities to subsequent cannibal films made during the same time period. ''[[Cannibal Ferox]]'' also stars Kerman and Pirkanen, and star [[Giovanni Lombardo Radice]] says it was made based on the success of ''Cannibal Holocaust''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Radice |first=Giovanni Lombardo |subjectlink=Giovanni Lombardo Radice |interviewer=Sage Stallone, Bob Murawski|title=Cannibal ferox DVD Commentary|work=Cannibal ferox DVD special features}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cannibal Ferox'' has also been noted as containing similar themes to ''Cannibal Holocaust'', such as comparison of Western violence to perceived uncivilized cultures and [[anti-imperialism]]. In a mixed review, film journalist Jay Slater claims, "Certainly a tough customer, ''Cannibal Ferox'' still fails where Deodato succeeds. [...] Lenzi attempts to tackle cultural defilement and racial issues, but ''Cannibal Ferox'' is nothing more than a shoddy exercise in sadism and animal cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Jay | editor-last=Slater | editor-first=Jay |title=Eaten Alive!: Italian Cannibal and Zombie Movies | chapter="''Cannibal Ferox'': Review by Jay Slater" |year=2002 |publisher=Plexus Publishing |location=London |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Andrew Parkinson also notes, "At the end, there is a basic attempt to validate ''Cannibal Ferox'', posing that old chestnut of whether civilised man is actually more savage than the uncivilised tribespeople."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parkinson |first=Andrew | editor-last=Slater | editor-first=Jay |title=Eaten Alive!: Italian Cannibal and Zombie Movies | chapter="''Cannibal Ferox'': Review by Andrew Parkinson" |year=2002 |publisher=Plexus Publishing |location=London |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deodato - Roth.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ruggero Deodato with [[Eli Roth]] on the set of ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'' (2007)]]
Unofficial sequels to ''Cannibal Holocaust'' were produced in the years following its release. The titles of these films were changed following their original theatrical releases in order to associate the film with ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in different markets. In 1985, Mario Gariazzo directed ''Schiave bianche: violenza in Amazzonia'', which was also released as ''[[White Slave (film)|Cannibal Holocaust 2: The Catherine Miles Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harper|first=Jim |title=Italian Horror |year=2002 |publisher=Midnight Marquee Press, Inc. |location=Baltimore |pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the new title, Slater notes similarities between the [[film score|score]] in ''The Catherine Miles Story'' and Riz Ortolani's score in ''Cannibal Holocaust''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Jay | editor-last=Slater | editor-first=Jay |title=Eaten Alive!: Italian Cannibal and Zombie Movies | chapter="''Amazonia: The Catherine Miles Story'': Review by Jay Slater" |year=2002 |publisher=Plexus Publishing |location=London |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously known for his work in Mondo films, Antonio Climati directed ''[[Natura contro]]'' in 1988, which was released as ''Cannibal Holocaust II'' in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/cannibal-holocaust-2-0|title=Cannibal Holocaust 2 |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Deodato announced that he planned to make a companion piece to ''Cannibal Holocaust'' entitled ''Cannibals''.&lt;ref name="DREAD"&gt;{{cite web |first=Johnny |last=Butane |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/story/ruggero-cannibals-natas |title=Ruggero on Cannibals, Natas |publisher=Dread Central Media, LCC |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deodato was originally hesitant about directing his new film, as he thought that he would make it too violent for American audiences. However, while he was in Prague filming his cameo appearance in ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'' for [[Eli Roth]], Deodato viewed ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' and decided that he would direct after all, citing it as a similarly violent film that was given a mainstream release in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brad |last=Miska |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7578 |title=Ruggero Deodato Talks 'Cannibal Holocaust 2' |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting LLC |accessdate=14 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226232652/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7578/ |archivedate=26 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the screenplay, written by Christine Conradt, was completed, a financial conflict&lt;ref name="DREAD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brad |last=Miska |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12685 |title=Deodato Holds New 'Holocaust' Hostage? |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting LLC | accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; between Deodato and the film's producer led to the project's cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brad |last=Miska |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/15150 |title='Cannibal Holocaust' Companion Piece D-E-A-D |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting LLC |accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Roth directed ''[[The Green Inferno (film)|The Green Inferno]]'', which takes its title from the fictional documentary produced in ''Cannibal Holocaust''. Roth's film was intended as an homage to ''Cannibal Holocaust'' and other cannibal films from the same era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/01/eli-roth-on-the-horrors-of-the-green-inferno|title=Eli Roth on the Horrors of The Green Inferno|author=Chris Tilly|date=1 March 2013|work=IGN|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's influence has extended to other media as well. In 2001, [[Death metal]] band [[Necrophagia]] released a song entitled "Cannibal Holocaust" from the [[Cannibal Holocaust (EP)|eponymous record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://housecorehorrorfilmfestival.com/hhff-welcomes-controversial-italian-gore-mesiter-ruggero-deodato/ | title=HHFF Welcomes Controversial Italian Gore-Meister Ruggero Deodato | publisher=Housecore Horror Film Festival| accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Author Saurav Dutt also published ''Cannibal Metropolis'', a novel inspired by ''Cannibal Holocaust'' set in an urban location. Like ''Cannibal Holocaust'', the novelization features explicit scenes of violence, horror, and rape.

==Alternate versions==
Due to its graphic content, there are several different versions of ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in circulation which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on [[VHS]] by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Egan |first=Kate |title=Trash or Treasure?: Censorship and the Changing Meanings of the Video Nasties |year=2002 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the film was passed for release on [[DVD]] by the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011.&lt;ref name="bbfc ch"/&gt; The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust: Ruggero Deodato's New Edit |others=[[Ruggero Deodato|Deodato, Ruggero]] |type=back cover |publisher=Shameless Screen Entertainment |location=UK |id=B0051ZH8CC |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The versions released by [[Grindhouse Releasing]] contains an "Animal Cruelty Free" version of the film that cuts out the six animal deaths. Other versions also contain alternative footage shot specifically for [[Middle East]]ern markets that does not depict nudity.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

There are multiple versions of the ''Last Road to Hell'' segment of the film, which causes variances even among uncensored releases. An extended version of  ''The Last Road to Hell'' includes approximately ten seconds of footage not seen in an alternative, shorter version. This additional footage includes a wide-angle shot of firing-squad executions, a close-up of a dead victim, and extended footage of bodies being carried into the back of a truck. The longer version also includes different titles that correctly name the film team as they appear in the final film, while the shorter version gives the names of the film team that originally appear in the script.&lt;ref name="roadtohell"/&gt;

The longer version of ''The Last Road to Hell'' is no longer found in the film's negatives,&lt;ref name="roadtohell"/&gt; but it was included in the original Dutch Ultrabit DVD release by EC Entertainment in 1999. This digital version has since been re-released and licensed for other various DVD releases in Europe. The Grindhouse Releasing DVD release in the United States and the [[Siren Visual]] release in Australia have the shorter version of ''The Last Road to Hell'' within the feature film but include the extended version in the special features on the first disc.

American cinematic artist [[Bruce Baillie]] founded '''Canyon Cinema''' as a filmmakers co-operative in about 1961. [[Baillie]] created it as an exhibition outlet for independent motion picture film. It then was formally established as Canyon Cinema, Inc., an independent, non-commercial film distributor in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Scott MacDonald, ''Canyon Cinema: The Life and Times of an Independent Film Distributor'', University of California Press, 2008, p6. {{ISBN|0-520-25087-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This corporation was dissolved in 2013, following the transfer of its assets and operations to the Canyon Cinema Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canyoncinema.com/about/history/ |title=History and Today |publisher=Canyon Cinema |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canyon Cinema Foundation''' in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] is a nonprofit founded in 2013 and dedicated to educating the public about independent, non-commercial, experimental, avant-garde and artist-made moving images. It nurtures scholarship and awareness with public programming at universities and nonprofit cultural organizations worldwide. With [[The Film Makers Cooperative]], Canyon Cinema is one of the only major sources for prints of avant-garde and experimental film in America, and related research information.

[[File:Ademollo-Teano.jpg|thumb|325px|The Handshake of [[Teano]]]]
'''Carlo Ademollo''' (9 October 1824, [[Florence]] - 15 July 1911, Florence) was an Italian painter, best known for his scenes from the [[Risorgimento]].

==Biography==
He was the grandson of the Milanese painter, [[Luigi Ademollo]]. In 1838, he enrolled at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]], where he studied with [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]].&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-ademollo_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Brief biography] @ Treccani.&lt;/ref&gt; He had his first exhibition in 1848, with scenes of contemporary customs. He came from a liberal family, many of whose members enlisted as volunteers in the [[First War of Italian Independence]] but, as a painter, he remained strictly traditional. He briefly took part in the "{{ill|Scuola di Staggia|it}}" (a group of landscape painters inspired by the [[Barbizon school]]) and frequented the [[Caffè Michelangiolo]], but never joined the [[Macchiaioli]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

Later, he moved away from landscapes and [[Genre art|genre]] scenes to depict episodes from the Risorgimento; including the breach of the [[Porta Pia]] during the [[Capture of Rome]], the "[[Teano#"Handshake of Teano"|Handshake of Teano]]", between [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], and the execution of [[Felice Orsini]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

During the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], he followed the army at his own expense and maintained an extensive correspondence with those involved, requesting details to help him create his paintings. He also participated in the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], receiving the rank of [[Adjutant]] to the commander of the National Guard of Florence. Later, the King designated him the official painter of the Italian Army.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; In 1869, he was named a corresponding professor at his alma mater, the Accademia.

Many of his letters and other personal items were donated to the "{{ill|Istituto per la storia del Risorgimento italiano|it}}" by his nephew Umberto. The Instituto also possesses one of Ademollo's last works; a posthumous portrait of {{ill|Adelaide Cairoli|it}}.

[[File:logo large 10years.jpg|thumb]]
'''Caterham Graduates Racing Club''' is a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Auto racing|motor-racing]] club for [[privateer (motorsport)|privateer]] [[auto racing|racing drivers]] in [[Caterham Seven]] type cars.

==History==
The Caterham Graduates Championship was started in 1998 by competitors from the 1997 [[Caterham Academy|Caterham Scholarship]] (subsequently [[Caterham Academy]]). For the first year it was called the Graduate 797 series (the first "7" for Caterham Seven, and "97" from the year that most drivers started competing). In its first two years, it was a multi-discipline series, with the rounds being made up of sprints (single car on track, against the clock), [[hillclimbing|hillclimbs]], and [[Race track|circuit races]], similar to the [[Caterham Academy|Caterham Scholarship]] format. The emphasis moved more and more towards circuit races, and from 2000-on the series has been entirely circuit races.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Frost, Chairman, Caterham Graduates Racing Club&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, following the Caterham Academy's change to [[MG Rover Group|Rover]]-engined cars, the championship launched a second class named Super Graduates, based upon an uprated K-Series Academy car.

In 2003, the Super Graduates class was further upgraded and renamed the Mega Graduates.  A replacement Super Graduates class was created to accommodate standard ex-Academy cars with Rover K-series engines.

In 2007, the "Graduates" class was rebranded "Classic Graduates".

In 2010, [[Ford Sigma engine|Ford Sigma-engined cars]] were introduced as a sub-class of Super Graduates. From 2011 onwards, the Sigma cars have been a separate, 4th championship class.

In 2013, a 5th championship class was introduced for variants of the [[Ford Sigma engine|Ford Sigma-engined cars]] - SigMax. This allows suspension and engine upgrades in line with the Caterham Tracksport and Supersport series.

The series is one of the largest in the UK, if not the largest, with well over 100 registered competitors. The competitors come from a variety of backgrounds - a number have "graduated" from the novice Caterham Scholarship and Academy series, whilst many others have made it their first foray into [[motor racing|motorsport]].

==Racing==
The Caterham Graduates race series takes place over a number of races meeting each year at UK and European [http://www.bmrc.co.uk/ motor racing circuits]. The races are usually run over 20–30 minutes and the leading car across the line after the time has expired is the winner. Wherever possible, each class starts on its own grids, but on larger grids it is usually necessary to combine two or more classes. The events are typified by close wheel to wheel racing, often having several lead changes on the same lap.

In Super Graduates and Mega Graduates, points are awarded thus: 40 for a win, 39 for 2nd place, 38 for 3rd place, right down to 2 points for finishing 39th or lower. It is 30 points for a win in Classic Graduates and Sigma Graduates, as they generally have slightly smaller grids. And even a driver who fails to finish will still earn one point. At the end of the season, drivers drop their lowest three scores, to allow for missing a race or two, or a "DNF" (did not finish).

In addition to the standard [[Motor Sports Association|MSA]] motorsport rules, the club operates a Driving Standards function which ensures that the close racing is fair and safe for all.

The club's racing is organised through the [[British Automobile Racing Club|BARC]].

==Car Specifications==
The cars in the series are genuinely road-going, although Mega and SigMax Graduates spec is moving away from this with the deletion of lights, and indeed a few are driven to and (hopefully) from races. Many are used by drivers mid-week for transport to work and for shopping, needing no more than the covering up of competition numbers to make them road-legal. No changes from the standard specification are allowed, putting the emphasis firmly on driving ability rather than car development and set-up. Along with low consumable costs, this keeps the costs of running a car very much under control, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to go racing. The large grid sizes are a testament to this low-cost formula.

Current classes are:

===Classic Graduate===
1600cc [[Ford]] or [[Vauxhall]] engined Caterham Sevens with a [[live axle]], from the Caterham Scholarship or Academy 1995 - 2000. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 100&amp;nbsp;bhp.

===Sigma Graduate===
1600cc [[Ford Sigma engine|Ford Sigma-engined cars]] from the 2008 [[Caterham Academy]] onwards or 2009/10 Roadsport B. The only significant permitted changes are a swap to stickier Yokohama A048R tyres and an optional rear anti-roll bar. The cars have independent [[De dion tube|DeDion]] rear suspension, produce around 120&amp;nbsp;bhp and are fully road-legal.

===Super Graduate===
1600cc [[Rover K engine|Rover K-series]] Caterham Sevens with [[De dion tube|DeDion]] rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2007 or Roadsport B up to 2008. A current "Roadsport A" spec car can be converted into a Super Graduate relatively easily and at low cost. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 125&amp;nbsp;bhp.

===SigMax Graduate===
Uprated 1600cc [[Ford Sigma engine|Ford Sigma-engined cars]] from the 2008 [[Caterham Academy]] onwards or 2009/10 Roadsport B. No lights or windscreen, widetrack suspension, controlled engine upgrades and lightened flywheel.

===Mega Graduate===
Uprated 1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with independent (DeDion) rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2008. These cars are semi-road legal (no lights or windscreen) and with controlled modifications produce around 140&amp;nbsp;bhp.

All classes run on [https://web.archive.org/web/20090504065326/http://www.polleysport.co.uk/polley/catalogue_tyres.asp Yokohama] road legal tyres. Classic Graduates race on [[Motor Sports Association|MSA]] list 1A A539s, whilst Sigmas, Supers, Sigmax and Megas use the stickier list 1B A048R (medium compound)

==Affordability and Technical Support==
Affordability is a key ingredient to Caterham Graduates racing. Strict regulations allow only limited modifications and work on the sealed engines is limited to nominated engine builders - [http://www.mcmm.co.uk/ McMillan Motorsport] and - for Sigmas and K-series only - [[Caterham Cars]].

Other ways the club promotes affordability include limiting the amount of tyres the drivers can use through the season, providing race-day [[catering]] as part of the drivers' membership fees, and encouraging drivers either to stay on-site at the circuits or in budget hotels locally.

==Race Numbers==
Race numbers 1 - 49 go to Mega Graduates, 51 - 69 to Sigma Graduates, 71 - 99 to Classic Graduates, 101 - 149 to Super Graduates and 151-199 to Sigmax Graduate cars.

The lower race numbers represent a driver's performance in the previous season, as the first ten numbers in each class are reserved for those finishing in the previous year's top ten. For instance, Ian Anderson's number 171 indicates that he came 1st in Sigma Graduates in 2011. Higher numbers go to those who are new to the championship or class.

Relatively few of the drivers have individual sponsors, although this is permitted.

'''Celebrate Brooklyn!''' is one of [[New York City]]’s longest running, free, outdoor performing [[arts festival]]s. Launched in 1979 by the then [[BRIC (nonprofit organization)|Fund for the Borough of Brooklyn]], as a catalyst for Brooklyn’s performing arts scene and to bring people back into [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] after years of neglect, Celebrate Brooklyn was an anchor in the park’s revitalization and has become one of the city’s foremost summer cultural attractions. Over the course of its history, the Festival has presented over 2,000 artists and ensembles reflective of the borough’s diversity, ranging from internationally acclaimed performers to emerging, cutting-edge artists.  The festival attracts upwards of 250,000 attendees from across New York City to the Prospect Park Bandshell each summer. The festival is produced by [[BRIC (nonprofit organization)|BRIC]], an organization that presents contemporary art, performing arts, and media programs throughout Brooklyn.  

Celebrate Brooklyn's music programming features established and emerging artists in a large and adventurous array of styles and genres ranging from regional American roots music, extremely varied world-music, classical and new music, jazz, pop and alt-rock and hip hop.

[[File:CropCircleW.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of a crop circle in Switzerland]]
A '''crop circle''' or '''crop formation''' is a pattern created by flattening a [[crop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/crop-circle?q=crop+circle|title=crop circle - Definition of crop circle in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually a [[cereal]]. The term was first coined in the early 1980s by Colin Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Andrews, Pat Delgado ''Circular Evidence: A Detailed Investigation of the Flattened Swirled Crops''. Phanes Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-7475-0635-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crop circles have been described as all falling "within the range of the sort of thing done in [[hoax]]es" by [[Taner Edis]], professor of physics at [[Truman State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Edis, Taner. ''Science and Nonbelief''. Prometheus Books. 2008, p. 138. {{ISBN|1-59102-561-3}} "Skeptics begin by pointing out that many paranormal claims are the result of fraud or hoaxes. Crop circles—elaborate patterns that appear on fields overnight—appear to be of this sort. Many crop circle makers have come forth or have been exposed. We know a great deal about their various techniques. So we do not need to find the perpetrator of every crop circle to figure out that probably they all are human made. Many true believers remain who continue to think there is something paranormal—perhaps alien—about crop circles. But the circles we know all fall within the range of the sort of thing done in hoaxes. Nothing stands out as extraordinary."&lt;/ref&gt; Although obscure natural causes or [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] origins of crop circles are suggested by [[Fringe theory|fringe theorists]],&lt;ref name="parker2000human"&gt;{{cite journal|

The number of crop circles has substantially increased from the 1970s to current times. There has been little scientific study of them. Circles in the United Kingdom are not distributed randomly across the landscape but appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population and cultural heritage monuments, such as [[Stonehenge]] or [[Avebury]].&lt;ref name="northcote"&gt;{{cite web |author= Jeremy Northcote |url= http://www.siue.edu/GEOGRAPHY/ONLINE/Northcote06.pdf |title= Spatial distribution of England's crop circles |journal= Geography Online |publisher= [[Southern Illinois University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, two hoaxers, Bower and Chorley, took credit for having created many circles throughout England after one of their circles was described by a circle investigator as impossible to be made by human hand.&lt;ref name="nyt1991"/&gt;

Formations are usually created overnight,&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; although some are reported to have appeared during the day.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 140–42}} In contrast to crop circles or crop formations, archaeological remains can cause [[cropmark]]s in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but they do not appear overnight, and they are always in the same places every year.

== History ==

The concept of "crop circles" began with the original late-1970s hoaxes by Doug Bower and Dave Chorley (see [[#Bower and Chorley|Bower and Chorley]], below).&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Demon-Haunted World]] |author= Carl Sagan |authorlink= Carl Sagan |year= 1997 |pages= 72–76|isbn= 0747251568 |publisher= [[Headline Publishing Group]] |ref= {{harvid|Sagan|1997}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGEO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |author1= Rob Irving |author2= Peter Brookesmith |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Crop-Circles-The-Art-of-the-Hoax.html |title= Crop Circles: The Art of the Hoax |work= Smithsonian.com |date= December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said that they were inspired by the [[Tully, Queensland|Tully]] "saucer nest" case in Australia, where a farmer claimed to first have seen a UFO, then found a flattened circle of swamp reeds.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt;

=== Before the 20th century ===

A 1678 news pamphlet ''[[Mowing-Devil|The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire]]'' is claimed by some cereologists to be the first depiction of a crop circle.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider it to be a historical precedent because it describes the stalks as being cut rather than bent&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; (see [[#Folklore|folklore section]]).

In 1686, British [[naturalist]] [[Robert Plot]] reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms (see [[fairy ring]]s) in ''The Natural History of Stafford-Shire'' and proposed air flows from the sky as a cause.&lt;ref name=NatHist&gt;{{cite book |author= John Aubrey |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |title= The Natural History of Stafford-Shire |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402233131/http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |archivedate= 2 April 2007 |df= dmy-all }} at [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PhiloTrans&gt;{{cite journal |title= ''The Natural History of Staffordshire'' by Robert Plott; ''Sciotericum Telescopicum or a new Contrivance of adapting a Telescope to a Horizontall Diall, for observing the moment of time by day or night'' by Will Molineux |journal= Philosophical Transactions |volume= 16 (1686–1692) |jstor= 101866 |pages= 207–16 |department= Accounts of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles, a claim that has been compared with those made by [[Erich von Däniken]].{{refn|group=n|Keving Greene wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;The difficulties that exist in communicating the results of archaeology have undoubtedly contributed to the flourishing of writers, such as Erich von Däniken, who take a particular delight in deriding the inability of 'experts' to find explanations that seize the imagination of the public. (...) Few archaeologists have sold as many paperbacks as von Däniken; more recently, a meteorologist who linked crop circles to prehistoric ring-ditches or round barrows generated a reaction that no orthodox student of these monuments has ever achieved (Meaden 1991) [in reference to {{cite book |author= T.

An 1880 letter to the editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by amateur scientist [[John Rand Capron]] describes how a recent storm had created several circles of flattened crops in a field.{{refn|name="Capron1880"|group=n|John Rand Capron wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;The storms about this part of Surrey have been lately local and violent, and the effects produced in some instances curious. Visiting a neighbour's farm on Wednesday evening (21st), we found a field of standing wheat considerably knocked about, not as an entirety, but in patches forming, as viewed from a distance, circular spots (...) they all presented much the same character, viz, a few standing stalks as a centre, some prostrate stalks with their heads arranged pretty evenly in a direction forming a circle round the centre, and outside there a circular wall of stalks which had not suffered. (...) I could not trace locally any circumstances accounting for the peculiar forms of the patches in the field, nor indicating whether it was wind or rain, or both combined, which had caused them, beyond the general evidence everywhere of heavy rainfall. They were suggestive to me of some cyclonic wind action, and may perhaps have been noticed elsewhere by some of your readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/022290d0 |bibcode= 1880Natur..22..290C |title= Storm Effects |url= http://www.iccra.org/Historical%20Research/Storm%20Effects_Nature_1880_J_Rand_Capron.pdf |year= 1880 |author= John Rand Capron |journal= Nature |volume= 22 |issue= 561 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=CJlFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 290]}} Retrieved from {{cite web |title= Nature archive for the decade 1880–1889 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/currentdecade.html?decade=1880&amp;year=1880 |work= nature.com |publisher= Nature |accessdate= 23 August 2011}} Republished in {{cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BGIdAQAAIAAJ |title= A case of genuine crop circles dating from July 1880 – as published in Nature in the year 1880 |journal= Journal of Meteorology |volume= 25 |pages= 20–21 |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

=== 20th century ===
In 1932, archaeologist E C Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester, but could examine only one: "a circle in which the barley was 'lodged' or beaten down, while the interior area was very slightly mounded up."&lt;ref&gt;Sussex Notes and Queries, 1937 Eliot Cecil Curwen pp. 139–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, amateur astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire, which he considered was probably caused by an unknown meteoric body. In nearby wheat fields, there were several circular and elliptical areas where the wheat had been flattened. There was evidence of "spiral flattening". He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater.&lt;ref&gt;Moore P. ‘That Wiltshire Crater’ Letter to the editor ''New Scientist'' 8 August 1963
{{blockquote|1=In the adjoining wheatfields were other features, taking the form of circular or elliptical areas in which the wheat had been flattened. I saw these myself; they had not been much visited, and were certainly peculiar One, very well-defined, was an oval 15 yards long by 41 broad. There was evidence of "spiral flattening", and in one case there was a circular area in the centre in which the wheat had not been flattened. In no case was there any evidence of an actual depression in the ground.

(...) [The crater] could have been caused by natural subsidence, but it did not give that impression, and in any case there are the areas of flattened wheat to be taken into account; it would be remarkable coincidence if these areas were not associated with the crater. Since the areas of flattened wheat "led" to the crater, it looks very much as though they, and the crater, were caused by something which came from the sky. In this case, the wheat would have been flattened by violent air-currents produced by the falling body.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Hugh Ernest Butler]] observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Ernest Butler 'That Wiltshire Crater', ''New Scientist'' issue 352, 15 August 1963 Letters to the editor&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, in [[Tully, Queensland]], Australia, and in Canada, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt; For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in [[Duhamel, Alberta]], Canada; [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] investigators concluded that it was artificial but couldn't say who made them or how.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ufo/002029-1200-e.html |title= Canada's Unidentified Flying Objects: The Search for the Unknown: Duhamel, Alberta: August 1967 |date= 14 December 2007 |origyear= 2005}} At Library and Archives Canada. ([http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ovni/002029-1200.01-f.html Original] in French).&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous case is the 1966 Tully "saucer nest", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or {{convert|40|ft|m}} from a swamp and then fly away. On investigating he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud.&lt;ref name=skepticssa&gt;{{cite web |author= Laurie Eddie |date= 4 November 2004 |url= http://www.skepticssa.org.au/html/cropcircles.html |title= The Skeptics SA Guide to: Crop circles |work= Skepticssa.org.au. |publisher= Skeptics SA |accessdate= 2012-01-01 |ref= {{harvid|Eddie|2004}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local police officer, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and the [[University of Queensland]] concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a [[willy-willy]] (dust devil), or a [[waterspout]]. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the "saucer" was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The flattened crops society |work= [[The Scotsman]] |date= September 7, 2002 | author= Jim Gilchrist |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12991491.html }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, there had been a surge of UFOlogists in [[Wiltshire]], and there were rumours of "saucer nests" appearing in the area, but they were never photographed.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; There are other pre-1970s reports of circular formations, especially in Australia and Canada, but they were always simple circles, which could have been caused by whirlwinds.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt; In ''[[Fortean Times]]'' David Wood reported that in 1940 he had already made crop circles near [[Gloucestershire]] using ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eddie|2004}} citing: {{cite journal |author= D.

Meteorol''. 13 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The coining of the term "crop circle" is attributed to [[Colin Andrews]] in the late 1970s or early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Brian Regal |title= Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia |publisher= Greenwood Press |year= 2009 |isbn= 9780313355073 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?ei=2aNnUpPmK-LT0QWBxIGIDw&amp;id=14AbAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22crop+circles%22++colin+andrews+coined&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=coined 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/5452330/Crop-circle-picture-gallery-shows-more-complex-forms.html |title= Crop circle picture gallery shows more complex forms |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 5 June 2009 |accessdate= 23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared in and spread since the late 1970s&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;{{cite book |title= Reframing Dutch Culture: Between Otherness and Authenticity |series= Progress in European Ethnology |author1= Peter Jan Margry |author2= Herman Roodenburg |edition= illustrated |publisher= [[Ashgate Publishing]] |year= 2007 |pages= 150–51 |isbn= 9780754647058 |ref= {{harvid|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many circles began appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in [[Hampshire]] and Wiltshire. After Bower's and Chorley's 1991 statement that they were responsible for many of them, circles started appearing all over the world.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011" /&gt; To date, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, the U.S., and Canada.

Although farmers expressed concern at the damage caused to their crops, local response to the appearance of crop circles was often enthusiastic, with locals taking advantage of the increase of tourism and visits from scientists, crop circle researchers, and individuals seeking spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name=NGEO&gt;{{cite news |author= Hillary Mayell |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020801_cropcircles.html |title= Crop circles: Artwork or alien signs |page= [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020801_cropcircles_2.html 2] |magazine= National Geographic |date= 2 August 2002 |accessdate= 28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for crop-circle interest consequently generated bus or helicopter tours of circle sites, walking tours, T-shirts, and book sales.

=== 21st century ===
Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes&lt;ref name="Taylor2011" /&gt; and some incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Benjamin Radford |url= http://www.livescience.com/6546-beautiful-math-equation-crop-circle.html |title= 'Beautiful Math Equation' Found in Crop Circle |work= [[LiveScience]] |date= 8 June 2010 |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Marc West |date= 2008-06-30 |url= http://plus.maths.org/content/pi-appears-crop-circle |title= Pi appears in crop circle |work= plus.maths.org. |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/crop-circle-season-arrives-with-a-mathematical-message-1982647.html |title= Crop circle season arrives with a mathematical message |department= This Britain |newspaper= The Independent |date= 2010-05-26 |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or [[Avebury]]. He found that they always appeared in areas that were easy to access. This suggests strongly that these crop circles were more likely to be caused by intentional human action than by paranormal activity. Another strong indication of that theory was that inhabitants of the zone with the most circles had a historical tendency for making large-scale formations, including stone circles such as Stonehenge, burial mounds such as [[Silbury Hill]], long barrows such as [[West Kennet Long Barrow]], and [[:Category:White horses in England|white horses in chalk hills]].&lt;ref name="northcote"/&gt;

== Bower and Chorley ==
In 1991, self-professed [[practical joke|pranksters]] Doug Bower and Dave Chorley made headlines claiming it was they who started the phenomenon in 1978 with the use of simple tools consisting of a plank of wood, rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk in a straight line.&lt;ref name="today91"&gt;{{cite news |author= Graham Brough |year= 1991 |title= Men who conned the world |newspaper= Today (defunct) |location= UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a "cereologist" (advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles), Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax.&lt;ref name="nyt1991"&gt;{{cite news |title= 2 'Jovial Con Men' Demystify Those Crop Circles in Britain |newspaper= New York Times |author= William E.

According to Professor Richard Taylor, "the pictographs they created inspired a second wave of crop artists.

== Legal implications ==
In 1992, Hungarian youths Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos, both then 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle. Takács and Dallos, of the St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a high school in Hungary specializing in [[agriculture]], created a {{convert|36|m|adj=on}} diameter crop circle in a wheat field near [[Székesfehérvár]], {{convert|43|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[Budapest]], on June 8, 1992. On September 3, the pair appeared on Hungarian TV and exposed the circle as a hoax, showing photos of the field before and after the circle was made. As a result, Aranykalász Co., the owners of the land, sued the teens for 630,000&amp;nbsp;[[Hungarian forint|Ft]] (~$3,000 USD) in [[damages]]. The presiding judge ruled that the students were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself, amounting to about 6,000&amp;nbsp;Ft (~$30 USD), and that 99% of the damage to the crops was caused by the thousands of visitors who flocked to Székesfehérvár following the media's promotion of the circle.

== Creation ==
[[File:Swiss crop circle detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of a crop circle in a field in Switzerland]]
The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, [[advertising]], or [[Crop art#Crop circles|art]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Sceptics of the paranormal point out that all characteristics of crop circles are fully compatible with their being made by hoaxers.&lt;ref name="csicop"/&gt;

Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; When some people refused to believe them, they deliberately added straight lines and squares to show that they could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;

The main criticism of alleged non-human creation of crop circles is that while evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to be the work of human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be "the real thing", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |authorlink= Joe Nickell |title= Crop-circle mania: An investigative update |journal= Skeptical Inquirer}} Cited as reference 6 in {{harvnb|Nickell|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Bower and Chorley and tabloid ''Today'' hoaxing Pat Delgado,&lt;ref name="today91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist91"/&gt; the Wessex Sceptics and [[Channel 4]]'s ''Equinox'' hoaxing Terence Meaden,&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist91"&gt;{{cite news |title= Flattened.

He reported on "expert" sources such as ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', who had been easily fooled and mused about why people want to believe [[supernatural]] explanations for phenomena that are not yet explained. Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the [[Internet]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising.&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"/&gt;{{refn|group=n|name= "Cohen2008"}} Many crop circles show human symbols, like the heart and arrow symbol of love, stereotyped alien faces,{{refn|group=n|The website Crop Circle Research.com described one formation stating, "It looks reminiscent of a fake dummy constructed by 'Balok' in a Star Trek episode called '[[The Corbomite Maneuver|Corbomite Manourvre]]'{{sic}} (series 1)' or the logo of local soccer club [[Feyenoord]]".{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 143–45}}}}

Advocates of non-human causes discount on-site evidence of human involvement as attempts to discredit the phenomena.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 143–45}} Some even argue a [[conspiracy theory]], with governments planting evidence of hoaxing to muddle the origins of the circles.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 143–45}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/607074/Former-RAF-engineer-MI5-paid-people-to-fake-crop-circles-to-discredit-UFO-research|title=Former RAF engineer: MI5 'paid people to fake crop circles' to discredit UFO research|first=Jon|last=Austin|date=22 September 2015|publisher=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Ridley wrote negative articles in newspapers, he was accused of spreading "government disinformation" and of working for the UK military intelligence service [[MI5]].&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt; Ridley responded by noting that many cereologists make good livings from selling books and providing high-priced personal tours through crop fields, and he claimed that they have vested interests in rejecting what is by far the most likely explanation for the circles.&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ridley WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |title= Houdini, crop circles and the need to believe |first= Matt |last=Ridley |newspaper= [[Wall Street Journal]] |date= 4 June 2011 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303657404576357462969207014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative explanations ==
=== Weather ===
It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak [[tornado]]es to [[ball lightning]], but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/circular_reasoning_the_mystery_of_crop_circles_and_their_orbs_of_light/ |title= Circular Reasoning: The 'Mystery' of Crop Circles and Their 'Orbs' of Light |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume= 26.5 |date=September–October 2002 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206012813/http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-09/crop-circles.html |archivedate= 2006-12-06 |deadurl= no |ref= {{harvid|Nickell|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal ''Nature'' about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm, saying their shape was "suggestive of some cyclonic wind action".{{refn|group=n|name= "Capron1880"}}

In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; As circles became more complex, Terence had to create increasingly complex theories, blaming an electromagneto-hydrodynamic "plasma vortex".&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; The meteorological theory became popular, and it was even referenced in 1991 by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] who said that, "Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air".&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2011|title=Coming soon to a field near you|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/richardtaylor/files/2015/12/CropCirclesphysicsworld-1o814jx.pdf|department=Feature: Crop circles|journal=Physics World|ref={{harvid|Taylor|2011}}|author=Richard Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather theory suffered a serious blow in 1991, but Hawking's point about hoaxes was supported when Bower and Chorley stated that they had been responsible for making all those circles.{{refn|group=n|name="Taylor2011_note"|In a ''Physics World'' article Richard Taylor wrote, "Today, with the benefit of hindsight, such explanations sound rather contrived. At the height of the debate, though, no less a physicist than Stephen Hawking was prepared to accept some version of Meaden's theory. When a spate of circles appeared in the countryside near his Cambridge home in 1991, Hawking told a local newspaper that "crop circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} By the end of 1991 Meaden conceded that those circles that had complex designs were made by hoaxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Simon Hoggart |author2= Mike Hutchinson |year= 1995 |title= Bizarre Beliefs |location= London |publisher= Richard Cohen Books |page= 59 |isbn= 9781573921565}} Cited in {{harvnb|Nickell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have become the subject of speculation by various [[paranormal]], [[ufology|ufological]], and [[forteana|anomalistic]] investigators ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]].&lt;ref name="csicop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5777580/Mayan-apocalypse-crop-circle-appears-at-Silbury-Hill.html |title= Mayan 'apocalypse' crop circle appears at Silbury Hill |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haselhoff1&gt;{{cite book |author= Eltjo Haselhoff |year= 2001 |title= The Deepening Complexity of Crop Circles: Scientific Research &amp; Urban Legends |publisher= Frog Ltd |isbn= 1583940464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clark1&gt;{{cite book |author1= Jerome Clark |author2= Nancy Pear |year= 1995 |title= Strange and Unexplained Happenings: When Nature Breaks the Rules of Science |publisher= [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |volume= 3 |isbn= 0810397803}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to [[ley line]]s.&lt;ref name=Haselhoff1/&gt;{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 138–39}}&lt;ref name=faussett1&gt;{{cite book |author= Charles Godfrey-Faussett |year= 2004 |title= England |series= Footprint Travel Guides |isbn= 1903471915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many  [[New Age]] groups incorporate crop circles into their belief systems.

Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lighting and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 138}} Some proposed entities are: [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] asking to stop [[global warming]] and human [[pollution]], God, supernatural beings (for example Indian [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]), the collective minds of humanity through a proposed "quantum field", or extraterrestrial beings.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 138}}

Responding to local beliefs that "extraterrestrial beings" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian [[National Institute of Aeronautics and Space]] (LAPAN) described crop circles as "man-made". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated, "We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven." Among others, paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists, and [[anomalistics|anomalistic]] investigators have offered hypothetical explanations that have been criticized as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] by [[scientific skepticism|sceptical]] groups and scientists, including the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"&gt;{{cite news |author= John Vidal |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jun/05/ruralaffairs |title= The bizarre revival of crop circles – and advice on how to make your own |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nickell1996&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |authorlink= Joe Nickell |journal= [[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=June 1996 |volume= 6.2 |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/levengoods_crop-circle_plant_research |title=Levengood’s crop-circle plant research |ref= {{harvid|Nickell|1996}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=levengood1994&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.C.

=== Animal activity ===
In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of [[Tasmania]] stated that Australian [[Wallaby|wallabies]] had been found creating crop circles in fields of [[opium poppy|opium poppies]], which are grown legally for medicinal use, after consuming some of the opiate-laden poppies and running in circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper= BBC News | date= 25 June 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8118257.stm|title=Stoned wallabies make crop circles|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to crops ===
A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late&lt;!--described as semi-retired by csicop source--&gt; biophysicist William Levengood) have found differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man-made.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt;

Levengood published papers in journal ''[[Physiologia Plantarum]]'' in 1994&lt;ref name=levengood1994 /&gt; and 1999.&lt;ref name=levengood1999&gt;{{cite journal |author1= W.C. Levengood |author2= Nancy P. Talbott |year= 1999 |title= Dispersion of energies in worldwide crop formations |journal= Physiologia Plantarum |volume= 105 |pages= 615–24 |doi=10.1034/j.1399-3054.1999.105404.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1994 paper he found that certain deformities in the grain inside the circles were correlated to the position of the grain inside the circle.&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt; In 1996 sceptic [[Joe Nickell]] objected that [[correlation is not causation]],&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt; raised several objections to the Levengood's methods and assumptions,&lt;ref name=nickell1996/&gt; and said "Until his work is independently replicated by qualified scientists doing 'double-blind' studies and otherwise following stringent scientific protocols, there seems no need to take seriously the many dubious claims that Levengood makes, including his similar ones involving plants at alleged 'cattle mutilation' sites." (in reference to [[cattle mutilation]]).&lt;ref name=nickell1996/&gt;

A study by Eltjo Haselhoff reported that the [[pulvini]] of wheat in 95% of the crop circles investigated were elongated in a pattern falling off with distance from the centre and that seeds from the bent-over plants grew much more slowly under controlled conditions. Furthermore, traces of crop circle patterns are sometimes found in the crop the following year, "suggesting long-term damage to the crop field consistent with Levengood's observations of stunted seed growth."

=== Magnetism ===
In 2000, Colin Andrews, who had researched crop circles for 17 years, stated that while he believed 80% were man-made, he thought the remaining circles, with less elaborate designs, could be explained by a three-degree shift in the [[Earth's magnetic field]], that creates a current that "electrocutes" the crops, causing them to flatten and form the circle.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/872142.stm | title=Magnetic 'solution' to crop circle puzzle | work=BBC News | date=9 August 2000 | accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==
Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old [[Folklore|folkloric]] tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Circle crops are culture-dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they don't appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 152}}

Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of "[[Fairy ring|fairie rings]]".&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Tales also mention [[Will-o'-the-wisp|balls of light]] many times but never in relation to crop circles.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

[[File:Diablefaucheur.jpg|thumb|upright|1678 pamphlet on the "[[Mowing-Devil]]".]]

A 17th-century English [[woodcut]] called the ''[[Mowing-Devil]]'' depicts the [[devil]] with a [[scythe]] mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. The [[pamphlet]] containing the image states that the farmer, disgusted at the wage his mower was demanding for his work, insisted that he would rather have "the devil himself" perform the task.  Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider this to be a historical precedent for crop circles because the stalks were cut down, not bent.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; The circular form indicated to the farmer that it had been caused by the devil.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

In the 1948 German story ''Die zwölf Schwäne'' (''The Twelve Swans''), a farmer every morning found a circular ring of flattened grain on his field. After several attempts, his son saw twelve [[swan maiden|princesses disguised as swans]], who took off their disguises and danced in the field. Crop rings produced by fungi may have inspired such tales since folklore holds these rings are created by dancing wolves or fairies.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

==The hoax==
A few days before April 1, 2007, Dan Baines, a 31-year-old illusion [[designer]] for [[Magician (illusion)|magician]]s from London, posted images on his website purporting to show the remains of a [[fairy]].&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/derbyshire/6514283.stm Fairy fool sparks huge response]" from [[BBC News]].

The "corpse", as shown in the pictures, had intact ears, wings, hair, skin and teeth, and had, according to Baines, ‘been examined by anthropologists and forensic experts who can confirm the body is genuine’.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; According to the website, X-rays of the 'fairy' showed that its body's structure was the same as that of a child. The bones, however, were described to be ‘hollow like those of a bird, making them particularly light.’&lt;ref name="The Sun"/&gt;

In spite of the coming of [[April Fool's Day]], the website received feedback from a large number of fairy believers, accumulating over 20,000 hits in one day.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt; On April 1, Baines appended a note to the website, thanking the readers for expressing their interest in his story and acknowledging that the fairy corpse was fake. He wrote: "Even if you believe in fairies, as I personally do, there will always have been an element of doubt in your mind that would suggest the remains are a hoax. However, the magic created by the possibility of the fairy being real is something you will remember for the rest of your life."&lt;ref name="Snope"&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/deadfairy.asp Dead fairy] from [[Urban Legends Reference Pages]]. Retrieved on July 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Baines listed the mummified fairy on [[eBay]] and the model attracted nearly 40 bids. The highest at the close of the sale was made by a private [[art collector]] in the United States and the fairy was sold for £280.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Sun"/&gt;

==Response==
Baines received hundreds of emails in response, including comments from those who claimed to have found similar fairy remains. "There was one person who was quite upset because I revealed the place where the fairy was found," he said.&lt;ref name="The Sun"/&gt; When Baines admitted that the dead fairy was in fact a model created by himself as an April Fools' prank and its back-story was a hoax, some still believed it was genuine, accusing Baines of covering up the 'truth' about the existence of fairies and deliberately issuing false information to harm the credibility of those who believe in them. It was noted that the number of queries sent to Baines regarding the dead fairy did not slow down after the revelation of his hoax. After the event, he described the response to his prank as "uncanny" and that it had taken him up to four hours a day to respond to the emails he had been receiving regarding the subject.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt;

'''''El Cantante''''' is a 2006 [[biographical film]] which stars singers [[Marc Anthony]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]. The film is based on the life of the late [[salsa music|salsa]] singer [[Héctor Lavoe]], who is portrayed by Anthony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=latinmusic.about.com | url=http://latinmusic.about.com/od/cdmusicreviews/fr/REVELCANTANTE.htm |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is told from the viewpoint of Puchi, Hector's wife, portrayed by Lopez. Initially debuting at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 12, 2006, ''El Cantante'' was released on August 3, 2007.

Distributed by [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse]], the film runs for 106 minutes and is rated R for language, sexuality and drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Cantante|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/el-cantante/|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Box Office Mojo]], ''El Cantante'' is the twenty-sixth highest-grossing musical biopic of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biopic - Music Movies at the Box Office - Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=musicbio.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]], [[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Puchi ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) talks about her late husband, salsa legend Héctor Lavoe "El Cantante De Los Cantantes" ("The singer of all the singers") ([[Marc Anthony]]), during a 2002 interview. Héctor Pérez leaves Puerto Rico, even though his father tries to persuade him not to go because if he does he'll lose a father. Héctor decides to go anyway against his father's will in an attempt to pursue his dreams. On his first night in the city he meets Eddie (Manny Pérez) and discovers the new sound of salsa flowing through the streets. He eventually becomes the lead singer in a salsa group performing in a bar. One night he is approached by salsa musician, Willie Colón (John Ortiz) and Johnny Pacheco. Johnny offers them a deal with Fania Records Company and Hector accepts. The company also suggests that he change his name to Héctor Lavoe. "Lavoe" meaning "the voice" in French. 

Héctor falls in love with Puchi, a girl who danced at the club where he performed. He confesses to her that his mother died when he was young, his brother was killed the night he came to New York and that he didn't have many people in his life. She tells him that they'll take care of each other. It is revealed that Héctor was cheating on Puchi with another girl named Carmen. Puchi reveals that Carmen and she were pregnant with a baby of his at the same time. But she is the only woman of his life because he chose her. They eventually get married and have a son named Tito. On a night of hard partying, Héctor catches Eddie doing drugs and does so too. This will be the start of his drug addiction. 

Through the years, after Héctor's consistent tardiness to gigs, Willie grows tired of Héctor's irresponsibility and decides to go solo. Héctor's drug and alcohol addiction continues to grow stronger and becomes very noticeable. Puchi is infuriated when she finds Tito eating alone and Héctor shooting up while the gas was on. She begs Héctor to quit the drugs and to turn his life around for their son and because he is always high and is missing out and she loves him. 

One night, Puchi wakes up to Héctor sitting with a gun staring into space, suicidally depressed. In fear she sends him to rehab. Puchi can't help feeling extremely guilty when Héctor's sister Priscilla blames all of Héctor's problems on her. She later takes him out and he is put on medication. A jealous Héctor calls Puchi a whore and frequently accuses her of having affairs with many different men. Héctor maintains sobriety and takes his family to Puerto Rico for vacation. When Héctor tries to reconcile with his father after leaving against his will, he rejects Héctor. This causes him more pain. He is diagnosed with HIV and advises Puchi to get tested as well. He maintains sobriety for a while but soon has a relapse and goes back to his old ways. Puchi and Héctor fight often and it usually ends with him leaving the house and then coming back and apologizing to her. 

Tito is killed when his friend accidentally shoots him while playing with the gun Héctor kept in the house. This scars Héctor for the rest of his life. In the interview, Puchi admits that Héctor was never the same after that, and he died along with their son. She says everyone expected too much from him.  Héctor confesses to Willie that he loves Puchi and that he wishes he would've done things differently, but it's too late and nothing is the same anymore. Willie encourages him to perform at a gig in Puerto Rico. At the concert, there is less than half of the audience due to bad managing and advertising. Still, he decides to perform for the few people who still showed up while it starts raining. He just couldn't hold in all the pain anymore. The depression and guilt are too much for Héctor to handle and it drives him to attempt suicide by jumping out a window. He survives the fall and lives another 5 years. 

Puchi is seen in her new apartment, listening to a voice mail from Hector, wishing her a happy birthday and that he'll always be there and love her. She smiles and begins to dance while looking at a picture of her and Héctor on the wall. The movie ends with Héctor performing and the credits revealing that he died at the age of 46 of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], from sharing needles. It is also, revealed that Puchi died shortly after this interview in 2002.

== Release ==
''El Cantante'', which has an [[MPAA]] rating of R, was first premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] which took place in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giese|first=Rachel|title=Guess Who’s Coming to Toronto?|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tiff/features/tiffcelebs.html|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then released to over 542 cinemas on August 3, 2007.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|title=El Cantante (2007)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=elcantante.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]], [[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marc Anthony Worried about Co-Starring with Jennifer|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/entertainment&amp;id=5537624|publisher=[[Go.com]], [[Disney Interactive Media Group]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=August 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened at No. 12 at the U.S. [[Box Office]], grossing $3,202,035 during its opening weekend. It averaged around $6,000 per theater. The following week, it grossed $1,401,148 and fell to No. 16. It left the chart at No. 115 on the week of September 28, 2007, after grossing $1,465.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Cantante (2007) - Weekend Box Office Results|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=elcantante.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]], [[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''El cantante'' grossed $7,556,712 domestically and $354,820 overseas, totaling $7.9 million.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt;

Charlotte O'Sullivan of the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' said the "film did not go down well" at the Box Office, crediting its lack of commercial success to Lopez and Anthony "know[ing] nothing about salsa" and its "negative view of the Latino community by focusing on Lavoe’s drug use and death from Aids", which had sparked [[El cantante#critism|controversy]].&lt;ref name="why" /&gt; The film's DVD was released on October 30, 2007. It became a hit, ranking at No. 8 on the DVD/Home Rentals chart at [[Box Office Mojo]], and had grossed $16.61 million in DVD sales as of December 23, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Cantante (2007) - DVD / Home Video Rentals|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&amp;id=elcantante.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]], [[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Following its [[Toronto International Film Festival]] premiere, ''El Cantante'' earned mostly negative reviews from critics and currently holds a 25% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 106 reviews.

Robert Koehler of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that the biopic, which contained "many standard-issue biopic montage sequences", was only "geared for the bigscreen, but the fairly bland visual design will make pic more than suitable to be seen on the tube". Koehler was critical of both performances, feeling that while Lopez brought "plenty of ferocity" to her character, there wasn't "shape" or "power" to her "wrath", and labeled Anthony "the dullest of movie drug addicts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koehler|first=Robert|title=El Cantante|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931648/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=September 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marc Anthony 2010.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Marc Anthony]]'s portrayal of Lavoe was met with a mixed reaction from film critics.]]

A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that Anthony as Lavoe was hidden behind "his high, delicate cheekbones and tinted glasses" but "Whenever Héctor takes the stage, however, Mr. Anthony unleashes his charisma, and shows that, whatever his limitations as an actor, he is a brilliant performer". Scott praised Lopez's performance, noting that it had "a lot of fight" with "a hard, skeptical edge" that made Puchi "a more interesting and plausible character than her husband".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=A.O|title=When the Salsa Throbs, a Singer’s Soul Is Revealed|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/movies/03cant.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=August 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Gonzalez of [[Slant Magazine]] gave the film and Anthony's performance a positive review, but was critical of Lopez, calling her performance "predictably self-conscious" but said her sequences "complements Puchi's own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Ed|title=El Cantante|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/el-cantante/1235|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]],|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=October 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renee Schonfield of [[Common Sense Media]] gave ''El Cantante'' a negative review, "brings the magic of salsa music to the screen; unfortunately, it also brings the audience another bleak story of a flameout singer bent on self-destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schonfeld|first=Renee|title=El Cantante|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/el-cantante|publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Maher of ''[[The Times]]'' was negative, stating that the "soft-pedalled account of Lavoe's rise to fame and his drug-related downfall that has more in common with the biopic parody Walk Hard than anything as muddy as real life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Cantante|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/el_cantante/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]], [[Flixter]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' said Anthony "gives a fine and impassioned performance" in a story that "relies on formula and clichés of the genre" which meant "we don't learn enough about what caused the Puerto Rican-born Lavoe's downward spiral into drug use, promiscuity and suicide attempts after he gained fame in New York City". Additionally, Puig criticized Lopez's airtime by stating "the film has far too much of her and not enough of Anthony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puig|first=Claudia|title=Music is the star of 'El Cantante'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2007-08-02-el-cantante_N.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=August 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Bradshaw of ''[[The Guardian]]'', in a review based primarily on Lopez, panned her performance and said "There is something entirely dead about Lopez's performance. No matter how superficially lively she makes it, she is always simply mouthing the lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|title=El Cantante|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/05/musicdocumentary|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Charlotte O'Sullivan of the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' praised Lopez and her character, "Lopez deserves praise for pushing this project. The recently deceased Puchi (who helped generate the script and pushed for Lopez to play her) is not the kind of character you see on screen every day. She has not been whitewashed and neither, thank goodness, has her husband".&lt;ref name="why"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Sullivan|first=Charlotte|title=Dance class with J-Lo in El Cantante|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/arts/film/dance-class-with-jlo-in-el-cantante-7409424.html|work=[[Evening Standard]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The film was criticized, and accused of "usurping barrio culture and exploiting Lavoe's memory", with salsa singer [[Ismael Miranda]] condemning it for "focusing too much on the tragic artist's drug abuse, which eventually led to his death from AIDS complications". Other celebrities who criticized the film included singer [[Domingo Quiñones]], and vocalist [[Cheo Feliciano]].&lt;ref name="angry" /&gt; [[Willie Colón]], Lavoe's long time friend and musical partner, was critical of the film. Although he had been hired as a consultant for ''El cantante'', he was not pleased with the end result, stating:&lt;ref name="angry"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurza|first=Augustin|title=Friendly fire over salsa movie|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/04/entertainment/et-culture4|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=August 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The creators of El Cantante missed an opportunity to do something of relevance for our community. The real story was about Hector fighting the obstacles of a nonsupportive industry that took advantage of entertainers with his charisma and talent. Instead they did another movie about two Puerto Rican junkies".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Additionally, Colón blamed Lopez and Anthony:&lt;ref name="angry" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It's difficult to comprehend how two individuals who are in the music business like Marc and Jennifer are not aware of the damage and the consequences of promoting only the negative side of our Latin music culture".&lt;/blockquote&gt; And while the film was predominantly a love story, Colón also noted that in real life, he believed Puchi caused Lavoe's drug problems, but was canonized "so that Jennifer can play her".&lt;ref name="angry" /&gt; David L. Coddon of ''[[U-T San Diego]]'' said following the film's release, "Latino pop culture's highest-profile couple is taking heat from salsa purists who complain that the film, about salsa legend Hector Lavoe, is a distortion, even an exploitation", while also stating Lopez is "one of the most famous women in the world, and there's nothing her critics can do to change that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coddon|first=David|title=Controversy, film choices don't dim J. Lo's star|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070824/news_lz1c24coddon.html|work=[[U-T San Diego]]|publisher=MLIM Holdings|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NPR]]'s Felix Contreras weighed in on the criticism, pointing out that " any time you have a portrayal of an artist where they reflect a history of drug abuse or alcohol abuse" there would always be criticism, and "in this case, some folks are arguing that the film was focusing on that drug abuse, and not necessarily on what he generated or what he contributed to the music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salsa Star Immortalized in Lopez, Anthony Film|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12587126|publisher=[[NPR]], National Public Radio, Inc.|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When commenting on the film, Lopez felt her performance should have earned an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination and blamed the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for overlooking both the film and her performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinkisthenewblog.com/2010/01/jennifer-lopez-tells-latina-magazine-she-deserves-an-oscar/ ''Jennifer Lopez Tells ‘Latina’ Magazine She Deserves An Oscar''] from ''[[Latina magazine]]'' February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Evita''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and lyrics and book by [[Tim Rice]]. It concentrates on the life of [[Politics of Argentina|Argentine political leader]] [[Eva Perón]], the second wife of [[President of Argentina|Argentine president]] [[Juan Perón]]. The story follows Evita's early life, rise to power, charity work, and eventual death.

The musical began as a [[Evita (1976 album)|rock opera concept album]] released in 1976. Its success led to productions in [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1978, winning the [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for Best Musical, and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] a year later, where it was the first British musical to receive the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical.

This has been followed by a string of professional tours and worldwide productions and numerous cast albums, as well as a major [[Evita (1996 film)|1996 film]] of the musical starring [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Antonio Banderas]]. The musical was revived in London in 2006, and on Broadway in 2012, and toured the UK again in 2013–14 before running for 55 West End performances at the [[Dominion Theatre]] in September–October 2014.

==Synopsis==

'''Act I'''

In 1952 [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], a crowd is watching a film ("A Cinema in Buenos Aires, July 26, 1952") that is interrupted when news breaks of the death of [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of Argentina|First Lady]] [[Eva Perón]]. Both the crowd and the nation go into public mourning ("Requiem for Evita") as Ché, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did "nothing, for years" ("[[Oh What a Circus]]").

In 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte lives in the provincial town of [[Junín, Buenos Aires|Junín]], and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva falls in love with a [[tango music|tango]] singer, [[Agustín Magaldi]], after she meets him at one of his shows ("On This Night of a Thousand Stars"). Eva persuades Magaldi into taking her with him to Buenos Aires and though he is initially resistant, he eventually accepts ("Eva, Beware of the City"). Upon her arrival at the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress ("Buenos Aires"). After her arrival, Eva is quick to leave Magaldi, and Che relates the story of how Eva sleeps her way up the social ladder, becoming a model, radio star, and actress ("Goodnight and Thank You"). He then tells of both a [[right-wing]] coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Perón, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder ("The Lady's Got Potential"). In a game of [[musical chairs]] that represents the rise of political figures, Perón and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy ("The Art of the Possible").

After a devastating earthquake hits the town of [[San Juan (Argentina)|San Juan]], Perón organises a charity concert at [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires|Luna Park]] to provide aid to the victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Agustín Magaldi, who coldly shuns her for her past actions. Perón addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits ("Charity Concert"). Eva and Perón share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Perón rise to power ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You"). Eva dismisses Perón's Mistress (the character is known only by that title), who ponders the rejection ("Another Suitcase in Another Hall").

Upon moving in with Perón, Eva is introduced to high society only to be met with disdain from the upper classes and the [[Argentine Army]] ("Perón's Latest Flame"). In 1946, after launching his presidential bid, Perón discusses his chances of winning the election with Eva. After reassuring him of their chances of winning, Eva organizes rallies for the ''descamisados'' and gives them hope for a better future while Perón and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way ("A New Argentina").

'''Act II'''

Perón is elected president in a sweeping victory in 1946. He stands "On The Balcony of the [[Casa Rosada]]" addressing his ''descamisados'' (shirtless ones). Eva speaks from the balcony of the Presidential Palace to her adoring supporters, where she reveals that despite her initial goal of achieving fame and glory, she has found her true calling to be the people of her country ("[[Don't Cry for Me, Argentina]]"). Che analyses the price of fame as Eva dances at the Inaugural Ball with Perón, now the president-elect ("High Flying, Adored").

Eva insists on a glamorous image to impress the people of Argentina and promote [[Peronism|Perónism]]. She prepares to tour in Europe as she is dressed for success by her fashion consultants ("Rainbow High"). Her famous 1946 tour meets with mixed results ("Rainbow Tour"); Spaniards adore her, but the Italians liken her husband to [[Benito Mussolini]]. France is unimpressed, and the English snub her by inviting her to a country estate, rather than [[Buckingham Palace]]. Eva affirms her disdain for the upper class, while Che asks her to start helping those in need as she promised ("The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines (You'd Like to Hear)"). Eva begins the [[Eva Perón Foundation]] to direct her charity work. Che describes Eva's controversial charitable work, and possible [[money laundering]] ("And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)").

Eva appears at a church to take the [[sacrament]] in front of her adoring supporters ("Santa Evita"), but passes out suddenly, and while passed out, appears to have dream that reflects upon the conflicting views of her life. In her dream, she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentine people for her own ends, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world's problems from the sidelines ("A Waltz for Eva and Che"). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Afterward, Eva finally understands that Perón loves her for herself, not just for what she can do for him and his career ("[[You Must Love Me]]"). Che points out the disastrous results of Perón's policies on Argentina: its treasury is bankrupt, its once-thriving beef industry under rationing, and the press and other critics of the regime muzzled.

Perón's generals finally get sick of Eva's meddling and demand that Perón force her to leave politics. However, Perón objects and claims that if it wasn't for her, they would never have achieved as much as they have ("She Is a Diamond"). But he also concedes she won't be able to keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her [[cervical cancer|cancer]]. Even so, Eva is determined to run for [[vice-president]], and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue, despite her failing health ("Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet").

Realizing she is close to death, Eva renounces her pursuit of the vice presidency and swears her eternal love to the people of Argentina ("Eva's Final Broadcast"). Eva's achievements flash before her eyes before she dies ("Montage"), and she asks for forgiveness, contemplating her choice of fame instead of long life ("Lament"). Eva dies, and embalmers preserve her body forever. Che notes that a monument was set to be built for Evita but "only the pedestal was completed when Evita's body disappeared for 17 years..."

==History==
[[File:New York bus, 1982.png|thumb|left|A bus in New York featuring an ''Evita'' advertisement in 1982.]]
In 1972, [[Robert Stigwood]] proposed that [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] develop a new musical version of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'', but they abandoned the project.

Travelling late to a meal one night in 1973, though, Rice heard the end of a radio show about Eva Perón which intrigued him. As a child stamp collector, he had been fascinated by her image on the Argentine stamps, but was unaware of her significance in Argentina's history. He began research and was introduced by a Cinema International Corporation executive to the Argentine film director Carlos Pasini Hansen who had produced the TV film ''Queen of Hearts'', which had aired in the UK on 24 October 1972. The executive also arranged for Rice to see the film at [[Thames Television]] which he did "at least twenty times" saying also that "by that time I had seen Pasini's superbly researched film, I was hooked."&lt;ref&gt;Citron, pp.192–193&lt;/ref&gt; The more Rice investigated Eva Perón, going so far as to travel to [[Buenos Aires]] to research her life with many documents and contacts that Pasini had supplied, the more fascinated he became by the woman; he even named his first daughter after her.

Rice suggested the idea of a musical based on the subject to Lloyd Webber, but although the idea of writing a score including [[Tango (dance)|tango]]s, [[paso doble|pasos dobles]], and similar Latin flavours intrigued him, Lloyd Webber ultimately rejected the idea. He decided instead to collaborate with [[Alan Ayckbourn]] on ''[[By Jeeves|Jeeves]]'', a traditional [[Rodgers and Hart]]-style musical based on the [[P. G. Wodehouse]] character, which proved to be a critical and commercial failure.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, pp.191–97&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Jeeves'', Lloyd Webber returned to Rice, and they began developing Rice's proposed musical.

The authors of the 1996 book ''Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón'' claim the musical was based on Mary Main's biography ''[[The Woman with the Whip]]'', which was extremely critical of Eva Perón.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser and Navarro, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Though Rice praised the Main biography, it was never officially credited as source material. Rice created a character, Che, to serve as a narrator and [[Greek chorus]]. Although he had recently discovered [[Che Guevara]] was Argentine, he did not necessarily intend that the character be based upon him, despite inserting specific biographical details into the lyrics that clearly apply to Guevara. When [[Harold Prince]] later became involved with the project, he insisted that the actors portraying Che should use Guevara as a role model.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1996 film adaptation, the character returned to his more anonymous roots. This was also the case for the 2006 London revival.&lt;ref&gt;Programme notes, 2006 London production&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd Webber and the conductor Anthony Bowles presented the musical at the second [[Sydmonton Festival]] before making the recording with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Citron, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
As they had previously done with ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', the songwriting team decided to record ''Evita'' as an [[album musical]] and selected actress and singer [[Julie Covington]] to sing the title role, after having caught an episode of [[Rock Follies]] and remembered her from the original London production of ''[[Godspell]]''. The recording, which was released by [[MCA Records]] who had previously marketed ''Jesus Christ Superstar'', commenced in April 1976 and was produced by Lloyd Webber and Rice. The recording was engineered by David Hamilton Smith, whose work Rice later acknowledged was effectively that of a third producer. He also delivered the line, "Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants," a rebuttal to Eva's balcony speech on the album.

Released in 1976, the two-record set included [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] as [[Juan Perón]], [[Colm Wilkinson]] as Che, [[Barbara Dickson]] as Perón's mistress, and [[Tony Christie]] as [[Agustín Magaldi]]. The writers had originally considered [[Steve Marriott]] and [[John Fogerty]] but neither was interested. [[Murray Head]], who had enormous success with the ''Superstar'' album, recorded some demos but Rice later admitted they "didn't really reproduce the magic that his portrayal of Judas had." Colm Wilkinson had recently played Judas in the London production of ''Superstar'' and agreed to audition: "It only took a couple of verses to know he was our man."

[[Mike d'Abo]], who had succeeded Paul Jones as lead singer of [[Manfred Mann]], had a minor role on the album which was notable as the first one which both had appeared. [[Mike Smith (Dave Clark Five)|Mike Smith]], former lead vocalist with the [[Dave Clark Five]] and d'Abo's then working partner, also appeared.

Pasini wrote the dialogue in Spanish of the first scene, "A Cinema in Buenos Aires, 26 July 1952". On this recording, he played the part of the actor in the soundtrack of a movie that grinds to a halt and also read the official communique of Eva's death. When the album was presented to the press at Lloyd Webber's country home [[Sydmonton]], Pasini organised a photographic presentation with his colleague Anton Furst to accompany it. His contribution to the development of the project was recognised as Rice and Lloyd Webber acknowledged him first in a thank you speech afterwards.

In Britain, Australia, South Africa, [[South America]], and various parts of [[Europe]], sales of the concept album exceeded those of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''; in the United States, however, it never achieved the same level of success. Covington's recording of "[[Don't Cry for Me Argentina]]" (originally titled "It's Only Your Lover Returning")&lt;ref&gt;Citron, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; was released in October 1976. It reached #1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]&lt;ref name="Citron, p. 230"/&gt; and enjoyed similar success internationally. Dickson's "[[Another Suitcase in Another Hall]]" also became a hit. In the US and UK, respectively, [[Karen Carpenter]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], and [[Petula Clark]] released cover versions of "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina".

==Musical analysis==
The musical employs an eclectic range of styles. [[Classical music]] in ''Evita'' includes the opening choral piece ("Requiem for Evita") and a choral interlude in "Oh What a Circus", as well as instrumental passages throughout the musical such as the orchestral version of the "Lament" and the introduction to "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". Rhythmic Latinate styles are heard in pieces such as "Buenos Aires", "And the Money Kept Rolling in (And Out)" and "On This Night of a Thousand Stars", while ballads include "High Flying, Adored" and "Another Suitcase in Another Hall". [[Rock music]] includes "Oh What a Circus", "Perón's Latest Flame", and a song cut from the original production called "The Lady's Got Potential". The song was reinstated for the 1996 film with revised lyrics by Rice, and has also been used in Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;[http://castalbumcollector.com/recordings/3741 "Japanese version, 1982, Recorded live at the Nissei Theater"] CastAlbums.org, accessed 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czech language|Czech]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://castalbumcollector.com/recordings/3115 "Czech version, 1998"] CastAlbums.org, accessed 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Danish language|Danish]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://castalbumcollector.com/recordings/2903 "Danish version, 2001"] CastAlbums.org, accessed 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; stage productions to expand on Argentine history for audiences less familiar with the subject.

==Historical accuracy==
Tomas Eloy Martinez noted:

{{quote|Che as well as Evita symbolise certain naïve, but effective, beliefs: the hope for a better world; a life sacrificed on the altar of the disinherited, the humiliated, the poor of the earth. They are myths which somehow reproduce the image of [[Christ]].|[[Tomas Eloy Martinez]]&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, Tomas Eloy.[http://www.lasmujeres.com/?m=peron_eva&amp;s=articles&amp;sc=art_Evita-or-Madonna-whom-will-history-remember "Evita Or Madonna: Whom Will History Remember?, Interview"] LasMujeres.com, Retrieved 13 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The lyrics and storyline of the musical are based on Mary Main's biography, ''[[The Woman with the Whip|Evita: The Woman with the Whip]]''{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, which drew heavily upon the accounts of anti-Perónist Argentines. Shortly after the musical appeared, Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro published a more neutral account of Eva Perón's life, ''Evita: The Real Lives of Eva Perón'', in which they claim that many of Main's assertions (which had influenced Rice's lyrics) were false, such as the suggestion that Eva had first gone to Buenos Aires as the mistress of a married musician, Agustín Magaldi. Instead, they wrote, Eva's mother Doña Juana had taken her there when she aspired to become a radio actress. Some critics also suggested that Rice's lyrics disparaged Evita's achievements unnecessarily, particularly her charity work. According to Navarro and Fraser,&lt;blockquote&gt;[''Evita''] was based for the most part on the earliest and seamiest versions of Evita's life, something happened to the tale in its retelling and the Evita who emerged each evening, dressed first as a teenager, then a hooker, and finally, in tulle and silver foil, as First Lady, was far from being unsympathetic.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser and Navarro, p.193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the success of the film version of ''Evita'', in 1996, an Argentinean film biography of Eva Perón was released, ''[[Eva Perón: The True Story]]'', asserting that it corrected distortions in the musical's account.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Eva-Peron-Esther-Goris/dp/B00013D4DG ''Eva Perón'', 1996 Argentine film biography of Eva Perón] Amazon.com, accessed 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resident productions==

===Original West End production===
When the recording was released, Lloyd Webber had sent a copy to the renowned American director [[Harold Prince]] and invited him to become involved with the eventual staging. Prince agreed, commenting, "Any [[opera]] that begins with a funeral can't be all bad", but he advised them that he could not take on any new commitments for the next two years.&lt;ref name="Citron, p. 230"&gt;Citron, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Lloyd Webber and Rice reworked several elements of the show. Some songs were dropped and some shortened, while others were introduced and some lyrics rewritten. Prince eventually confirmed that he would be ready to start rehearsals in early 1978. When he began working on the project in May, he suggested few changes, other than for deleting Che's rock number "The Lady's Got Potential". Prince requested a song he could stage to chart Perón's rise to power, and Rice and Lloyd Webber responded with the musical chairs number "The Art of the Possible", during which military officers are eliminated until only Perón remains.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

''Evita'' opened at the [[Prince Edward Theatre]] on 21 June 1978 and closed on 18 February 1986, after 3,176 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/princeedward40.html Evita at Prince Edward Theatre] thisistheatre.com, retrieved 17 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elaine Paige]] played Eva with [[David Essex]] as Che, [[Joss Ackland]] as Perón, and [[Siobhán McCarthy]] as Mistress.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, p.&amp;nbsp;232.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paige was selected from among many hopefuls, after [[Julie Covington]] declined the role. The production was directed by Harold Prince, [[choreography|choreographed]] by [[Larry Fuller]], and produced by Robert Stigwood. Paige was succeeded by [[Marti Webb]], [[Stephanie Lawrence]], [[Siobhán McCarthy]] (who had played The Mistress when the show opened), Jacquey Chappell and ultimately, [[Kathryn Evans]] with Maria Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;Inverne, J. "Jack Tinker: A Life in Review", p.&amp;nbsp;21, Oberon, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb originally played the role during Paige's holiday and was persuaded by Prince to remain in the cast as an alternate for two shows each week to aid the transition when she took over the role. This set the precedent until the show closed, with Lawrence becoming Webb's alternate. [[Michele Breeze]], Paige's original understudy never inherited the role in London but later created it for the original New Zealand production. Susannah Fellows also understudied Eva.

[[Gary Bond]] replaced David Essex as Che, then [[Mark Ryan (actor)|Mark Ryan]], who had first starred as Magaldi, later assumed the role, followed by [[Martin Smith (actor/musician)|Martin Smith]] and Jimmy Kean. Ackland's replacements included John Turner, Oz Clark and [[Daniel Benzali]].

In his review in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', Derek Jewell called the show "quite marvellous" and described Lloyd Webber's "ambitious" score "an unparallelled fusion of 20th century musical experience" and Rice's lyrics as "trenchant" and "witty". [[Bernard Levin]] of ''[[The Times]]'' disliked it, however, calling it as an "odious artefact ... that calls itself an opera ... merely because the clichés between the songs are sung rather than spoken" and "one of the most disagreeable evenings I have ever spent in my life".&lt;ref&gt;Citron, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

This production won [[The Society of London Theatre|The Society of West End Theatre]] (S.W.E.T) award as Musical of the Year, and Elaine Paige won the award for Performance of the Year in a Musical. Harold Prince (Director of the Year) and David Essex (Performance of the Year in a Musical) received S.W.E.T. nominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivierawards.com/about/previous-winners/view/item98512/S.W.E.T Award-Winners-1978 "S.W.E.T Award Winners 1978"]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Olivierawards.com, accessed 21 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy O'Brien (theatre designer)|Timothy O'Brien]] and Tazeena Firth collaborated on the design of the show. The set was minimal, with a scaffolded balcony running along the back and sides of the stage and images projected onto a screen above. [[Madame Tussauds]] produced a wax figurine of Eva, based on Elaine Paige, for the coffin during the funeral scene at the beginning of the show. Inspired by the [[mural]]s of [[Diego Rivera]], Prince suggested the [[proscenium]] be flanked by artwork depicting the struggles of the [[Argentine people|Argentine]] peasants. He jettisoned the original monochromatic costumes designed for the chorus members and dancers; instead, he had them go to charity and secondhand clothing shops to purchase costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, pp. 231–32&lt;/ref&gt; The now iconic balcony scene featured Eva in a broad, white dress based on one actually owned by Eva Perón addressing a crowd from the rear balcony of the stage.

The ''Evita: Original London Cast Recording'' was recorded in 1978 and released by MCA Records. Some releases mistakenly refer to the concept album as the Original London Cast Recording.

The original London production transferred to the Opera House in Manchester for an extended run following its closure at the Prince Edward Theatre.  Kathryn Evans and Jimmy Kean played Eva and Che with Ria Jones and John Barr being their alternates.

===Original Broadway production===

[http://www.beyondchron.org/evita-miss-coco-peru-terese-geneco/ "Evita! Miss Coco Peru! Terese Geneco!"] Beyond Chron, 18 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the Broadway production opened at the [[The Broadway Theatre|Broadway Theatre]] on 25 September 1979 and closed on 26 June 1983, after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. [[Patti LuPone]] starred as Eva, with [[Mandy Patinkin]] as Che, [[Bob Gunton]] as Perón, Mark Syers as Magaldi, and Jane Ohringer as Perón's mistress. [[Harold Prince]] directed with choreography by Larry Fuller.&lt;ref name=internet&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3809 "'Evita' listing, 1979–1983"] InternetBroadwayDatabase.com, accessed 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  During the run, six actresses alternated playing the title role, in addition to LuPone: Terri Klausner (matinees), [[Nancy Opel]] (matinees), Pamela Blake (matinees), Derin Altay, [[Loni Ackerman]] and Florence Lacey.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Stanley and Green, Kay. ''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patinkin was replaced by James Stein and later by [[Anthony Crivello]]. ''New York Times'' critic [[Frank Rich]] stated: "Loni Ackerman, the current Eva Perón, has no discernible Latin blood, but she sings the role better than any of the American Evitas, as well as acting and dancing it with nonstop energy. Anthony Crivello, a performer new to me, is easily the best Che I've seen in New York or London: not only does he have a supple voice, but he also moves with such grace that he lightens the heavy, moralizing tone his character must bear. He's so effective, in fact, that he almost convinces you that there's a sound reason for Che Guevara to be dragged into the Peron saga."&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank. [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/theater/in-the-arts-critics-choice-229254.html "In the Arts. Critics Choice"] ''New York Times'', 17 October 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Carter understudied Patinkin and performed as Che.

LuPone has stated about her time in ''Evita'':" 'Evita' was the worst experience of my life,' she said. 'I was screaming my way through a part that could only have been written by a man who hates women. And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee.'"&lt;ref&gt;Green, Jesse.  [http://theater.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/theater/08gree.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=pattilupone "Let Her Entertain You. Please"] ''The New York Times'', 8 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaine Paige was originally told she would re-create her role in the Broadway production, however, the Actors' Equity Association refused permission for a non-American. Prince attempted to persuade the organisation for a second time when LuPone was suffering vocal problems before the production reached New York. Lupone stated in her memoir that this was nothing more than a rumour started by Prince himself to build publicity. She however had her own doubts about that being true.

In the same way the previous tour had a limited London run, this production will perform a limited, 91 performance run (due to the failure of ''[[The Girls (musical)|The Girls]]'') at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] from July to October 2017. Hatton will reprise her role along with all her previous cast members. The tour will then continue into 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/evita-west-end-summer-2017-emma-hatton_43946.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017/2018 International Tour===

A revival of the original production (as directed by Hal Prince and choreographed by Larry Fuller) will tour South Africa, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan featuring a cast from South Africa and led by Emma Kingston from the U.K. in the title role.

The Singapore tour run from February 23, 2018 to March 18, 2018 in the Marina Bay Sands Theatre. 18 young talents were selected to be cast in this Evita production. Three sets of six children alternate in ensemble roles. The young actors are: Federica Aramburu, Lilo Baier, Mika Barel, Charmaine Chan, Hindya Dickinson, Jasmine Huilian Ellis, Gabriel Frade, Sam Howie, Annabelle Jarvis, Jayden Alim Lai, Lia Marie Elaine Macdonell, Max Makatsaria, Nanako Masui, Faith Ong, Sofia Ella Poston, Sebastian Street, Damien Rocco Weber, Charisse Low Yu Xin.

===2018 Australian Tour===

A 2018 Australian revival of the stage musical, directed by [[Harold Prince]], was announced on 21 August 2017, by [[Opera Australia]], with Australian [[singer-songwriter]], musician, musical theatre actress [[Tina Arena]] being confirmed as the lead actress. The stage tour production will begin at the [[Sydney Opera House]], in the ''Joan Sutherland Theatre'', with opening night on September 13, running to November 3, 2018. The next venue on the national tour leg will be at the [[Arts Centre Melbourne]], from December 5 to December 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://opera.org.au/whatson/events/evita-sydney?noloc=true&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aussietheatre.com.au/news/tina-arena-confirmed-eva-peron-evita|title=Tina Arena confirmed as Eva Peron in Evita - News|date=21 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arena says she felt the time was right to tackle the role. "I have been approached to do this role on a couple of occasions," Arena stated. "I never felt emotionally ready for it. I felt I had a lot of living and learning before I could get up and take on the enormity of the story and the human spirit she possessed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/musicals/tina-arena-to-play-evita-at-the-sydney-opera-house-20170821-gy0suf.html|title=Tina Arena to play Evita at the Sydney Opera House|first=Nathanael|last=Cooper|date=21 August 2017|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/arts/tina-arena-will-help-young-stars-find-their-voices-on-the-big-stage-in-evita-musical/news-story/9edbccd1b5ae5ddd1fb33b47a1f9b143&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2018, [[Opera Australia]] Artistic Director Lyndon Terracini, along with producers John Frost and David Ian, announced the full cast for the upcoming Australian production of ''Evita''. With Arena announced in the lead role as [[Eva Perón]], the remainder of the cast was announced as: [[Paulo Szot]], Brazilian operatic baritone in the role of [[Juan Perón]]; Kurt Kansley will take on the role of the revolutionary [[Che Guevara]]. Michael Falzon will portray [[tango music|tango]] singer [[Agustín Magaldi]], while the role of Perón’s Mistress will be played by Alexis van Maanen. Jemma Rix has been cast as the alternate [[Eva Perón]] and is currently scheduled to be appearing in the role at least once a week (the Wednesday 7:30pm show) throughout the Sydney season, according to the Evita-Australia website.&lt;ref name="aussietheatre.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aussietheatre.com.au/news/evita-full-cast-announced|title=Evita full cast announced - News|date=7 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://evitathemusical.com.au/cast/|title=Evita The Musical|first=|last=ACMN|website=Evita The Musical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|Evita (1996 film)}}
Plans for a film directed by [[Ken Russell]] developed soon after the West End and Broadway openings. Much speculation of potential leads included [[Barbra Streisand]] or [[Liza Minnelli]] as Eva, and [[Barry Gibb]] or [[Elton John]] as Che.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Greenberg | first = James | title = Is It Time Now to Cry for 'Evita'? | work = The New York Times | publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] | date = 19 November 1989 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/19/movies/is-it-time-now-to-cry-for-evita.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans never came to fruition.

Russell has said that his own first choice for the film lead was [[Karla DeVito]], who had come to fame in rock tours and on Broadway, where she had impressed the wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber.  DeVito was screen tested for the role while in England shooting music videos for her solo album "Is This A Cool World or What?"  DeVito's performance of "Don't Cry For Me, Argentina" in the screen test caused much positive buzz.  Russell wrote that she brought viewers to tears (except Tim Rice – who wanted Elaine Paige, with whom he was romantically involved).  Although Russell rejected the idea, Paige was screen tested twice.

Russell's biography indicates that he met with Barbra Streisand, who dismissed the role immediately.  He wrote that he then suggested Liza Minnelli.  A year had passed between the first screen tests and Minnelli's, which Russell reports was amazing.  Russell approached Stigwood with Minnelli's test, convinced she had the necessary talent and star quality, but he was soon told it was going to be Elaine Paige.  Having already protested that idea, Russell quit the film.  Years later when he saw Karla DeVito again, Russell addressed her as "My Evita."

It was not until 1996 that ''Evita'' came to the big screen. [[Alan Parker]] directed the film, with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in the title role, [[Antonio Banderas]] as Che and [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Perón. Madonna had herself been interested in the role since 1986, and had lobbied hard for the role. The film was nominated for five [[Academy Award]]s, winning one for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] ("You Must Love Me," composed especially for the film). Madonna received mixed reviews but received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her performance. The film was choreographed by Vincent Paterson.

==Cultural impact==
''Evita'' came in sixth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[opinion poll|poll]] of the UK's "Number One Essential Musicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml |title=Elaine Paige – Nation's Favourite Musicals |accessdate=2 June 2007 |work=BBC Radio 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[The President Wore Pearls]]", has a plot loosely based on the musical, with [[Lisa Simpson]] in Eva's role. The episode includes parodies of songs such as "Don't Cry for Me, Kids of Springfield". At the end of the episode, a comical disclaimer is displayed stating, "On the advice of our lawyers, we swear we have never heard of a musical based on the life of Eva Perón".

During ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', "[[Special Education (Glee)|Special Education]]", the characters [[Kurt Hummel]] and [[Rachel Berry]] sing "[[Don't Cry for Me, Argentina]]" when Kurt is auditioning for a solo in the Warblers for Sectionals. In the season three episode "[[Hold On to Sixteen]]", a rival showchoir sings "Buenos Aires" as their competition piece.

In the short "The Ballad of Magellan" in the cartoon series [[Animaniacs]], the country of Argentina is depicted with a sign reading, "EVITA Coming Soon!".

==Recordings==
[[File:Evitaoriginalcastrecording.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of Original Broadway Recording]]
First recorded by a cast assembled specifically for the recording in 1976, the first stage cast recording of Evita was of the original London production in 1978. The original Broadway cast was recorded for an album released in 1979. Lloyd Webber and Rice produced these first three recordings.

At least 25 English language cast albums have been released, along with many foreign language recordings. There are currently four in Spanish, five German, three in Japanese, and two in [[Hebrew]], with additional recordings in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Danish language|Danish]], Dutch, French, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://subtitles.o2.cz/6035/Evita.html] subtitles.o2.cz  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605035337/http://subtitles.o2.cz/6035/Evita.html|date=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soprano [[Kiri Te Kanawa]] recorded a complete operatic version of the score with [[Christopher Lee]] as Perón{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. This recording, however, has never been released{{Citation needed|reason=There is no indication that this recording exists|date=February 2018}}. [[Marti Webb]] also recorded a highlights album of sorts for the [[Pickwick Records]] label that featured [[Dave Willetts]] and [[Carl Wayne]]. It was released to coincide with the 1995 UK Tour of the show in which Webb starred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6316">'''Extinction threshold''' is a term used in [[conservation biology]] to explain the point at which a [[species]], [[population]] or [[metapopulation]], experiences an abrupt change in density or number because of an important parameter, such as habitat loss. It is at this critical value below which a species, population, or metapopulation, will go [[extinct]],&lt;ref name="ETMM"&gt;Ovaskainen, O. and Hanski, I. 2003:Extinction Threshold in Metapopulation Models, Ann.Zool.Fennic.40:81-97.&lt;/ref&gt; though this may take a long time for species just below the critical value, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].&lt;ref name=Tilman1994&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = May | first2 = R. M. | last3 = Lehman | first3 = C. L. | last4 = Nowak | first4 = M. A. | title = Habitat destruction and the extinction debt | doi = 10.1038/371065a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 371 | pages = 65 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1994Natur.371...65T | issue=6492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extinction thresholds are important to conservation biologists when studying a species in a population or metapopulation context because the colonization rate must be larger than the extinction rate, otherwise the entire entity will go extinct once it reaches the threshold.&lt;ref name="PCB"&gt;Groom, M., Meffe, G. K., and Carroll, C.R. 2000:Principles of Conservation Biology, 3rd Ed, Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extinction thresholds are realized under a number of circumstances and the point in modeling them is to define the conditions that lead a population to extinction.&lt;ref name="ETPFL"&gt;With, K.A. and King, A.W. 1999:Extinction Thresholds For Species in Fractal Landscapes, Conservation Biology: Vol 13, No.2,pp.314-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling extinction thresholds can explain the relationship between extinction threshold and [[habitat loss]] and [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref name="EHFET"&gt;Fahrig, Lenore. 2002:Effect of Habitat Fragmentation on the Extinction Threshold: A Synthesis, Ecological Applications: Vol.12, No.2, pp.346-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical models ==

Metapopulation-type models are used to predict extinction thresholds. The classic metapopulation model is the [[Levins Model]], which  is the model of metapopulation dynamics established by [[Richard Levins]] in the 1960s. It was used to evaluate patch occupancy in a large network of patches. This model was extended in the 1980s by [[Russell Lande]] to include habitat occupancy.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt; This mathematical model is used to infer the extinction values and important population densities. These mathematical models are primarily used to study extinction thresholds because of the difficulty in understanding extinction processes through empirical methods and the current lack of research on this subject.&lt;ref name="ETHPD"&gt;Deredec, A. and Courchamp,F, 2003:Extinction Thresholds in Host-Parasite Dynamics, Ann. Zool. Fennic. 40:115-130.&lt;/ref&gt; When determining an extinction threshold there are two types of models that can be used: deterministic and stochastic metapopulation models.

=== Deterministic ===

Deterministic metapopulation models assume that there are an infinite number of habitat patches available and predict that the metapopulation will go extinct only if the threshold is not met.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

'''''dp/dt = chp (1-p)-ep'''''

Where p= occupied patches, e= extinction rate, c= colonization rate, and h= amount of habitat.

A species will persist only if '''''h&gt; δ''''' 

where '''''δ=e/c''''' 

δ= species parameter, or how successful a species is in colonizing a patch.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

=== Stochastic ===

Stochastic metapopulation models take into account stochasticity, which is the non-deterministic or random processes in nature. With this approach a metapopulation may be above the threshold if determined that it is unlikely it will go extinct within a certain time period.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt; 

The complex nature of these models can result in a small metapopulation that is considered to be above the deterministic extinction threshold, but  in reality has a high risk of extinction .&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

== Other factors ==

When using metapopulation-type models to predict extinction thresholds there are a number of factors that can affect the results of a model. First, including more complicated models, rather than relying solely on the Levins model produces different dynamics. For example, in an article published in 2004, [[Otso Ovaskainen]] and [[Ilkka Hanski]] explained with an empirical example that when factors such as [[Allee effect]] or Rescue effect were included in modeling the extinction threshold, there were unexpected extinctions in a high number of species. A more complex model came up with different results, and in practicing conservation biology this can add more confusion to efforts to save a species from the extinction threshold. Transient dynamics, which are effects on the extinction threshold because of instability in either the metapopulation or environmental conditions, is also a large player in modeling results. Landscapes that have recently endured habitat loss and fragmentation may be less able to sustain a metapopulation than previously understood without considering transient dynamics.  Finally, environmental stochasticity, which may be spatially correlated, can lead to amplified regional stochastic fluctuations and therefore greatly affect the extinction risk.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

'''Friedrich Paul 'Fritz' Honka''' (31 July 1935 – 19 October 1998) was a [[Germany|German]] [[serial killer]]. Between 1970 and 1975 he killed at least four [[prostitute]]s from [[Hamburg]]'s [[Reeperbahn|red light district]], keeping the bodies in his flat.

==Youth==
Honka was born on 31 July 1935 in [[Leipzig]] as the third of ten children. His father Fritz Honka (Senior) was a joiner, his mother Else Honka worked as a cleaner. Three of his siblings died during birth. During his later trial Honka described his youth thus: "My father was in a concentration camp. I too was in a concentration camp for children. I was freed by the Russians. My father too. School afterwards didn't amount to much." Honka grew up in children's homes in Leipzig. His father worked as a stoker in Leipzig. His father was said to have been sent to a concentration camp for working for the Communists. He died in 1946 of alcoholism and long-term health issues caused by imprisonment.

His mother was said to be unable to cope with her nine children. In the early 1950s, Honka started an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, but had to give it up due to an allergy. Honka fled to West Germany in 1951 and started work as an unskilled farm worker in the small village of Brockhöfe on the [[Lüneburg Heath]]. He had an affair with a woman named Margot which yielded a son, Heinrich. Honka had to pay 3000 Deutschmarks alimony and left the village. In 1956 he came to Hamburg and was employed as a harbour worker at [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]]. A serious traffic accident in 1956 smashed his nose and gave him a pronounced squint. In 1957 he married Inge and had a son called Fritz, but the marriage failed and they separated in 1960. Neighbours recall violent scenes in their flat. The couple reconciled, but separated a second time in 1967. He moved to the Hamburg suburb of [[Ottensen]] in 1967. In 1972 he lived together with Irmgard Albrecht for a while. On 15 August 1972 he attempted to force Ruth Dufner to have sex with him and Irmgard. Dufner fled unclothed from Honka's flat and reported him to the police. She received treatment in hospital. At the time of the incident, Honka had a very high blood alcohol level. On 4 April 1975 a court ordered him to pay a fine of 4500 DM, but a charge of rape was dropped. In the years afterwards, his problems with alcohol prevented him from maintaining relationships with women, and he turned to prostitutes he met in pubs or around the [[Reeperbahn]] for sex.

==Murders==
[[File:1194Wohnhaus Fritz Honka.JPG|thumb|The apartment house in Ottensen, Hamburg where Honka lived]]
In December 1970 Honka, then a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|night watchman]] for Shell, committed his first proven murder. He strangled Gertraud Bräuer, a 42-year-old hairdresser and occasional prostitute, in his flat. Honka said that she would not have sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wunder|first1=Olaf|title=Hamburg historisch Der Tag, an dem Fritz Honka gefasst wurde|url=http://www.mopo.de/hamburg/hamburg-historisch-der-tag--an-dem-fritz-honka-gefasst-wurde-22731276|website=Hamburger Morgenpost|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=DE|date=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honka sawed the corpse into pieces that he then wrapped up and hid in various places in the nearby area. The body parts were found and identified by Hamburg police, but their investigation did not find the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lohmann|first1=Klaus|title=Der Frauenmörder von St. Pauli|website=Schleswig-Holstein am Sonntag|publisher=Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=DE|date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honka murdered again, four years later, when he strangled the 54-year-old prostitute Anna Beuschel in his flat in August 1974. He claimed that she had not been passionate enough when they had sex. In December 1974 he killed the 57-year-old Frieda Roblick in the same way and in January 1975 he murdered the 52-year-old prostitute Ruth Schult. In all three cases Honka cut the corpses into small pieces and hid them in his flat and in the house's attic. The disappearance of the three women was not reported to the police. Complaints of other people living in the house regarding the stench of rotting flesh were disregarded. Honka used large numbers of pine-scented perfume blocks in an attempt to mask the odour.

==Motives and personality==
Fritz Honka was short ({{height|m=1.68|precision=0}}) and of slight build. He had a squint and a speech impediment. Both of his marriages failed due to heavy alcohol consumption. When very drunk he would vent his aggression on women, usually shorter than him and often toothless, to alleviate his fears of mutilation during [[oral sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramsland|first1=Katherine|title=The Human Predator: A Historical Chronicle of Serial Murder and Forensic Investigation|date=2013|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=1101619058|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and trial==
On 15 July 1975 the apartment building where Honka lived caught fire. Firemen tackling the blaze discovered a partially decomposed female torso in a plastic bag which prompted the police to search the flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex-Frust - da tötete und zerstückelte er seine Opfer|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/archiv/2001/article204813705/Sex-Frust-da-toetete-und-zerstueckelte-er-seine-Opfer.html|website=Hamburger Abendblatt|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=DE|date=31 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=Jay Robert|title=World Encyclopedia of 20th Century Murder|date=1992|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=1590775325|pages=293–294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eONxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293&amp;lpg=PA293|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honka was at work at the time and was arrested when he returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fritz Honka: Der Frauenmörder von St Pauli|url=https://www.ndr.de/kultur/geschichte/Fritz-Honka-der-Frauenmoerder-von-St-Pauli,honka106.html|website=NDR.de|publisher=Norddeutscher Rundfunk|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July Fritz Honka confessed to murdering the women. He withdrew his confession in November 1976 claiming not to remember anything.

In custody, Honka said he killed the women after they mocked his preference for oral sex over "straight" intercourse. The court found him guilty on one count of murder and three counts of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment in a psychiatric hospital. His habitual abuse of alcohol was considered a mitigating factor, as it diminished his mental capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/1976/53/bossis-erfolg/|title=Mord-Prozeß Honka: Bossis Erfolg|last=Noite|first=Jost|date=1976-12-24|newspaper=Die Zeit|issn=0044-2070|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
Honka was released from prison in 1993 and spent his last years in a [[nursing home]] under the name of Peter Jensen. He died in a hospital in [[Langenhorn, Hamburg]] on 19 October 1998.

== Legacy ==
In 1975, German musician Karl-Heinz Blumenberg recorded the [[black humor]] single ''Gern hab ich die Frau'n gesägt'' ("I loved to saw the women", a titular reference to the 1920s [[Schlager]] ''Gern hab ich die Frau'n geküßt'', "I loved to kiss the women", sung by [[Richard Tauber]]) under the pseudonym of Harry Horror, in reference to Honka. The song quickly became an underground hit in Hamburg clubs, but Blumenberg's record company [[RCA Records]] refused to officially release it due to its controversial theme.

German writer [[Heinz Strunk]]'s novel ''Der goldene Handschuh'' (The Golden Glove) was published in 2016, winning the [[Wilhelm Raabe Literature Prize]] and nominated for the [[Leipzig Book Fair Prize]]. It tells the story of Fritz Honka and bears the name of one of the [[St Pauli]] bars in which Honka met his victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Für ihn gab es keine Hoffnung|url=http://www.fnp.de/nachrichten/kultur/bdquo-Fuer-ihn-gab-es-keine-Hoffnung-ldquo;art679,1874954|website=Frankfurter Neue Presse|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=DE|date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Great Stockholm Fire of 1759''' was the city’s greatest fire since 1686. It raged in the Eastern Södermalm on Thursday July 19 and over the following night, reduced about 20 blocks with about 300 houses to ash, and rendered about 2000 persons homeless. While no deaths were reported, there were 19 injuries. In [[Sweden]], the fire is named ''Mariabranden'' (Swedish ''brand'' = fire) after the [[Maria Magdalena Church]], which was severely damaged. Outside Sweden, the fire is most famous because an [[occultism|occult]] anecdote claims the scientist and mystic [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] by a sort of [[clairvoyance]] could ”see” the fire from [[Gothenburg]].

==Background==
In the 18th century, fire was a serious threat to urban centers. In Northern Europe, most houses were made of wood, and were often built very close to adjoining structures. Open fires were used for cooking, heating, and light. When a fire broke out, firefighting mainly depended on bucket or pail teams, in addition to fire axes and equipment to tear downs houses for [[firebreak|firebreaks]]. Like most major cities, Stockholm did not have any professional firefighters at the time. As cities expanded in the 17th and 18th centuries, fires became more threatening, as with the [[Great Fire of London]], the [[Great Fire of Copenhagen]] in 1728, and the [[Great Fire of Bergen 1702|Great Fire of Bergen in 1702]].

The increased fire threat also applied to Sweden. Throughout the 17th century, Sweden had experienced over 30 devastating fires which had destroyed many cities and villages. In addition, the Russians had burned down more than 20 cities or towns between 1714 and 1721, during the [[Great Northern War]]. In 1751, the year before [[Karlstad]] burned for the third time since 1616, a violent fire (''Klarabranden'') had destroyed at least a hundred buildings in Stockholm. The fire had originated in [[Norrmalm]] during a [[whole gale]] and grew into a [[firestorm]]. Some copper plates, glowing with heat from the fire, blew above Riddarfjärden (an arm of the sea [[Mälaren]]), at least 400 meters, and, in turn, set fire to buildings on Södermalm, as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandhistoriska.org/olyckor_se.html; in Swedish&lt;/ref&gt;

==The drought==
In 1759, a severe drought struck Stockholm. As both buildings and [[vegetation]] dried out, the fire hazard grew. In addition, the water supply was on the verge of running dry, (except near Mälaren.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandhistoriska.org/olyckor_se.html; in Swedish&lt;/ref&gt;) which meant that any fire would be harder to fight. The drought may also have contributed to fires in the towns of Skövde and (in south-eastern [[Norway]]) [[Halden]] the same year.

==The fire==
At around 16:15 on July 19, the fire broke out in the Besvärsbackan (literally: ''Trouble Hill'') area. High (and increasing) winds spread the fire quickly in all directions, but especially to the west and southwest. About an hour and a half later, the Maria Magdalena Church caught fire.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Christoffer Gjörwell The Older to [[Carl Gustaf Warmholtz]] July 20, 1759, cited from Staffan Högberg: Stockholms historia (Albert Bonniers förlag, 1981. {{ISBN|91-34-59000-5}}), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Panic spreading among the people made the situation worse. Attempts to fight the fire were hampered by a lack of available water, and the lines bringing water from Mälaren (one of the few bodies of water not shrunk by the drought) grew longer as the fire advanced away from the sea.

Given the inferior equipment available at the time and the difficulties in transporting water, it was probably not possible the extinguish the fire itself. As the fire crossed the major street (Hornsgatan) in the area, firefighting efforts turned towards the construction of firebreaks well in advance of the fire's spread. Using some open areas on either side of Hornsgatan, the firebreaks were able to halt the fire's advance, and it burned itself out early on the morning of July 20 (Friday).

==Aftermath==
The Maria Magdalena Church was severely damaged. The tower had collapsed, and the interior was burned out. However, the people demanded that the church should be restored. It was reopened four years later, at the Pentecost of 1763. The church tower was rebuilt in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stockholmskallan.se/PostFiles/SMF/SD/SSMB_0001451_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
After the fire, the city government required all constructions to consist of brick and stone. With these regulations in place, the Great Fire of 1759 was the last on such a scale to strike Stockholm.

==Emanuel Swedenborg and the fire==
Outside Sweden, the fire is most famous because of a story connected to the scientist and mystic [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688-1772). According to an anecdote, Swedenborg could ”see” the fire during a dinner in [[Gothenburg]] with his friend William Castel. At that time, Swedenborg himself lived at Hornsgatan 43 in Stockholm. Supposedly, Swedenborg declared later in the evening that the fire was stopped three buildings from his own – as it indeed was. Swedenborg’s biographer Lars Bergquist, however, writes the dinner in question took place on Sunday July 29, ten days after the fire broke out.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist 1999, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Because a courier at that time could travel from Stockholm to Gothenburg at about two days or a little more, Swedenborg could have got information about the fire without the use of any "paranormal" abilities.

The '''Hamburger Dom'''&lt;ref name=dom/&gt; is a large [[fair]] held at [[Heiligengeistfeld]] fair ground in central [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. With three fairs (spring, summer and winter) per year it is the biggest and the longest fair throughout Germany and attracts 
approximately ten million visitors per year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} It is also referred to as a [[Volksfest]] ([[beer festival]] and [[travelling funfair]]).

Hamburger Dom puts on an impressive firework display at the Heiligengeistfeld, that can be seen across most of the city, every Friday that it runs at 22:30 hrs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/themen-touren/lifestyle-szene/hamburger-dom/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A market in or in front of [[St. Mary's Cathedral (Hamburg)|Hamburg's Cathedral]] ({{lang-de|Hamburger Dom}}) was first recorded in 1329, at the beginning only in special seasons like [[Christmas]]. With the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century the fair was also held at other times. After the demolition of the cathedral (1804&amp;ndash;1807), the market was held on the [[Gänsemarkt]] (lit. ''geese market'') in 1804, but kept the name “[[Duomo|Dom]]”. Since 1892, the fair has been held at Heiligengeistfeld (lit. ''field of the Holy Spirit'') and the name was used for all fairs at this location.&lt;ref name=hhlex/&gt;

* ''Winterdom'' or ''Dommarkt'' (winter fair or cathedral market): 30 days in late autumn
* ''Sommerdom''  or ''Hummelfest'' (summer fair or ''Hummel'' market):&lt;ref name=hummel/&gt; since 1947: 31 days during summer
* ''Frühlingsdom'' (spring fair): since 1948, 30 days in spring

&lt;ref name=dom&gt;The German term ''Dom'' ({{lang-it|Duomo}}) is the [[synecdoche]], used - pars pro toto - for most persisting or former [[collegiate church]]es and cathedrals alike. Therefore the uniform translation of this term into English as cathedral is correct in this case, but in many other cases it is inappropriate.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISS-RapidScat''' was an instrument mounted to the [[International Space Station]]{{'s}} [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'' module]] that measured wind speeds.&lt;ref name="nasa20131029"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/jpl/news/earth20131029.html |title=Watching Earth's Winds, On a Shoestring |publisher=[[NASA]] |first=Joshua |last=Rodriguez |date=29 October 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched aboard [[SpaceX CRS-4]] in September 2014 and operated until August 2016.&lt;ref name="nasa20131029" /&gt; ISS-RapidScat was a [[scatterometer]] designed to support weather forecasting by bouncing microwaves off the ocean's surface to measure wind speed.&lt;ref name="nasa20131029" /&gt; It featured a {{convert|75|cm|abbr=on}} rotating radar dish that operated at 13.4&amp;nbsp;GHz ([[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]]).&lt;ref name="Martin2014"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUwHAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;pg=PA355 |title=An Introduction to Ocean Remote Sensing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |first=Seelye |last=Martin |edition=2nd |pages=334, 355 |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-01938-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could collect data between 51.6 degrees north and south latitude, with a swath {{convert|560|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}}.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/issrapidscat_factsheet.pdf |title=ISS-RapidScat |series=NASA Facts |publisher=NASA |date=September 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISS-RapidScat program was initiated in response to the failure of the [[QuikSCAT]] satellite's antenna rotation mechanism in November 2009. While the spacecraft continued to function, it could only gather data in one direction, significantly limiting its data collection ability. ISS-RapidScat was built by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] from elements of QuikSCAT's SeaWinds instrument engineering model, originally used to validate that instrument's flight hardware prior to its launch in 1999.&lt;ref name="Silberg2014"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eospso.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/eo_pdfs/September_October_2014_color508.pdf |title=ISS-RapidScat: Measuring Ocean Winds from the International Space Station |journal=The Earth Observer |first1=Bob |last1=Silberg |first2=Carol |last2=Rasmussen |first3=Peter |last3=Falcon |first4=Stacey |last4=Boland |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=4–9 |date=September–October 2014 |id=NP-2014-1-117-GSFC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed in 18 months; re-using the QuikScat hardware had the double benefit of reducing cost and using already flight-proven hardware that functioned well in orbit.&lt;ref name="nasa20140918"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/rapidscat/five-things-about-nasas-iss-rapidscat |title=Five Things About NASA's ISS-RapidScat |publisher=NASA |first=Carol |last=Rasmussen |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISS-RapidScat was very similar to QuikSCAT in functionality. However, the instrument suffered due to peculiarities of the International Space Station, such as the station's varying altitude due to increased drag, its variable orientation due to the demands of visiting spacecraft, and its lack of a Sun-synchronous orbit.&lt;ref name="Martin2014" /&gt; By the time of ISS-RapidScat's launch, the [[European Space Agency]]{{'s}} [[MetOp]] series were the only two satellites with fully functioning scatterometers in orbit.&lt;ref name="nasa20141015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/rapidscat/nasas-rapidscat-keeps-a-watchful-eye-on-ocean-storms |title=NASA's RapidScat Keeps a Watchful Eye on Ocean Storms |publisher=NASA |first=Carol |last=Rasmussen |date=15 October 2014 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these peculiarities were also advantages. Its mid-latitude orbit meant it was able to collect data about the same spot on Earth at different times of day, whereas the [[Sun-synchronous orbit]]s used by other scatterometer-equipped spacecraft would re-visit the same location on Earth at the same time daily. This allowed scientists to study how the wind changes at one location over the course of a day.&lt;ref name="nasa20140918" /&gt; This orbit also gives better coverage of the [[tropics]], and by crossing the orbit of other satellites, it was able to observe the same area at the same time as them, allowing for cross-calibration between the different [[data set]]s.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt;

Objectives of the ISS-RapidScat program were to mitigate the loss of and provide continuity of wind data products from the QuikSCAT SeaWinds instrument, serve as a [[standard (metrology)|calibration standard]] for the international constellation of scatterometer-equipped satellites, and to sample the [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] and semi-diurnal wind variations that occur between ISS flight [[latitude]]s at least every two months.&lt;ref name="Silberg2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin2014" /&gt;

The scatterometer was launched as external cargo aboard the [[SpaceX CRS-4]] mission on 21 September 2014, attached to the unpressurized section of the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon capsule]].&lt;ref name="nasa20131029" /&gt; Dragon was berthed to the station on 23 September.&lt;ref name=nasacrs4-20140921&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/september/nasa-cargo-launches-to-space-station-aboard-spacex-resupply-mission-0/ |title=NASA Cargo Launches to Space Station aboard SpaceX Resupply Mission |publisher=NASA |first1=Stephanie |last1=Schierholz |first2=Dan |last2=Huot |date=21 September 2014 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was removed from Dragon, robotically assembled and attached to ''Columbus'' between 29 and 30 September. It was powered up on 1 October and immediately began gathering data, which was first processed into an uncalibrated product on 3 October.&lt;ref name="nasajpl20141006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-342 |title=NASA's New Winds Mission Installed, Gathers First Data |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first1=Alan |last1=Buis |first2=Whitney B. |last2=Clavin |first3=Stephen E. |last3=Cole |date=6 October 2014 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISS-RapidScat was declared fully operational and its data products properly [[calibration|calibrated]] on 10 November.&lt;ref name="nasa20141110"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/rapidscat/nasas-new-wind-watcher-ready-for-weather-forecasters |title=NASA's New Wind Watcher Ready for Weather Forecasters |publisher=NASA |first=Alan |last=Buis |date=10 November 2014 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August 2016, the ''Columbus'' module, to which ISS-RapidScat was attached and reliant on for resources, suffered a [[power distribution unit]] failure, which resulted in ISS-RapidScat shutting down. This was followed by an electrical overload in the power distribution unit during recovery efforts. Attempts to restore the instrument were without success, and NASA formally terminated operations on 28 November 2016.&lt;ref name="nasajpl20160909"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6617 |title=RapidScat Team Investigating Power System Anomaly |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Alan |last=Buis |date=9 September 2016 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasajpl20161128"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6683 |title=NASA's ISS-RapidScat Earth Science Mission Ends |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Carol |last=Rasmussen |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No replacement or successor device was planned.&lt;ref name="nasasf20161128"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/11/nasa-calls-time-iss-rapidscat/ |title=NASA calls time on ISS-RapidScat |work=NASA Spaceflight |first=Chris |last=Bergin |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cannes_beach_1980_6.jpg|thumb|Topless sunbathing in France. In certain cultures, public nudity (partial or total) is accepted in certain contexts]]
'''Indecent exposure''' is the deliberate exposure in public or in view of the general public by a person of a portion or portions of their body, in circumstances where the exposure is contrary to local moral or other standards of appropriate behavior. The term ''indecent exposure'' is a legal expression. Social and community attitudes to the exposing of various body parts and laws covering what is referred to as indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from outright prohibition to prohibition of exposure of certain body parts, such as the [[genital area]], [[buttock]]s or [[breast]]s.

Decency is generally judged by the standards of the local community, which are seldom codified in specifics in law. Such standards may be based on religion, morality or tradition, or justified on the basis of "necessary to [[public order]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |edition=Tenth |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=2001 |chapter=Indecent exposure |page=589 |isbn=0-87779-713-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-sexual [[exhibitionism]] or [[public nudity]] is sometimes considered indecent exposure. If [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]]s are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered [[gross indecency]], which is usually a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of [[modesty]] is also considered to be public indecency.

The legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure itself a complex topic.

== Overview ==
It is generally accepted, at least in [[western countries]], that a naked human body is not in itself indecent. That principle is reflected, for example, in [[depictions of nudity|depiction of the human form]] in art of various forms. Nevertheless, as a general rule, it is also commonly expected that people when they appear in a public place will be appropriately attired. Inappropriateness is viewed in context, so that, for example, what may be appropriate on a beach may be inappropriate in a street, school or workplace. Depending on the context, some degree of inappropriateness may be tolerated, and perhaps described as [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], but in extreme cases of inappropriateness it may be regarded as "crossing the line". Besides the social disapproval of such a state of dress, most jurisdictions have laws to "maintain social order", variously described as [[public nudity]], indecent exposure, as an affront to [[public morality]], public nuisance, besides others. What is an inappropriate state of dress in a particular context depends on the standards of [[decency]] of the community where an exposure takes place. These standards vary from time to time and can vary from the very strict standards of [[modesty]] in places such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which require most of the body to be covered, to tribal societies such as the [[Pirahã people|Pirahã]] or [[Mursi people|Mursi]] where full nakedness is the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/1416/legality-of-nudism-in-public-places/1524#1524|title=Legality of Nudism in Public Places?|website=politics.stackexchange.com|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature; and if such an allegation were to be made, the act would generally be described as "[[gross indecency]]".

The standards of decency have varied over time. During the [[Victorian era]], for example, exposure of a woman's legs and some extent the arms,  was considered indecent in much of the [[Western world]].  Hair was sometimes required to be covered in formal occasions as in a form a hat or bonnet. As late as the 1930s and to some extent, the 1950s,  both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing [[bathing suit]]s that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her [[navel]] was also considered indecent in the West into the 1960s and 1970s, and even as late as the 1980s.  Moral values changed drastically during the 1990s and 2000s, which in turn changed the criteria for indecent exposure.  Public exposure of the navel has been accepted during the 1990s, such as in beaches,  while in the 2000s, the buttocks can be exposed while wearing a thong.  Today, however, it is quite common for women to go topless at public beaches throughout Europe and South America and even some parts of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3834365/map-topless-laws/|title=Here's Where It's Legal for Women to Go Topless in the U.S.|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the phenomenon widely known as [[exhibitionism|flashing]], involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and [[bra]], may be free from sexual motive or intent, it nonetheless is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the United States as prohibited criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/state_statutes2.html#criminal_code |title=Criminal Code |author= |date= |work=Topical Index: State Statutes 2 |publisher=Cornell University Law School |accessdate=2010-09-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation of the exposure is sometimes based on it being unusual, attention-getting, [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]], or separately, as in a public policy protest, inappropriate and to show disrespect to the enemy side. The effects (including negative consequences) may be enhanced by intended or unintended publication of a photograph or film of the act, which would also include [[mooning]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Breastfeeding in public]] does not constitute indecent exposure under the laws of the United States, Canada, Australia, or Scotland.&lt;ref name="Scotlandact"&gt;{{cite web| authorlink = Queen's Printer for Scotland | title = Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005. | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/20050001.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Government of the United States|federal government]] and all 50 states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/07/25/public-breastfeeding-now-legal-all-50-states/835372002/|title=Finally!

Legislation ranges from simply exempting breastfeeding from laws regarding indecent exposure, to outright full protection of the right to nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/map-where-its-legal-to-breastfeed-in-public_n_5637301.html|title=These Are All The States Where It's Legal To Breastfeed In Public|last=Samakow|first=Jessica|date=2014-08-01|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public clothing==

Public clothing varies by country and may be regulated by law. What parts of the body must be covered varies by region. Although genitals are usually expected to be covered in public in almost all societies, when it comes to other parts of the body such as female breasts, midriff, legs or shoulders, norms vary. For example, in some African cultures, it is the thighs, not the breasts, which must be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3031969.stm|title=MPs defend Swazi bare breasts|author=Tom Holloway |date=15 May 2003|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, the head hair, especially female, must be covered, usually with a scarf. The vast majority of cultures accept that the face can and must be seen, but some cultures (especially in the [[Middle East]]), require that it be covered under a [[burqa]]. In conservative societies, appearing in a public place in clothing that is deemed 'indecent' is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6919581.stm|title=Nigerian skimpy dressers arrested|author=|date=27 July 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44628887|title=Inquiry into Saudi TV presenter's clothing|author=|date=27 June 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6596933.stm|title=Crackdown in Iran over dress codes|author=Frances Harrison |date=27 April 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries there are exceptions to the general rules (social or legal) regarding clothing. For instance, a country which generally prohibits full nudity may allow it in designated places, such as [[nude beaches]], or during various social events such as festivals or nude protests.

==Europe==
Attitudes towards nudity vary by country and are generally most relaxed in [[Scandinavia]], 
where genitals and breasts are not normally considered indecent or obscene. Hence, laws and societal views on public nudity are generally relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Welfare States: Scandinavian Politics and Policy in the Global Age |page=309 |first=Eric S. |last=Einhorn |first2=John |last2=Logue |year=2003 |location=Oxford |publisher=Harcourt |isbn=0-275-95044-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Finland, it is very typical for patrons to bathe nude in the intense heat of [[sauna]]s. 

In the [[Netherlands]], public nudity is allowed at sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and "other suitable places."&lt;ref&gt;[http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html Nudity and the law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012081745/http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html |date=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On nudist beaches, in unisex saunas and in swimming pool changing rooms, remaining partially clothed is frowned upon and the social norm is to undress. 

In [[Barcelona]], public nudity was a recognised right. However, on 30 April 2011, the Barcelona City Council voted a by-law forbidding walking "naked or nearly naked in public spaces" and limiting the wearing of bathing costumes to pools, beaches, adjacent streets and sea-side walks.&lt;ref&gt;[[APNEL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries, such as the UK, Ireland or Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/classified-odd/11/08/08/model-fined-sunbathing-topless-ombudsman-appeal-mulled|title=Model fined for sunbathing topless; Ombudsman appeal mulled|agency=AFP|date=8 November 2008|website=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; are more conservative. 

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, indecent exposure was prosecuted under either section 28 of the [[Town Police Clauses Act 1847]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1847/89/pdfs/ukpga_18470089_en.pdf|title=Town Police Clauses Act 1847 (as enacted)|last=|first=|date=|website=Legislation.Gov.Uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or section 4 of the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]]. The latter was a piece of legislation that made it an offence to sleep rough or beg and contained a provision for the prosecution of:
:every person wilfully openly, lewdly, and obscenely exposing his person in any street, road, or public highway, or in the view thereof, or in any place of public resort, with intent to insult any female...
This provision was repealed by section 66 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which replaced the offence of "indecent exposure" and other sexual offences with legislation that is more specific and explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Indecency in England 1857-1960: 'A Serious and Growing Evil’|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1HeCQAAQBAJ|first1=David J.|last1=Cox|first2=Kim|last2=Stevenson|first3=Candida|last3=Harris|first4=Judith|last4=Rowbotham|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317573838|volume=Volume 6|series=SOLON Explorations in Crime and Criminal Justice Histories|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current laws apply only to genital exposure with intent to shock those who do not want to see them.

Public nudity in England and Wales can also be punished as "disorderly behaviour" under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], sections 4A and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2013/10/31/freedom-of-expression-nakedness-in-a-public-place/|title=Freedom of expression – nakedness in a public place  - UK Human Rights Blog|work=UK Human Rights Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland and Northern Ireland the situation is more complex, as some sections of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 extend to these places and some do not. Under [[Scots law]], indecent exposure is considered to be a form of public indecency and is regarded as a [[crimes of indecency|crime of indecency]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Scots law has been known to respond differently from English and Welsh law in cases of indecent exposure. [[Stephen Gough]], a man known as the "Naked Rambler" who hikes across Britain wearing only shoes, has been arrested in both jurisdictions with different consequences in each. The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has considered the introduction of new legislation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

{{Main article|Indecent exposure in the United States}}
The laws governing indecent exposure in the United States vary according to location. In most states [[public nudity]] is illegal. However, in some states it is only illegal if it is accompanied by an intent to shock, arouse or offend other persons.  Some states permit local governments to set local standards. Most states exempt [[breastfeeding]] mothers from prosecution.

==Canada==
In Canada, s.173 of the ''Criminal Code''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.part-v.html |title=Criminal Code of Canada, 1985, Part V, Sexual Offences |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits "indecent acts".&lt;ref&gt;Part 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code provides, in part - Indecent acts - 173. (1) Every one who wilfully does an indecent act (a) in a public place in the presence of one or more persons...is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act, other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age.  Thus, the decision of what states of undress are "indecent", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges. Judges have held, for example, that [[nude sunbathing]] is not indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Beaupré'', 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: "the phrase 'indecent act' connotes something more active, with greater moral turpitude than the mere state of being nude in a public place."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[streaking]] is similarly not regarded as indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Springer'', 1975, Saskatchewan District Court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Niman'', 1974, Ontario Provincial Court&lt;/ref&gt; Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends "against public decency or order" and in view of the public.  The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Benolkin'', 1977, Saskatchewan Court of the Queen's Bench. It was found that "It cannot be an offence to swim in the nude at a lonely place in Canada in summer. That is part of the pleasure of summer in Canada, particularly to young males. If somebody comes along unexpectedly or if the swimmer misjudged the loneliness of the place the act cannot suddenly become criminal.".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toplessness]] is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in [[Guelph, Ontario]] while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent.&lt;ref name="QueenvsJacob"&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | title = Judgment C12668, R. vs. Jacob | date = 1996-12-09 | publisher = Province of Ontario Court of Appeal | accessdate = 2009-02-16| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?language=en&amp;searchTitle=1996+CanLII+1119+%28ON+CA%29&amp;origin=%2Fen%2Fon%2Fonca%2Fdoc%2F1996%2F1996canlii1119%2F1996canlii1119.html&amp;path=/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2000/2000bcsc902/2000bcsc902.html District of Maple Ridge v.

==Australia==
[[File:Banner protesting vehicle emissions at the World Naked Bike Ride, Auckland, New Zealand - 20050217.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Protesters gathered outside a courthouse to protest against the arrest of [[Simon Oosterman]] (second from left), Auckland's 13 Feb 2005 WNBR organizer.]]
In Australia, it is a [[Summary judgment|summary]] or [[criminal]] offence in some [[States and territories of Australia|States and Territories]] to expose one's genitals (also referred to as - 'his or her person')&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|452|1997|litigants=R v Eyles |date=1 October 1997 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Criminal Appeal|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (NSW, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in a public place or in view of a public place. In some jurisdictions exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act, indecent behaviour, grossly indecent behaviour, [[obscenity]], intention to cause offence or deliberate intention. The applicable law is different in each jurisdiction and in several jurisdictions the offence of indecent exposure does not apply.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Penalties vary between jurisdictions and are summarised below. Specific state [[Act of Parliament|Acts]], are as follows:
*Australian Capital Territory – ''Crimes Act'' 1900, section 393 – 'indecent exposure' – penalty 12 months. Under the ''Nudity Act'' 1976, the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|393}} Indecent exposure.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|na1976108|Nudity Act 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*New South Wales – ''Summary Offences Act'' 1988, section 5 – 'wilful and obscene exposure' – penalty six months.&lt;ref name="SOA1988"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|soa1988189|Summary Offences Act 1988|5}} Obscene exposure.&lt;/ref&gt;

*South Australia – ''Summary Offences Act'' 1953, section 23 – 'Indecent behaviour and gross indecency' – penalty three months and six months respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|act|soa1953189|Summary Offences Act 1953|23}} Indecent behaviour and gross indecency .&lt;/ref&gt;

*Western Australia – ''Criminal Code'', section 203 – 'Indecent acts in public' – criminal penalty two years. Summary conviction penalty: 9 months and fine of $9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|WA|act|ccaca1913252/notes.html#appendixb|Criminal Code}} section 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition of ''person''===
The laws of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory use the term "person", while in the other States the exposure refers to the [[genitalia|genital area]]. It has been noted that a term such as "exposing one's person" relates back to the United Kingdom [[Vagrancy Act 1824|''Vagrancy Act'' 1824]] and ''Evans v Ewels'' (1972)&lt;ref&gt;''Evans v Ewels'' [1972] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 671.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was said that the word "person" was a [[euphemism|genteel synonym]] for "penis" or "vulva". However, it has been held that the word "person" in s5 of the (NSW) ''Summary Offences Act'' is not limited to "penis" or "vulva". For example, in ''R v Eyles'' (1997) the offender was seen masturbating in his front garden and charged with obscene exposure under the NSW Act.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOA1988" /&gt;

:In the case of both males and females, the parts of the body which are capable of being employed for the purpose of obscene exposure are limited. The concepts of obscenity and exposure in a practical sense restrict the potential operation of the provision. There is a question as to whether there is any further restriction to be found in the word "person". The [[Crown Advocate]] has submitted that there may be circumstances in which the exposure of the breasts of a woman is capable of being regarded as obscene, and that it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which the exposure of a person's buttocks could be obscene.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;

However &amp;ndash;

:It is unnecessary and inappropriate to decide in the present case whether her submissions in that regard are correct. The jurisdiction which this Court is exercising is a jurisdiction confined to determining questions of law which arise in the case before the District Court. No question arises in the present case as to whether there are any circumstances in which the exposure by a female of breasts, or by a female or male of buttocks, could involve a contravention of s5. The prosecution case against the appellant was that he obscenely exposed his penis and other genitals. It is sufficient for resolution of the present case to say that this was capable of constituting exposure of "his person" for the purposes of the proceedings against him.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;

In many [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s (e.g., [[England and Wales]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]]), an '''indictable offence''' is an offence which can only be tried on an [[indictment]] after a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is a ''[[prima facie]]'' case to answer or by a [[grand jury]] (in contrast to a [[summary offence]]). In the [[United States]], a crime of similar severity and rules is called a [[felony]], which also requires an indictment.

==England and Wales==
In relation to [[England and Wales]], the expression ''indictable offence'' means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable on [[indictment]], whether it is exclusively so triable or [[triable either way]]; and the term ''indictable'', in its application to offences, is to be construed accordingly. In this definition, references to the way or ways in which an offence is triable are to be construed without regard to the effect, if any, of section 22 of the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] on the mode of trial in a particular case.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 5 and Schedule 1 (in the heading [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/30/schedule/1/crossheading/construction-of-certain-expressions-relating-to-offences "construction of certain expressions relating to offences"]), as amended by section 154 of, and paragraph 169 of Schedule 7 to, the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An either-way offence allows the defendant to elect between trial by jury on indictment in the [[Crown Court]] and summary trial in a [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]. However, the election may be overruled by the magistrates' court if the facts suggest that the [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] powers of a magistrates' court would be inadequate to reflect the seriousness of the offence.  

In relation to some indictable offences, for example criminal damage, only summary trial is available unless the damage caused exceeds £5,000. 

A youth court has jurisdiction to try all indictable offences with the exception of homicide and certain firearms offences, and will normally do so provided that the available sentencing power of two years' detention is adequate to punish the offender if found guilty.

===History===
See section 64 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]]. 

Grand juries were abolished in 1933.

===Offences triable only on indictment===
Some offences such as [[murder]] and [[rape]] are considered so serious that they can only be tried on indictment at the [[Crown Court]] where the widest range of sentencing powers is available to the [[judge]].

The expression ''indictable-only offence'' was defined by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/section/51 section 51] of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], as originally enacted, as an offence triable only on indictment. Sections 51 and 52 of, and Schedule 3 to, that Act abolished committal proceedings for such offences and made other provisions in relation to them.

When the accused is charged with an indictable-only offence, he or she will be tried in the Crown Court. The rules are different in England and Wales in respect of those under 18 years of age.

See also section 14(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].

==New Zealand==
Similarly in New Zealand, a rape or murder charge will be tried at the High Court, while less serious offences such as theft, will be tried at the District Court. However, the District Court can hold both jury and summary trials.

==Canada==
For differences between indictable offences and summary offences see [[summary offence#Canada|summary offences]].

==United States==
In United States penal law, other than a felony, court findings of, or an act of [[gross negligence]] can be counted as an indictable offence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3704">: ''Not to be confused with [[International Year of Youth]] which has been held since 2010.''

The year 1985 was proclaimed by the [[United Nations]] as the '''International Youth Year''', or '''IYY'''. It was held to focus attention on issues of concern to and relating to youth. The proclamation was signed on January 1, 1985 by [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]].

==Events==
Throughout the year, activities took place all over the world. These activities were coordinated by the Youth Secretariat within the [[Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs]], at the time based at the UN offices in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The Secretariat's director, [[Mohammad Sharif (United Nations)|Mohammad Sharif]], was also the Executive Secretary for IYY.&lt;ref&gt;Final Report of the World Congress on Youth, p. 126. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000684/068409eb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The President of IYY was [[Nicu Ceauşescu]], son of the then dictator of [[Romania]] [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]

While not organising any specific events itself, under the year's slogan of "Participation, Development, Peace", the IYY Secretariat helped facilitate numerous events helping to make IYY a success. On October 11, 1985 the Secretary General of the UN, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], in his report to the General Assembly, summarised the principal activities for IYY.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Secretary General on International Youth Year to the General Assembly" (UN/GA Document A/40/701, October 11, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main UN event for IYY was the [[World Congress on Youth]] (''in Spanish'': [[Congreso Mundial Sobre La Juventud]]) organised by [[UNESCO]] and held in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]] July 8-15, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000684/068409eb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It issued the "Barcelona Declaration"&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000665/066540sb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on youth.

Other international events mentioned in the Secretary General's report (October 11, 1985 A/40/701):
*[[International Youth Conference and World Youth Festival]] ([[Kingston, Jamaica]], April 6-10, 1985). Issued the "Kingston Declaration" on youth.&lt;ref&gt;Kesler, Charles R.

'''Jofur''' (from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''Jöfurr'': "[[wild boar]]") is a name used in [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] literature for the thunder god, mainly as a synonym for [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]. Jofur probably originated in the writings of the 17th-century Swedish scientist and writer [[Olaus Rudbeckius]], and has since been used in Nordic poetry, mainly during the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] eras. Jofur (as a god) does not appear in [[Norse mythology]], even though the word was also used as an honorary title for kings and heroes. The most famous use of the word is in Carl Michael Bellman's (1740-1795) song Fredman's Epistle No. 72 "Glimmande Nymf" ("Glittering Nymph"), which remains very popular and which is frequently sung in renditions by numerous artists.

The [[AsiaWorld–Expo]], a major convention and exhibition facility in [[Hong Kong]], has been one of the busiest venues in the city. The halls in the venue have been used for various entertainment events since its launch on 25 December 2005, including the [[AsiaWorld–Arena]], the biggest purpose-built indoor seated entertainment arena in Hong Kong with a maximum capacity of 14,000.

VIVA, a combination of hall 8 and 10 of the AsiaWorld–Expo, commonly and simply referred to as AsiaWorld–Expo Hall 10, is a smaller venue that has also been frequently used for concert events.  All events are categorised according to years and venues; in a chronological order.

==2000s==
&lt;!--It is currently known that some events held at Hall 10 are being mistakenly inserted to the table for the Arena (Hall 1). Please help to move or add them back to the list for Hall 10. --&gt;

{{Maronites}}
The '''Mardaites''' ({{lang-el|Μαρδαΐται}}) or '''al-Jarajima''' ({{lang-syr|ܡܪ̈ܕܝܐ}}; {{lang-ar|الجراجمة}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''al-Jarājimah''), inhabited the highland regions of the [[Nur Mountains]].
The Mardaites were early Christians following either [[Miaphysitism]] or [[Monothelitism]] and bear a possible, but unconfirmed, relation to the [[Maronites]].&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{Citation | first = Alexander (Ed.) | last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=1297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Little is known about their ethnicity, it has been speculated that they might have been [[Persian people|Persians]] or [[Armenians]], yet other sources claim them to have been native to the [[Levant]] or possibly even from the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; Their other Arabic name, ''al-Jarājimah'', suggests that some were natives of the town [[Jurjum]] in [[Cilicia]], however the name also exists in Arabic and translates to "Sick" or "Insane" as is the case with the word "Mareed", due to their fierce fighting style and retaliation against attacks. They were joined later by various escaped slaves and peasants during their insurgency and were said to have claimed territory from "the Holy City" to the "Black Mountain".&lt;ref name="eoi457"/&gt;

== History ==
According to some historians, after the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]], the Mardaites gained a semi-independent status around the Nur Mountains within [[al-'Awasim|al-ʿAwāṣim]], the Byzantine-Arab border region. They initially agreed to serve as mercenaries for the Arabs and to guard the [[Amanian Gate]], but their loyalty was intermittent and they often sided with the [[Byzantine Empire]] as their agenda varied.&lt;ref name="eoi457"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Djaradjima | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam | publisher=BRILL | accessdate=April 6, 2013 | author=Canard, M. |editor1=P. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=C.E. Bosworth |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs | volume=2 | edition=2 | pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Greek and Syriac historians, their territory stretched from the Amanus to the "holy city", the latter often identified as [[Jerusalem]], although more likely to refer to [[Cyrrhus]], also called Hagioupolis, the capital of [[Cyrrhestica]], in upper Syria.&lt;ref name=woods&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.syriacstudies.com/AFSS/Syriac_Articles_in_English/Entries/2011/1/9_Corruption_and_Mistranslation__The_Common_Syriac_Source_on_the_Origin_of_the_Mardaites_David_Woods.html | title=Corruption and Mistranslation: The Common Syriac Source on the Origin of the Mardaites | accessdate=April 6, 2013 | author=Woods, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their numbers were swelled by thousands of runaway slaves, making them an ethnically diverse group. In light of this, it is claimed that they forced [[Muawiyah I]], Caliph of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], to pay tribute to the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine IV]], or possibly to them instead.&lt;ref name="woods"/&gt; Emperor [[Justinian II]] sent the Mardaites again to raid Syria in 688/9; this time they were joined by native peasants and slaves and were able to advance as far as Lebanon. The Umayyads were compelled to sign another treaty by which they paid the Byzantines half the tribute of [[Cyprus]], [[Armenia]] and the [[Kingdom of Iberia]] in the [[Caucasus Mountains]]; in return, Justinian relocated around 12,000 Mardaites to the southern coast of [[Anatolia]], as well as parts of [[Greece]] such as [[Epirus]] and the [[Peloponnese]], as part of his measures to restore population and manpower to areas depleted by earlier conflicts.&lt;ref name="eoi457"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ostrogorsky1957&gt;{{Citation | last = Ostrogorsky | first =  George |last2 = Hussey (trans.) |first2 = Joan | year = 1957 | title = History of the Byzantine state | isbn = 0-8135-0599-2 | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, N.J. |pages = 116–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There they were conscripted as rowers and [[marines]] in the [[Byzantine navy]] for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Byzantium and Its Army, 284–1081  |last=Treadgold |first=Warren T. |year=1998 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-3163-2 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others however remained behind and continued raiding Muslim-held territories until their chief stronghold fell to Umayyad prince-general [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] in 708. Maslama(h) then resettled them throughout Syria, and although he allowed them to retain their faith, he conscripted them into his army.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

Describing the [[abna']] of Yemen, [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani]] states in his ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'' that, up to his time (10th century), these people were called "''banū al-aḥrār'' ({{lang|ar|بنو الأحرار}}) in Sanaa, ''al-abnāʾ'' in Yemen, ''al-aḥāmira'' ({{lang|ar|الأحامرة}}) in [[Kufa]], ''[[al-asāwira]]'' ({{lang|ar|الأساورة}}) in [[Basra]], ''al-khaḍārima'' ({{lang|ar|الخضارمة}}) in [[Upper Mesopotamia|al-Jazira]], and ''al-jarājima'' ({{lang|ar|الجراجمة}}) in [[Bilad al-Sham]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zakeri|first1=Mohsen|title=Sasanid Soldiers in Early Muslim Society: The Origins of 'Ayyārān and Futuwwa|date=1995|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=9783447036528|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfYnu5F20coC&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=Banu%20al-Ahrar&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q=Banu%20al-Ahrar&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Maronites ==
Many [[Maronites]] claim that the modern Maronites are of Mardaite ancestry, and oral tradition is said to indicate this. However, documented evidence is sporadic at best as the Maronites sources are recent due to their lack of a thorough recorded history beyond the 16th century, leaving the matter open for debate among historians. That being said, Maronite oral tradition does mirror much of the history of the Mardaites and it is possible that the similarities are superficial and the groups are similar, but unrelated. In reality there is no way to prove or disprove this connection due to the lack of a thorough recorded history, but oral traditions are unlikely to have been falsified in isolated mountain communities. Many attribute the view that the Maronites are unrelated to the Mardaites due to early historic bias, when the West favored the [[Druze]] until the pogroms of Syria in the 19th century which resulted in the death of 50,000 Maronites and other Christians at the hands of the Druze as a reprisal for Maronite peasantry and Maronite church attempts to topple their feudal lords in the South of Mount Lebanon.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

This term was adopted by the [[Marada Movement]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] because of their [[Phoenicianism|Phoenicianist]] views of the origin of the [[Lebanese people]].

The [[University of California]] has been no stranger to sexual harassment, with substantial accusations reported yearly in the hundreds at all nine UC campuses, notably UC Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/university-of-california-staff-faculty-sexual-misconduct-harassment-cases/|title=University of California releases details on 113 employee sexual misconduct cases |last=Press |first=Associated |date=2017-03-01 |work=CBS News |access-date=2018-10-22 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a landmark event at the [[University of California, Irvine]] spearheaded the removal and reprimanding of several campus officials and professors accused of sexual harassment and discrimination. In early July 2018, UC Irvine removed millionaire benefactor [[Francisco J.

There are still many places of education such as high schools, however, where legal intervention is not readily enforced for situations where sexual assault takes place. Pamela Y. Price in her book ''Directions in Sexual Harassment Law'' describes how “a major argument for why [laws against] sexual harassment won’t work in education is that issues of sexuality can’t be regulated (similar to the debate in employment) or that adolescent behavior is too unpredictable to be legally controlled” (Price 62). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-11-10|editor-last=MacKinnon|editor-first=Catharine A.|editor2-last=Siegel|editor2-first=Reva B.|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.12987/yale/9780300098006.001.0001|doi=10.12987/yale/9780300098006.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finance ===
It has been noted that, although the [[financial services|financial industry]] is known to have a wide prevalence of sexual harassment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-harassment-breakingviews/breakingviews-citys-metoo-moment-is-tipping-point-and-catalyst-idUSKBN1FE2F2|title=City's #MeToo moment is tipping point and catalyst|date=January 25, 2018|agency=Reuters |access-date=January 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126070649/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-harassment-breakingviews/breakingviews-citys-metoo-moment-is-tipping-point-and-catalyst-idUSKBN1FE2F2 |archive-date=January 26, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of January 2018, there were no high-profile financial executives stepping down as the result of #MeToo allegations.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1188053/the-presidents-club-fallout-why-metoo-movement-will-not-affect-the-financial-world/|title=Why the financial world and big business will never have a #MeToo moment|last=Brinded|first=Lianna|website=Quartz |access-date=January 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012855/https://qz.com/1188053/the-presidents-club-fallout-why-metoo-movement-will-not-affect-the-financial-world/|archivedate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first widely covered example of concrete consequences in finance was when two reporters, including Madison Marriage of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', went [[undercover operation|undercover]] at a men-only [[Presidents Club]] event meant to raise money for children. Because women were not allowed to attend except as "hostesses" in tight, short black dresses with black underwear, Financial Times reporter Madison Marriage and another reporter got jobs as hostesses and documented widespread sexual misconduct. As a result, The presidents Club was shut down.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In March 2018, Morgan Stanley broker [[Douglas E. Greenberg]] was put on administrative leave after a ''New York Times'' story outlined harassment allegations by four women, including multiple arrests for the violation of restraining orders, and a threat to burn down an ex-girlfriend's house. It has been called the #MeToo moment of Portland's financial service industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2018/03/morgan_stanley_aware_of_abuse.html|title=Morgan Stanley knew of abuse allegations against Lake Oswego broker: report|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=March 30, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted in discussion of #MeToo in finance that only about a quarter of top positions are held by women at several major banks, and there is evidence there may be wide disparities in some financial institutions between how much men and women are paid on average.&lt;ref name=":47" /&gt;

The detective provided sexually suggestive text messages from Hancock sent to her while working for Hancock's [[security detail]] in 2012.

==== ME TOO bill in the US Congress ====
[[Jackie Speier]] proposed the Member and Employee Training and Oversight on Congress Act (ME TOO Congress Act) on November 15, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564405871/me-too-legislation-aims-to-combat-sexual-harassment-in-congress|title='Me Too' Legislation Aims To Combat Sexual Harassment in Congress|publisher=NPR |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121201936/https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564405871/me-too-legislation-aims-to-combat-sexual-harassment-in-congress|archivedate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full language of the bipartisan bill was revealed by the House on January 18, 2018 as an amendment to the [[Congressional Accountability Act of 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-unveils-landmark-sexual-harassment-overhaul-bill-n838436|title=House unveils landmark sexual harassment overhaul bill|publisher=NBC News |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122073057/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-unveils-landmark-sexual-harassment-overhaul-bill-n838436|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the bill is to change how the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government treats sexual harassment complaints. Under the old system, complaints regarding the legislative branch were channeled through the [[United States Congress Office of Compliance|Office of Compliance]], which required complete confidentially through the process and took months of counseling and mediation before a complaint could actually be filed. Any settlement payments were paid using federal taxes, and it was reported that within a decade, $15&amp;nbsp;million of tax money had been spent settling harassment and discrimination complaints. The bill would ensure future complaints could only take up to 180 days to be filed. The bill would also allow the staffers to transfer to a different department or otherwise work away from the presence of the alleged harasser without losing their jobs if they requested it. The bill would require Representatives and Senators to pay for their own harassment settlements. The Office of Compliance would no longer be allowed to keep settlements secret, and would be required to publicly publish the settlement amounts and the associated employing offices. For the first time, the same protections would also apply to unpaid workers, including pages, fellows and interns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies|title=Lawmakers unveil 'ME TOO Congress' bill to overhaul sexual harassment policies|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|date=November 15, 2017|website=TheHill|access-date=January 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223010703/http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481|title=House unveils sweeping harassment overhaul after wave of scandals|website=POLITICO |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072858/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled|title=Bill Changes How Congressional Sexual Harassment Claims Are Handled|publisher=NPR |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122024352/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
Soon after #MeToo started spreading in late 2017, several allegations from a 2016 ''[[The Indianapolis Star|Indianapolis Star]]'' article re-surfaced in the gymnastic industry against former U.S. Gymnastics doctor [[Larry Nassar]] of [[Michigan State University]]. Nassar was called out via #MeToo for sexually assaulting gymnasts as young as 6 years old during "treatments".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/the-metoo-moment-for-us-gymnasts-olympics-nassar-justice.html|title=The #MeToo Moment: For U.S. Gymnasts, Why Did Justice Take So Long?|date=January 25, 2018|website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 25, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126182826/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/the-metoo-moment-for-us-gymnasts-olympics-nassar-justice.html|archivedate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachael Denhollander]] was the first to call him out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadspin.com/it-began-with-rachael-denhollander-and-it-ends-with-her-1822388448|title=It Began With Rachael Denhollander And It Ends With Her|last=Meyers|first=Dvora|website=Deadspin |access-date=January 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125003835/https://deadspin.com/it-began-with-rachael-denhollander-and-it-ends-with-her-1822388448|archivedate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though nothing was done after the initial allegations came out in 2016, after more than 150 women came forward, Nassar was effectively sentenced to life in prison.

=== Pornography ===
There have been discussions about how [[pornography]] is related to the emergence of the #MeToo movement, and what changes, if any, should be made to the porn industry in response.&lt;ref name=":010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/07/me-too-anti-porn-conference-cosmopolitan-ban|title=The strange alliance between #MeToo and the anti-porn movement|last=Graves|first=Lucia|date=April 8, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/danny-wylde-christopher-zeischegg-porn-814784|title=This ex-porn star is calling on #MeToo to include sex workers|date=February 21, 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deaths of five female porn actresses during the first three months of 2018 inspired demands that workers in the industry be included as part of the #MeToo movement.&lt;ref name=":58"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43093080|title=Porn stars call for respect after spate of deaths|last=Fabbri|first=Thomas|date=March 26, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that many women and men have been sexually assaulted on set.&lt;ref name=":59"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/186887/what-will-it-take-for-the-porn-industry-to-have-its-metoo-moment#.YPIF6SWdc|title=What will it take for the porn industry to have its #MeToo moment?|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some high-profile pornographic performers have been accused of assault since the emergence of #MeToo, including [[James Deen]] and [[Ron Jeremy]].&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/insider/reporting-the-porn-industry.html|title=What It's Like to Report About the Porn Industry|last=Syckle|first=Katie Van|date=March 26, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/porns-two-biggest-male-stars-stand-accused-of-serial-sexual-assault-wheres-the-outrage|title=Porn's Two Biggest Male Stars Stand Accused of Serial Sexual Assault.

Several groups of [[Christian]]s, [[Conservatism|conservative]] women, and [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]] have argued that #MeToo demonstrates pornography causes women to be viewed as sexual objects and contributes to the prevalence of sexual harassment. As a result, these groups believe the production and consumption of pornography should be greatly restricted or made illegal.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

Other social advocates and feminists have responded by pointing out that attempts to suppress pornography in the U.S. have historically never been effective at reducing consumption. They note that porn consumption in the U.S. is currently at what is likely the highest levels in history, but overall levels of sexual violence and rape are far lower today than when the [[Anti-pornography movement in the United States|anti-pornography movement in the U.S.]] first emerged during the 1960s. Additionally, many feminists argue that laws which make pornography illegal only further restrict women as far what they are and are not allowed to do with their bodies.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

Many feminists have stated that pornography can be empowering or enjoyable for women and depicting female sexuality is not always objectification.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytrojan.com/2018/04/05/you-do-uterus-female-sexuality-isnt-always-objectification/|title=You Do Uterus: Female sexuality isn’t always objectification {{!}} Daily Trojan|date=April 5, 2018|work=Daily Trojan|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that a lot of porn is made by women and for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternet.org/conservative-trying-use-metoo-movement-ban-pornography|title=This Conservative Is Trying to Use the #MeToo Movement to Ban Pornography|last=Fenwick|first=Cody|date=February 12, 2018|work=AlterNet|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Award-winning porn actress and director [[Angela White]] says there is a "large positive shift within the industry" to more women directing and producing their own content and "to represent women as powerful sexual beings."&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt; Anti-porn activist [[Melissa Farley]] has said this ignores the "choicelessness" faced by many actresses in porn.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt; Liberal advocates argue that anti-pornography movements in the U.S. have historically never tried to increase choices for vulnerable adult performers, and taking away a person's right to act in porn may hurt them economically by reducing their choices. Many adult performers have stated that the social stigma surrounding their type of work is already a major barrier when they're seeking help, and making porn illegal would leave them few options if they are suffering from sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;

As a result of #MeToo, many adult performers, sex worker advocates and feminists have called for greater protections for pornographic actresses, for example reducing social stigmas, mandating training courses that teach performers their rights, and providing access to independent hotlines where performers can report abuse. They argue that making porn illegal would only cause the production of porn to go underground where there are even fewer options for help. Some liberal activists have argued to compromise by raising the legal age of entry into adult entertainment from 18 to 21, which would prevent some of the most vulnerable women from being taken advantage of, while allowing adult women to still do what they want with their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;

Some have pointed out that many young people who do not receive a sex education adopt ideas about sex and sexual roles from pornography, whose fantasy depictions of those behaviors are not accurate to life, as they are designed for purposes of adult entertainment, and not educating the public on the reality of sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html|title=What Teenagers Are Learning From Online Porn|date=February 7, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of the United States teach [[Birth control|birth-control]] methods only by [[abstinence]] from sex.

Sex education can also effectively prepare children to identify and say no to unwanted sexual contact before it occurs, and gives parents an opportunity to teach children about consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/23/sex-ed-metoo-era-consent-parents/419690002/|title=Sex ed: Many parents wouldn't recognize it today -- and #metoo may change it even more|last=|first=|date=|work=USA TODAY|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose==
The original purpose of "Me Too" as used by Tarana Burke in 2006, was to empower women through empathy, especially young and vulnerable women. In October 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to help reveal the extent of problems with sexual harassment and assault by showing how many people have experienced these events themselves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA" /&gt;

After millions of people started using the phrase, and it spread to dozens of other languages, the purpose changed and expanded, as a result, it has come to mean different things to different people. Tarana Burke accepts the title of the leader and creator of the movement but has stated she considers herself a worker of something much bigger. Burke has stated that this movement has grown to include both men and women of all colors and ages, as it continues to support marginalized people in marginalized communities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=Chris|last2=Lopez|first2=Linette|title=Tarana Burke on why she created the #MeToo movement – and where it's headed|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|website=[[Business Insider]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229055941/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|archivedate=December 29, 2017|date=December 13, 2017|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104|title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors|last=Jeffries|first=Zenobia|website=[[Yes!

===Awareness and empathy===
Analyses of the movement often point to the prevalence of sexual violence, which has been estimated by the [[World Health Organization]] to affect one-third of all women worldwide. A 2017 poll by [[ABC News]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also found that 54% of American women report receiving "unwanted and inappropriate" sexual advances with 95% saying that such behavior usually goes unpunished. Others state that #MeToo underscores the need for men to intervene when they witness demeaning behavior.&lt;ref name=":262"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/how-metoo-has-awoken-women-around-the-world|title=How #MeToo has awoken women around the world|last=Radu|first=Sintia|date=October 25, 2017|website=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report|US News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120413/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/how-metoo-has-awoken-women-around-the-world |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2|title=The problem with asking women to say 'Me Too'|last=Chapin|first=Angelina|date=October 16, 2017|website=[[HuffPost]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102235158/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2|archivedate=January 2, 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/17/me-too-hashtag-sexual-harassment-at-work-stats/|title=A new poll on sexual harassment suggests why 'Me Too' went so insanely viral|last=Zillman|first=Claire|date=October 17, 2017|website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |access-date=January 13, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093211/http://fortune.com/2017/10/17/me-too-hashtag-sexual-harassment-at-work-stats/|archivedate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies and laws===
Burke has stated the current purpose of the movement is to give people the resources to have access to healing, and advocates for changes to laws and policies. Burke has highlighted goals such as processing all untested [[rape kit]]s, re-examining local school policies, improving the vetting of teachers, and updating sexual harassment policies.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|title=Tarana Burke on why she created the #MeToo movement – and where it's headed|last1=Snyder|first1=Chris|last2=Lopez|first2=Linette|date=December 13, 2017|website=[[Business Insider]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229055941/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|archivedate=December 29, 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has called for all professionals who work with children to be [[fingerprint]]ed and subjected to a [[background check]] before being cleared to start work. She advocates for sex education that teaches kids to report predatory behavior immediately.&lt;ref name=":172" /&gt; Burke supports the #MeToo bill in the [[US Congress]], which would remove the requirement that staffers of the federal government go through months of "cooling off" before being allowed to file a complaint against a Congressperson.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

Milano states a priority for #MeToo is changing the laws surrounding sexual harassment and assault, for example, instituting protocols that give sufferers in all industries the ability to file complaints without retaliation. She supports legislation making it difficult for publicly traded companies to hide cover-up money from their stockholders and would like to make it illegal for employers to require new workers sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s as a condition of employment.&lt;ref name=":272" /&gt; Gender analysts such as [[Anna North]] have stated that #MeToo should be addressed as a labor issue due to the economic disadvantages to reporting harassment. North suggested combating underlying power imbalances in some workplaces, for example by raising the tipped minimum wage, and embraces innovations like the "portable [[panic button]]s" that are mandated for hotel employees in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo|title=What I've learned covering sexual misconduct this year|website=Vox |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118064612/https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that barriers to employment must be removed, such as the job requirement by some employers to sign non-disclosure agreements or other agreements that prevent an employee from talking about their employment publicly, or taking disputes (including sexual harassment claims) to arbitration or legal proceedings. It's been suggested that legislation should be passed that bans these types of mandatory pre-employment agreements.&lt;ref name=":65"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/|title=From Politics to Policy: Turning the Corner on Sexual Harassment - Center for American Progress|date=January 31, 2018|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=April 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some policy-based changes that have been suggested is reducing limited managerial oversight; creating clear internal reporting mechanisms; more effective and proactive disciplinary measures; creating a culture that encourages employees to be open about serious problems;&lt;ref name=":65" /&gt; making financial penalties for workers who work for companies that allow those workers to remain in their position when they have repeatedly sexually harassed others; and force companies to pay huge fines or lose tax breaks if they decide to keep workers that are sexual harassers around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=2f23c864-96db-4e51-9cb9-29daeb95d19b@pdc-v-sessmgr06&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=edsbig.A553402477&amp;db=edsbig|title=Time's Up: As the Me Too movement continues to shed light on sexual harassm...: Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
In the coverage of #MeToo, there has been widespread discussion about the best way for sufferers of sexual abuse or harassment to stop what is happening to them at work. There is general agreement that a lack of effective reporting options is a major factor that drives unchecked sexual misconduct in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY|title=Despite #MeToo, U.S. workers fear speaking out about sexual harassment|date=November 10, 2017|agency=Reuters |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011233/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

False reports of sexual assault are rare but when they happen, they are put in the spotlight for the public to see. The media does this to portray the image that the majority of the reported sexual assaults are falsely reported by women. However, falsely reported sexual assaults only make up 3% of the total amount that are reported. This doesn’t even take into account the amount of women that still don’t report their stories. This is yet another reason why women are scared to report their experiences with sexual assault because they are afraid that no one will ever believe their story and in the process they will have embarrassed and humiliated themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/the-glaring-blind-spot-of-the-me-too-movement/546458/|title=The Glaring Blind Spot of the 'Me Too' Movement|last=White|first=Gillian B.|date=2017-11-22|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], a person who makes a sexual harassment complaint at work is reprimanded or fired 40% of the time, while the accused person is typically not investigated or punished.&lt;ref name=":332"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/europe/france-sexual-harassment.html|title='Revolt' in France Against Sexual Harassment Hits Cultural Resistance|last=Rubin|first=Alissa J.|date=November 19, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 15, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223074906/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/europe/france-sexual-harassment.html|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a 2016 report from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] states that although 25–85% of women say they experience sexual harassment at work, few ever report the incidents, most commonly due to fear of reprisal.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; There is evidence that in [[Japan]], as few as 4% of rape victims report the crime, and the charges are dropped about half the time.&lt;ref name=":1522"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/metoo-sexual-assault-women-rights-japan/|title=Saying #MeToo in Japan|date=January 2, 2018|website=POLITICO |access-date=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106063552/https://www.politico.eu/article/metoo-sexual-assault-women-rights-japan/|archivedate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html|title=She Broke Japan's Silence on Rape|last=Rich|first=Motoko|date=December 29, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124054016/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html|archivedate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a discussion on the best ways to handle [[whisper network]]s, or private lists of "people to avoid" that are shared unofficially in nearly every major institution or industry where sexual harassment is common due to power imbalances, including government, media, news, and academia. These lists have the stated purpose of warning other workers in the industry and are shared from person-to-person, on forums, in private social media groups, and via [[spreadsheet]]s. However, these lists can become "weaponized" and used to spread unsubstantiated gossip, which has been discussed widely in the media.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-whisper-network-sexual-misconduct-allegations-719009|title=What is a whisper network?

Defenders say the lists provide a way to warn other people in the industry if worried about punishment, or if complaints have already been ignored, and also helps victims identify each other so they can speak out together.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":210" /&gt; Sometimes these lists are kept for other reasons, for example, a spreadsheet from the United Kingdom called "High Libido MPs" and dubbed "the spreadsheet of shame" was created by a group of male and female parliamentary researchers, and contained a list of allegations against nearly 40 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. It is also rumored that [[whip (politics)|party whips]] (who are in charge of getting members of Parliament to commit to votes) maintain a "black book" that contains allegations against several lawmakers that can be used for [[blackmail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html|title=Sexual Harassment Claims Surface in U.K. Parliament|last=Castle|first=Stephen|date=October 30, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011016/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/|title=Making Sense of the Lewd Sexual Harassment Scandal Roiling the U.K|website=Fortune |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031182703/http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dirty-dossier-accuses-mps-of-harassment-and-sex-in-offices-6f7q8kn8b|title=Dirty dossier accuses MPs of harassment and sex in offices|author1=Hannah McGrath|author2=Billy Kenber|date=October 30, 2017|website=The Times|access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0140-0460|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is claimed a well-known person's sexual misconduct was an "open secret", these lists are often the source.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt; In the wake of #MeToo, several private whisper network lists have been leaked to the public.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":210"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/1/11/16878316/shitty-media-men-list-katie-roiphe-moira-donegan|title=The creator of the Shitty Media Men List has come forward.

In [[India]], a student gave her friends a list containing names of professors and academics in the Indian university system to be avoided. The list went viral after it was posted on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/09/health/india-me-too-allegations/index.html|title=#MeToo helps spark wider conversation around sexual abuse in India|last=CNN|first=Huizhong Wu,|publisher=CNN |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125143503/http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/09/health/india-me-too-allegations/index.html|archivedate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism in the media, the authors defended themselves by saying they were only trying to warn their friends, had confirmed every case, and several victims from the list were poor students who had already been punished or ignored when trying to come forward.&lt;ref name=":252"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/krantikali/raya-sarkar-and-all-the-lists-men-ae956f21eab1|title=Raya Sarkar and All The List's Men|date=October 24, 2017 |access-date=January 6, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120435/https://medium.com/krantikali/raya-sarkar-and-all-the-lists-men-ae956f21eab1|archivedate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/126213/me-too-hadiya-love-jihad-triple-talaq-2017-year-feminism-india/|title=#MeToo, Hadiya, Triple Talaq: How 2017 Was an Important Year for Indian Feminism|date=December 29, 2017|website=The Better India |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011249/https://www.thebetterindia.com/126213/me-too-hadiya-love-jihad-triple-talaq-2017-year-feminism-india/|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moira Donegan]], a New York City-based journalist, privately shared a crowd-sourced [[Shitty Media Men|Shitty Media Men list]] of people to avoid in publishing and journalism. When it was shared outside her private network, Donegan lost her job. Donegan stated it was unfair so few people had access to the list before it went public; for example, very few women of color received access (and therefore protection) from it. She pointed to her "[[privilege (sociology)|whiteness, health, education, and class]]" that allowed her to take the risk of sharing the list and getting fired.&lt;ref name=":210" /&gt;

The main problem with trying to protect more potential victims by publishing whisper networks is determining the best mechanism to verify allegations in a way that is fair to all parties.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/16/16482800/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-workplace|title=It's time to weaponize the "whisper network"|work=Vox |access-date=January 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127143320/https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/16/16482800/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-workplace|archivedate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/18/how-whisper-networks-help-protect-women-harvey-weinsteins-world/759860001/|title=How 'whisper networks' help protect women from the Harvey Weinsteins of the world|work=USA Today |access-date=January 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127154813/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/18/how-whisper-networks-help-protect-women-harvey-weinsteins-world/759860001/|archivedate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggestions have included strengthening [[trade union|labor unions]] in vulnerable industries so workers can report harassment directly to the union instead of to an employer.

Dr. John Launer of [[Health Education England]] stated leaders must be made aware of common "mismatches of perceptions" at work to reduce incidents where one person thinks they are flirting while the other person feels like they're being demeaned or harassed.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Reporter [[Anna North]] from ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' states one way to address #MeToo is teach children the basics of sex. North states the cultural notion that women do not enjoy sex leads men "to believe that a lukewarm yes is all they're ever going to get", referring to a 2017 study which found that men who believe women enjoy being forced into sex are "more likely to perceive women as consenting".&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/16/16894722/aziz-ansari-grace-babe-me-too|title=The Aziz Ansari story is ordinary.

She says "preserving the nuances" is more inclusive and realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/01/17/the-metoo-movement-is-at-a-dangerous-tipping-point/|title=Opinion: The #MeToo movement is at a dangerous tipping point|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|date=January 17, 2018|website=The Washington Post|access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0190-8286|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117125828/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/01/17/the-metoo-movement-is-at-a-dangerous-tipping-point/|archivedate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Daniel W. Drezner|Daniel Drezner]] stated that #MeToo laid the groundwork for two major cultural shifts. One is the acceptance that sexual harassment (not just sexual assault) is unacceptable in the workplace. The other is that when a powerful person is accused of sexual harassment, the reaction should be a presumption that the less powerful accuser is "likely telling the truth, because the risks of going public are great." However, he states society is struggling with the speed at which change is being demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/02/14/metoo-and-the-trouble-with-norms/|title=Perspective {{!}} #MeToo and the trouble with new norms|last=Drezner|first=Daniel W.|date=February 14, 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=February 20, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and former [[Seduction community|pick-up artist]] [[Michael Ellsberg]] encourages men to reflect on past behavior and examples of questionable sexual behavior, such as the viral story [[Cat Person]], which is written from the perspective of a twenty-year-old woman who goes on a date with a much older man and ends up having an unpleasant sexual experience that was consensual but unwanted.

Relationship instructor Kasia Urbaniak said the movement is creating its own crisis around [[masculinity]]. "There's a reflective questioning about whether they’re going to be next and if they’ve ever hurt a woman. There's a level of anger and frustration. If you’ve been doing something wrong but haven't been told, there's an incredible sense of betrayal and it’ll provoke a backlash. I think silence on both sides is incredibly dangerous." Urbaniak says she would like women to be allies of men and to be curious about their experience. "In that alliance there's a lot more power and possibility than there is in men stepping aside and starting to stew."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/dominatrix-classes-be-more-assertive-work-and-life|title=Want to be more assertive in life?

==#HimToo==
{{main|Him Too movement}}
The related hashtag [[Him Too movement|#HimToo]] emerged in popularity with the #MeToo movement. Although dating back to at least 2015, and initially associated with politics or casual communication, #HimToo took on new meanings associated with #MeToo in 2017, with some using it to emphasize male victims of sexual harassment and abuse, and others using it to emphasize male perpetrators. In September and October 2018, during the [[Brett_Kavanaugh_Supreme_Court_nomination#Sexual_assault_allegations|sexual assault allegations raised during Brett Kavanaugh's nomination]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, #HimToo became used by supporters of Kavanaugh and to highlight male victims of false accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Amanda |title=#HimToo: Left And Right Embrace Opposing Takes On Same Hashtag |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/11/656293787/-himtoo-left-and-right-embrace-opposing-takes-on-same-hashtag |website=NPR.org |language=en |date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ellis |first1=Emma Grey |title=How #HimToo Became the Tagline of the Men’s Rights Movement |url=https://www.wired.com/story/brett-kavanaugh-hearings-himtoo-metoo-christine-blasey-ford/ |website=WIRED |date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creator [[Tarana Burke]] has laid out specific goals for the #MeToo movement, including: processing all untested rape kits in the United States, investigating the vetting of teachers, better protecting children at school, updating sexual harassment policies, and improving training in workplaces, places of worship, and schools. She has stated that everyone in a community, including men and women, must take action in order to make the #MeToo movement a success. She also supports the #MeToo Congress bill and hopes it will inspire similar legal changes in other parts of the country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Some actors have admonished proponents of the movement for not distinguishing between different degrees of sexual misconduct. [[Matt Damon]] commented on the phenomenon in an interview, and later apologized, saying "the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it.

Tarana Burke said in January 2018, "Those of us who do this work know that backlash is inevitable." While describing the backlash as carrying an underlying sentiment of fairness, she defended her movement as "not a witch hunt as people try to paint it". She stated that engaging with the cultural critique in #MeToo was more productive than calling for it to end or focusing on accused men who "haven't actually touched anybody".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; [[Ronan Farrow]], who published the Weinstein exposé in the [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] that helped start the #MeToo resurgence (alongside ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporters [[Megan Twohey]] and [[Jodi Kantor]]), was asked in late December 2017 whether he thought the movement had "gone too far". Farrow called for a careful examination of each story to guard against false accusations but also recalled the alleged sexual abuse his sister Dylan Farrow claims she went through at the hands of his father [[Woody Allen]]. He stated that after decades of silence, "My feeling is that this is a net benefit to society and that all of the people, men, and women, pouring forward and saying 'me too' deserve this moment. I think you're right to say that we all have to be conscious of the risk of the pendulum swinging too far, but in general this is a very positive step."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Janice|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-metoo-755974|title=Will innocent men become 'casualities' of #MeToo movement?|date=December 21, 2017|website=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104131421/http://www.newsweek.com/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-metoo-755974|archivedate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[Steven Thrasher]] noted that, "There has been worry that the #MeToo movement could lead to a sex panic. But the real sex panic is not due to feminism run amok, but due to the patriarchal, homophobic, transantagonistic, theocratic desire of the US Congress to control sex workers." He points to 2018 [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act]] (SESTA), which many experts say will only put sex workers at further risk by causing them to go underground, does not offer sex workers any help or protections, and as a side effect prevents most people from using online personal ads regardless of their intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/sexual-freedom-fosta-sosta|title=Sexual freedom is at risk from these damning new bills passed by Congress {{!}} Steven W Thrasher|last=Thrasher|first=Steven W.|date=March 29, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators have responded that the number of false reports is expected to be low, citing figures obtained by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and other organizations which estimate the number of [[false rape accusations]] to be around 2–10%.

Police sexual misconduct disproportionately affects women of color, though women from all walks of life are affected.&lt;ref name=":57" /&gt; The [[Cato Institute]] reported that in 2010, more than 9% of police misconduct reports in 2010 involved sexual abuse, and there are multiple indications that "sexual assault rates are significantly higher for police when compared to the general population."&lt;ref name=":56" /&gt; Fear of retribution is considered{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} one reason some law-enforcement officers are not subjected to significant consequences for known misconduct.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Police-reform activist Roger Goldman stated that an officer who is fired for sexual misconduct from one police department often gets rehired by a different department, where they can continue the misconduct in a new environment.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Some states (such as Florida and Georgia) have licensing laws that can decertify a law-enforcement officer who has committed major misconduct, which prevents decertified officers from being hired again in that state.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Some have called for sexual misconduct allegations against police to be investigated by third parties to reduce bias (as opposed to the common practice of investigations being led by fellow law-enforcement officers or colleagues in the same department).&lt;ref name=":57" /&gt;

Minority women are overrepresented in industries with the greatest number of sexual harassment claims, for example hotels, health, food services, and retail.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt; It has been pointed out that undocumented minority women often have no recourse if they're experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hollywood-having-metoo-moment-women-color-have-fought-battle-decades-n841121|title=Hollywood is having a #MeToo moment.

Former victim Farah Tanis stated there are also additional barriers for black women who want to participate in the #MeToo movement. She pointed out that there is often social pressure not to report allegations against black men, especially from church and family, because many would view that as a betrayal against their "brothers."&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Additionally, black women are less likely to be believed if they do speak out.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/black-women-metoo-antirape-movement#9|title=There Is No #MeToo Without Black Women|work=Healthline|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the American judicial system acknowledges the term "sexual harassment" only because of successful sexual harassment lawsuits by three black women: [[Diane R. Williams|Diane Williams]] and Paulette Barnes against the US government, and Mechelle Vinson against a bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=October 20, 2017|work=The Nation|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinson's case of [[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]] eventually leading to the unanimous 1986 Supreme Court decision that sexual harassment violates the [[Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt; Black law professor [[Anita Hill]] again brought sexual harassment to public discourse in 1991 with her testimony against Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/27/560231232/women-are-speaking-up-about-harassment-and-abuse-but-why-now|title=Women Are Speaking Up About Harassment And Abuse, But Why Now?|work=NPR.org|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarana Burke initially criticized the movement for ignoring the work of black women in creating dialogue addressing sexual assault. However, she did salute those who partook in the movement and credited Milano for acknowledging Burke's own similar movement.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano|title=Black woman Tarana Burke founded the 'Me Too' movement|last=Hill|first=Zahara|date=October 16, 2017|website=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=October 17, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017035553/http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano|archivedate=October 17, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, she pleaded to black women not to drop out of the movement just because the media isn't listening saying "This is your movement, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tarana-burke-tells-black-women-me-too-is-your-movement-too_us_5b967c8fe4b0162f472f65f6|title=Tarana Burke Tells Black Women Me Too Is 'Your Movement, Too'|last=Vagianos|first=Alanna|date=September 10, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American feminist and journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] said there is a blind spot surrounding [[intersectionality]] between race and gender, and a major problem with today's feminists is they are not acknowledging "that women of color in general—and especially black women—have always been more likely to be feminist than white women."&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; Steinem argues that #MeToo could never have happened without the work of these women, and women in the #MeToo movement have a responsibility: “If you have more power, remember to listen as much as you talk. And if you have less power, remember to talk as much as you listen."&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;

=== Overemphasis on specific cases ===
The #MeToo movement has been criticized for putting too much public focus on the consequences of specific individuals who have been accused of sexual misconduct, as opposed to discussing policies and changes to institutional norms that would help people who are currently experiencing sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/|title=6 Perspectives on the Future of #MeToo|last=Fonda|first=Jane|date=December 13, 2017|work=The Nation |access-date=February 1, 2018|last2=Covert|first2=Bryce|issn=0027-8378|last3=Pollitt|first3=Katha|last4=Meyerson|first4=Collier|last5=Lipsitz|first5=Raina|last6=Walsh|first6=Joan|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131001011/https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/|archivedate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's been noted that although allegations surrounding high-profile public figures tends to attract the most attention, the stories of regular workers often go unacknowledged.&lt;ref name=":65" /&gt; Yet to ensure meaningful change, these workers’ experiences must be at the center of any policy solutions that lawmakers pursue. Tarana Burke has voiced similar misgivings, pointing out one problematic aspect of #MeToo is "All of this media attention is on the perpetrator. All of the conversation about fairness and due process is focused on the perpetrator." She states the movement should focus on specific steps to help current and future sufferers.&lt;ref name=":173"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104|title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors|last=Jeffries|first=Zenobia|date=January 4, 2018|website=[[Yes!

==Financial support==
In May 2018, The New York Women's Foundation announced their Fund to Support the Me Too Movement and Allies, a $25M commitment over the next five years to provide funding and support survivors of sexual violence.[https://www.apnews.com/c07113f1a73047a589eedd1ef936fecb]

In September 2018, CBS announced that it would be donating $20 million of former Chairman Les Moonves' severance to #MeToo.  Moonves was forced to step down after numerous sexual misconduct accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tom McCarthy |title=Les Moonves resigns from CBS after six more women accuse him of sexual harassment |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/09/les-moonves-cbs-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-new-ronan-farrow-report |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=10 September 2018 |quote=Moonves and CBS will donate $20m to one or more organisations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace.

=== Afghanistan ===
The #MeToo hashtag initially spread in [[Afghanistan]] where it is estimated about 90% of women experience sexual harassment in public, at school, or at work, but was quickly silenced when those who shared their stories started fearing for their life.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/20/metoo-afghanistan-anyone-listening|title=#MeToo in Afghanistan: Is Anyone Listening?|date=December 20, 2017|publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=January 19, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224101743/https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/20/metoo-afghanistan-anyone-listening|archivedate=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":111"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://impact.vice.com/en_us/article/qvwmz5/why-the-metoo-movement-has-failed-to-take-off-in-afghanistan|title=Women in Afghanistan Want Their #MeToo Moment, But Fear Retaliation|date=January 17, 2018|website=Impact |access-date=January 19, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119150256/https://impact.vice.com/en_us/article/qvwmz5/why-the-metoo-movement-has-failed-to-take-off-in-afghanistan|archivedate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 1% of police officers or military members are women, and sexual assault is often ignored by law enforcement and the military.&lt;ref name=":211"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/asia/afghan-metoo-women-harassment.html|title=Harassment All Around, Afghan Women Weigh Risks of Speaking Out|last=Nordland|first=Rod|date=December 10, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 19, 2018|last2=Faizi|first2=Fatima|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120124044/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/asia/afghan-metoo-women-harassment.html|archivedate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape threats and other types of harassment are common on Facebook and other social media in Afghanistan. Sharing stories of sexual abuse against higher-ranking men is especially dangerous for women in the country, and may result in the killing of the victim or her family members.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; Some women are also punished or killed to by their own family for speaking out, to [[Honor killing|redeem their "honor"]] after being tarnished by rape.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; Despite the risks, some notable people such as ''Sarienews'' journalist Maryam Mehtar, and presidential advisor Shaharzad Akbar have shared their own #MeToo stories on social media. Mehtar experienced extreme abuse and several death threats for sharing her story about being sexually harassed in public on a daily basis, and was publicly called a "whore" in an interview with ''The New York Times'' by Afghan writer Jalil Junbish. He also called the NYT reporter a whore in the same interview. He later denied making the comments.&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt; Other women only share their first name or a fake name, and typically describe the story without naming the perpetrator for fear of reprisal.&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt; Sexual harassment was first defined in Afghanistan in 2016, though there has been little effort made to enforce laws against it.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Rod Nordland and Fatima Faizi of ''The New York Times'' reported that a colonel in the [[Afghan Air Force]] was secretly and clearly videotaped sexually assaulting a subordinate in November 2017, and the video quickly went viral, but despite an alleged investigation, the colonel has not been formally accused of misconduct.&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt; The Ministries of [[Ministry of Interior Affairs (Afghanistan)|Interior]] and [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Afghanistan)|Communications]] set up a phone hotline to for women to call to report sexual misconduct from law enforcement officials, but a call to the line revealed the hotline will offer advice only about phone harassment, and stated if a person harasses you in person, to "slap them".&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt;

In October 2017 reporter and journalist [[Tracey Spicer]] announced on Twitter that she was launching an investigation into reports of sexual harassment by powerful Australian men in the media in the wake of the [[Harvey Weinstein]] sexual abuse allegations and the rise in public awareness of the #MeToo movement. Earlier that same year, Spicer had released a memoir, ''The Good Girl Stripped Bare'', where she wrote about her own experiences of sexual harassment in the work place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/a37znj/tracey-spicer-to-unveil-decades-of-sexual-assault-in-australian-media|title=Tracey Spicer To Unveil Decades of Sexual Assault In Australian Media|date=2017-10-20|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;Spicer later reported that she had received responses from 470 people about people in the industry, including Australian television presenter and producer [[Don Burke]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-27/don-burke-accused-of-sexual-harassment-indecent-assault/9188070|title='He was trying to take my top off': Don Burke accused of sexual harassment|date=2017-11-27|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;The extent of the claims against Burke were published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Sydney Morning Herald in a joint investigative piece on 26 November 2017, where it was reported that "One name kept recurring – Don Burke."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/the-australian-media-industry-operates-a-protection-racket-for-men-like-don-burke-20171127-gztgu3.html|title=The Australian media industry operates a protection racket for men like Don Burke|last=Spicer|first=Tracey|date=2017-11-27|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/a-highgrade-twisted-abuser-don-burke-a-sexual-harasser-and-bully-claims-series-of-women-20171126-gzt6d2.html|title='A high-grade, twisted abuser': Don Burke a sexual harasser and bully, claims series of women|last=McClymont|first=Kate|date=2017-11-26|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;Spicer, along with Kate McClymont, Lorna Knowles and Alison Branley, won the 2018 Walkley Awards in the print/text journalism and Television/Video Current Affairs Short (less than 20 minutes) categories for their investigation and on Australia Day in 2018, Spicer was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia "for significant service to the broadcast media as a journalist and television presenter, and as an ambassador for social welfare and charitable groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walkleys.com/awards/walkleys/award-winners-2018/|title=Award Winners - The Walkley Foundation|work=The Walkley Foundation|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/26/journalist-tracey-spicer-humbled-by-australia-day-honour|title=Journalist Tracey Spicer 'humbled' by Australia Day honour|last=Davidson|first=Helen|date=2018-01-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, Spicer and Melinda Schneider launched NOW Australia, a campaign aimed at helping connect people with legal support and counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/25/tracey-spicer-launches-now-australia-campaign-as-tina-arena-joins-accusers|title=Tracey Spicer launches Now Australia campaign as Tina Arena joins accusers|last=Harmon|first=Steph|date=2018-03-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the #MeToo movement has now expanded beyond Australian media and the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] has launched an independent search into workplace sexual harassment that is the first of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-08-03/how-metoo-australian-media-has-spread-other-industries|title=How #MeToo in the Australian media has spread to other industries|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesised by ''The Age'' that Australia's strict defamation laws make it difficult for more victims to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/facing-the-particular-challenge-of-metoo-in-australia-20171215-h05ctp.html|publisher=The Age|title=Facing the particular challenge of metoo in Australia |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] has been a vocal advocate and supporter of the #MeToo movement. In a speech at the [[World Economic Forum]] in January 2018, Trudeau called for critical discussion on issues brought up by the #MeToo, [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up]], and Women's March movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/pm-keynote-remarks-for-world-economic-forum-2018/|title=Justin Trudeau's Davos address in full|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trudeau has also advocated and acted upon a high standard set for himself and members of his government. Trudeau stated that he holds a "zero tolerance for sexual assault, harassment or other forms of misconduct by his employees or caucus colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/17/change-in-canadian-society-on-sexual-harassment-not-fast-enough-trudeau-says.html|title=Change in Canadian society on sexual harassment ‘not fast enough,’ Trudeau says  {{!}} The Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] party, Trudeau initiated investigations on several members of parliament resulting in the dismissal of cabinet minister [[Kent Hehr]], the resignation of MP [[Darshan Kang]], and the suspension and later expulsion of MPs [[Scott Andrews (politician)|Scott Andrews]] and [[Massimo Pacetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-hehr-sexual-allegations-1.4510371|title=Trudeau says Liberals 'doing the best that we can' amid sexual harassment allegations {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Trudeau explained that the zero tolerance standard applied to himself as well and stated, "I've been very, very careful all my life to be thoughtful, to be respectful of people's space and people's headspace as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-careful-metoo-1.4511093|title=Trudeau says zero tolerance on misconduct toward women applies to him as well {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an editorial written in August 2000 resurfaced during his premiership regarding an alleged incident where author accused Trudeau of groping a reporter and in July 2018 Trudeau publicly rejected the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/justin-trudeau-denies-groping-reporter-music-festival-2000-british-columbia|title=Justin Trudeau 'does not remember' groping reporter at festival|author=Ashifa Kassam|date=July 2, 2018|access-date=July 3, 2018|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/02/justin-trudeau-responds-to-groping-allegations-i-dont-remember-any-negative-interactions/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.642d2f3b6f85|title=Justin Trudeau responds to groping allegations: 'I don't remember any negative interactions'|author=Rebecca Tan|date=July 2, 2018|access-date=July 3, 2018|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece stated Trudeau provided a "day-late" apology to the reporter, saying, "If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4309277/justin-trudeau-reporter-grope/|title=COMMENTARY: The facts about what Justin Trudeau can't remember|work=Global News|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6 Trudeau stated there was no need to conduct an investigation into the allegations against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cp24.com/news/don-t-investigate-groping-allegation-from-2000-trudeau-says-1.4002639|title=Don't investigate groping allegation from 2000, Trudeau says|first=Chris|last=Herhalt|date=July 6, 2018|website=Cp24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
On Chinese social networks, hashtags #WoYeShi or #metoo are sometimes used to denote the #Metoo hashtag.

In mainland China, the [[Internet censorship in China|Chinese internet censorship service]] has slowed down the Chinese MeToo posts via censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Javier C.|last1=Hernandez|first2=Zoe|last2=Mou|date=January 23, 2018|title='Me Too,' Chinese Women Say.

An article appearing on the state-run ''[[China Daily]]'' newspaper states that sexual misconduct is rare in China due to superior education and culture has caused considerable Internet outrages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/anger-as-chinese-media-claim-harassment-is-just-a-western-problem|title=Anger as Chinese media claim harassment is just a western problem|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108130241/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/anger-as-chinese-media-claim-harassment-is-just-a-western-problem|archivedate=November 8, 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 8, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study from a pair of professors from [[City University of Hong Kong]] indicated that about 80% of working women in China have experienced sexual harassment at some point in their career,&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; and there were strong reactions of anger online following the report. The article has since been taken down.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/25/china-refuses-to-admit-it-has-a-rape-problem-i-would-know/|title=China Refuses to Admit It Has a Rape Problem.

New laws recently made it illegal for television programming to contain images of a women's cleavage, sexual acts outside of marriage, or any topics that present "Western lifestyles" in a positive light. #MeToo has received extreme governmental [[censorship]] online.&lt;ref name=":302" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

Sophie Richardson, the [[Human Rights Watch]] director for China, stated the Chinese government regularly suppresses discussion of women's rights, for example an incident in 2015 where [[Li Tingting]] and four other activists were arrested when the government learned they planned to hand out stickers about preventing sexual harassment on public transportation.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

In Hong Kong, track and field athlete Vera Lui Lai-Yiu posted her case of sex abuse alongside #metoo on her Facebook fanpage on her 23rd birthday. She posted in response to a similar action by gymnast [[McKayla Maroney]]. Lui posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper with the handwritten words "#metoo lly" (her initials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/laiyiului/photos/rpp.1084620708226476/1613101928711682/?type=3&amp;theater|title=我被我的前教練性侵犯|date=November 30, 2017|website=Facebook|language=zh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206195621/https://www.facebook.com/laiyiului/photos/rpp.1084620708226476/1613101928711682/?type=3&amp;theater|archivedate=December 6, 2017|deadurl=no}}{{Primary source inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20171130/57522123|title=香港體育界驚爆性侵 「欄后」呂麗瑤生日FB勇敢指控前教練|date=November 30, 2017|website=Apple Daily Hong Kong|language=zh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032439/https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20171130/57522123|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/hong-kong-athlete-says-coach-abused-her-as-teen/article/508811|title=Hong Kong athlete says coach abused her as teen|date=November 30, 2017|website=Digital Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041229/http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/hong-kong-athlete-says-coach-abused-her-as-teen/article/508811|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2122203/coach-sexually-assaulted-her-when-she-was-13-hong-kong|title=Police to investigate after Hong Kong hurdler Vera Lui says coach sexually assaulted her when she was 13|date=November 30, 2017|website=South China Morning Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130025628/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2122203/coach-sexually-assaulted-her-when-she-was-13-hong-kong|archivedate=November 30, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=100313&amp;sid=4|title=Hurdler Vera Lui claims sexual assault by coach in teenage years|date=November 30, 2017|website=the Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041033/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=100313&amp;sid=4|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, student Zheng Xi publicly started a campaign against sexual harassment in response to #MeToo.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

Dr. Luo Xixi, an academic, revealed being sexually assaulted by a professor at [[Beihang University]] when she was in her 20s.

The people who signed the letter, especially {{lang|fr|Deneuve|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|Millet|italic=no}}, were criticized for saying men should have the "right to pester" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment|title=After the #MeToo backlash, an insider's guide to French feminism|last=Poirier|first=Agnès|date=January 14, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=January 15, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235554/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment|archivedate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also told people not to be bothered by small amounts of sexual harassment, for example men who rub against women on public transportation. The letter states women should "consider it as the expression of a great sexual misery, or even as a nonevent".&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; French politician {{lang|fr|[[Marlène Schiappa]]|italic=no}} said some aspects of the letter were "profoundly shocking" and "we have immense difficulty convincing young women that when a man rubs his genitals against a woman in the [[Paris Métro|Métro]] without her consent, it is an act of sexual assault that can lead to three years in prison and a 75,000 euro fine."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

A week after its publication, {{lang|fr|Deneuve|italic=no}} issued a letter of clarification, and said although she still agrees with the spirit of the original letter, she wants to clarify that she does believe sexual harassment and assault are real problems, and apologized to all victims of unpleasant sexual acts who read the letter and felt hurt by it.&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/catherine-deneuve-me-too.html|title=Catherine Deneuve Apologizes to Victims after Denouncing #MeToo|last=Codrea-Rado|first=Anna|year=2018|website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 15, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115143236/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/catherine-deneuve-me-too.html|archivedate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{cite web|last=Deneuve|first=Catherine |author-link=Catherine Deneuve|url=http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2018/01/14/catherine-deneuve-rien-dans-le-texte-ne-pretend-que-le-harcelement-a-du-bon-sans-quoi-je-ne-l-aurais_1622399|title=Catherine Deneuve : "Rien dans le texte ne prétend&amp;nbsp;que le harcèlement a du bon, sans quoi je ne l'aurais pas signé"|website=[[Libération]]|date=January 14, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2018|language=fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115191819/http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2018/01/14/catherine-deneuve-rien-dans-le-texte-ne-pretend-que-le-harcelement-a-du-bon-sans-quoi-je-ne-l-aurais_1622399|archivedate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentator {{lang|fr|Anastasia Colosimo|italic=no}} said the movement to prevent sexual misconduct at work is more accepted by younger women in France because they take sexual freedom as a given, while older feminists are afraid #MeToo may hurt the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=":352" /&gt; Legal professional {{lang|fr|Marilyn Baldeck|italic=no}} noted that when people are given "concrete examples" of sexual misconduct, they often "change their minds and acknowledge how harmful some situations can be".&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; French politician {{lang|fr|Sandrine Rousseau|italic=no}} said that the #MeToo movement will continue because French women have been silenced for too long.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; A petition aimed at President {{lang|fr|Emmanuel Macron|italic=no}} demanded sexual harassment to be taken more seriously in France, and received more than 100,000 signatures in 3 days.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

The List of Sexual Harassers in Academia ("[[LoSHA]]") was posted on October 24, 2017 by activist Inji Pennu and an Indian student in California named Raya Sarkar, who alleged they personally confirmed every incident.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/perpetrators-are-shamed-under-due-process-toofarooqui-tejpal-khurshid-were-all-s/303891|title='Perpetrators are shamed under due process too ...

Harimaya writes how the #MeToo movement has shown several women that they are not alone as they feared, and that many women are experiencing the same sexual violence and harassment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Keiko Kojima of Buzzfeed Japan says that #MeToo is needed in Japan because sexual harassment is baked into Japanese society, and the movement is about the fact that it is okay to say no to sexual violence. She said growing up that she felt getting molested on the train was an unavoidable as mosquito bites in the summer, and she hopes that #MeToo gives more victims the ability to find their voice, including male victims. She says that, despite how it is attacked in Japanese media, that #MeToo is not an "anti-man" campaign, it is simply about anti-violence and anti-harassment. She also believes it is extremely important for men to call out behaviors in others such as sexual harassment or having sex with someone who is unconscious. Therefore, every person who is not committing sexual violence is part of the #MeToo movement, whether they are male or female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/keikokojima/metoo-ga-kirai-na-anata|title=#MeToo が嫌いなあなたへ|last=Kojima|first=Keiko|website=BuzzFeed |access-date=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233606/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/keikokojima/metoo-ga-kirai-na-anata|archivedate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiori Ito notes that the word "rape" is [[taboo]] in Japan, and is typically described with less threatening words such as saying an underage victim was "tricked" or a woman was "violated" to describe what happened, which Ito says contributes to the public not understanding the full extent of the problem.&lt;ref name=":1522" /&gt; The legal age of consent in Japan is 13. She says women in Japan are regularly exposed to harassment from a young age, and recalls being groped by a man at a swimming pool when she was 10 only to be blamed herself for wearing a "cute bikini".

As part of the #MeToo movement, {{ill|Shiori Ito|jp|伊藤詩織}} went public alleging that she was raped by {{ill|Noriyuki Yamaguchi|jp|山口敬之}}, a prominent TV journalist and acquaintance of Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]],&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan's secret shame|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b8cfcj/japans-secret-shame|date=20 June 2018|accessdate=26 July 2018 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; an admission she says was unthinkable for a woman to do in Japan. Yamaguchi rejects her accusations, and says that sex was consensual.&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a/&gt; She said her experience with Japan's legal system showed her that victims of sex crimes were undermined and ignored. She called for the Japanese parliament to update Japan's laws regarding rape, which were over a century old. She explains how she could not get information on which hospital provides rape kits without going through a preliminary interview in person. When she went to the police, she was discouraged from filing a report, and informed her career would be ruined for no reason if she did this. She was told she did not act like a victim, and had to be interviewed by several officers, including one who made her reenact the rape with a dummy while he took pictures. Although they initially said they would arrest Yamaguchi, the case and charges were unexpectedly dropped. Ito then went to the media, but no one would take her story. When she spoke about the experience at a press conference, she made national news and immediately started receiving a negative backlash, hate mail, and threats.&lt;ref name=":1522" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/22/asia/shiori-ito-japan-metoo-intl/index.html|title=Ignored, humiliated: How Japan is accused of failing survivors of sexual abuse|author1=Anna Stewart|author2=Euan McKirdy|author3=Junko Ogura|website=Edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been unsuccessful in her attempts to have criminal charges brought against Yamaguchi, but as of 2018 she was still pursuing a civil case against him, which he was defending.&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a/&gt;

[[Nigerians|Nigerian]] women and children get sexually assaulted every day and do not speak up about it due to fear of [[stigmatisation]] and [[prejudice]].&lt;ref name=":60"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pulse.ng/gist/metro/horror-stories-of-how-these-nigerian-women-were-raped-id8066173.html|title=Horror stories of how these Nigerian women were raped|last=Akinloye|first=Dimeji|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official silence seems to surround [[sexual abuse]] of women in Nigeria, with the police frequently not taking sexual abuse reports seriously.&lt;ref name=":61"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IZUGBARA|first=C.

==== Role of power and privilege ====
There is a factor of power influencing the slow growth of the movement in Nigeria. The country is a highly patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guardian.ng/features/as-metoo-moves-across-the-world-is-nigeria-next/|title=As #MeToo moves across the world, is Nigeria next?|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have complained of how unimaginable it is in the country to report cases of harassment.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-women-sexcrimes/metoo-challenges-taboo-against-admitting-sexual-abuse-in-africa-idUSKBN1CP1CG|title=#MeToo challenges taboo against admitting sexual abuse in Africa|last=Peyton|first=Nellie|work=U.S.|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, sexual harassment is so prominent within the country that it is perceived as almost a right to men.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

====Brenda Uphopho case====
She had been assaulted three times by three different men. The first incident took place at age five. At that time, she was too young to understand what happened until she turned 18 when she encountered a similar incident again. She was at a party when a stranger forced her to have sex with him. Upon her refusal, he beat her up and raped her. Due to the stigma attached to being raped, she resorted to silence. The final experience took place at her workplace when her boss forcibly put his hand under her skirt. She still remained silent with the notion of not being believed and being judged by others. Realizing she could not remain silent and needed to make an impact, Uphopho currently works with her husband to break the "culture of silence" around abuse in Nigeria. They produced a play called "Shattered" which seeks to encourage victims of sexual abuse to speak up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/02/africa/nigeria-rape-survivors-metoo-asequals/index.html|title=The #MeToo stories you haven't heard: Meet the women speaking out in Nigeria|last=CNN|first=Stephanie Busari and Torera Idowu|work=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With hashtags such as #BoycottAliZafar, #BoycottTeefainTrouble, and #TeefaisTrouble, a huge wave of activists built a momentum on social media ahead of the movie's premiere and subsequent screenings. A few major Pakistani media outlets outright ignored the demonstrations but other had to give in when protestors turned up at cinemas and police and other law enforcement agencies got involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cutacut.com/2018/07/21/police-detain-protesters-at-ali-zafars-teefa-in-trouble-screening-in-neuplex-karachi/|title=Police detain protesters at Ali Zafar’s Teefa in Trouble screening in Nueplex Karachi|work=cutacut|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestors again showed up at Lahore’s CineStar for voice their anger and disappointment at both the promotion of the film of an alleged harasser and the celebrities pouring in to support him. The controversy deepened when, in one instance, the demonstrators asked Waleed Zaman, the creative director of women’s clothing brand Kayseria, the reason why he was backing the film, to which Zaman responded by saying: “We support sexual harassment of women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/asia/pakistan/we-support-sexual-harassment-pakistani-businessman-1.2254722|title=We support sexual harassment: Pakistani businessman|last=Editor|first=Rabab Khan, Community Interactivity|date=2018-07-21|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/22/white-lies-273/|title=White Lies|website=Pakistantoday.com.pk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At yet another screening of the film at Nueplex Cinemas at Rashid Minhas Road, Karachi, protestors were allegedly held in the basement and beaten by the cinema’s private security, with various media reports confirming the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mangobaaz.com/protesters-teefa-in-trouble-beaten-up/|title=Teefa In Trouble Protesters In Karachi Were Allegedly Beaten Up By Rangers And Pakistanis Are Furious|date=2018-07-21|work=MangoBaaz|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/271162/protests-erupt-against-ali-zafars-teefa-in-trouble/|title=Protests erupt against Ali Zafar’s ‘Teefa in Trouble’ - Daily Times|date=2018-07-22|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrators’ phones were also confiscated and the cinema's security allegedly tried to plant incriminating evidence in one of the protestors' bags in order to make their case appear stronger to police.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, they were let go later after the arrival of Rangers personnel.

==== Stand-up comedy ====
At least four women leveled allegations of sexual misconduct against Junaid Akram, a prominent stand-up comedian and vlogger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/214445|title=Stand-up comedian Junaid Akram accused of sexual assault, harassment|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the accusers were girls in their teens and early twenties. Akram, too, denied "all allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct", labeled them "false", and announced that he intended to pursue legal actions as he had "already met my legal team".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181035|title=As #MeToo picks up in Pakistan, Junaid Akram and Faisal Edhi are accused of sexual harassment|last=Staff|first=Images|date=2018-10-11|work=Images|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akram also clarified that his "marital status is public information".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1822859/4-junaid-akram-denies-claims-sexual-harassment/|title=Multiple women accuse Junaid Akram of sexual harassment {{!}} The Express Tribune|date=2018-10-11|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippines ===
The Me Too movement has slowly picked in in the Philippines. In the culture of the Philippines, shaming and victim blaming are still present. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.devex.com/news/what-metoo-has-meant-around-the-world-93871|title=What #MeToo has meant around the world|date=2018-11-26|work=Devex|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are afraid to say #MeToo because people do not believe them. Stories finally began to come about after actress [[Saab Magalona]] retweeted Alyssa Milano’s infamous quote. &lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/01/now-filipina-journalists-say-metoo/|title=Now Filipina journalists are saying #MeToo|website=asiancorrespondent.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations revolved around the entertainment industry as one of the bands, [[Jensen and The Flips|Jensen and the Flips]] was being brought up and they acknowledged their mistakes and apologized for their misconduct.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Statistics from the Philippine Commission on Women from 2004 to 2013 revealed that only 629 cases had been recorded with the Philippine national police’s Women and Children Protection Center.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This figure is believed to only be a fraction of the actual number of harassment offenses committed against women. While the movement has not been as big as in the U.S., other movements such as [[Babae Ako movement|#BabaeAko]] have started as a result of #MeToo. #BabaeAko translates to “I am Women” and began in May after President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared that the next Chief Justice of Philippines could not be a woman. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5345552/duterte-philippines-sexism-sona-women/|title=How President Duterte Sparked an Uprising of Filipina Women|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the Me Too movement started to gain momentum as public prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon shared her experience of assault by a high-level prosecutor and oppression of government authorities on national television on January 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shin|first1=Ji-min|last2=Seon|first2=Dahm-eun|title=MeToo movement having lasting impact on South Korean society after just one month|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/834264.html|accessdate=March 1, 2018|work=Hankyoreh|date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of her interview, Seo claimed that she was sexually assaulted by then Korean Ministry of Justice Policy Planning Director and former prosecutor Ahn Tae-geun at a funeral in 2010. She reported the activity to her superiors, however, her superiors covered up the incident and demoted her to Changwon Public Prosecutor's Office from her post in Seoul, in spite the fact that she was highly praised and awarded for her work performance by her superiors prior to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/31/south-korean-public-prosecutor-sparks-countrys-metoo-moment/|title=South Korean public prosecutor sparks country's #Metoo moment with allegations of groping|first=Nicola|last=Smith|date=February 28, 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Seo's public admittance of sexual assault, the Me Too movement spread quickly to other areas of society. On February 13, 2018, several women, including former actress Kim Soo-hee and actress Hong Seon-joo, accused [[Lee Yountaek]], a prominent and critically acclaimed stage director, of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Choe|first=Sang-hun|title=A Director's Apology Adds Momentum to South Korea's #MeToo Movement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/world/asia/south-korea-metoo-lee-youan-taek.html|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee allegedly forced many women in his theater troupe, for 18 years, to massage his genital area prior to raping them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Park|first1=Jin-hai|title=#MeToo is another 'candlelight protest'|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/culture/2018/02/703_244739.html|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Korea Times|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Kim Soo-hee stated that in 2005, Lee raped her and got her pregnant, for which she had an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kil|first1=Sonia|title=Korean Stage Director Lee Yoon-taek Accused of Rape|url=https://variety.com/2018/legit/asia/korea-metoo-stage-director-lee-yoon-taek-accused-of-rape-1202707408/|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Variety|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, actress Hong Seon-joo alleged that Lee forcibly penetrated her private part with sticks and wooden chopsticks, saying it will help her vocalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chun|first=Geum-joo|title=[영상] "성기에 나무젓가락 꽂아…" 손석희도 놀란 홍선주의 폭로|url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0012147853&amp;code=61121211|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Kukmin Ilbo|date=February 22, 2018|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lee resigned from all his positions in the theater world and formally apologized to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theater director Lee apologizes amid sex assault allegations|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/03/251_245760.html|accessdate=May 26, 2018|work=The Korea Times|date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park|first=Jin-hai|title=#MeToo is another 'candlelight protest'|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/culture/2018/02/703_244739.html|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Korea Times|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee admitted to all his crimes except the abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yoon|first=So-yeon|title=Theater bigwig Lee Youn-taek apologizes for sexual abuse|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3044676|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2018, [[Ko Un]], one of South Korea's most iconic and prominent poets and frequently mentioned [[Nobel laureate]] shortlist candidate, was also accused of sexual assault. First reported by the [[Dong-A Ilbo]], poet [[Choi Young-mi]]'s poem 'The Beast' suggests sexual assault by Ko approximately 20 years ago.

As a result, Ko was pulled from textbooks and critically denounced by fellow literaries alike. Ko also resigned from various posts that he held, including his professorship at [[KAIST]]. On March 2, 2018 Ko offered his statement to [[The Guardian]] through UK publishers Bloodaxe Books, writing that "he had ‘done nothing which might bring shame on my wife or myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Poet Ko Un erased from Korean textbooks after sexual harassment claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/02/ko-un-korea-sexual-harassment-claims|work=The Guardian|language=en|date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the denial, more allegations are emerging against Ko.

A series of allegations concerning the involvement of British politicians in cases of [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault|assault]] arose in October and November 2017, the [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals]]. Allegations were prompted by discussions among junior staff employed in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] at Westminster following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]] in Hollywood earlier in October, and the subsequent rise of Me Too. The journalists [[Jane Merrick]] and Kate Maltby made allegations against the Defence Minister [[Michael Fallon]] and de facto Deputy Prime Minister [[Damian Green]], respectively. These led to the departures of both from Theresa May's cabinet, the latter after a two-month inquiry that also considered allegations that Green had lied about copious amounts of pornography found on his parliamentary computer. Both Merrick and Maltby cited the #MeToo movement as inspiring their allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/britains-metoo-movement-is-uncovering-a-culture-of-rampant-sexism-and-harassment-in-londons-corridors-of-power.html|title=That Charity Dinner Was Just the Tip of the Iceberg of the British Elite's Culture of Sexism and Harassment|first=Julia|last=Rampen|website=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape statistics (2016-2017) from Rape Crisis Centers across England and Wales unfolds that every year, about 85,000 women and 12,000 men become victims of rape. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323816747_metoo_movement_An_awareness_campaign|title=(PDF) # metoo movement: An awareness campaign|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first conflict between [[Moldavia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] for which there is a historical account occurred during the reign of [[Alexandru cel Bun]], in 1420, when the Ottomans tried to capture [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]]. The attack was unsuccessful.

In 1439, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] of [[Hungary]] argued with [[Władysław II Jagiełło|King Wladislaw]] of Poland about dividing Moldavia between their two countries. Sigismund complained that the Moldavians refused to aid him in his expeditions against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], but King Wladyslaw argued that the Moldavians couldn't aid Sigismund with troops because they aided him, instead, and Sigismund had to give up on his claims.&lt;ref&gt;The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1444, Moldavia sent troops that joined King [[Władysław III of Varna]] at the [[Battle of Varna]]. The Turks had camels with them and in case of defeat, they would spill gold and silver coins on the ground in order to slacken the enemy. The Moldavians went after the camels for the money.&lt;ref&gt;The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1451 and 1457, Moldavia was in civil turmoil and under [[Petru Aron]], the principality paid the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] an annual tribute of 2,000,000 [[gold coins]]. In 1470, during the rule of [[Stephen the Great]], the relationship between Moldavia and the Porte became hostile, and resulted in several confrontations, most notable being the [[Battle of Vaslui]], where the Ottomans were heavily defeated, and the [[Battle of Valea Albă]], where [[Mehmed II]] was victorious, but was forced to retreat. In 1484, the Ottomans managed to annex Chilia and [[Akkerman]]. After 1504, Moldavia fell into decline and was forced to accept vassalage for the Porte, but conflicts continued to rage until the 19th century, giving the country brief periods of independence.

'''Restoration Day''', more commonly known as '''Oak Apple Day''' or '''Royal Oak Day''', was an English [[public holiday]], observed annually on 29 May, to commemorate the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the [[English monarchy]] in May 1660.{{sfn|Chambers|1879|pp=693–694}} In some parts of the country the day is still celebrated. It has also been known as Shick Shack Day, or Oak and Nettle Day.{{sfn|Hole|1978|pp=114–115}}

In 1660, Parliament passed into law "An Act for a Perpetual Anniversary Thanksgiving on the Nine and Twentieth Day of May", declaring 29 May a public holiday "for keeping of a perpetual Anniversary, for a Day of Thanksgiving to God, for the great Blessing and Mercy he hath been graciously pleased to vouchsafe to the People of these Kingdoms, after their manifold and grievous Sufferings, in the Restoration of his Majesty..."{{sfnm |1a1=Browning |1y=1995 |1p=54 |2a1=''House of Commons Journal'' |2y=1802 |2pp=49–50}}

The public holiday was formally abolished in the [[Anniversary Days Observance Act 1859]], but the date retains some significance in local or institutional customs. It is, for example, still observed as Founder's Day by the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], which was founded by Charles II in 1681.{{sfn|Drake-Carnell|1938|p=73}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 June 2012 |title=Old Soldiers on Parade to Honour Royal Founder |work=The Times |location=London |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==
Traditional celebrations to commemorate the event often entailed the wearing of [[oak apple]]s (a type of [[Gall|plant gall]], possibly known in some parts of the country as a "shick-shack") or sprigs of oak leaves, in reference to the occasion after the [[Battle of Worcester]] in September 1651, when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] escaped the [[Roundhead]] army by [[The Royal Oak|hiding in an oak tree]] near [[Boscobel House]].&lt;ref name="Timms"&gt;{{cite web |last=Timms |first=Elizabeth Jane |date=15 April 2016 |title=What is Oak Apple Day? |url=http://royalcentral.co.uk/historic/what-is-oak-apple-day-58464 |work=Royal Central |access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who failed to wear a sprig of oak risked being pelted with bird's eggs or thrashed with [[Urtica dioica|nettles]].{{sfnm |1a1=Hole |1y=1978 |1pp=114–115 |2a1= Vickery |2y=2010 |2pp=165–166}} In [[Sussex]], those not wearing oak were liable to be [[Pinch (action)|pinch]]ed, giving rise to the unofficial name of "Pinch-[[Wikt:bum#Noun|bum]] Day"; similarly it was known as "Bumping Day" in [[Essex]].{{sfn|Watts|2007|p=331}}

In [[Upton Grey]], Hampshire, after the church bells had been rung at 6&amp;nbsp;am the bell-ringers used to place a large branch of oak over the church porch, and another over the lych gate. Smaller branches were positioned in the gateway of every house to ensure good luck for the rest of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=29 October 2010 |title=Hampshire Treasures, Vol. 2 (Basingstoke and Deane): Upton Grey |url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/hampshiretreasures/vol02/page321.html |publisher=Hampshire County Council |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183612/http://www.hants.gov.uk/hampshiretreasures/vol02/page321.html |archive-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern events==
Events still take place at [[Upton-upon-Severn]] in Worcestershire, [[Marsh Gibbon]] in Buckinghamshire, [[Great Wishford]] in Wiltshire (when villagers gather wood in [[Grovely Wood]]), and [[Membury, Devon|Membury]] in Devon. The day is generally marked by re-enactment activities at [[Moseley Old Hall]], West Midlands, one of the houses where Charles II hid in 1651.

At [[Fownhope]] in Herefordshire the Heart of Oak Society organize an annual event, where members of the society gather at the local pub and march through the village holding flower and oak leaf decorated sticks, whilst following the society banner and a brass band. The march goes first to the church for a service, and then to houses who host refreshments. The Heart of Oak Society was previously a [[friendly society]], but had to reform in 1989 to keep the tradition going. Although Oak Apple Day celebrations have decreased in popularity and knowledge, Fownhope has managed to keep the event going, increasing in popularity and turn-out every year.

At [[All Saints' Church, Northampton]], a statue of Charles II is garlanded with oak leaves at noon every Oak Apple Day, followed by a celebration of the Holy Communion according to the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.{{sfn|Vickery|2010|p=166}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=29 May 2010 |title=Restoration of the Monarchy |url=http://www.allsaintsnorthampton.co.uk/latest_news_article17.shtml |publisher =All Saints' Church Northampton |access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oak Apple Day is also celebrated in the Cornish village of [[St Neot, Cornwall|St Neot]].{{sfn|Vickery|2010|p=166}} The vicar leads a procession through the village, he is followed by the Tower Captain holding the Oak bough. A large number of the villagers follow walking to the Church. A story of the history of the event is told and then the vicar blesses the branch. The Tower Captain throws the old branch down from the top of the tower and a new one is hauled to the top. Everyone is then invited to the vicarage gardens for refreshments and a barbecue. Up to 12 noon villagers wear a sprig of "red" (new) oak and in the afternoon wear a sprig of [[Artemisia abrotanum|"Boys Love" (''Artemisia abrotanum'')]]; tradition dictates that the punishment for not doing this results in being stung by nettles.

The '''PollyGrind Film Festival''', also known as simply '''Pollygrind''' and the '''PollyGrind Underground Film Festival''', was an annual event held in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] that specialized "in all things alternative, with a wide variety of films not shown elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/articles/50-film-festivals-worth-the-entry-fee-2014/ |title=50 Film Festivals Worth the Entry Fee, 2014 |publisher=MovieMaker |date=2014-04-22 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spotlighting short films, feature-length films, music videos and trailers of all genres, PollyGrind was founded by filmmaker and promoter Chad Clinton Freeman. The event prided itself on focusing on individuality, diversity, creativity and empowerment. Vegas Seven has said PollyGrind is a "celebration of all things, dark, bloody, underground and arthouse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vegasseven.com/latest/2012/10/18/seven-days |title=Seven Days: A curated tour of this week in your city |publisher=Vegas Seven |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The event gave a slew of awards that are quite different than most festivals. Those include The Biggest Baddest Mother of the PollyGrind, Best Use of Nudity/Sexuality, Best Use of Violence/Gore, Most Outrageous, and Most Creative. There is also a Bad Girl Award and an Ultimate Badass Award.

Started in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wixson|first=Heather|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37074/las-vegas-gearing-the-pollygrind-2010|title=Las Vegas Gearing up for The PollyGrind 2010|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2010-04-20|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; PollyGrind's first year was a five-night event "with over a dozen features, plus tons of short films, trailers and music videos; the quality ranged from borderline incompetent to undiscovered genius, virtually all within the confines of horror and sci-fi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2010/may/19/kink-n-grind/|title=Kink n’ grind|last=Bell|first=Josh|work=[[Las Vegas Weekly]]|date=2010-05-19|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrowinthehead.com declared the event a "B-movie jamboree of awesomeness" that "only Vegas has the balls to host." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Ammon |url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/index.php?id=21660|title=Pollygrind hits Vegas this May with films, shorts, and trailers that will blow your mind|work=[[Joblo]]|date=2010-04-15|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second installment of the festival included more than 100 films over a span of 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/film-events-celebrate-horror-sci-fi-131204829.html|title=Film events celebrate horror, sci-fi|last=Cling|first=Carol|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=2011-10-06|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming ranged from campy horror B-movies to extreme, underground and avant-garde films &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2011/oct/13/sadism-kitsch-pollygrind-film-fest-wrap--part-1/ |title=From sadism to kitsch: PollyGrind film fest wrap-up, Part 1 |work=[[Las Vegas Weekly]] |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Robin Leach]] featured "every night creature from hookers to zombies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/oct/06/tropic-beauty-pageant-vs-blood-nudity-and-scares-p/|title=Photos: Tropic Beauty Pageant vs. 'blood, nudity and scares' of PollyGrind Fest|last=Leach|first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Leach|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=2011-10-06|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DreadCentral.com noted that "PollyGrind has quickly made a name for itself as one of the up-and-coming premiere genre fests out there due to the success of each year of programming." &lt;ref name="dreadcentral1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wixson|first=Heather|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/48306/exclusive-second-annual-pollygrind-film-festival-announces-winners|title=Exclusive: Second Annual PollyGrind Film Festival Announces Winners|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2011-10-26|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker Adam Rehmeier, whose film ''[[The Bunny Game]]'' was banned by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] right after playing the event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/newsreleases/2011/10/the-british-board-of-film-classification-bbfc-has-rejected-the-dvd-the-bunny-game/ |title=The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has rejected the DVD THE BUNNY GAME|work=[[BBFC]]|date=2011-10-12|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the festival a display of cinema's "bastards and red-headed step children."&lt;ref name="dreadcentral1"/&gt;

''[[MovieMaker]]'' magazine named PollyGrind to its 2014 list of "50 festivals worth the entry fee"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[MovieMaker]]|title=50 Film Festivals Worth the Entry Fee, 2014|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/articles/50-film-festivals-worth-the-entry-fee-2014/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its 2012 list of "25 festivals worth the entry fee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/festivals/article/25_film_festivals_worth_the_entry_fee_2012_20120425/ |title=25 Film Festivals Worth the Entry Fee: 2012|work=[[MovieMaker]]|date=2012-04-23|accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was also named to MovieMaker's 2013 "Top 5 Coolest Experiemntal/Underground Film Festivals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/festivals/the-coolest-film-festivals-in-the-world-2013-experimentalunderground-and-outside-the-box-film-festival-winners/|title=Top 5 Coolest Experimental/Underground Film Festivals: 2013|last=Colocino|first=Lara|work=[[MovieMaker]]|date=2013-11-14|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, PollyGrind is a member of Film Exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmexchange.org/|title=Film Exchange: 2013|work=FilmExchange.org|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a multi-market screening network composed of regional U.S. and International film festivals. Select winners at PollyGrind advance to screen at the RxSM Self-Medicated Film Expo (RxSM), which takes place in [[Austin, Texas]] each year alongside [[South by Southwest]].

Starting in 2014, feature film official selections at the festival will also be looked at for distribution through its new label PollyGrind Presents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vegasseven.com/2013/10/02/pollygrind-film-festival/|title=PollyGrind Film Festival is a Bloody Labor of Love|last=Perez|first=P. J.|work=VegasSeven.com|date=2013-10-02|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while short films will be considered for special features and compilation releases through a number of outlets.

In regards to successes of the festival, filmmaker Eric Stanze noted in his 2014 [[Fearnet]] column that [[Jen Soska]] and [[Sylvia Soska]] of ''[[American Mary]]'' fame and Calvin Reeder of The Rambler and ''[[V/H/S]]'' received "major boosts in their careers when their early works won key awards at the fest." He also noted "Randy Moore’s 2013 Sundance Official Selection ''[[Escape from Tomorrow]]'' was first an Official Selection of PollyGrind in 2012."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fearnet.com/blogs/surviving-cinema/v-victory Fearnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

2014 marked the final year of the festival. While it may be resurrected in the future, as of summer 2015, it was no longer in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/75844/full-details-pollygrinds-october-30th-victory-night-event/ | publisher=Dread Central | title=Full Details on PollyGrind’s October 30th Victory Night Event | last=Moore | first=Debi | date=October 27, 2014 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319131256/http://www.pollygrind.com|url=http://www.pollygrind.com|publisher=Polly Grind Film Festival|title=Pollygrind.com|archivedate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Popular Front of Estonia''' ({{lang-et|Rahvarinne}}), introduced to the public by the Estonian politician [[Edgar Savisaar]] under the short-lived name  '''Popular Front for the Support of Perestroika''', was a political organisation in [[Estonia]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Edgar Savisaar introduced the idea of popular front during a TV show on 13 April 1988. The idea was developed through the year and finally The Estonian Popular Front was established on 1 October 1988 with a massively crowded congress which turned to a culmination of the first phase of the [[Singing Revolution]].

It was to a significant degree the precursor to the current [[Estonian Centre Party]], although with a much broader base of popularity at the beginning.

==History==
The Popular Front of Estonia was a major force in the [[Estonian independence movement]] that led to the re-establishment of the [[Republic of Estonia]] as a country independent from the [[Soviet Union]]. It was similar to the [[Popular Front of Latvia]] and the [[Sąjūdis]] movement in [[Lithuania]] and a number of Popular Fronts that were created almost simultaneously in many parts of the USSR. The Baltic States were in a unique category among the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent parts of the USSR]] in that they had been European parliamentary democracies in the [[interbellum]] and had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. The Popular Front of Estonia was founded in 1988 by [[Marju Lauristin]] and [[Edgar Savisaar]]. Savisaar initiated the founding in April 1988 in a live broadcast (''Mõtleme veel'') on Estonian TV, advocating support of Gorbachevian [[perestroika]].

Popular Front organised series of much-crowded and well-published events and actions which stressed on Estonian national pride but on  democratic values as well. Huge amount of prints and newspapers were produced to popularise PF movement. The top-leaders and sub-leaders of PF were everyday guests in every kind of media to talk about several kind of problems and ideas. Popular Front of Estonia made ideas of independent Estonia acceptable and possible for masses. The idea of independence had become a somewhat impossible and unbelievable dream for the majority of Estonians during decades under the Soviet Union.

At one point someway problematic character of Edgar Savisaar created growing opposition against PF among Estonians too.  Those people formed their own smaller organisations which grew into important element of politics of independent Estonia next decade.

The Popular Front of Estonia together with the Popular Front of Latvia and the Sąjūdis organised the [[Baltic Way]] mass "arm-in-arm" manifestation extending through three [[Baltic states]] on 23 August 1989 that marked 50th anniversary of 23 August 1939, when the Soviet Union and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which resulted in the forcible incorporation of these three states into the Soviet Union and the loss of their independence. The front was opposed by the [[Intermovement]] that represented the pro-Soviet part of Estonia's ethnic [[Russians in Estonia|Russian minority]] and other ethnic groups that had been settled in Estonia during the Soviet occupation period. The Popular Front was a supporter of [[perestroika]], while the Intermovement was seen as opposed to [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev's]] reforms. As time went by, an ever-greater chasm developed between the initial thrust of the Popular Front, leading members of which at first advocated mere autonomy within a Soviet system that Gorbachev was trying to reform in a cautious way, and the eventual context of the Estonian Popular Front, which  came to stand for true independence, an idea supported by the rank and file. Consequently, the Estonian Popular Front changed a great deal over time, until political parties came to replace such movements in Estonia during the early nineties. This rendered the Popular Front of Estonia an anachronism, and Popular Front was dissolved in 1993.

{{RMS|Titanic}} sank in the early morning of 15 April 1912 in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]], four days into the ship's [[maiden voyage]] from [[Southampton]] to [[New York City]]. The largest [[superliner (passenger ship)|passenger liner]] in service at the time, ''Titanic'' had an estimated 2,224&amp;nbsp;people on board when she struck an [[iceberg]] at around 23:40 (ship's time){{efn|name=shiptime|At the time of the collision, ''Titanic''{{'}}s clocks were set to 2 hours 2 minutes ahead of [[Eastern Time Zone]] and 2 hours 58 minutes behind [[Greenwich Mean Time]]. Ship's time had been set at midnight, April 13–14, 1912, and was based on the expected position of ''Titanic'' at local apparent noon on April 14, which in turn was based on the [[Celestial navigation|star sights]] of the evening of April 13, adjusted by [[dead reckoning]]. Due to the unfolding disaster, ''Titanic''{{'}}s clocks were not adjusted at midnight of April 14–15.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=78}} }} on Sunday, 14 April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (ship's time; 05:18 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, which made it one of the deadliest [[List of maritime disasters in the 20th century#Peacetime disasters|peacetime maritime disasters]] in history.

''Titanic'' received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her [[starboard]] side and opened five of her sixteen [[Compartment (ship)|compartments]] to the sea. ''Titanic'' had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|distress flares]] and radio ([[Wireless telegraphy|wireless]]) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. In accordance with existing practice, ''Titanic''{{'}}s lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore, with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge for many of the passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.

As a result, when ''Titanic'' sank, over a thousand passengers and crew were still on board. Almost all those who jumped or fell into the water either drowned or died within minutes due to the effects of [[cold shock]] and [[Cold incapacitation|incapacitation]]. {{RMS|Carpathia}} arrived on the scene about an hour and a half after the sinking and rescued the last of the survivors by 09:15 on 15 April, some nine and a half hours after the collision. The disaster shocked the world and caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation. Subsequent inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the establishment in 1914 of the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today.

She and her sister, {{RMS|Olympic}}, were almost one and a half times the [[gross register tonnage]] of Cunard's {{RMS|Lusitania}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}}, the previous record holders, and were nearly {{convert|100|ft|m}} longer.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=37}} ''Titanic'' could carry 3,547 people in speed and comfort,{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=10}} and was built on a hitherto unprecedented scale. Her [[reciprocating engine]]s were the largest that had ever been built, standing {{convert|40|ft|m}} high and with cylinders {{convert|9|ft|m}} in diameter requiring the burning of {{convert|600|LT|t}} of coal per day.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=10}}

Her passenger accommodation, especially the First Class section, was said to be "of unrivalled extent and magnificence",{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=16–20}} indicated by the fares that [[First class facilities of the RMS Titanic|First Class accommodation]] commanded. The Parlour Suites (the most expensive and most luxurious suites on the ship) with private [[Promenade deck|promenade]] cost over {{US$|4350|1912}}&lt;!-- previous template, till 2017-04-20 – $4,350 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4350|1912|r=-1}} today)}}{{Inflation-fn|US}} --&gt; for a one-way transatlantic passage. Even Third Class, though considerably less luxurious than Second and First Classes, was unusually comfortable by contemporary standards and was supplied with plentiful quantities of good food, providing its passengers with better conditions than many of them had experienced at home.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=16–20}}

''Titanic''{{'}}s maiden voyage began shortly after noon on 10 April 1912 when she left Southampton on the first leg of her journey to New York.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=67}} A few hours later she called at [[Cherbourg]] in northern France, a journey of {{convert|80|nmi|0}}, where she took on passengers.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=71}} Her next port of call was Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) in Ireland, which she reached around midday on 11 April.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=76}} She left in the afternoon after taking on more passengers and [[Ship's stores|stores]].{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=77}}

By the time she departed westwards across the Atlantic she was carrying 892&amp;nbsp;crew members and 1,320&amp;nbsp;passengers. This was only about half of her full passenger capacity of 2,435,{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=238}} as it was the low season and shipping from the UK had been disrupted by a [[National coal strike of 1912|coal miners' strike]].{{sfn|Lord|1987|p=83}} Her passengers were a cross-section of [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] society, from millionaires such as [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob Astor]] and [[Benjamin Guggenheim]],{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=27–28}} to poor emigrants from countries as disparate as Armenia, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Syria and Russia seeking a new life in America.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=95}}

The ship was commanded by 62-year-old Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward John Smith]], the most senior of the [[White Star Line]]'s captains. He had four decades of seafaring experience and had served as captain of {{RMS|Olympic}}, from which he was transferred to command ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=43–44}} The vast majority of the crew who served under him were not trained sailors, but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines; or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. The six watch officers and 39&amp;nbsp;[[able seamen]] constituted only around five percent of the crew,{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=238}} and most of these had been taken on at Southampton so had not had time to familiarise themselves with the ship.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=49}}

The ice conditions were attributed to a mild winter that caused large numbers of icebergs to shift off the west coast of Greenland.{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=8}}

A fire had begun in one of ''Titanic''{{'}}s [[coal bunker]]s  approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into the voyage, but it was over on 14 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanicology.com/Titanica/FireDownBelow.pdf Fire Down Below] – by Samuel Halpern. Retrieved 7 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|pp=122–26}}  The weather improved significantly during the course of the day, from brisk winds and moderate seas in the morning to a crystal-clear calm by evening, as the ship's path took it beneath an arctic [[high-pressure area|high pressure system]].{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=80}}

The waning crescent moon had set a few seconds after 15:00 on 14 April and would not rise again until 04:37 (ship's time) on 15 April, shortly after the arrival of the ''Carpathia''.

=== Iceberg warnings (09:00–23:39) ===
[[File:Titanic iceberg.jpg|thumb|The iceberg thought to have been hit by ''Titanic'', photographed by the chief steward of the liner {{SS|Prinz Adalbert||2}} on the morning of 15 April 1912. The iceberg was reported to have a streak of red paint from a ship's hull along its waterline on one side.|alt=Black and white photograph of a large iceberg with three "peaks".]]

On 14 April 1912, ''Titanic''{{'}}s [[telegraphist|radio operators]]{{efn|name=wireless|Radio telegraphy was known as [[Wireless telegraphy|"wireless"]] in the British English of the period.}} received six messages from other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on ''Titanic'' had begun to notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50&amp;nbsp;years (which was the reason why the lookouts were unaware that they were about to steam into a line of drifting ice several miles wide and many miles long).{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=199}} Not all of these messages were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the [[Marconi Company|Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company]] and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers, with weather reports as a secondary concern.

The first warning came at 09:00 from {{RMS|Caronia|1905|6}} reporting "bergs, growlers{{efn|name=growler|{{Wiktionary-inline|growler}}: &amp;nbsp;"A small iceberg or ice floe which is barely visible over the surface of the water."}} and field ice".{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=9}} Captain Smith acknowledged receipt of the message. At 13:42, {{RMS|Baltic|1903|6}} relayed a report from the Greek ship ''Athenia'' that she had been "passing icebergs and large quantities of field ice".{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=9}} This too was acknowledged by Smith, who showed the report to [[J. Bruce Ismay]], the chairman of the White Star Line, aboard ''Titanic'' for her maiden voyage.{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=9}} Smith ordered a new course to be set, to take the ship farther south.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=191}}

At 13:45, the German ship [[USS America (ID-3006)|SS ''Amerika'']], which was a short distance to the south, reported she had "passed two large icebergs".{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=10}} This message never reached Captain Smith or the other officers on ''Titanic''{{'}}s [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. The reason is unclear, but it may have been forgotten because the radio operators had to fix faulty equipment.{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=10}}

{{SS|Californian}} reported "three large bergs" at 19:30, and at 21:40, the steamer ''Mesaba'' reported: "Saw much heavy [[Sea ice|pack ice]] and great number large icebergs. Also field ice."{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=11}} This message, too, never left the ''Titanic''{{'}}s radio room. The radio operator, [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]], may have failed to grasp its significance because he was preoccupied with transmitting messages for passengers via the relay station at [[Cape Race]], Newfoundland; the radio set had broken down the day before, resulting in a backlog of messages that the two operators were trying to clear.{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=10}} A final warning was received at 22:30 from operator [[Cyril Furmstone Evans|Cyril Evans]] of ''Californian'', which had halted for the night in an ice field some miles away, but Phillips cut it off and signalled back: "Shut up! Shut up! I'm working Cape Race."{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=11}}

Although the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they did not reduce the ship's speed, and continued to steam at {{convert|22|knots}}, only {{convert|2|knots}} short of her maximum speed of {{convert|24|knots}}.{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=10}}{{efn|Despite later myth, featured for example in the [[Titanic (1997 film)|1997 film ''Titanic'']], the ship ''Titanic'' was not attempting to set a transatlantic speed record; the White Star Line had made a conscious decision not to compete with their rivals [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] on speed, but instead to focus on size and luxury.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=24}} }} ''Titanic''{{'}}s high speed in waters where ice had been reported was later criticised as reckless, but it reflected standard maritime practice at the time. According to Fifth Officer [[Harold Lowe]], the custom was "to go ahead and depend upon the lookouts in the [[crow's nest]] and the watch on the bridge to pick up the ice in time to avoid hitting it".{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=278}}

The North Atlantic liners prioritised time-keeping above all other considerations, sticking rigidly to a schedule that would guarantee their arrival at an advertised time. They were frequently driven at close to their full speed, treating hazard warnings as advisories rather than calls to action. It was widely believed that ice posed little risk; close calls were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, {{SS|Kronprinz Wilhelm}}, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but was still able to complete her voyage. That same year, ''Titanic''{{'}}s future captain, Edward Smith, declared in an interview that he could not "imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that."{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=13}}

=== "Iceberg right ahead!" (23:39) ===

==== ''Titanic'' enters Iceberg Alley ====
{{details|topic=the missing binoculars|David Blair (mariner)}}
As ''Titanic'' approached her fatal collision, most passengers had gone to bed and command of the bridge had passed from [[Second Officer (nautical)|Second Officer]] [[Charles Lightoller]] to [[Chief mate|First Officer]] [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]]. Lookouts [[Frederick Fleet]] and [[Reginald Lee]] were occupying the crow's nest, {{convert|29|m}} above the deck. The air temperature had fallen to near freezing, and the ocean was completely calm. Colonel [[Archibald Gracie IV|Archibald Gracie]], one of the survivors of the disaster, later wrote that "the sea was like glass, so smooth that the stars were clearly reflected."{{sfn|Gracie|1913|p=247}} It is now known that such exceptionally calm water is a sign of nearby pack ice.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=85}}

Although the air was clear, there was [[new moon|no moon]], and with the sea so calm, there was nothing to give away the position of the nearby icebergs; had the sea been rougher, waves breaking against the icebergs would have made them more visible.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1987|p=19}} Because of a mix-up at Southampton the lookouts had no binoculars; but reportedly binoculars would not have been effective in darkness which was total except for starlight and the ship's own lights.{{sfn|Brown|2000|p=47}} The lookouts were nonetheless well aware of the ice hazard, as Lightoller had ordered them and other crew members to "keep a sharp look-out for ice, particularly small ice and growlers".{{efn|name=growler}}{{sfn|Barratt|2010|p=122}}

At 23:30, Fleet and Lee noticed a slight haze on the horizon ahead of them, but did not make anything of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when ''Titanic'' entered [[Atlantic Marine Ecozone (CEC)|Iceberg Alley]]. This would have resulted in a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/science/a-new-look-at-natures-role-in-the-titanics-sinking.html |title=A New Look at Nature’s Role in the Titanic’s Sinking |first=William J. |last=Broad |date=9 April 2012 |work=The New York Times |access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center"&gt;{{cite web |title=Where Is Iceberg Alley |website=U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center |url=https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=iipWhereIsIcebergAlley |access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collision====
Nine minutes later, at 23:39, Fleet spotted an iceberg in ''Titanic''{{'}}s path. He rang the lookout bell three times and telephoned the bridge to inform Sixth Officer [[James Paul Moody|James Moody]]. Fleet asked "Is there anyone there?" Moody replied, "Yes, what do you see?" Fleet replied: "Iceberg, right ahead!"{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=2}} After thanking Fleet, Moody relayed the message to Murdoch, who ordered Quartermaster [[Robert Hichens (RMS Titanic)|Robert Hichens]] to change the ship's course.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=137}} Murdoch is generally believed to have given the order "Hard astarboard" which would result in the ship's [[tiller]] being moved all the way to [[starboard]] (the right side of the ship) in an attempt to turn the ship to [[port (nautical)|port]] (left).{{sfn|Brown|2000|p=47}} He also rang "Full Astern" on the [[Engine order telegraph|ship's telegraphs]].{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=191}}

According to Fourth Officer [[Joseph Boxhall]], Murdoch told Captain Smith that he was attempting to "hard-a-port around [the iceberg]", suggesting that he was attempting a "port around" manoeuvre&amp;nbsp;– to first swing the bow around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that both ends of the ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered steering mechanism took up to 30&amp;nbsp;seconds to turn the ship's tiller,{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=191}} and the complex task of setting the engines into reverse would also have taken some time to accomplish.{{sfn|Brown|2000|p=67}} Because the centre turbine could not be reversed, both it and the centre propeller, positioned directly in front of the ship's rudder, were stopped. This reduced the rudder's effectiveness, therefore impairing the turning ability of the ship. Had Murdoch turned the ship while maintaining her forward speed, ''Titanic'' might have missed the iceberg with feet to spare.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=194}}

In 2010, [[Louise Patten]] asserted that her grandfather Charles Lightoller claimed that the helmsman Robert Hichens initially panicked and turned the rudder in the wrong direction and that subsequently Bruce Ismay ordered the boat to continue "Slow Ahead" in the belief that ''Titanic'' was unsinkable. This, allegedly, had never been revealed because of the insurance implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The truth about the sinking of the Titanic|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8016751/The-truth-about-the-sinking-of-the-Titanic.html|first=Stanford|last=Peter|date=21 September 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=4 July 2016}} In a review of {{cite book|last=Patten|first=Louise|title=Good as Gold|year=2010|publisher=Quercus Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Titanic porting around English.svg|center|500px|thumb|Diagram of ''Titanic''{{'}}s course at the time of the collision with the iceberg.&lt;br /&gt;(Blue: path of bow. Red: path of stern.)]]

In the event, ''Titanic''{{'}}s heading changed just in time to avoid a head-on collision, but the change in direction caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=100}} About five minutes after the collision, all of ''Titanic''{{'}}s engines were stopped, leaving the bow of the ship facing north and slowly drifting south in the [[Labrador Current]].{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=94}}

==== Effects of the collision ====
[[File:Iceberg and titanic (en).svg|thumb|The iceberg buckled the plates, popping rivets and damaging a sequence of compartments. Contrary to widespread assumption, the iceberg did not slice the hull.|alt=Diagram showing how the iceberg buckled ''Titanic''{{'}}s hull, causing the riveted plates to come apart.]]
The impact with the iceberg was long thought to have produced a huge opening in ''Titanic''{{'}}s hull, "not less than {{convert|300|ft}} in length, {{convert|10|ft}} above the level of the keel", as one writer later put it.{{sfn|Hoffman|Grimm|1982|p=20}} At the British inquiry following the accident, Edward Wilding (chief naval architect for Harland and Wolff), calculating on the basis of the observed flooding of forward compartments forty minutes after the collision, testified that the area of the hull opened to the sea was "somewhere about 12 square feet".&lt;ref name=wilding&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq19Wilding03.php|title=Testimony of Edward Wilding|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "I believe it must have been in places, not a continuous rip", but that the different openings must have extended along an area of around 300 feet, to account for the flooding in several compartments.&lt;ref name=wilding /&gt; The findings of the inquiry state that the damage extended about 300 feet, and hence many subsequent writers followed this statement. Modern [[ultrasound]] surveys of [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|the wreck]] have found that the damage consisted of six narrow openings in an area of the hull covering only about {{convert|12|to|13|sqft|m2|1}} in total. According to Paul K. Matthias, who made the measurements, the damage consisted of a "series of deformations in the starboard side that start and stop along the hull&amp;nbsp;... about {{convert|10|ft|m|disp=x| [|]}} above the bottom of the ship".{{sfn|Broad|1997}}

The gaps, the longest of which measures about {{convert|39|ft}} long, appear to have followed the line of the hull plates. This suggests that the iron rivets along the plate seams snapped off or popped open to create narrow gaps through which water flooded. An engineer from ''Titanic''{{'}}s builders, [[Harland and Wolff]], suggested this scenario at [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry]] following the disaster but his view was discounted.{{sfn|Broad|1997}} ''Titanic''{{'}}s discoverer [[Robert Ballard]] has commented that the assumption that the ship had suffered a major breach was "a by-product of the mystique of the ''Titanic''. No one could believe that the great ship was sunk by a little sliver."{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=25}} Faults in the ship's hull may have been a contributing factor. Recovered pieces of ''Titanic''{{'}}s hull plates appear to have shattered on impact with the iceberg, without bending.{{sfn|Zumdahl|Zumdahl|2008|p=457}}

The plates in the central 60% of the hull were held together with triple rows of [[mild steel]] [[rivet]]s, but the plates in the bow and stern were held together with double rows of [[wrought iron]] rivets which were&amp;nbsp;– according to materials scientists [[Tim Foecke]] and [[Jennifer McCarty]]&amp;nbsp;– near their [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] limits even before the collision.{{sfn|''Materials Today'', 2008}}{{sfn|McCarty|Foecke|2012|p=83}} These "Best" or No. 3 iron rivets had a high level of slag inclusions, making them more brittle than the more usual "Best-Best" No. 4 iron rivets, and more prone to snapping when put under stress, particularly in extreme cold.{{sfn|Broad|2008}}{{sfn|Verhoeven|2007|p=49}} But Tom McCluskie, a retired archivist of Harland &amp; Wolff, pointed out that ''[[RMS Olympic|Olympic]]'', ''Titanic''{{'}}s sister ship, was riveted with the same iron and served without incident for nearly 25 years, surviving several major collisions, including being rammed by a British [[cruiser]].{{sfn|Ewers|2008}} When ''Olympic'' rammed and sank the [[U-boat]] {{ship|SM|U-103||2}} with her bow, the stem was twisted and hull plates on the starboard side were buckled without impairing the hull's integrity.{{sfn|Ewers|2008}}{{sfn|Mills|1993|p=46}}

Above the waterline, there was little evidence of the collision. The stewards in the first class dining room noticed a shudder, which they thought might have been caused by the ship shedding a propeller blade. Many of the passengers felt a bump or shudder –  "just as though we went over about a thousand marbles",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq12White01.php|title=Testimony of Mrs J Stuart White at the US Inquiry|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one survivor put it – but did not know what had happened.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=67–69}} Those on the lowest decks, nearest the site of the collision, felt it much more directly. Engine Oiler Walter Hurst recalled being "awakened by a grinding crash along the starboard side. No one was very much alarmed but knew we had struck something".{{sfn|Barratt|2010|p=151}} [[Fireman (steam engine)|Fireman]] George Kemish heard a "heavy thud and grinding tearing sound" from the starboard hull.{{sfn|Barratt|2010|p=156}}

The ship began to flood immediately, with water pouring in at an estimated rate of {{convert|7|LT|t|lk=in}} per second, fifteen times faster than it could be pumped out.{{sfn|Aldridge|2008|p=86}} Second Engineer J. H. Hesketh and Leading Stoker Frederick Barrett were both struck by a jet of icy water in No.&amp;nbsp;6 boiler room and escaped just before the room's watertight door closed.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=71}} This was an extremely dangerous situation for the engineering staff; the boilers were still full of hot high-pressure steam and there was a substantial risk that they would explode if they came into contact with the cold seawater flooding the boiler rooms. The stokers and firemen were ordered to reduce the fires and vent the boilers, sending great quantities of steam up the funnel venting pipes. They were waist-deep in freezing water by the time they finished their work.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=18}}

[[File:Titanic side plan annotated English.png|center|thumb|700px|Annotated diagram of RMS ''Titanic'' showing the arrangement of the bulkheads. The areas of damage are shown in green. The compartments in the engineering area at the bottom of the ship are noted in blue. The scale's smallest unit is {{convert|10|ft|m}} and its total length is {{convert|400|ft|m}}.|alt=A line diagram showing Titanic from the side.]]

''Titanic''{{'}}s lower decks were divided into sixteen [[Compartment (ship)|compartments]]. Each compartment was separated from its neighbour by a bulkhead running the width of the ship; there were fifteen bulkheads in all. Each bulkhead extended at least to the underside of E Deck, nominally one deck, or about {{convert|11|ft|m}}, above the waterline. The two nearest the bow and the six nearest the stern went one deck further up.{{sfn|Mersey|1912}}

Each bulkhead could be sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler rooms on the tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.{{sfn|Mersey|1912}}

Although the watertight bulkheads extended well above the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling across the top of an ice cube tray. This was what happened to ''Titanic'', which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.&amp;nbsp;6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. ''Titanic'' was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.{{sfn|Mersey|1912}}{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=22}}

[[File:Titanic-sinking-animation.gif|thumb|300px|Animation showing the sequence of ''Titanic''{{'}}s sinking, from 23:50 April 14 to 02:20 April 15]]
Captain Smith felt the collision in his cabin and immediately came to the bridge. Informed of the situation, he summoned [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], ''Titanic''{{'}}s builder, who was among a party of engineers from Harland and Wolff observing the ship's first passenger voyage.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=147}} The ship was listing five degrees to starboard and was two degrees down by the head within a few minutes of the collision.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=71}} Smith and Andrews went below and found that the forward cargo holds, the mail room and the squash court were flooded, while No.&amp;nbsp;6 boiler room was already filled to a depth of {{convert|14|ft}}. Water was spilling over into No.&amp;nbsp;5 boiler room,{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=71}} and crewmen there were battling to pump it out.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=72}}

Within 45 minutes of the collision, at least {{convert|13500|LT|t}} of water had entered the ship. This was far too much for ''Titanic''{{'}}s ballast and bilge pumps to handle; the total pumping capacity of all the pumps combined was only {{convert|1700|LT|t}} per hour.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=112}} Andrews informed the captain that the first five compartments were flooded, and therefore ''Titanic'' was doomed.  By his estimate, she could remain afloat for no longer than about two hours.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=148}}

From the time of the collision to the moment of her sinking, at least {{convert|35000|LT|t}} of water flooded into ''Titanic'', causing her [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] &lt;!-- This term has been established as correct. Please discuss on Talk Page before changing. --&gt;to nearly double from {{convert|48300|LT|t}} to over {{convert|83000|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=106}} The flooding did not proceed at a constant pace, nor was it distributed evenly throughout the ship, due to the configuration of the flooded compartments. Her initial list to starboard was caused by asymmetrical flooding of the starboard side as water poured down a passageway at the bottom of the ship.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=116}} When the passageway was fully flooded, the list corrected itself but the ship later began to list to port by up to ten degrees as that side also flooded asymmetrically.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=118}}

''Titanic''{{'}}s down angle altered fairly rapidly from zero degrees to about four and a half degrees during the first hour after the collision, but the rate at which the ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, worsening only to about five degrees.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=109}} This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay afloat long enough for them to be rescued. By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until ''Titanic'' reached a down angle of about ten degrees.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=118}} At about 02:15, ''Titanic''{{'}}s angle in the water began to increase rapidly as water poured into previously unflooded parts of the ship through deck hatches, disappearing from view at 02:20.{{sfn|Barratt|2010|p=131}}

At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith ordered the ship's lifeboats uncovered and the passengers [[Muster drill|mustered]].{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=22}} He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship on the west side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about {{convert|13.5|nmi|mi km}}.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=199}}{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=120}} Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000&amp;nbsp;items of mail being carried aboard ''Titanic''. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=118–19}} Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew&amp;nbsp;– ''Titanic'' did not have a public address system&amp;nbsp;– and told them to go to the Boat Deck.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=20}}

The thoroughness of the muster was heavily dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards were in charge of only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second- and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people. The first-class stewards provided hands-on assistance, helping their charges to get dressed and bringing them out onto the deck. With far more people to deal with, the second- and third-class stewards mostly confined their efforts to throwing open doors and telling passengers to put on lifebelts and come up top. In third class, passengers were largely left to their own devices after being informed of the need to come on deck.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=121}} Many passengers and crew were reluctant to comply, either refusing to believe that there was a problem or preferring the warmth of the ship's interior to the bitterly cold night air. The passengers were not told that the ship was sinking, though a few noticed that she was [[list (watercraft)|listing]].{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=20}}

Around 00:15, the stewards began ordering the passengers to put on their lifebelts,{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=126}} though again, many passengers took the order as a joke.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=20}} Some set about playing an impromptu game of [[association football]] with the ice chunks that were now strewn across the foredeck.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=116}}

On the boat deck, as the crew began preparing the lifeboats, it was difficult to hear anything over the noise of high-pressure steam being vented from the boilers and escaping via the valves on the funnels above. [[Lawrence Beesley]] described the sound as "a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives blowing off steam in a low key it would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck."{{sfn|Beesley|1960|pp=32–33}} The noise was so loud that the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=124}}

''Titanic'' had a total of 20 lifeboats, comprising 16&amp;nbsp;wooden boats on [[davit]]s, 8 on either side of the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=20}} The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching.{{sfn|Lord|1987|p=90}} Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=21}} The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=123}} On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178&amp;nbsp;– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. ''Titanic'' had been designed to accommodate up to 68&amp;nbsp;lifeboats{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=112}}&amp;nbsp;– enough for everyone on board&amp;nbsp;– and the price of an extra 32&amp;nbsp;lifeboats would only have been some {{US$|16000|1912}}, a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on ''Titanic''. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=116}}{{efn|An incident confirmed this philosophy while ''Titanic'' was under construction: the White Star liner ''Republic'' was involved in a collision and sank. Even though she did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers, they were all saved because the ship was able to stay afloat long enough for them to be ferried to ships coming to assist.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=29}}}} It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39&amp;nbsp;British liners of the time of over {{convert|10000|LT|t}}, 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=30}} The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.{{sfn|Marshall|1912|p=141}}

Captain Smith was an experienced seaman who had served for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first crisis of his career, and he would have known that even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=22}} As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer [[Joseph Boxhall]] did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down,{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=250–52}} while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=106}} Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=250–52}}{{sfn|Cox|1999|pp=50–52}}

The crew was likewise unprepared for the emergency, as lifeboat training had been minimal. Only one [[Muster drill|lifeboat drill]] had been conducted while the ship was docked at Southampton. It was a cursory effort, consisting of two boats being lowered, each manned by one officer and four men who merely rowed around the dock for a few minutes before returning to the ship. The boats were supposed to be stocked with emergency supplies, but ''Titanic''{{'}}s passengers later found that they had only been partially provisioned despite the efforts of the ship's chief baker, [[Charles Joughin]], and his staff to do so.{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=279}} No lifeboat or fire drills had been conducted since ''Titanic'' left Southampton.{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=279}} A lifeboat drill had been scheduled for the Sunday morning before the ship sank, but was cancelled for unknown reasons by Captain Smith.{{sfn|Aldridge|2008|p=47}}

Lists had been posted on the ship assigning crew members to specific lifeboat stations, but few appeared to have read them or to have known what they were supposed to do. Most of the crew were not seamen, and even some of those had no prior experience of rowing a boat. They were now faced with the complex task of coordinating the lowering of 20&amp;nbsp;boats carrying a possible total of 1,100&amp;nbsp;people {{convert|70|ft|m}} down the sides of the ship.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=123}} Thomas E. Bonsall, a historian of the disaster, has commented that the evacuation was so badly organised that "even if they had the number [of] lifeboats they needed, it is impossible to see how they could have launched them" given the lack of time and poor leadership.{{sfn|Cox|1999|p=52}}

By about 00:20, 40&amp;nbsp;minutes after the collision, the loading of the lifeboats was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith standing near the bridge looking out at the ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, "I yelled at the top of my voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply."{{sfn|Gleicher|2006|p=65}} Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to "put the women and children in and lower away".{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=37}} Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the "women and children" evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean [[women and children first]], while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=21}} Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=21}} Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=124}}{{sfn|Cox|1999|p=52}}

Few passengers at first were willing to board the lifeboats and the officers in charge of the evacuation found it difficult to persuade them. The millionaire [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob Astor]] declared: "We are safer here than in that little boat."{{sfn|Lord|1976|pp=73–74}} Some passengers refused flatly to embark. J. Bruce Ismay, realising the urgency of the situation, roamed the starboard boat deck urging passengers and crew to board the boats. A trickle of women, couples and single men were persuaded to board starboard lifeboat No.&amp;nbsp;7, which became the first lifeboat to be lowered.{{sfn|Lord|1976|pp=73–74}}

=== Departure of the lifeboats (00:45–02:05) ===
{{further|Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic}}

[[File:The Sad Parting - no caption.jpg|thumb|upright|''"The Sad Parting"'', illustration of 1912|alt=Illustration of a weeping woman being comforted by a man on the sloping deck of a ship. In the background men are loading other women into a lifeboat.]]
At 00:45, lifeboat No. 7 was rowed away from ''Titanic'' with 28&amp;nbsp;passengers on board (despite a capacity of 65). Lifeboat No. 6, on the port side, was the next to be lowered at 00:55. It also had 28 people on board, among them the "unsinkable" [[Margaret Brown|Margaret "Molly" Brown]]. Lightoller realised there was only one seaman on board (Quartermaster Robert Hichens) and called for volunteers. Major [[Arthur Godfrey Peuchen]] of the [[Royal Canadian Yacht Club]] stepped forward and climbed down a rope into the lifeboat; he was the only adult male passenger whom Lightoller allowed to board during the port side evacuation.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=87}} Peuchen's role highlighted a key problem during the evacuation: there were hardly any seamen to man the boats. Some had been sent below to open gangway doors to allow more passengers to be evacuated, but they never returned. They were presumably trapped and drowned by the rising water below decks.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=150}}

Meanwhile, other crewmen fought to maintain vital services as water continued to pour into the ship below decks. The engineers and firemen worked to vent steam from the boilers to prevent them from exploding on contact with the cold water. They re-opened watertight doors in order to set up extra portable pumps in the forward compartments in a futile bid to reduce the torrent, and kept the electrical generators running to maintain lights and power throughout the ship. Steward F. Dent Ray narrowly avoided being swept away when a wooden wall between his quarters and the third-class accommodation on E deck collapsed, leaving him waist-deep in water.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=78}} Two engineers, Herbert Harvey and Jonathan Shepherd (who had just broken his left leg after falling into a manhole minutes earlier), died in boiler room No.&amp;nbsp;5 when, at around 00:45, the bunker door separating it from the flooded No.&amp;nbsp;6 boiler room collapsed and they were swept away by "a wave of green foam" according to leading fireman Frederick Barrett, who barely escaped from the boiler room.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=126}}

In boiler room No.&amp;nbsp;4, at around 01:20, water began flooding in from below, possibly indicating that the bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=76}} Further [[aft]], Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.&amp;nbsp;1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators in order to keep the ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=25}} They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that ''Titanic''{{'}}s electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=226}} Neither did any of the ''Titanic''{{'}}s five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=225}}

Many of the third-class passengers were also confronted with the sight of water pouring into their quarters on E, F and G decks. Carl Jansson, one of the relatively small number of third-class survivors, later recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then I run down to my cabin to bring my other clothes, watch and bag but only had time to take the watch and coat when water with enormous force came into the cabin and I had to rush up to the deck again where I found my friends standing with lifebelts on and with terror painted on their faces. What should I do now, with no lifebelt and no shoes and no cap?{{sfn|Gleicher|2006|p=40}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The lifeboats were lowered every few minutes on each side, but most of the boats were greatly under-filled. No.&amp;nbsp;5 left with 41 aboard, No.&amp;nbsp;3 had 32 aboard, No.&amp;nbsp;8 left with 39{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=24}} and No.&amp;nbsp;1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=24}} The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.&amp;nbsp;10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=90}} First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.&amp;nbsp;5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=147}}{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=150}} The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.&amp;nbsp;6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=24}}{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=145}} No.&amp;nbsp;3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=152}}

{{listen |filename=RMS Titanic distress signal simulated as morse code.wav |title=Distress signal |description=Simulated RMS ''Titanic'' distress signal, in Morse code. "SOS SOS CQD CQD - MGY WE ARE SINKING FAST PASSENGERS BEING PUT INTO BOATS - MGY"}}
By 01:20, the seriousness of the situation was now apparent to the passengers above decks, who began saying their goodbyes, with husbands escorting their wives and children to the lifeboats. [[Distress rocket|Distress flares]] were fired every few minutes to attract the attention of any ships nearby and the radio operators repeatedly sent the [[distress signal]] [[CQD]]. Radio operator [[Harold Bride]] suggested to his colleague Jack Phillips that he should use the new [[SOS]] signal, as it "may be your last chance to send it". The two radio operators contacted other ships to ask for assistance. Several responded, of which RMS ''Carpathia'' was the closest, at {{convert|58|mi}} away.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=98}} She was a much slower vessel than ''Titanic'' and, even driven at her maximum speed of {{convert|17|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=on}}, would have taken four hours to reach the sinking ship.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=113}} Another to respond was SS ''Mount Temple'', which set a course and headed for ''Titanic'''s position but was stopped en-route by pack ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq09Moore01.php|title=Testimony of Henry James Moore at the US Inquiry|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much nearer was {{SS|Californian}}, which had warned ''Titanic'' of ice a few hours earlier. Apprehensive at his ship being caught in a large field of drift ice,  ''Californian''{{'}}s captain, [[Stanley Lord]], had decided at about 22:00 to halt for the night and wait for daylight to find a way through the ice field.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=159}} At 23:30, 10&amp;nbsp;minutes before ''Titanic'' hit the iceberg, ''Californian''{{'}}s sole radio operator, [[Cyril Furmstone Evans|Cyril Evans]], shut his set down for the night and went to bed.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=161}} On the bridge her Third Officer, Charles Groves, saw a large vessel to starboard around {{convert|10|to|12|mi|abbr=on}} away. It made a sudden turn to port and stopped. If the radio operator of ''Californian'' had stayed at his post fifteen minutes longer, hundreds of lives might have been saved.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=160}} A little over an hour later, Second Officer Herbert Stone saw five white rockets exploding above the stopped ship. Unsure what the rockets meant, he called Captain Lord, who was resting in the chartroom, and reported the sighting.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=162}} Lord did not act on the report, but Stone was perturbed: "A ship is not going to fire rockets at sea for nothing," he told a colleague.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=163}}

[[File:Titanic signal.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Distress signal sent at about 01:40 by ''Titanic''{{'}}s radio operator, Jack Phillips, to the [[Russian American Line|Russian]] ship SS ''Birma''. This was one of ''Titanic''{{'}}s last intelligible radio messages.|alt=Image of a distress signal reading: "SOS SOS CQD CQD. MGY [Titanic]. We are sinking fast passengers being put into boats. MGY"]]

By this time, it was clear to those on ''Titanic'' that the ship was indeed sinking and there would not be enough lifeboat places for everyone. Some still clung to the hope that the worst would not happen: Lucien Smith told his wife Eloise, "It is only a matter of form to have women and children first. The ship is thoroughly equipped and everyone on her will be saved."{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=84}} Charlotte Collyer's husband Harvey called to his wife as she was put in a lifeboat, "Go, Lottie! For God's sake, be brave and go! I'll get a seat in another boat!"{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=84}}

Other couples refused to be separated. [[Ida Straus]], the wife of [[Macy's]] [[department store]] co-owner and former [[United States House of Representatives|member of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Isidor Straus]], told her husband: "We have been living together for many years. Where you go, I go."{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=84}} They sat down in a pair of deck chairs and waited for the end.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=85}} The industrialist [[Benjamin Guggenheim]] changed out of his life vest and sweater into top hat and evening dress and declared his wish to go down with the ship like a gentleman.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=25}}

At this point, the vast majority of passengers who had boarded lifeboats were from first- and second-class. Few third-class (steerage) passengers had made it up onto the deck, and most were still lost in the maze of corridors or trapped behind barriers and partitions that segregated the accommodation for the steerage passengers from the first- and second-class areas.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=284}} This segregation was not simply for social reasons, but was a requirement of United States immigration laws, which mandated that third-class passengers be segregated to control immigration and to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. First- and second-class passengers on transatlantic liners disembarked at the main piers on [[Manhattan Island]], but steerage passengers had to go through health checks and processing at [[Ellis Island]].{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=96}} In at least some places, ''Titanic''{{'}}s crew appear to have actively hindered the steerage passengers' escape. Some of the barriers were locked and guarded by crew members, apparently to prevent the steerage passengers from rushing the lifeboats.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=284}} Irish survivor Margaret Murphy wrote in May 1912:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before all the steerage passengers had even a chance of their lives, the ''Titanic''{{'}}s sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section&amp;nbsp;... A crowd of men was trying to get up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=284}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A long and winding route had to be taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the farthest away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=95}} Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.{{sfn|Lord|1976|pp=91–95}}

Some, perhaps overwhelmed by it all, made no attempt to escape and stayed in their cabins or congregated in prayer in the third-class dining room.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=97}} Leading Fireman Charles Hendrickson saw crowds of third-class passengers below decks with their trunks and possessions, as if waiting for someone to direct them.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=131}} Psychologist Wynn Craig Wade attributes this to "stoic passivity" produced by generations of being told what to do by social superiors.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=225}} August Wennerström, one of the male steerage passengers to survive, commented later that many of his companions had made no effort to save themselves. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hundreds were in a circle [in the third-class dining saloon] with a preacher in the middle, praying, crying, asking God and Mary to help them. They lay there and yelled, never lifting a hand to help themselves. They had lost their own will power and expected God to do all the work for them.{{sfn|Gittins|Akers-Jordan|Behe|2011|p=167}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Launching of the last lifeboats (01:30–02:05) ====
[[File:Leaving the sinking liner.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lifeboat No. 15 was nearly lowered onto lifeboat No. 13 (depicted by [[Charles Dixon (artist)|Charles Dixon]]).|alt=Painting of lifeboats being lowered down the side of Titanic, with one lifeboat about to be lowered on top of another one in the water. A third lifeboat is visible in the background.]]
By 01:30, ''Titanic''{{'}}s downward angle in the water was increasing and the ship was now listing slightly more to port, but not more than 5 degrees. The deteriorating situation was reflected in the tone of the messages sent from the ship: "We are putting the women off in the boats" at 01:25, "Engine room getting flooded" at 01:35, and at 01:45, "Engine room full up to boilers."{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=26}} This was ''Titanic''{{'}}s last intelligible signal, sent as the ship's electrical system began to fail; subsequent messages were jumbled and broken. The two radio operators nonetheless continued sending out distress messages almost to the very end.{{sfn|Regal|2005|p=34}}

The remaining boats were filled much closer to capacity and in an increasing rush. No.&amp;nbsp;11 was filled with five people more than its rated capacity. As it was lowered, it was nearly flooded by water being pumped out of the ship. No.&amp;nbsp;13 narrowly avoided the same problem but those aboard were unable to release the ropes from which the boat had been lowered. It drifted astern, directly under No.&amp;nbsp;15 as it was being lowered. The ropes were cut in time and both boats made it away safely.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=153}}

The first signs of panic were seen when a group of passengers attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No.&amp;nbsp;14 as it was being lowered with 40&amp;nbsp;people aboard. [[Harold Lowe|Fifth Officer Lowe]], who was in charge of the boat, fired three warning shots in the air to control the crowd without causing injuries.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=154}} No.&amp;nbsp;16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess [[Violet Jessop]], who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of ''Titanic''{{'}}s sister ships, {{HMHS|Britannic||2}}, in the First World War.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=155}} Collapsible boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most of those on deck had moved to the [[stern]] of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director [[J. Bruce Ismay]], ''Titanic''{{'}}s most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=26}}

At 01:45, lifeboat No.&amp;nbsp;2 was lowered.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=222}} While it was still at deck level, Lightoller had found the boat occupied by men who, he wrote later, "weren't British, nor of the English-speaking race&amp;nbsp;... [but of] the broad category known to sailors as '[[Ethnic slur#D|dagoes]]'."{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=296}} After he evicted them by threatening them with his revolver, he was unable to find enough women and children to fill the boat{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=296}} and lowered it with only 25 people on board out of a possible capacity of 40.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=222}} John Jacob Astor saw his wife off to safety in No.&amp;nbsp;4 boat at 01:55 but was refused entry by Lightoller, even though 20 of the 60&amp;nbsp;seats aboard were unoccupied.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=222}}

The last boat to be launched was collapsible D, which left at 02:05 with 25&amp;nbsp;people aboard;&lt;ref name="bright"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq09Bright01.php|title=Testimony of Arthur Bright|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; two more men jumped on the boat as it was being lowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq10Woolner01.php|title=Testimony of Hugh Woolner|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sea had reached the boat deck and the forecastle was deep underwater. First-class passenger [[Edith Corse Evans|Edith Evans]] gave up her place in the boat, and ultimately died in the disaster. She was one of only four women in first class to perish in the sinking. Captain Smith carried out a final tour of the deck, telling the radio operators and other crew members: "Now it's every man for himself."{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=130}}

As passengers and crew headed to the stern, where Father [[Thomas Byles]] was hearing confessions and giving absolutions, ''Titanic''{{'}}s band played outside the gymnasium.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=135}} ''Titanic'' had two separate bands of musicians. One was a quintet led by [[Wallace Hartley]] that played after dinner and at religious services while the other was a trio who played in the reception area and outside the café and restaurant. The two bands had separate music libraries and arrangements and had not played together before the sinking. Around 30 minutes after colliding with the iceberg, the two bands were called by Captain Smith who ordered them to play in the first class lounge. Passengers present remember them playing lively tunes such as "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]". It is unknown if the two piano players were with the band at this time. The exact time is unknown, but the musicians later moved to the boat deck level where they played before moving outside onto the deck itself.&lt;ref name=Steph&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barczewski|first1=Stephanie|title=Titanic: A Night Remembered|date=2006|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=9781852855000|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the enduring folklore of the ''Titanic'' sinking is that the musicians played the hymn "[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]" as the ship sank, but this appears to be dubious.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=128}} The claim surfaced among the earliest reports of the sinking,{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=129}} and the hymn became so closely associated with the ''Titanic'' disaster that its opening bars were carved on the grave monument of ''Titanic''{{'}}s bandmaster, Wallace Hartley, one of those who perished.{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=395}} Violet Jessop said in her 1934 account of the disaster that she had heard the hymn being played.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=128}} In contrast, Archibald Gracie emphatically denied it in his own account, written soon after the sinking, and Radio Operator Harold Bride said that he had heard the band playing ragtime, then "Autumn",{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=396}} by which he may have meant [[Archibald Joyce]]'s then-popular waltz "Songe d'Automne" (Autumn Dream). George Orrell, the bandmaster of the rescue ship, ''Carpathia'', who spoke with survivors, related: "The ship's band in any emergency is expected to play to calm the passengers. After ''Titanic'' struck the iceberg the band began to play bright music, dance music, comic songs&amp;nbsp;– anything that would prevent the passengers from becoming panic-stricken&amp;nbsp;... various awe-stricken passengers began to think of the death that faced them and asked the bandmaster to play hymns. The one which appealed to all was 'Nearer My God to Thee'."{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=194}} According to Gracie, who was near the band until that section of deck went under, the tunes played by the band were "cheerful" but he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' as claimed in the newspaper "I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death to us all and one likely to create panic."{{sfn|Gracie|1913|p=20}} Several survivors who were among the last to leave the ship claimed that the band continued playing until the slope of the deck became too steep for them to stand, Gracie claimed that the band stopped playing at least 30 minutes before the vessel sank. Several witnesses support this account including A. H. Barkworth, a first-class passenger who testified: "I do not wish to detract from the bravery of anybody, but I might mention that when I first came on deck the band was playing a waltz. The next time I passed where the band was stationed, the members had thrown down their instruments and were not to be seen."&lt;ref name="Steph"/&gt;

Bride heard the band playing as he left the radio cabin, which was by now awash, in the company of the other radio operator, Jack Phillips. He had just had a fight with a man who Bride thought was "a stoker, or someone from below decks", who had attempted to steal Phillips' lifebelt. Bride wrote later: "I did my duty. I hope I finished [the man]. I don't know. We left him on the cabin floor of the radio room, and he was not moving."{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=317}} The two radio operators went in opposite directions, Phillips aft and Bride forward towards collapsible lifeboat B.{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=317}}

Archibald Gracie was also heading aft, but as he made his way towards the stern he found his path blocked by "a mass of humanity several lines deep, covering the boat deck, facing us"{{sfn|Winocour|1960|pp=138–39}}&amp;nbsp;– hundreds of steerage passengers, who had finally made it to the deck just as the last lifeboats departed. He gave up on the idea of going aft and jumped into the water to get away from the crowd.{{sfn|Winocour|1960|pp=138–39}} Others made no attempt to escape. The ship's designer, Thomas Andrews, was reportedly last seen in the first-class smoking room, having removed his lifebelt, staring at the painting above the fireplace.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=155}}{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=177}} Captain Smith's fate is unclear as there are conflicting accounts of his death; he either entered the wheelhouse on the bridge and died there when it was engulfed{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=224}}{{sfn|Ballard|1987|pp=40–41}} or jumped into the water just before the bridge was submerged and subsequently perished in the water, possibly near Collapsible B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq14Bride01.php|title=Testimony of Harold Bride at the US Inquiry|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williammurdoch.net/mystery02_witness_18_widener.html|title=Mrs. Eleanor Widener, first class passenger|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wormstedt.com/Titanic/shots/secondno.html|title=Shots in the dark|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanic-lore.info/Capt-Smith.htm|title=Captain Edward John Smith|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822094217/http://www.titanic-lore.info/Capt-Smith.htm|archivedate=22 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ANTR&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=67R5gy-fZhEC&amp;pg=PT87&amp;lpg=PT87&amp;dq=All+right+boys.+Good+luck+and+God+bless+you.+smith+collapsible+b|title=A Night to Remember|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|isbn=9781453238417|author1=Lord|first1=Walter|date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last minutes of sinking (02:15–02:20) ===

A beam of light is shown coming down from heaven to illuminate the couple. Behind them is an empty davit.]]
At about 02:15, ''Titanic''{{'}}s angle in the water began to increase rapidly as water poured into previously unflooded parts of the ship through deck hatches.{{sfn|Barratt|2010|p=131}} Her suddenly increasing angle caused what one survivor called a "giant wave" to wash along the ship from the forward end of the boat deck, sweeping many people into the sea.{{sfn|Lynch|1998|p=117}} The parties who were trying to lower collapsible boats A and B, including Chief Officer Henry Wilde, First Officer Murdoch, Second Officer Charles Lightoller and Colonel Archibald Gracie, were swept away along with the two boats (boat B floated away upside-down with Harold Bride trapped underneath it, and boat A ended up partly flooded and with its canvas not raised). Bride, Gracie and Lightoller made it onto boat B, but Murdoch and Wilde perished in the water.{{sfn|Gracie|1913|p=61}}{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=316}}

Lightoller opted to abandon his post to escape the growing crowds, and dived into the water from the roof of the officers' quarters. He was sucked into the mouth of a ventilation shaft but was blown clear by "a terrific blast of hot air" and emerged next to the capsized lifeboat.{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=299}} The forward funnel collapsed under its own weight, crushing several people as it fell into the water and only narrowly missing the lifeboat.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=28}} It closely missed Lightoller and created a wave that washed the boat 50 yards clear of the sinking ship.{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=299}} Those still on ''Titanic'' felt her structure shuddering as it underwent immense stresses. As first-class passenger Jack Thayer{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=166}} described it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Occasionally there had been a muffled thud or deadened explosion within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.{{sfn|Gleicher|2006|p=229}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eyewitnesses saw ''Titanic''{{'}}s stern rising high into the air as the ship tilted down in the water. It was said to have reached an angle of 30–45&amp;nbsp;degrees,{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=202}} "revolving apparently around a centre of gravity just astern of midships", as Lawrence Beesley later put it.{{sfn|Beesley|1960|p=47}} Many survivors described a great noise, which some attributed to the boilers exploding.{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=70}} Beesley described it as "partly a groan, partly a rattle, and partly a smash, and it was not a sudden roar as an explosion would be: it went on successively for some seconds, possibly fifteen to twenty". He attributed it to "the engines and machinery coming loose from their bolts and bearings, and falling through the compartments, smashing everything in their way".{{sfn|Beesley|1960|p=47}}

After another minute, the ship's lights flickered once and then permanently went out, plunging ''Titanic'' into darkness. Jack Thayer recalled seeing "groups of the fifteen hundred people still aboard, clinging in clusters or bunches, like swarming bees; only to fall in masses, pairs or singly as the great afterpart of the ship, two hundred fifty feet of it, rose into the sky."{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=28}}

[[File:Reuterdahl - Sinking of the Titanic.jpg|thumb|left|''"Sinking of the Titanic"'' by [[Henry Reuterdahl]]|alt=Painting of a sinking ship with a lifeboat being rowed away from it in the foreground.]]

==== ''Titanic''{{'}}s final moments (02:20) ====
''Titanic'' was subjected to extreme opposing forces&amp;nbsp;– the flooded bow pulling her down while the air in the stern kept her to the surface&amp;nbsp;– which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after the lights went out, the ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=119}}{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/titanic-100-years/videos/titanic-sinking-cgi/|title=Titanic Sinking CGI|publisher=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, "gradually [turning] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle&amp;nbsp;... Then, with the deadened noise of the bursting of her last few gallant bulkheads, she slid quietly away from us into the sea."{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=29}}

''Titanic''{{'}}s surviving officers and some prominent survivors testified that the ship had sunk in one piece, a belief that was affirmed by the British and American inquiries into the disaster. Archibald Gracie, who was on the promenade deck with the band (by the second funnel), stated that "''Titanic''{{'}}s decks were intact at the time she sank, and when I sank with her, there was over seven-sixteenths of the ship already under water, and there was no indication then of any impending break of the deck or ship".{{sfn|Gracie|1913|p=58}} Ballard argued that many other survivors' accounts indicated that the ship had broken in two as it was sinking.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=201}} As the engines are now known to have stayed in place along with most of the boilers, the "great noise" heard by witnesses and the momentary settling of the stern were presumably caused by the break-up of the ship rather than the loosening of her fittings or boiler explosions.{{sfn|Kuntz|1998|p=xiii}}

After they went under, the bow and stern took only about 5–6 minutes to sink {{convert|3795|m|ft}}, spilling a trail of heavy machinery, tons of coal and large quantities of debris from ''Titanic''{{'}}s interior. The two parts of the ship landed about {{convert|600|m|ft}} apart on a gently undulating area of the seabed.{{sfn|Uchupi|Ballard|Lange|1986}} The streamlined bow section continued to descend at about the angle it had taken on the surface, striking the seabed prow-first at a shallow angle{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=206}} at an estimated speed of {{convert|25|–|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Its momentum caused it to dig a deep gouge into the seabed and buried the section up to {{convert|20|m|ft}} deep in sediment before it came to an abrupt halt. The sudden deceleration caused the bow's structure to buckle downwards by several degrees just forward of the bridge. The decks at the rear end of the bow section, which had already been weakened during the break-up, collapsed one atop another.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=205}}

The stern section seems to have descended almost vertically, probably rotating as it fell.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=206}} Empty tanks and [[cofferdam]]s imploded as it descended, tearing open the structure and folding back the steel ribbing of the [[poop deck]].{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=140}} The section landed with such force that it buried itself about {{convert|15|m}} deep at the rudder. The decks pancaked down on top of each other and the hull plating splayed out to the sides. Debris continued to rain down across the seabed for several hours after the sinking.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=205}}

=== Passengers and crew in the water (02:20–04:10) ===
[[File:Titanic watch.jpg|thumb|Pocket watch retrieved from an unknown victim of the disaster, stopped showing a time of 2:28|alt=Photograph of a brass pocket watch on a stand, with a silver chain curled around the base. The watch's hands read 2:28.]]

In the immediate aftermath of the sinking, hundreds of passengers and crew were left dying in the icy sea, surrounded by debris from the ship.  ''Titanic''{{'}}s disintegration during her descent to the seabed caused buoyant chunks of debris&amp;nbsp;– timber beams, wooden doors, furniture, panelling and chunks of cork from the bulkheads&amp;nbsp;– to rocket to the surface. These injured and possibly killed some of the swimmers; others used the debris to try to keep themselves afloat.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=139}}

With a temperature of {{convert|28|°F}}, the water was lethally cold. Second Officer Lightoller described the feeling of "a thousand knives" being driven into his body as he entered the sea.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=140}} Sudden immersion into freezing water typically causes death within minutes, either from [[cardiac arrest]], uncontrollable breathing of water, or [[cold incapacitation]] (not, as commonly believed, from [[hypothermia]]);&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/findings-titanic-victims-in-cold-shock/169325.article Findings: Titanic victims in 'cold shock'], quoting Michael Tipton&lt;/ref&gt; almost all of those in the water died of cardiac arrest or other bodily reactions to freezing water within 15–30 minutes.{{sfn|Aldridge|2008|p=56}} Only 13 of them were helped into the lifeboats even though these had room for almost 500 more people.{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=103}}

Those in the lifeboats were horrified to hear the sound of what Lawrence Beesley called "every possible emotion of human fear, despair, agony, fierce resentment and blind anger mingled&amp;nbsp;– I am certain of those&amp;nbsp;– with notes of infinite surprise, as though each one were saying, 'How is it possible that this awful thing is happening to ''me''? That I should be caught in this death trap?{{'"}}{{sfn|Barratt|2010|pp=199–200}} [[Jack Thayer]] compared it to the sound of "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before ''Titanic'' sank, described it as "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural."{{sfn|Barratt|2010|p=177}}

The noise of the people in the water screaming, yelling, and crying was a tremendous shock to the occupants of the lifeboats, many of whom had up to that moment believed that everyone had escaped before the ship sank. As Beesley later wrote, the cries "came as a thunderbolt, unexpected, inconceivable, incredible. No one in any of the boats standing off a few hundred yards away can have escaped the paralysing shock of knowing that so short a distance away a tragedy, unbelievable in its magnitude, was being enacted, which we, helpless, could in no way avert or diminish."{{sfn|Barratt|2010|pp=199–200}}

[[File:Archibald Gracie IV.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Archibald Gracie IV|Colonel Archibald Gracie]], one of the survivors who made it to collapsible lifeboat B. He never recovered from his ordeal and died eight months after the sinking.|alt=Photograph of a moustached middle-aged man in a dark suit and waistcoat, sitting in a chair while looking at the camera]]
Only a few of those in the water survived. Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized collapsible boat B. Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were clinging precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those in the water; "In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... [one refusal] was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck and God bless you'."{{sfn|Gracie|1913|p=89}} Several other swimmers (probably 20 or more) reached Collapsible boat A, which was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised. Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water,{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=224}} and many died of hypothermia during the night.

Farther out, the other eighteen lifeboats&amp;nbsp;– most of which had empty seats&amp;nbsp;– drifted as the occupants debated what, if anything, they should do to rescue the swimmers. Boat No.&amp;nbsp;4, having remained near the sinking ship, seems to have been closest to the site of the sinking at around {{convert|50|m}} away; this had enabled two people to drop into the boat and another to be picked up from the water before the ship sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq05Ranger01.php|title=Testimony of Thomas Ranger|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sinking, seven more men were pulled from the water, although two later died. Collapsible D rescued one male passenger who jumped in the water and swam over to the boat immediately after it had been lowered. In all the other boats, the occupants eventually decided against returning, probably out of fear that they would be capsized in the attempt. Some put their objections bluntly; Quartermaster Hichens, commanding lifeboat No.&amp;nbsp;6, told the women aboard his boat that there was no point returning as there were "only a lot of stiffs there".{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=226–67}}

After about twenty minutes, the cries began to fade as the swimmers lapsed into unconsciousness and death.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=228}} Fifth Officer Lowe, in charge of lifeboat No.&amp;nbsp;14, "waited until the yells and shrieks had subsided for the people to thin out" before mounting an attempt to rescue those in the water.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=230}} He gathered together five of the lifeboats and transferred the occupants between them to free up space in No.&amp;nbsp;14. Lowe then took a crew of seven crewmen and one male passenger who volunteered to help, and then rowed back to the site of the sinking. The whole operation took about three-quarters of an hour. By the time No.&amp;nbsp;14 headed back to the site of the sinking, almost all of those in the water were dead and only a few voices could still be heard.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=144–45}}

[[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]], recalled after the disaster that "the very last cry was that of a man who had been calling loudly: 'My God! My God!' He cried monotonously, in a dull, hopeless way. For an entire hour there had been an awful chorus of shrieks, gradually dying into a hopeless moan, until this last cry that I speak of. Then all was silent."{{sfn|Everett|1912|p=167}} Lowe and his crew found four men still alive, one of whom died shortly afterwards. Otherwise, all they could see were "hundreds of bodies and lifebelts"; the dead "seemed as if they had perished with the cold as their limbs were all cramped up".{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=230}}

In the other boats, there was nothing the survivors could do but await the arrival of rescue ships. The air was bitterly cold and several of the boats had taken on water. The survivors could not find any [[Emergency rations|food or drinkable water]] in the boats, and most had no lights.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=232}} The situation was particularly bad aboard collapsible B, which was only kept afloat by a diminishing air pocket in the upturned hull. As dawn approached, the wind rose and the sea became increasingly choppy, forcing those on the collapsible boat to stand up to balance it. Some, exhausted by the ordeal, fell off into the sea and were drowned.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=231}} It became steadily harder for the rest to keep their balance on the hull, with waves washing across it.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=238}} Archibald Gracie later wrote of how he and the other survivors sitting on the upturned hull were struck by "the utter helplessness of our position".{{sfn|Gracie|1913|p=161}}

=== Rescue and departure (04:10–09:15) ===
[[File:Titanic lifeboat.jpg|thumb|Collapsible lifeboat D photographed from the deck of ''Carpathia'' on the morning of 15 April 1912.|alt=Photograph of a lifeboat, filled with people wearing life jackets, being rowed towards the camera.]]

''Titanic''{{'}}s survivors were rescued around 04:00 on 15 April by the RMS ''Carpathia'', which had steamed through the night at high speed and at considerable risk, as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs ''en route''.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=238}} ''Carpathia''{{'}}s lights were first spotted around 03:30,{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=238}} which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=240–41}} Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe more than a half) had died overnight.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=140}} The remaining survivors&amp;nbsp;– an unknown number of men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman&amp;nbsp;– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}} with the bodies still aboard.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=240–41}}

Those on ''Carpathia'' were startled by the scene that greeted them as the sun came up: "fields of ice on which, like points on the landscape, rested innumerable pyramids of ice."{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=242}} Captain [[Arthur Rostron]] of ''Carpathia'' saw ice all around, including 20&amp;nbsp;large bergs measuring up to {{convert|200|ft|m}} high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=242}} It appeared to ''Carpathia''{{'}}s passengers that their ship was in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs appearing like hills in the distance.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=245}}

As the lifeboats were brought alongside ''Carpathia'', the survivors came aboard the ship by various means. Some were strong enough to climb up rope ladders; others were hoisted up in slings, and the children were hoisted in mail sacks.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=154}} The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.&amp;nbsp;12, with 74&amp;nbsp;people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on ''Carpathia'' by 09:00.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=156}} There were some scenes of joy as families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=155}}

At 09:15, two more ships appeared on the scene&amp;nbsp;– [[SS Mount Temple|''Mount Temple'']] and [[SS Californian|''Californian'']], which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty&amp;nbsp;– but by then there were no more survivors to rescue. ''Carpathia'' had been bound for Fiume, [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Rijeka]], Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=156}} ''Carpathia'' departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=157}}{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=255}}

== Aftermath ==

=== Grief and outrage ===
[[File:Arrival of the ship of sorrow.jpg|thumb|left|According to an eyewitness report, there "were many pathetic scenes" when ''Titanic''{{'}}s survivors disembarked at New York.|alt=A man wearing a bowler hat and a woman in a shawl embrace among a crowd of people standing in a wooden building]]
When ''Carpathia'' arrived at [[Pier&amp;nbsp;54]] in New York on the evening of 18 April after a difficult voyage through pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas,{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=266}}{{sfn|Lord|1976|pp=196–97}} some 40,000&amp;nbsp;people were standing on the wharves, alerted to the disaster by a stream of radio messages from ''Carpathia'' and other ships. It was only after ''Carpathia'' docked&amp;nbsp;– three days after ''Titanic''{{'}}s sinking&amp;nbsp;– that the full scope of the disaster became public knowledge.{{sfn|Lord|1976|pp=196–97}}

Even before ''Carpathia'' arrived in New York, efforts were getting underway to retrieve the dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328&amp;nbsp;bodies; 119 were [[Burial at sea|buried at sea]], while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax, Nova Scotia]],{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=266}} where 150 of them were buried.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=235}} Memorials were raised in various places&amp;nbsp;– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|pp=296–300}}&amp;nbsp;– and ceremonies were held on both sides of the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|pp=293–95}} The bodies of most of ''Titanic''{{'}}s victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73&amp;nbsp;years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=25}}

The prevailing public reaction to the disaster was one of shock and outrage, directed against several issues and people: why were there so few lifeboats? Why had Ismay saved his own life when so many others died? Why did ''Titanic'' proceed into the ice field at full speed?{{sfn|Björkfors|2004|p=59}} The outrage was driven not least by the survivors themselves; even while they were aboard ''Carpathia'' on their way to New York, Beesley and other survivors determined to "awaken public opinion to safeguard ocean travel in the future" and wrote a public letter to ''[[The Times]]'' urging changes to maritime safety laws.{{sfn|Beesley|1960|p=81}}

In places closely associated with ''Titanic'', the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699&amp;nbsp;crew members and also home to many of the passengers.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=266}} Crowds of weeping women&amp;nbsp;– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew&amp;nbsp;– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=173}} Most of them were among the 549&amp;nbsp;Southampton residents who perished.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=264}} In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built ''Titanic'' came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|pp=221–22}}

=== Public inquiries and legislation ===
{{Main article|United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the RMS Titanic}}
[[File:Time To Get Busy - no caption.png|thumb|''"Time to get busy"'' by "[[Bud Fisher|Fisher]]", 1912. Public outrage at the disaster led politicians to impose new regulations on the shipping industry.|alt=Cartoon of Uncle Sam taking hold of a ship's wheel marked "Navigation Laws" and saying, "By ginger, I'll take a firmer grip on this business hereafter." At his feet is a paper reading "Ragged marine regulations". A worried-looking man in a top hat marked "Steamship Magnate" looks on. In the distant background a ship can be seen sinking.]]
In the aftermath of the sinking, public inquiries were set up in Britain and the United States. The [[United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|US inquiry]] began on 19 April under the chairmanship of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[William Alden Smith]],{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=181}} and the [[British Titanic inquiry|British inquiry]] commenced in London under [[John Bigham, 1st Viscount Mersey|Lord Mersey]] on 2 May 1912.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=192}} They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate;{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=195}} Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings;{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=189}} the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a danger area at too high a speed.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=195}} Both inquiries strongly criticised Captain Lord of ''Californian'' for failing to render assistance to ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=191, 196}}

Neither inquiry found [[negligence]] by the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] (the parent company) or the White Star Line (which owned ''Titanic'') to be a factor. The US inquiry concluded that those involved had followed standard practice, and the disaster could thus only be categorised as an "[[act of God]]",{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=67}} and the British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice which had not previously been shown to be unsafe{{sfn|Lynch|1998|p=189}} (the inquiry noted that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 73 lives{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=265}}) and concluded that he had done "only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position". The British inquiry also warned that "What was a mistake in the case of the ''Titanic'' would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future."{{sfn|Lynch|1998|p=189}}

The disaster led to major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that radio equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1987|p=109}} An [[International Ice Patrol]] was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=310}}

=== Cultural impact and wreckage ===
{{further|RMS Titanic in popular culture|Wreck of the RMS Titanic}}
[[File:Titanic wreck bow.jpg|Wreck of the RMS ''Titanic'', June 2004|thumb|alt=]]

''Titanic''{{'}}s sinking has become a cultural phenomenon, commemorated by artists, film-makers, writers, composers, musicians and dancers from the time immediately after the sinking to the present day.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=14}} On 1 September 1985, a joint US-French expedition led by [[Robert Ballard]] found the [[wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck of ''Titanic'']],{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=82}} and the ship's rediscovery led to an explosion of interest in ''Titanic''{{'}}s story.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=332}} Numerous expeditions have been launched to film the wreck and, controversially, to salvage objects from the debris field.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=310}} The first major exhibition of recovered artefacts was held at London's [[National Maritime Museum]] in 1994–95.{{sfn|Portman 12 November 1994}} In 1997, [[James Cameron]]'s [[Titanic (1997 film)|eponymous film]] became the first movie ever to take $1 billion at the box office, and the [[Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture|film's soundtrack]] became the best selling soundtrack recording of all time.{{sfn|Parisi|1998|p=223}}

The wreck is steadily decaying, turning to oxide at a rate of 0.5–1 ton&lt;!--judging from the discussion on talk any type of ton since the calculation is very rough--&gt; per day (assuming one ten-thousandth of an inch per day on all surfaces).{{sfn|McCarty|Foecke|2012|pp=196–99}} Eventually ''Titanic''{{'}}s structure will collapse, and she will be reduced to a patch of rust on the seabed, with any remaining scraps of the ship's hull mingled with her more durable fittings, like the propellers, bronze capstans, compasses and the telemotor.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=235}}

== Casualties and survivors ==
{{further|Passengers of the RMS Titanic|Crew of the RMS Titanic}}

The number of casualties of the sinking is unclear due to several factors, including confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=239}} The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635&amp;nbsp;people.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=197}} The figures below are from the British [[Board of Trade]] report on the disaster.{{sfn|Mersey|1912|pp=110–11}}

Less than a third of those aboard ''Titanic'' survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard ''Carpathia''.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=179}} Of the groups shown in the table, 49 percent of the children, 26 percent of the female passengers, 82 percent of the male passengers and 78 percent of the crew died. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates between men and women, and of the different classes aboard ''Titanic'', especially among women and children. Although less than 10&amp;nbsp;percent of first- and second-class women (combined) were lost, 54 percent of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=94}} The only first-class child to perish was [[Allison family|Loraine Allison]], aged two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Copping|first=Jasper|title=Lost child of the Titanic and the fraud that haunted her family|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10581757/Lost-child-of-the-Titanic-and-the-fraud-that-haunted-her-family.html|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92 percent died. Of the [[Animals aboard the RMS Titanic|pets brought aboard]], three survived the sinking.{{sfn|Georgiou|2000|p=18}}

The show was notable for its unusual cacophony, which is controlled by the performers rather than sound technicians.&lt;ref name=APHS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/theater/the-select-the-sun-also-rises-and-its-sound-effects.html|title=A Push-Button Hemingway Soundtrack|accessdate=March 31, 2014|date=September 11, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Piepenburg, Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical commentary==
[[Lyn Gardner]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'', while noting its length, praised the performance in Edinburgh describing it as "theatrical open-heart surgery on Ernest Hemingway's first major success" done with "surgical expertise and a droll, playful humour" that is too long at nearly four hours.&lt;ref name=TSARTG/&gt; Erik Piepenburg of ''[[The New York Times]]'' says that although words are important to this performance, so are sounds.&lt;ref name=APHS/&gt; When [[Ben Brantley]] of ''The New York Times'' saw the 2010 Philadelphia performance, he praised the presentation of the alcoholic consumption and continuous party atmosphere saying "This alcoholic element is what has been conjured so persuasively" and the show is "a wood-paneled temple to drinks past, present and future".&lt;ref name=FWtGIAH/&gt; However, upon seeing the 2011 Off-Broadway performance, Brantley says "...it never entirely wraps its mind around the style and essence of the book that inspired it".&lt;ref name=ALGDUAoJBT/&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]'''s Helen Shaw describes the show as "a gleefully drunken, offhandedly contemporary animation of Hemingway's hardboiled classic".&lt;ref name=TSTSARGH/&gt; Adam Hetrick of ''[[Playbill]]'' described the performance as "a dramatic explosion of Hemingway's 1926 novel, that melds text, theatrical avant garde and an evocative soundscape".&lt;ref name=ERSTSTSARDiBM1/&gt;

==History==
At the time of the [[Gaul]]s, ''Tarwanna'' or ''Tervanna'' was the capital of the [[Belgae|Belgian]] tribe of the [[Morini]]. After the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered Gaul, they too made the city the capital of the ''Civitas Morinorum'' district.

The origin of the name has several theories. According to the historian Malbracq, it got its name from its founder "Lucius Tauruannus"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Godmond| first = Christopher| title = Memoir of Therrouanne, the ancient capital of the Morini in Gaul ... also a discourse on the Portus Itius of Cæsar| date = 1836}}&lt;/ref&gt;, others say it is derived from "Terra avanae" The land of Oats. But this second derivation seems to be a generic used term. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-02325-3| last = Postan| first = Michael Moïssey| title = The Medieval Economy and Society: An Economic History of Britain, 1100-1500| date = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 7th century, probably around 639, [[Saint Audomar]] (Saint Omer) established the bishopric of ''Terwaan'' or ''Terenburg'', the [[Ancient Diocese of Thérouanne|diocese of Thérouanne]], which during the [[Middle Ages]] controlled a large part of the left bank of the river [[Scheldt]]. Territorially it was part of the [[county of Artois]] which belonged to the [[county of Flanders]].

Thanks to that ecclesiastical control of some of the most prosperous cities north of the [[Alps]], like [[Arras]] and [[Ypres]], the bishopric was able to build a [[cathedral]] which was at the time the largest in France.

The town was captured by the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] and [[Henry VIII]] from the French in 1513 after the [[Battle of Guinegate (1513)|battle of the Spurs]]. In 1553 [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[besiege]]d Thérouanne, then a French enclave in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in revenge for a defeat by the French at [[Siege of Metz (1552)|the siege of Metz]]. After he captured the city he ordered it to be razed, the roads to be broken up, and the area to be [[plough]]ed and [[Salting the earth|salted]].{{Dubious|date=December 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;salting is mentioned in Elise Whitlock Rose, ''Cathedrals and Cloisters of Northern France'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WwogAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=salt p. 8], but this is not a reliable historical source.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small commune which lay outside the city walls, then named Saint-Martin-Outre-Eaux, was left standing, and later (probably around 1800) took over the name ''Thérouanne''. Part of the portal of the cathedral was acquired by Saint-Omer; a colossal statue of Christ is all that is left of it these days.

The disappearance of the former bishopric led to a reform of sees at the [[Council of Trent]], and the [[bishopric of Thérouanne]] was split between those of [[Diocese of St-Omer|Saint-Omer]] and [[Diocese of Ypres|Ypres]].

Therouanne lies on the [[Via Francigena]].

[[File:FranzLiszt1880-85.jpg|thumb|200px|Franz Liszt]]
'''Via crucis''' (''{{lang|de|Die 14 Stationen des Kreuzwegs}}'') is a work for mixed choir, soloists and organ (also harmonium or piano) by [[Franz Liszt]]. The work is devoted to the [[Stations of the Cross]]. It is one of the last works of Liszt.

Liszt started the composition of this work in the fall of 1878 when he stayed in Rome and ended it in February 1879 in [[Budapest]]. There are three sources of the work available: the first sketches in [[Weimar]], the manuscript of the whole work in Budapest and a copy of it in Weimar. The original version was set with accompaniment by organ. Liszt made later a version with piano.

The work is a special case in the oeuvre of Liszt, especially because it is a work of great serenity. The work is also special because it reaches the limits of the till then prevailing tonality. The work combines [[unison]] songs (Stations I and XIV) with [[Lutheran chorale]]s (Stations IV and XII), and [[chorale]]s inspired by [[Bach]]'s chorales (Station VI), whereas other stations consist of solo organ (or piano). Liszt self wanted to perform the work in the [[Colosseum]], with accompaniment by [[harmonium]].

== Setting ==
The work follows the fourteen stations:

'''William Earl Johns''' (5 February 1893{{spaced ndash}}21 June 1968) was an English First World War [[Aviator|pilot]], and writer of adventure stories, usually written under the [[pen name]] '''Capt. W. E. Johns'''. He was the creator of the fictional air-adventurer ''[[Biggles]]''.

==Early life==
Johns was born in [[Bengeo]], [[Hertford]], England, the son of Richard Eastman Johns, a fabric tailor, and Elizabeth Johns ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Earl), the daughter of a master butcher. A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns' early ambition was to be a soldier, and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended [[Richard Hale School|Hertford Grammar School]].&lt;ref name=johns&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wejohns.com/Biography/Biography1/ | title=A Brief Biography of Captain W. E. Johns  Part One | website=Wejohns.com | accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended evening classes at the local art school.

Johns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book ''Biggles Goes to School'' (1951). In the summer of 1907 he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to a county municipal [[Surveying|surveyor]] for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in [[Swaffham]] in [[Norfolk]]. Soon afterwards, his father died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914 Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882–1961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of [[Little Dunham]], Norfolk.&lt;ref name=johns/&gt; Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.

==Military career and the First World War ==
In 1913, while living in [[Swaffham]], and working as a sanitary inspector, Johns enlisted in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]] in the [[Norfolk Yeomanry|King's Own Royal Regiment (Norfolk Yeomanry)]].  The regiment was mobilised in August 1914 and was sent overseas in September 1915, embarking on [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']].  The Norfolk Yeomanry fought (as infantry) at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] until December when they were withdrawn to [[Egypt]].  In September 1916 Johns transferred to the [[Machine Gun Corps]]. While serving on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] in [[Greece]] he was hospitalised with [[malaria]].  After recovering, he was commissioned into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) in September 1917 as a temporary [[second lieutenant]]&lt;ref name="LG 19 October 1917"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30347 |date=19 October 1917 |page=10886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and posted back to England for flight training.

Johns undertook his initial flying training at the short-lived airfield at [[Coley Park]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], flying the [[Farman MF.11|Farman MF.11 Shorthorn]] aircraft. He was then posted to No.25 Flying Training School at [[Thetford]] in Norfolk, closer to where his wife Maude and son Jack were living.&lt;ref name=cpabac&gt;{{cite web | title = The Coley Park Aerodrome and CWS Jam Works | url = http://www.users.on.net/~kevros/coleypark/oc_aerocws.htm | publisher = Coley Park &amp; Beyond (Kevin Rosier)|website=Users.on.net | accessdate =15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 1 April 1918, Johns was appointed flying instructor at [[Marske-by-the-Sea]] in [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]]. The aircraft of the time were very unreliable and he wrote off three planes in three days through engine failure – crashing into the sea, then the sand, and then through a fellow officer's back door. Later, he was caught in fog over the [[Tees]], missed [[Hartlepool]] and narrowly escaped flying into a cliff. Shooting one's own propeller off with a forward-mounted machine-gun with malfunctioning [[synchronization gear|synchronisation]] was a fairly common accident, and it happened to Johns twice. The Commanding Officer at Marske was a Major Champion, known as 'Gimlet', a name used later by Johns for the hero of a series of stories. During this time Johns's probationary commission was confirmed&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30887 |date=6 September 1918 |page=10551}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he served as a flying instructor until August 1918 when he transferred to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

He performed six weeks of active duty as a bomber pilot with [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]], close to the average in the latter part of the war.&lt;ref&gt;H.A.Jones. ''War in the Air''. Naval and Military Press; New edition (8 Oct 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; This squadron was part of the [[Independent Air Force]], a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing strategic targets deep inside Germany.

On 16 September 1918 he was piloting one of six [[De Havilland DH4]]s on their way to bomb [[Mannheim]] when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of [[Fokker D.VII]] fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns' observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to [[Georg Weiner]], the commander of [[Jagdstaffel 3]].&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite book | title=Aces Falling: War Above The Trenches, 1918 | publisher=W&amp;N | author=Hart, Peter | year=2007 | page=278 | isbn=0297846531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auction"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/medals-royal-flying-corps-biggles-observer-s-casu-1-c-h46sfkylnv | title=Bosleys 2005, Lot 556 | website=Invaluable.com | accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johns was a prisoner of war until the end of the war (November 1918).&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Amey's medals were sold at auction in the United Kingdom in 2005, in a lot that included a letter to his family from Johns, describing the circumstances of his death ''(see: Bosleys 2005, Lot 556)''. In the preface of ''Biggles Pioneer Air Fighter'' (1954), Johns noted that this had been Amey's "first and last fight beside me" and he had not even unpacked his kit.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Johns remained in the [[Royal Air Force]], apparently with the substantive rank of [[Pilot Officer]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;It was common for officers continuing in the service after the war to take a lower rank than that held during the conflict, but it does seem highly unlikely he had ever held the rank of "Captain" in the RFC (equivalent to [[Flight Lieutenant]] in the RAF), even on an "acting" basis.&lt;/ref&gt; His promotion to the rank of [[Flying Officer]] was [[gazetted]] on 23 November 1920.&lt;ref name="LG 30 November 1920"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32145 |date=30 November 1920 |page=11823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johns worked in central London as a recruiting officer&lt;ref name=johns2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wejohns.com/Biography/Biography2/ | title=A Brief Biography of Captain W. E. Johns  Part Two | website=Wejohns.com | accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected [[T. E. Lawrence]] (of Arabia) as an RAF recruit for obviously giving a false name, but was later ordered to accept him.&lt;ref&gt;Biography of Johns, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1923, Johns had left his wife. His RAF commission had been extended a further four years and he had moved to [[Birmingham]], again working as a recruitment officer. In Birmingham  he met Doris 'Dol' May Leigh&lt;ref name=johns2 /&gt; (1900–1969), daughter of Alfred Broughton Leigh. They later moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] when Johns was posted there. Although he never divorced Maude Hunt, Doris Leigh was known as 'Mrs Johns' until her death. Johns continued to pay for his wife and son's upkeep and for her nursing care (she suffered from acute arthritis).&lt;ref name=johns2 /&gt;

On 15 October 1927, he was transferred to the reserves.&lt;ref name="LG 11 October 1927"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33319 |date=11 October 1927 |page=6402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, on 15 October 1931, he relinquished his commission.&lt;ref name="LG 22 December 1931"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33782 |date=22 December 1931 |page=8260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
{{see also|List of works by W. E. Johns}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Biggles of 266 cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Biggles of 266'']] --&gt;
W. E. Johns was a prolific author and editor. In his 46-year writing career (1922–68) he penned over 160 books, including nearly one hundred Biggles books, more than sixty other novels and factual books, and scores of magazine articles and short stories.

His first novel, ''Mossyface'',&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Mossy Face was a name given by the Allies to [[Havrincourt|Havrincourt Wood]]: it is mentioned in some of the ''Biggles'' stories and in some pilot's memoirs of the period.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1922 under the pen name "William Earle". After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine ''Popular Flying'' which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of ''Popular Flying'' that Biggles first appeared.

The first Biggles book, ''The Camels are Coming'' (a reference to the [[Sopwith Camel]] aeroplane), was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968. At first, the Biggles stories were credited to "William Earle", but later Johns adopted the more familiar "Capt. W. E. Johns". While his apparent final RAF rank of [[flying officer]] was equivalent to an army (or RFC) lieutenant, [[captain]] is commonly used for the commander of a vessel or aircraft.

Johns was also a regular contributor to ''[[Modern Boy]]'' magazine in the late 1930s as well as editing (and writing for) both ''Popular Flying'' and ''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]''. From the early 1930s Johns called for the training of more pilots, for if there were not enough when war came, "training would have to be rushed, and under-trained airmen would die in accidents or in combat against better trained German pilots."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/biggles-flies-uncensored-more-whisky-less-jingoism-8944480.html Patrick Cockburn, "Biggles flies uncensored: more whisky, less jingoism." ''[[The Independent]]'', Sunday 17 November 2013] Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was removed as editor at the beginning of 1939, probably as a direct result of a scathing editorial, strongly opposed to the policy of [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement]] and highly critical of several [[Conservative Party (UK)#1920-1963|Conservative]] statesmen of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularflying.com/Covers/81/ |title=POPULAR FLYING MAGAZINE – ISSUE 1 (0F 88) |website=Popularflying.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cockburn, however, feels that the government was concerned about being so "expertly attacked" on the lack of trained pilots by the editor of the most widely read aviation magazines in the world, including readers "in the RAF or connected with flying."&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johns' opposition to appeasement is reflected in some of his books. For example, in ''The Black Peril'' (1935) the storyline revolves around German preparations for conquest. Even more advanced in his thinking, for that time, was the story ''Biggles Air Commodore'' (1937) which alludes to Japanese preparations for conquest of British colonies in the Far East.

Apart from "Biggles", his other multi-volume fiction series were:

* The 6-volume "Steeley" series (1936–1939), featuring former First World War pilot turned crime-fighter Deeley Montfort Delaroy (nicknamed "Steeley").
* The 11-volume "[[Worrals]]" series (1941–1950), detailing the exploits of plucky WAAF [[Flight Officer]] Joan "Worrals" Worralson (who was also the subject of three short stories); these were created at the request of the [[Air Ministry]] to inspire young women to join the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]].
* The 10-volume "Gimlet" series (1943–1954), whose hero is the dashing British [[commando]] [[Captain Lorrington "Gimlet" King]].
* A 10-volume science fiction series (1954–1963) that follows the interplanetary adventures of retired RAF Group Captain Timothy 'Tiger' Clinton, his son Rex, scientist Professor Lucius Brane (who invents a spaceship powered by [[cosmic rays]]) and Brane's resourceful butler Judkins.

Johns also wrote eight other books of juvenile fiction, twelve books of fiction for adults, and eight factual books, including several books on aviation, books on pirates and treasure hunting, and a book on gardening, ''The Passing Show''.

Unusually among children's writers of the time, from 1935 Johns employed a working-class character as an equal member of the Biggles team – "Ginger" Habblethwaite, later Hebblethwaite, the son of a Northumberland miner. However, readers never learn his real Christian name, and he proclaims himself a Yorkshireman once or twice.

==Death==
W. E. Johns died on 21 June 1968 in his 76th year. Shortly before his death he was writing the final Biggles story, entitled ''Biggles does some Homework'', which shows Biggles at last preparing to retire, and meeting his [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] replacement. The twelve chapters written were issued privately in 1997.&lt;ref name = Homework&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biggles.info/Details/97/ | title = Biggles does some homework – plot summary |website=Biggles.info| accessdate = 2010-02-03 | date = 2006-07-26 | last = Harris | first = R }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Johns' body was cremated at the [[Kingston-upon-Thames]] Crematorium, on Bonner Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for W.E Johns in [[Findagrave]]. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/35221044&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
From 1953  Johns resided at Park House, Hampton Court Road, at [[Hampton Court]] in [[Middlesex]].&lt;ref&gt;'London mansion where the Biggles' children's books were written by Capt.

==Biography==
''By Jove, Biggles!'', a biography of Johns, was published in 1981, written by [[Peter Berresford Ellis]] and Piers Williams. It was republished as ''Biggles! The Life Story of Capt. W. E. Johns'' (Veloce Publishing, 1993, {{ISBN|187410526X}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">'''Welwel''' (also transliterated '''Walwal'''; Italian '''Ual-Ual'''), is a town in eastern [[Ethiopia]] known as the [[Ogaden]]. Located in the [[Werder Zone]] of the [[Somali Region]], this town has a longitude and latitude of {{coord|7|03|N|45|24|E|display=inline,title}} with an elevation of 570 meters above sea level. The [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] has not published an estimate for its 2005 population.

Welwel was the [[oasis]] in Ethiopia where a [[Walwal Incident|border clash]] occurred in 1934 between the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] and [[Ethiopian Empire]]. [[Benito Mussolini]] used this incident as a pretext to invade Ethiopia, which led to the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. 

Records at the Nordic Africa Institute website provide details of a test oil well drilled at Welwel by [[Sinclair Oil]] in 1955, and about Fitawrari Wolde Amanuel primary school in Welwel during the year 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/vw/ORTWEL.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"] (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 14 August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''William Everett Scotten''''' born 24 August 1904 in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] died 27 November 1958 was an [[American diplomat]] who was the author of the '''Scotten Report''' about [[the Mafia]] in Sicily during World War II.

==Career==
The son of William E. Scotten of the Scotten Tobacco Company and Florence Scotten (née Fleming), Scotten attended the [[University of Southern California]] where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Latin]] in 1925. He then attended the [[University of Paris]] from 1926 to 1927 where he studied Art History. His first [[United States Foreign Service]] posting was as the U.S. vice consul in [[Ciudad Juarez]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;p. 275 Corfield, Justin ''Historical Dictionary of Ho Chi Minh City'' Anthem Press, 1 Nov. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He then served as [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] from 1931 to 1932. Later he went to [[Hong Kong]] where he married Josephine Bryant in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=United States. Dept. of|title=The Biographic Register|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNYWAAAAYAAJ|year=1943|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 he served in [[Palermo]] as the American vice-counsel for three years. In 1939 he was serving as the Second Secretary of the American Legation at [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pasadena Plays Gaiety Across Board at Ball'' ''Chicago Tribune'' 29 January 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he was posted to the [[Tangier International Zone]] as the consul and second secretary in [[Tangier]] in March 1942.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Service List ...United States. Dept. of State'' U.S. Government Printing Office, 1942&lt;/ref&gt; He was later commissioned in the United States Army.

Based on his experience in Palermo, Captain Scotten was called upon by the Commissioner of Public Safety of the [[Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories|Allied Military Government Headquarters]] to write a report on the Mafia in Sicily and its affect on the Allied Occupation.  Scotten wrote a six page report ''The Problem of the Mafia in Sicily'' in October 29, 1943.

Scotten's report detailed the history of the Mafia and concluded with three possible actions.

1) Direct and prompt action to bring the Mafia under control&lt;br&gt;
2) A negotiated truce with Mafia leaders &lt;br&gt;
3) Abandonment of any attempt to control the Mafia&lt;ref&gt;pp. 204-206Newark, Timothy ''The Mafia at War: Allied Collusion with the Mob'' Casemate Publishers, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotten finished the war as a Major in Vienna.  He was made a Knight of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;Weekly Bulletin, Volume 3 Allied Commission for Austria  1946&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Allied Commission Weekly Bulletin'', Volume 2 Allied Commission, Public Relations Branch., 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==

He retired in [[Orange County, California]], where he died in on 27 November 1958.&lt;ref name="Corfield2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corfield|first=Justin|title=Historical Dictionary of Ho Chi Minh City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qBybCK8NjkEC&amp;pg=PA275|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-0-85728-235-4|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military operations in [[World War II]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began on 6 April 1941, when the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|swiftly conquered by Axis forces]] and partitioned between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and client regimes. Subsequently, a guerrilla [[liberation war]] was fought against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupying forces and their locally established puppet regimes, including the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and the Serbian [[Government of National Salvation]], by the [[KPJ|Communist]]-led republican [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Simultaneously, a multi-side [[civil war]] was waged between the Yugoslav communist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], the Serbian royalist [[Chetniks]], Croatian fascist [[Ustashe]] and [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Home Guard]], as well as [[Slovene Home Guard]] troops.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pages=145-155}}

Both the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetnik movement initially resisted the occupation. However, after 1941, Chetniks extensively and systematically collaborated with the [[Military history of Italy during World War II|Italian occupation forces]] until the [[Italian capitulation]], and thereon also with [[Wehrmacht|German]] and Ustashe forces.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=145-155}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=246}} The Axis mounted a [[Seven anti-Partisan offensives|series of offensives]] intended to destroy the Partisans, coming close to doing so in the [[Battle of Neretva]] and [[Battle of Sutjeska]] in the spring and summer of 1943.

Despite the setbacks, the Partisans remained a credible fighting force, with [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|their organization]] gaining recognition from the Western Allies at the [[Tehran Conference#Results|Tehran Conference]] and laying the foundations for the [[SFRY|post-war Yugoslav state]]. With support in logistics and air power from the Western Allies, and [[Red Army|Soviet ground troops]] in the [[Belgrade Offensive]], the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and of the border regions of [[Trieste#World War II and aftermath|Trieste]] and [[Carinthia (state)#From 1920 to the Present|Carinthia]].

The [[World War II casualties|human cost of the war]] was enormous. The number of war victims is still in dispute, but is generally agreed to have been at least one million. Non-combat victims included the majority of the country's [[Jewish]] population, many of whom perished in [[concentration camp|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]]s (e.g. [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], [[Banjica concentration camp|Banjica]]) run by the client regimes.

The Ustashe regime (mostly [[Croats]], but also [[Bosniaks|Muslims]] and others) committed [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide against Serbs]], Jews, [[Romani people|Roma]] and anti-Fascist [[Croats]]. The Chetniks (mostly [[Serbs]], but also [[Montenegrins]] and others) pursued [[Serbian war crimes in World War II|genocide]] against [[Bosniaks|Muslims]], [[Croats]] and Pro-Partisan [[Serbs]], and the Italian occupation authorities pursued violence and [[ethnic cleansing]] ([[Italianization]]) against [[Slovenes]] and Croats. The Wehrmacht carried out mass executions of civilians in retaliation for resistance activity e.g., the [[Kragujevac massacre]]. [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|SS Division "Prinz Eugen"]] massacred large number of civilians and prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomasevich|first1=Jozo|title=War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941 - 1945|date=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804779241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqUSGevFe5MC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian occupation troops massacred civilians (mostly Serbs and Jews) during the [[Novi Sad raid|a major raid in southern Bačka]], under the pretext of suppressing resistance activities.

Finally, during and after the final stages of the war, Yugoslav authorities and Partisan troops carried out reprisals, including the deportation of the [[Danube Swabian]] population, forced marches and executions of thousands of captured soldiers and civilians (predominantly Croats associated with the NDH, but also Slovenes and others)  fleeing their advance (the [[Bleiburg repatriations]]), atrocities against the Italian population in [[Istria]] (the [[Foibe massacres]]) and [[Communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45|purges against Serbs, Hungarians and Germans associated with the fascist forces]].

==Background==
Prior to the outbreak of war, the government of [[Milan Stojadinović]] (1935–1939) tried to navigate between the [[Axis Powers]] and the imperial powers by seeking neutral status, signing a non-aggression treaty with Italy and extending its treaty of friendship with France. In the same time, the country was destabilized by internal tensions, as Croatian leaders demanded a greater level of autonomy. Stojadinović was sacked by the regent [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] in 1939 and replaced by [[Dragiša Cvetković]], who negotiated a compromise with Croatian leader [[Vladko Maček]] in 1939, resulting in the formation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]].

However, rather than reducing tensions, the agreement only reinforced the crisis in the country's governance.{{sfn|Trbovich|pages=131-132}} Groups from both sides of the political spectrum were not satisfied: the pro-fascist [[Ustaše]] sought an independent Croatia allied with the Axis, Serbian public and military circles preferred alliance with the Western European empires, while the then-banned [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] saw the [[Soviet Union]] as a natural ally.

After the [[fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in May 1940, the UK was the only empire in conflict with the Axis powers, and Prince Paul and the government saw no way of saving Yugoslavia except through adopting policies of accommodation with the Axis powers. Although [[Hitler]] was not particularly interested in creating another front in the [[Balkans]], and Yugoslavia itself remained at peace during the first year of the war, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy had [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]] in April 1939 and launched the rather unsuccessful [[Italo-Greek War]] in October 1940. These events resulted in Yugoslavia's geographical isolation from potential [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] support. The government tried to negotiate with the Axis on cooperation with as few concessions as possible, while attempting secret negotiations with the Allies and the Soviet Union, but those moves would fail to keep the country out of the war.{{sfn|Lampe|page=198}} A secret mission to the US, led by the influential Serbian-Jewish Captain [[David Albala]] with the purpose of obtaining funding to buy arms for the expected invasion went nowhere, while Stalin expelled Yugoslav Ambassador Gavrilovic just one month after agreeing a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Gorodetsky2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabriel Gorodetsky|title=Stafford Cripps' Mission to Moscow, 1940-42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0hGHrq7d4C&amp;pg=PA130|date=8 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52220-5|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1941==
Having steadily fallen within the orbit of the Axis during 1940 after events such as the [[Second Vienna Award]], Yugoslavia followed Bulgaria and formally joined the Axis powers by signing the [[Tripartite Pact]] on 25 March 1941. Air force officers opposed to the move [[Yugoslav coup d'état|staged a coup d'état]] and took over in the following days. These events were viewed with great apprehension in Berlin, and as it was preparing to help its Italian ally in its war against Greece anyway, the plans were [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|modified to include Yugoslavia]] as well.

===Invasion===
{{Main|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|thumbnail|left|Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia 1941.]]
On 6 April 1941 the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] from all sides by the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and [[Hungary during World War II|their ally Hungary]].
During the invasion, [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|Belgrade was bombed]] by the German air force (''[[Luftwaffe]]''). The invasion lasted little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] on 17 April. Besides being hopelessly ill-equipped when compared to the German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]''), the Yugoslav army attempted to defend all borders but only managed to thinly spread the limited resources available. Also, large numbers of the population refused to fight, instead welcoming the Germans as liberators from government oppression. However, as this meant each individual ethnic group would turn to movements opposed to the unity promoted by the South Slavic state, two different concepts of resistance emerged, the monarchist [[Chetniks]], and the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].{{sfn|Roberts|page=26}}

Two of the principal constituent national groups, Slovenes and Croats, were not prepared to fight in defense of a Yugoslav state with a continued [[Karađorđević dynasty|Serb monarchy]]. The only effective opposition to the invasion was from units wholly from Serbia itself.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=92}} The Serbian General Staff was united on the question of Yugoslavia as a "Greater Serbia" ruled, in one way or another, by Serbia. On the eve of the invasion, there were 165 generals on the Yugoslav active list. Of these, all but four were Serbs.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=89}}

The terms of the capitulation were extremely severe, as the Axis proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Germany annexed northern [[Slovenia]], while retaining [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|direct occupation over a rump Serbian state]], and considerable influence over its newly created [[puppet state]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]], which extended over much of today's [[Croatia]] and contained all of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Mussolini's Italy gained the remainder of Slovenia, [[Kosovo]], and large chunks of the coastal [[Dalmatia]] region (along with nearly all of the [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] islands and the [[Bay of Kotor]]). It also gained control over the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]], and was granted the kingship in the Independent State of Croatia, though wielding little real power within it. [[Kingdom of Hungary (Regency)|Hungary]] dispatched the [[Hungarian Third Army]] to [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|occupy Vojvodina]] in northern Serbia, and later [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|forcibly annexed sections of Baranja, Bačka, Međimurje, and Prekmurje]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html Hungary profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203003152/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html |date=3 February 2007 }}, Shoah Foundation Institute Visual History Archive; usc.edu; accessed 4 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|The Bulgarian army]] moved in on 19 April 1941, occupying nearly all of the modern-day [[Republic of Macedonia]] and some districts of eastern Serbia which, with Greek western Thrace and eastern Macedonia (the Aegean Province), were annexed by Bulgaria on 14 May.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=24}}

The [[Yugoslav government-in-exile|government in exile]] was now only recognized by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]].{{sfn|Talmon|1998|page=294}} The [[Axis powers|Axis]] had recognized the territorial acquisitions of their allied states.{{sfn|Thomas|1995}}{{sfn|Lemkin|2008|pages=241–64}}

===Early resistance===
Various military formations more or less linked to the general liberation movement were involved in armed confrontations with Axis forces which erupted in various areas of Yugoslavia in the ensuing weeks. {{quote|In the beginning there had been two resistance movements in Yugoslavia, the Chetniks and the Partisans. The resistance of the Chetniks had lasted only until the autumn of 1941, their leaders then going over to the enemy or returning to passivity.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Introduction}}}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0723, Marburg-Drau, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Maribor]], Yugoslavia in 1941. He later ordered his officials "to make these lands German again".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=85}}]]
From the start, the Yugoslav resistance forces consisted of two factions: the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], a communist-led movement propagating pan-Yugoslav tolerance ("[[brotherhood and unity]]") and incorporating republican, left-wing and liberal elements of Yugoslav politics, on one hand, and the [[Chetniks]], a conservative royalist and nationalist force, enjoying support almost exclusively from the [[Serbs|Serbian]] population in occupied Yugoslavia, on the other hand. Initially the Chetniks received recognition from the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], while the Partisans were supported by the [[Soviet Union]].

At the very beginning, the Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed, and without any infrastructure. But they had two major advantages over other military and [[paramilitary]] formations in former Yugoslavia:  the first and most immediate advantage was a small but valuable cadre of [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans. Unlike some of the other military and paramilitary formations, these veterans had experience with a modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those found in World War II Yugoslavia. In Slovenia, the Partisans likewise drew on the experienced [[TIGR]] members to train troops.

Their other major advantage, which became more apparent in later stages of War, was in the Partisans being founded on a socialist ideology rather than [[ethnicity]]. Therefore, they won support that crossed national lines, meaning they could expect at least some levels of support in almost any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations limited to territories with Croat or Serb majority. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.

Although the activity of the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] Partisans were part of the Yugoslav People's Liberation War, the specific conditions in Macedonia and Slovenia, due to the strong [[Autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] tendencies of the local communists, led to the creation of a separate sub-armies called the [[People's Liberation Army of Macedonia]], and [[Slovene Partisans]] led by [[Liberation Front of the Slovene People]], respectively.

The most numerous local force, besides the four second-line German Wehrmacht infantry divisions assigned to occupation duties was the [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Croatian Home Guard]] (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo''), founded in April 1941, a few days after the founding of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) itself. It was done with the authorisation of German occupation authorities. The task of the new Croatian armed forces was to defend the new state against both foreign and domestic enemies.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=419}}

The Croatian Home Guard was originally limited to 16 infantry [[battalions]] and 2 cavalry [[Squadron (army)|squadrons]] – 16,000 men in total. The original 16 battalions were soon enlarged to 15 infantry regiments of two battalions each between May and June 1941, organised into five divisional commands, some 55,000 enlisted men.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=12}} Support units included 35 light tanks supplied by Italy,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=420}} 10 artillery battalions (equipped with captured Royal Yugoslav Army weapons of Czech origin), a cavalry regiment in [[Zagreb]] and an independent cavalry battalion at [[Sarajevo]]. Two independent motorized infantry battalions were based at Zagreb and Sarajevo respectively.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=13}} Several regiments of Ustaše militia were also formed at this time, which operated under a separate command structure to, and independently from, the Croatian Home Guard, until late 1944.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}} The Home Guard crushed the [[June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina|Serb revolt in Eastern Herzegovina]] in June 1941, and in July they fought in Eastern and Western Bosnia. They fought in Eastern Herzegovina again, when Croatian-Dalmatian and Slavonian battalions reinforced local units.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=13}}

The Italian High Command assigned 24 divisions and three coastal brigades to occupation duties in Yugoslavia from 1941. These units were located from Slovenia, Croatia and Dalmatia through to Montenegro and Kosovo.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=10}}

From 1931-39, the Soviet Union had prepared communists for a guerrilla war in Yugoslavia. On the eve of the war, hundreds of future prominent Yugoslav communist leaders completed special "partisan courses" organized by the Soviet military intelligence in the Soviet Union and Spain.{{sfn|Timofejev|2011}} [[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Higgins|1966|pages=11–59, 98–151}} On the same day, Yugoslav Partisans formed the [[First Sisak Partisan Detachment|1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]], was the first armed anti-fascist resistance unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II.{{sfn|Pavličević|2007|pages=441–442}} Founded in the [[Brezovica Forest]] near [[Sisak]], Croatia, its creation marked the beginning of anti-Axis resistance in occupied Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Pavličević|2007|pages=441–442}}

After the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July 1941, a date which was later marked as Fighter's Day – a public holiday in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. In the village of [[Bela Crkva (Krupanj)|Bela Crkva]], Spanish veteran [[Žikica Jovanović Španac]] shot the first bullet of the campaign on 7 July 1941, a date that later became known as the "Day of Uprising of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]]". On 10 August 1941 in Stanulović, a mountain village, the Partisans formed the Kopaonik Partisan Detachment Headquarters. Their liberated area, consisting of nearby villages and called the "Miners Republic", was the first in Yugoslavia, and lasted 42 days. The resistance fighters formally joined the ranks of the Partisans later on.

The [[Chetnik movement]] was organized after the surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] by some of the remaining Yugoslav soldiers. This force was organized in the [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]] district of western Serbia under Colonel [[Draža Mihailović]]. However, unlike the Partisans, Mihailović's forces were almost entirely ethnic Serbs. He directed his units to arm themselves and await his orders for the final push. Mihailović avoided direct action against the Axis, which he judged were of low strategic importance.

The royalist [[Chetniks]] (officially the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, JVUO), under the command of General Draža Mihailović, drew primarily from the scattered remnants of the Royal Yugoslav Army, relying overwhelmingly on the ethnic Serbian population for support. They were formed soon after the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the surrender of the government on 17 April 1941. The Chetniks were initially the only [[resistance movement]] recognized by the [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]] and the Western Allies. The Partisans and Chetniks attempted to cooperate early during the conflict, but this quickly fell apart.

[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1941.png|thumb|Uprising in Yugoslavia, September 1941.]]
In September 1941, Partisans organized [[sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb]].
As the levels of resistance to its occupation grew, the Axis Powers responded with numerous minor offensives. There were also [[Seven anti-partisan offensives|seven major Axis operations]] specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]].

The [[Operation Uzice|First Anti-Partisan Offensive]] was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the "[[Republic of Užice]]", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility.

After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailović, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 1980, P. 80&lt;/ref&gt; This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailović advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the Užice attack (see [[First Anti-Partisan Offensive]]), but Britain continued to do so.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+yu0031) LCWeb2.loc.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the [[1st Proletarian Assault Brigade (Yugoslav Partisans)|1st Proletarian Assault Brigade]] (''1. Proleterska Udarna Brigada'') – the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the "Day of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]".

On 15 January 1942, the Bulgarian 1st Army, with 3 infantry divisions, transferred to south-eastern Serbia. Headquartered at [[Niš]], it replaced German divisions needed in Croatia and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=32}}

The Chetniks initially enjoyed the support of the Western Allies (up to the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943). In 1942, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' featured an article which praised the "success" of Mihailović's Chetniks and heralded him as the sole defender of freedom in Nazi-occupied Europe.

Tito's Partisans fought the Germans more actively during this time. Tito and Mihailović had a bounty of 100,000 [[Reichsmark]]s offered by Germans for their heads. While "officially" remaining mortal enemies of the Germans and the [[Ustaše]], the Chetniks were known for making clandestine deals with the Italians and other occupying forces. The [[Second Enemy Offensive]] was a coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. The Partisan troops once again avoided encirclement and were forced to retreat over the [[Igman]] mountain near [[Sarajevo]].

The [[Operation Trio|Third Enemy Offensive]], an offensive against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia, [[Montenegro]], [[Sandžak]] and [[Hercegovina]] which took place in the spring of 1942. It was known as ''Operation TRIO'' by the Germans, and again ended with a timely Partisan escape. This attack is mistakenly identified by some sources as the [[Battle of Kozara]], which took place in the summer of 1942.

The Partisans fought an increasingly successful [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]] against the Axis occupiers and their [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Yugoslavia|local collaborators]], including the Chetniks (which they also considered collaborators). They enjoyed gradually increased levels of success and support of the general populace, and succeeded in controlling large chunks of Yugoslav territory. [[People's committees]] were organized to act as civilian governments in areas of the country liberated by the Partisans. In places, even limited arms industries were set up.

To gather [[military intelligence|intelligence]], agents of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were infiltrated into both the Partisans and the Chetniks. The intelligence gathered by liaisons to the resistance groups was crucial to the success of supply missions and was the primary influence on Allied strategy in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the decline of the Chetniks and their eclipse by Tito's Partisans. In 1942, though supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. In November 1942, Partisan detachments were officially merged into the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (''NOV i POJ'').

==1943==

===Critical Axis offensives===
In the first half of 1943 two Axis offensives came close to defeating the Partisans.  They are known by their German code names [[Case White|Fall Weiss]] ''(Case White)'' and [[Case Black|Fall Schwarz]] ''(Case Black)'', as the Battle of Neretva and the Battle of Sutjeska after the rivers in the areas they were fought, or the Fourth and Fifth Enemy Offensive, respectively, according to former Yugoslav historiography.

On 7 January 1943, the Bulgarian 1st Army also occupied south-west Serbia. Savage pacification measures reduced Partisan activity appreciably. Bulgarian infantry divisions participated in the [[Fifth anti-Partisan Offensive]] as a blocking force of the Partisan escape-route from [[Montenegro]] into [[Serbia]] and in the [[Sixth anti-Partisan Offensive]] in Eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=32}}

[[German–Yugoslav Partisan negotiations|Negotiations between Germans and Partisans]] started on 11 March 1943 in [[Gornji Vakuf]], Bosnia. Tito's key officers [[Vladimir Velebit]], [[Koča Popović]] and [[Milovan Đilas]] brought three proposals, first about an exchange of prisoners, second about the implementation of international law on treatment of prisoners and third about political questions.{{sfn|Lekovic|1985|page=83}}  The delegation expressed concerns about the Italian involvement in supplying the Chetnik army and stated that the National Liberation Movement is an independent movement, with no aid from the Soviet Union or the UK.{{sfn|Lekovic|1985|page=86,87}} Somewhat later, Đilas and Velebit were brought to Zagreb to continue the negotiations.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|page=245}}

In the [[Case White|Fourth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Neretva or ''Fall Weiss'' (Case White), Axis forces pushed Partisan troops to retreat from [[Bihać Republic|western Bosnia]] to northern [[Herzegovina]], culminating in the Partisan retreat over the [[Neretva]] river. It took place from January to April, 1943.

[[File:Jugoslavija i Evropa maj 1943.jpg|thumb|Partisan liberated territory in Yugoslavia, May 1943.]]

The [[Case Black|Fifth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Sutjeska or ''Fall Schwarz'' (Case Black), immediately followed the Fourth Offensive and included a complete encirclement of Partisan forces in southeastern Bosnia and northern Montenegro in May and June 1943.

{{quote|In that August of my arrival [1943] there were over 30 enemy divisions on the territory of Jugoslavia, as well as a large number of satellite and police formations of Ustashe and Domobrani (military formations of the puppet Croat State), German Sicherheitsdienst, chetniks, Neditch militia, Ljotitch militia, and others. The partisan movement may have counted up to 150,000 fighting men and women (perhaps five per cent women) in close and inextricable co-operation with several million peasants, the people of the country. Partisan numbers were liable to increase rapidly.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Contact}}}}

The Croatian Home Guard reached its maximum size at the end of 1943, when it had 130,000 men. It also included an air force, the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (''Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske'', or ZNDH), the backbone of which was provided by 500 former [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers and 1,600 NCOs with 125 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Savic, et al., 2002, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; By 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}}

===Italian capitulation and Allied support for the Partisans===
[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1943.png|thumb|Uprising in occupied Yugoslavia after [[capitulation of Italy]], September 1943.]]

On 8 September 1943, the Italians concluded [[armistice of Cassibile|an armistice with the Allies]], leaving 17 divisions stranded in Yugoslavia. All divisional commanders refused to join the Germans. Two Italian infantry divisions joined the Montenegrin Partisans as complete units, while another joined the Albanian Partisans. Other units surrendered to the Germans to face imprisonment in Germany or summary execution. Others surrendered themselves, arms, ammunition and equipment to Croatian forces or to the Partisans, simply disintegrated, or reached Italy on foot via Trieste or by ship across the Adriatic.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=12}} The Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] was disestablished and the country's possessions were subsequently divided between Germany, which established its [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], and the Independent State of Croatia, which established the new district of Sidraga-Ravni Kotari. The former Italian kingdoms [[Albania under Nazi Germany|of Albania]] and [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|of Montenegro]] were placed under German occupation.

The events, which occurred in 1943 would bring about change in the attitude of the Allies. The Germans were executing [[Case Black|Operation Schwarz]] (Battle of Sutjeska, the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when [[William Deakin|F.W.D. Deakin]] was sent by the British to gather information. His reports contained two important observations. The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain]] and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had transited from the Soviet Union on rail lines through [[Chetniks|Chetnik]]-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. Even though today many circumstances, facts, and motivations remain unclear, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy.

The [[Operation Kugelblitz|Sixth Enemy Offensive]] was a series of operations undertaken by the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Ustaše]] after the [[capitulation of Italy]] in an attempt to secure the [[Adriatic]] coast. It took place in the autumn and winter of 1943/1944.

At this point the Partisans were able to win the moral, as well as limited material support of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who until then had supported General [[Draža Mihailović]]'s Chetnik Forces, but were finally convinced of their collaboration by many intelligence-gathering missions dispatched to both sides during the course of the war.

In September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] was parachuted to Tito's headquarters near [[Drvar]] to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 1946, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[AVNOJ]] (the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] wartime council in Yugoslavia) was eventually recognized by the Allies, by late 1943, the official recognition of the Partisan [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] soon followed. The [[National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia]] was recognized by the major Allied powers at the [[Tehran Conference]], when United States agreed to the position of other Allied.&lt;ref&gt;Rendulić, Zlatko. ''Avioni domaće konstrukcije posle drugog svetskog rata'' (Domestic aircraft construction after World War II), Lola institute, Beograd, 1996, p 10. "At the [[Teheran Conference]] of 28 November to 1 December 1943, NOVJ is recognized as an allied army, this time by all three allied sides, and for the first time by the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; The newly recognized Yugoslav government, headed by Prime Minister [[Josip Broz Tito]], was a joint body formed of AVNOJ members and the members of the former government-in-exile in London. The resolution of a fundamental question, whether the new state remained a monarchy or was to be a republic, was postponed until the end of the war, as was the status of King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]].

Subsequent to switching their support to the Partisans, the Allies set-up the [[RAF Balkan Air Force]] (under the suggestion of Brigadier-General Fitzroy Maclean) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito's Partisan forces.

==1944==

===Last Axis offensive===
In January 1944, Tito's forces unsuccessfully attacked [[Banja Luka]]. But, while Tito was forced to withdraw, Mihajlović and his forces were also noted by the Western press for their lack of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| date =17 January 1944| title = While Tito Fights| journal = Time Magazine| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,796332,00.html| accessdate =14 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventh Enemy Offensive]] was the final Axis attack in western Bosnia in the spring of 1944, which included ''Operation Rösselsprung'' (Knight's Leap), an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate Josip Broz Tito personally and annihilate the leadership of the Partisan movement.

===Partisan growth to domination===
[[File:Yugoslav-leader-marsal-tito-talking-with-itzroy-maclean.jpg|thumb|Marshal Tito talking with Brigadier General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]]]]

Allied aircraft specifically started targeting ZNDH ([[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]]) and [[Luftwaffe]] bases and aircraft for the first time as a result of the [[Operation Rösselsprung (1944)|Seventh Offensive]], including ''Operation Rösselsprung'' in late May 1944. Up until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will, as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during ''Rösselsprung'' as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full [[Air supremacy|aerial superiority]]. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.&lt;ref&gt;Ciglic, et al., 2007, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yugoslav Partisan movement grew to become the largest resistance force in occupied Europe, with 800,000 men organized in 4 [[field army|field armies]]. Eventually the Partisans prevailed against all of their opponents as the official army of the newly founded [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] (later Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).

In 1944, the Macedonian and Serbian commands made contact in southern Serbia and formed a joint command, which consequently placed the Macedonian Partisans under the direct command of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]].&lt;ref&gt;Narodnooslobodilačka Vojska Jugoslavije. Beograd. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The Slovene Partisans also merged with Tito's forces in 1944.&lt;ref name="McQueen2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=James |editor=Linda McQueen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwBUkHaz76QC |title=Slovenia |publisher=New Holland Publishers |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-86011-336-9 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Klemenčič|Žagar|2004|pp=167–168}}

On 16 June 1944, the [[Tito-Šubašić agreement]] between the Partisans and the Yugoslavian Government in exile of King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was signed on the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. This agreement was an attempt to form a new Yugoslav government which would include both the communists and the [[Monarchism|royalists]]. It called for a merge of the Partisan [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] (''Antifašističko V(ij)eće Narodnog Oslobođenja Jugoslavije'', AVNOJ) and the Government in exile. The Tito-Šubašić agreement also called on all Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs to join the Partisans. The Partisans were recognized by the Royal Government as Yugoslavia's regular army. Mihajlović and many Chetniks refused to answer the call. The Chetniks were, however, praised for [[Operation Halyard|saving 500 downed Allied pilots]] in 1944; United States President Harry S. Truman posthumously awarded Mihailović the [[Legion of Merit]] for his contribution to the Allied victory.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Allied advances in Romania and Bulgaria===
[[File:Balkanfront 19440831-19441130.png|thumb|230px|Map of German retreat in autumn 1944 (week by week)]]
In August 1944 after the [[Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]] overwhelmed the front line of Germany's [[Army Group South Ukraine]], [[King Michael's Coup|King Michael I of Romania staged a coup]], Romania quit the war, and the Romanian army was placed under the command of the [[Red Army]]. Romanian forces, fighting against Germany, participated in the [[Prague Offensive]]. [[Bulgaria]] quit as well and, on 10 September, declared war on Germany and its remaining allies. The weak divisions sent by the [[Axis powers]] to invade Bulgaria were easily driven back. In Macedonia, the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces and betrayed by high-ranking military commanders, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In Late September 1944 three Bulgarian armies, some 455,000 strong in total led by General Georgi Marinov Mandjev from the village of Goliamo Sharkovo – Elhovo, entered Yugoslavia with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Southern and eastern Serbia and Macedonia were liberated within two months and the 130,000-strong [[Bulgarian First Army]] continued to Hungary.

On 10 September 1944, Bulgaria changed sides and declared war on Germany as an Allied Power. The Germans swiftly disarmed the 1st Occupation Corps of 5 divisions and the 5th Army, despite short-lived resistance by the latter. Survivors retreated to the old borders of Bulgaria. After the occupation of Bulgaria by the Soviet army negotiations between Tito and the Bulgarian Communist leaders were organized, resulting in a military alliance between them. The new Bulgarian Peoples Army and the Red Army 3rd Ukrainian Front troops were concentrated at the old Bulgarian-Yugoslav border. On 8 October, they entered Yugoslavia. The First and Fourth Bulgarian Armies invaded [[Vardar Macedonia]], and the Second Army south-eastern Serbia. The First Army then swung north with the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front, through eastern Yugoslavia and south-western Hungary, before linking up with the British 8th Army in Austria in May 1945.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=33}}

===Liberation of Belgrade and eastern Yugoslavia===
[[File:1944 Yugoslavia liberated territories.jpg|thumb|right|Territories under Partisan control, September 1944]]
Concurrently, with Allied air support and assistance from the Red Army, the Partisans turned their attention to [[Central Serbia]]. The chief objective was to disrupt railroad communications in the valleys of the Vardar and Morava rivers, and prevent Germans from withdrawing their 300,000+ forces from Greece.

The Allied air forces sent 1,973 aircraft (mostly from the US 15th Air Force) over Yugoslavia, which discharged over 3,000 tons of bombs. On 17 August 1944 Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] offered an amnesty to all collaborators. On 12 September, King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] broadcast a message from London, calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to "join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito".  The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many of them switched sides to the Partisans.

In September, the Red Army and the Partisans launched the [[Belgrade Offensive]], and took the city on 20 October. At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia—Serbia, [[Vardar Macedonia|Macedonia]], Montenegro—as well as most of the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. The Wehrmacht and the forces of the Ustaše-controlled [[Independent State of Croatia]] fortified a [[Syrmian Front|front in Syrmia]] that held through the winter of 1944–45 in order to aid the evacuation of German [[Army Group E]] from the Balkans. To raise the number of Partisan troops Tito  again offered the amnesty on 21 November 1944. In November 1944, the units of the Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard were reorganized and combined to form the Army of the Independent State of Croatia.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}}

==1945==
{{quote|Every German unit which could safely evacuate from Jugoslavia might count itself lucky.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Rules and Reasons}}}}
The Germans continued their retreat. Having lost the easier withdrawal route through Serbia, they fought to hold the Syrmian front in order to secure the more difficult passage through Kosovo, Sandzak and Bosnia. They even scored a series of temporary successes against the People's Liberation Army. They left Mostar on 22 February 1945. They did not leave Sarajevo until 15 April. Sarajevo had assumed a last-moment strategic position as the only remaining withdrawal route and was held at substantial cost. In early March the Germans moved troops from southern Bosnia to support an unsuccessful counter-offensive in Hungary, which enabled the NOV to score some successes by attacking the Germans' weakened positions. Although strengthened by Allied aid, a secure rear and mass conscription in areas under their control, the one-time partisans found it difficult to switch to conventional warfare, particularly in the open country west of Belgrade, where the Germans held their own until mid-April in spite of all of the raw and untrained conscripts the NOV hurled in a bloody war of attrition against the Syrmian Front.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=258}}

On 8 March 1945, a coalition Yugoslav government was formed in Belgrade with Tito as Premier and [[Ivan Šubašić]] as Foreign Minister.

===Partisan general offensive===
On 20 March 1945, the Partisans launched a general offensive in the [[Mostar]]-[[Višegrad]]-[[Drina River|Drina]] sector. With large swaths of Bosnian, Croatian and Slovenian countryside already under Partisan guerrilla control, the final operations consisted in connecting these territories and capturing major cities and roads. For the general offensive Marshal Josip Broz Tito commanded a Partisan force of about 800,000 men organized into four [[field army|armies]]: the [[1st Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|1st Army]] commanded by [[Peko Dapčević]], [[2nd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|2nd Army]] commanded by [[Koča Popović]], [[3rd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|3rd Army]] commanded by [[Kosta Nađ]], and the [[4th Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|4th Army]] commanded by [[Petar Drapšin]]. In addition, the Yugoslav Partisans had eight independent army corps (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and the 10th).

Set against the Yugoslav Partisans was German General [[Alexander Löhr]] of [[Army Group E]] (''[[Army Group E|Heeresgruppe E]]''). This Army Group had seven army corps (the [[XV Mountain Corps (Germany)|XV Mountain]], [[XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps|XV Cossack]], [[XXI Mountain Corps (Germany)|XXI Mountain]], XXXIV, LXIX, and [[LXXXXVII Corps (Germany)|LXXXXVII]]). These corps included seventeen weakened divisions ([[1st Cossack Division|1st Cossack]], 2nd Cossack, [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|7th SS]], [[11th Luftwaffe Field Division|11th]] [[Luftwaffe Field Division]], 22nd, [[41st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|41st]], 104th, 117th, 138th, [[181st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|181st]], 188th,  237th, [[297th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|297th]], [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Croat]], [[373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|373rd Croat]], [[392nd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|392nd Croat]] and the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Ukrainian)|14th SS Ukrainian Division]]). In addition to the seven corps, the Axis had remnant naval and [[Luftwaffe]] forces, under constant attack by the British [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]].{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=9}}
[[File:Royal Air Force- Italy, the Balkans and South-east Europe, 1942-1945. CL3482.jpg|thumb|320px|British [[RAF Regiment|RAF field regiment]] in Croatia with German prisoners captured by partisan forces at [[Bihać]]]]
The army of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] was at the time composed of eighteen divisions: 13 infantry, two mountain, two assault and one replacement Croatian Divisions, each with its own [[Organic unit|organic]] artillery and other support units. There were also several armoured units. From early 1945, the Croatian Divisions were allocated to various German corps and by March 1945 were holding the Southern Front.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}} Securing the rear areas were some 32,000 men of the Croatian [[gendarmerie]] (''Hrvatsko Oruznistvo''), organised into 5 Police Volunteer Regiments plus 15 independent battalions, equipped with standard light infantry weapons, including mortars.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=30}}

The [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (''Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske'', or ZNDH) and the units of the [[Croatian Air Force Legion]] (''Hrvatska Zrakoplovna Legija'', or HZL), returned from service on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] provided some level of air support (attack, fighter and transport) right up until May 1945, encountering and sometimes defeating opposing aircraft from the British [[Royal Air Force]], [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]]. Although 1944 had been a catastrophic year for the ZNDH, with aircraft losses amounting to 234, primarily on the ground, it entered 1945 with 196 machines. Further deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses. By 10 March, the ZNDH had 23 [[Messerschmitt 109]] G&amp;Ks, three [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]], six [[Fiat G.50]], and two [[Messerschmitt 110]] G fighters.  The final deliveries of up-to-date German [[Messerschmitt 109]] G and K fighter aircraft were still taking place in March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Savic &amp; Ciglic, 2002, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; and the ZNDH still had 176 aircraft on its strength in April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ciglic, et al., 2007, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 30 March and 8 April 1945, General Mihailović's Chetniks mounted a final attempt to establish themselves as a credible force fighting the Axis in Yugoslavia. The Chetniks under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Pavle Đurišić]] fought a combination of Ustaša and Croatian Home Guard forces in the [[Battle on Lijevča field]]. In late March 1945 elite NDH Army units were withdrawn from the Syrmian front to destroy Djurisic's Chetniks trying to make their way across the northern NDH.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=256}} The battle was fought near Banja Luka in what was then the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and ended in a decisive victory for the Independent State of Croatia forces.

Serbian units included the remnants of the [[Serbian State Guard]] and the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] from the [[Serbian Military Administration]]. There were even some units of the [[Slovene Home Guard]] (''Slovensko domobranstvo'', SD) still intact in [[Slovenia]].{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=22}}

By the end of March, 1945, it was obvious to the Croatian Army Command that, although the front remained intact, they would eventually be defeated by sheer lack of ammunition. For this reason, the decision was made to retreat into Austria, in order to surrender to the British forces advancing north from Italy.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=101}} The German Army was in the process of disintegration and the supply system lay in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ambrose, S.|title=The Victors – The Men of World War II|location=London|year=1998|isbn= 978-0-684-85629-2|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bihać]] was liberated by the Partisans the same day that the general offensive was launched. The 4th Army, under the command of [[Petar Drapšin]], broke through the defences of the [[XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps]]. By 20 April, Drapšin liberated [[Lika]] and the [[Croatian Littoral]], including the islands, and reached the old Yugoslav border with Italy. On 1 May, after capturing the Italian territories of [[Rijeka]] and [[Istria]] from the German LXXXXVII Corps, the Yugoslav 4th Army beat the western Allies to [[Trieste]] by one day.

The Yugoslav 2nd Army, under the command of [[Koča Popović]], forced a crossing of the [[Bosna River]] on 5 April, capturing [[Doboj]], and reached the [[Una (Sava)|Una River]].  On 6 April, the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Corps of the Yugoslav Partisans took [[Sarajevo]] from the German XXI Corps. On 12 April, the Yugoslav 3rd Army, under the command of [[Kosta Nađ]], forced a crossing of the [[Drava]] river. The 3rd Army then fanned out through [[Podravina]], reached a point north of Zagreb, and crossed the old Austrian border with Yugoslavia in the [[Dravograd]] sector. The 3rd Army closed the ring around the enemy forces when its advanced motorized detachments linked up with detachments of the 4th Army in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]].

Also, on 12 April, the Yugoslav 1st Army, under the command of [[Peko Dapčević]] penetrated the fortified front of the German XXXIV Corps in Syrmia. By 22 April, the 1st Army had smashed the fortifications and was advancing towards Zagreb.

The long-drawn out liberation of western Yugoslavia caused more victims among the population. The breakthrough of the Syrmian front on 12 April was, in [[Milovan Đilas]]'s words, "the greatest and bloodiest battle our army had ever fought", and it would not have been possible had it not been for Soviet instructors and arms.{{sfn|Đilas|1977|page=440}}
By the time General [[Peko Dapčević]]'s NOV units had reached Zagreb, on 9 May 1945, they had perhaps lost as many as 36,000 dead. There were by then over 400,000 refugees in Zagreb.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=259}} After entering Zagreb with the Yugoslav 2nd Army, both armies advanced in Slovenia.

===Final operations===
[[File:1945-05-01GerWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Front lines in Europe 1 May 1945.]]
On 2 May, the German capital city, [[battle of Berlin|Berlin, fell to]] the [[Red Army]]. On 8 May 1945, the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germans surrendered unconditionally]] and the [[Victory in Europe Day|war in Europe officially ended]]. The Italians had quit the war in 1943, the Bulgarians in 1944, and the Hungarians earlier in 1945. Despite the German capitulation, however, sporadic fighting still took place in Yugoslavia. On 7 May, [[Zagreb]] was evacuated, on 9 May, [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]] were captured by the Partisans, and General [[Alexander Löhr]], Commander-in-Chief of [[Army Group E]] was forced to sign the total surrender of the forces under his command at Topolšica, near [[Velenje]], Slovenia, on Wednesday 9 May 1945. Only the Croatian and other anti-Partisan forces remained.

From 10 to 15 May, the Yugoslav Partisans continued to face resistance from Croatian, and other anti-Partisan forces throughout the rest of Croatia and Slovenia. The [[Battle of Poljana]], the last battle of World War II in Europe, started on 14 May, ending on 15 May 1945 at Poljana, near [[Prevalje]] in Slovenia. It was the culmination and last of a series of battles between Yugoslav Partisans and a large (in excess of 30,000) mixed column of German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'') soldiers together with Croatian Ustaše, Croatian Home Guard, Slovenian Home Guard, and other anti-Partisan forces who were attempting to retreat to Austria.

===Aftermath===
{{refimprove|date=February 2014}}
On 5 May, in the town of [[Palmanova]] (50&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Trieste), between 2,400 and 2,800 members of the Serbian Volunteer Corps surrendered to the British. On 12 May, about 2,500 additional Serbian Volunteer Corps members surrendered to the British at Unterbergen on the [[Drava]] River.
On 11 and 12 May, British troops in [[Klagenfurt]], Austria, were harassed by arriving forces of the Yugoslav Partisans.{{Why|date=December 2015}} In Belgrade, the British ambassador to the Yugoslav coalition government handed Tito a note demanding that the Yugoslav troops withdraw from Austria.

On 15 May 1945 a large column of the Croatian Home Guard, the Ustaše, the XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps and the remnants of the Serbian State Guard, and the Serbian Volunteer Corps, arrived at the southern Austrian border near the town of [[Bleiburg]]. The representatives of the Independent State of Croatia attempted to negotiate a surrender to the British under the terms of the [[Geneva Convention]] that they had joined in 1943, and were recognised by it as a "belligerent", but were ignored.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=101}} Most of the people in the column were turned over to the Yugoslav government as part of what is sometimes referred to as [[Operation Keelhaul]]. Following the [[Bleiburg repatriations]], the Partisans proceeded to brutalize the [[POW]]s.

On 15 May, Tito had placed Partisan forces in Austria under Allied control. A few days later he agreed to withdraw them. By 20 May, Yugoslav troops in Austria had begun to withdraw. On 8 June, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia agreed on the control of Trieste. On 11 November, [[Yugoslavian parliamentary election, 1945|parliamentary elections]] were held in Yugoslavia. In these elections the communists had an important advantage because they controlled the police, judiciary and media. For that reason the opposition did not want to participate in the elections.{{sfn|Klemenčič|Žagar|2004|pp=197}} On 29 November, in accordance with election result, Peter II was deposed by communist dominated Yugoslavia's Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref name="AbromeitNorman2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Abromeit|author2=York Norman|author3=Gary Marotta |author4=Bridget Maria Chesterton |title=Transformations of Populism in Europe and the Americas: History and Recent Tendencies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBXfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|date=19 November 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4742-2522-9|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] was established as a [[socialist state]] during the first meeting of the Yugoslav Parliament in Belgrade. [[Josip Broz Tito]] was appointed Prime Minister. The autonomist wing in the [[Communist Party of Macedonia]], which dominated during World War II, was finally pushed aside in 1945 after the Second Assembly of the [[ASNOM]].

On 13 March 1946, Mihailović was captured by agents of the [[OZNA|Yugoslav Department of National Security]] (''Odsjek Zaštite Naroda'' or OZNA). From 10 June to 15 July of the same year, he was tried for [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]]. On 15 July, he was found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852848,00.html "Too Tired"], time.com, 24 June 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July, a clemency appeal was rejected by the Presidium of the National Assembly. During the early hours of 18 July, Mihailović, together with nine other Chetnik and Nedić's officers, was executed in Lisičiji Potok. This execution essentially ended the World War II-era civil war between the communist Partisans and the royalist Chetniks.

The Yugoslav government estimated the number of casualties to be at 1,704,000 and submitted the figure to the International Reparations Commission in 1946 without any documentation.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002|page=161}} The figure included war related deaths but also the expected population if war did not break out, the number of unborn children, and losses from emigration and disease.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|page=108}} The same figure was later submitted to the Allied Reparations Committee in 1948 but was claimed to be only from war related deaths.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|page=108}} After Germany requested verifiable data the Yugoslav Federal Bureau of Statistics created a nationwide survey in 1964.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|page=108}} The total number of those killed was found to be 597,323.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|page=108}} The list stayed a state secret until 1989 when it was published for the first time.{{sfn|Žerjavić|1993}}

The U.S. Bureau of the Census published a report in 1954 that concluded that Yugoslav war related deaths were 1,067,000. The U.S. Bureau of the Census noted that the official Yugoslav government figure of 1.7 million war dead was overstated because it "was released soon after the war and was estimated without the benefit of a postwar census".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of the Census ''The Population of  Yugoslavia'' Ed. Paul F. Meyers and Arthur A. Campbell , Washington D.C.- 1954&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Vladimir Žerjavić]] estimates total war related deaths at 1,027,000. Military losses are estimated at 237,000 [[Yugoslav partisans]] and 209,000 collaborators, while civilian losses at 581,000, including 57,000 Jews. Losses of the Yugoslav Republics were Bosnia 316,000; Serbia 273,000; Croatia 271,000; Slovenia 33,000; Montenegro 27,000; Macedonia 17,000; and killed abroad 80,000.{{sfn|Žerjavić|1993}} Statistician [[Bogoljub Kočović]] calculated that the actual war losses were 1,014,000.{{sfn|Žerjavić|1993}} The late [[Jozo Tomasevich]], Professor Emeritus of Economics at San Francisco State University, believes that the calculations of Kočović and Žerjavić "seem to be free of bias, we can accept them as reliable".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=737}} [[Stjepan Mestrovic]] estimates that about 850,000 people were killed in the war.{{sfn|Mestrovic|2013|page=129}} Vego cites figures from 900,000 to a million dead.{{sfn|Army War College|1994|page=116}} Stephen R. A'Barrow estimates that the war caused 446,000 dead soldiers and 514,000 dead civilians, or 960,000 dead in total from the Yugoslav population out of 15 million.{{sfn|A'Barrow|2016}} 

The reasons for the high human toll in Yugoslavia were as follows:
# Military operations of five main armies (Germans, Italians, [[Ustaše]], [[Yugoslav partisans]] and [[Chetniks]]).{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=744}}
# German forces, under express orders from Hitler, fought with a special [[World War II persecution of Serbs|vengeance against the Serbs]], who were considered [[Untermensch]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=744}} One of the worst massacres during the German military occupation of Serbia was the [[Kragujevac massacre]].
# Deliberate acts of reprisal against target populations were perpetrated by all combatants. All sides practiced the shooting of hostages on a large scale. At the end of the war Ustaše collaborators were killed during the [[Bleiburg massacre]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pages=744–745}}
# The systematic extermination of large numbers of people for political, religious or racial reasons. The most numerous victims were Serbs killed by the Ustaše and Croats and Muslims killed by the Chetniks. The Ustaše massacred Serbs throughout the Independent State of Croatia and especially in [[Banija]], [[Kordun]], Lika, northwest Bosnia, and eastern Herzegovina and killed others in concentration camps such as the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]].

Chetniks carried out massacres against Muslims in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Sandžak]] and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, northern [[Dalmatia]], and [[Lika]]. Jews were partly killed in camps throughout Yugoslavia and partly in camps in Germany, Norway and Greece after deportation.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=747}} In the [[Province of Ljubljana]], Italian authorities led by [[Mario Roatta]] terrorized the [[Slovenes|Slovene]] civilian population and deported them to concentration camps with the goal of [[Italianization|Italianizing]] the area. The large numbers of casualties as a result of the ethnic cleansing the local populace committed on one another, along with the especially brutal methods of execution used-mass hangings, clubbing to death, setting fire to buildings with people inside, etc.,-led even the Germans occupying the area to express shock at the violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rmis/2004/00000009/00000003/art00005 James H.

Most victims were either killed for association with fascist forces such as soldiers and collaborators or were civilians of ethnic groups associated with the fascist forces such as Hungarian, German and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Tanner, Croatia: a Nation Forged in War&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:German Soldierss arresting in 1941 people in Kragujevac.jpg|thumb|Germans escorting people from [[Kragujevac massacre|Kragujevac]] and its surrounding area to be executed.]]
In Slovenia, the [[Institute for Contemporary History, Ljubljana]] launched a comprehensive research on the exact number of victims of World War II in Slovenia in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ds-rs.si/?q=publikacije/zborniki/Zrtve_vojne DS-RS.si] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102638/http://www.ds-rs.si/?q=publikacije%2Fzborniki%2FZrtve_vojne |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a decade of research, the final report was published in 2005, which included a list of names. The number of victims was set at 89,404.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ds-rs.si/dokumenti/publikacije/Zbornik_05-1.pdf DS-RS.si] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102550/http://www.ds-rs.si/dokumenti/publikacije/Zbornik_05-1.pdf |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure also includes the victims of [[Extrajudicial killing|summary killings]] by the Communist regime immediately after the war (around 13,500 people). The results of the research came as a shock for the public, since the actual figures were more than 30% higher than the highest estimates during the Yugoslav period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/89-000-zrtev-vojne-in-revolucije/25226 RTVSLO.si]&lt;/ref&gt; Even counting only the number of deaths up to May 1945 (thus excluding the military prisoners killed by the Yugoslav Army between May and July 1945), the number remains considerably higher than the highest previous estimates (around 75,000 deaths versus a previous estimate of 60,000).

There are several reasons for such a difference. The new comprehensive research also included Slovenes killed by the Partisan resistance, both in battle (members of collaborationist and anti-Communist units), and civilians (around 4,000 between 1941 and 1945). Furthermore, the new estimates includes all the Slovenians from Nazi-occupied Slovenia who were drafted in the Wehrmacht and died either in battle or in prisoner camps during the war. The figure also includes the Slovenes from the [[Julian March]] who died in the Italian Army (1940–43), those from [[Prekmurje]] who died in the Hungarian Army, and those who fought and died in various Allied (mostly British) units. The figure does not include victims from [[Venetian Slovenia]] (except of those who joined the Slovenian Partisan units), nor does it include the victims among [[Carinthian Slovenes]] (again with the exception of those fighting in the Partisan units) and [[Hungarian Slovenes]]. 47% percent of casualties during the war were partisans, 33% were civilians (of which 82% were killed by Axis powers or Slovene home guard), and 20% were members of the Slovene home guard.&lt;ref&gt;Delo, ''Sobotna priloga'', 30 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Croatia, the Commission for the Identification of War and Post-War Victims of the Second World War was active from 1991 until the Seventh Government of the republic, under Prime Minister [[Ivica Račan]] ended the commission in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/308886.html 66 7.6.2002 Zakon o prestanku važenja Zakona o utvrđivanju ratnih i poratnih žrtava II. svjetskog rata], narodne-novine.nn.hr&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, concealed mass grave commissions were established in both [[Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia|Serbia]] to document and excavate mass graves from the Second World War.

===German casualties===
According to German casualty lists quoted by [[The Times]] for 30 July 1945, from documents found amongst the personal effects of General [[Hermann Reinecke]], head of the Public Relations Department of the German High Command, total German casualties in the Balkans amounted to 24,000 killed and 12,000 missing, no figure being mentioned for wounded. A majority of these casualties suffered in the Balkans were inflicted in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=The sixth offensive}} According to German researcher [[Rüdiger Overmans]], German losses in the Balkans were more than three times higher – 103,693 during the course of the war, and some 11,000 who died as Yugoslav prisoners of war.{{sfn|Overmans|2000|p=336}}

===Italian casualties===
The Italians incurred 30,531 casualties during their occupation of Yugoslavia (9,065 killed, 15,160 wounded, 6,306 missing). The ratio of dead/missing men to wounded men was uncommonly high, as Yugoslav partisans would often murder prisoners. Their highest losses were in Bosnia and Herzegovina: 12,394. In Croatia the total was 10,472 and in Montenegro 4,999. Dalmatia was less bellicose: 1,773. The quietest area was Slovenia, where the Italians incurred 893 casualties.&lt;Ref&gt;The South Slav Journal. Volume 6. 1983. Page 117&lt;/ref&gt; An additional [[Military history of Italy during World War II#Casualties|10,090 Italians died]] post-armistice, either killed during [[Operation Achse]] or after joining Yugoslav partisans.
