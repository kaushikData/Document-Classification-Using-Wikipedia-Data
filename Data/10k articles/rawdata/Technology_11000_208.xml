'''Actinometers''' are instruments used to measure the heating [[power (physics)|power]] of [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. They are used in [[meteorology]] to measure [[solar radiation]] as [[Pyranometer|pyranometers]], [[pyrheliometer]]s and [[Net radiometer|net radiometers]].

An actinometer is a chemical system or physical device which determines the number of
photons in a beam integrally or per unit time. This name is commonly
applied to devices used in the [[ultraviolet]] and visible wavelength ranges.
For example, solutions of [[potassium ferrioxalate|iron(III) oxalate]] can be used as a chemical
actinometer, while [[bolometer]]s, [[thermopile]]s, and [[photodiode]]s are physical
devices giving a reading that can be correlated to the number of photons
detected.

==History==

The actinometer was invented by [[John Herschel]] in 1825; he introduced the term ''actinometer'', the first of many uses of the prefix ''actin'' for scientific instruments, effects, and processes.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[actinograph]] is a related device for estimating the actinic power of lighting for photography.

== Chemical actinometry ==

Chemical actinometry involves measuring [[radiant flux]] via the yield from a chemical reaction.  It requires a chemical with a known [[quantum yield]] and easily analyzed reaction products.

=== Choosing an actinometer ===

[[Potassium ferrioxalate]] is commonly used, as it is simple to use and sensitive over a wide  range of relevant wavelengths (254&amp;nbsp;nm to 500&amp;nbsp;nm).  Other actinometers include malachite green leucocyanides, vanadium(V)–iron(III) oxalate and monochloroacetic acid, however all of these undergo dark reactions, that is, they react in the absence of light.  This is undesirable since it will have to be corrected for.  Organic actinometers like [[butyrophenone]] or [[piperylene]] are analysed by gas chromatography.  Other actinometers are more specific in terms of the range of wavelengths at which quantum yields have been determined.  Reinecke’s salt K[Cr(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NCS)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] reacts in the near-UV region although it is thermally unstable.&lt;ref name = "Calvert"&gt;{{cite book

have used 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and benzoic acid as a [[radical scavenger]] for hydroxyl radicals produced in the photolysis of hydrogen peroxide and [[sodium nitrate]].  However, they originally used ferrioxalate actinometry to calibrate the quantum yields for the hydrogen peroxide photolysis.  Radical scavengers proved a viable method of measuring production of hydroxyl radical.

===Chemical actinometry in the visible range===

Meso-diphenylhelianthrene can be used for chemical actinometry in the visible range (400–700&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name="Brauer et al. 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Brauer H-D|author2 = Schmidt R|author3 = Gauglitz G|author4 = Hubig S|title= Chemical actinometry in the visible (475-610 nm) by meso-diphenylhlianthrene|journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology|volume=37| date=1983|pages=595–598|doi = 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1983.tb04526.x|issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chemical measures in the  475–610&amp;nbsp;nm range, but measurements in wider spectral ranges can be done with this chemical if the emission spectrum of the light source is known.

'''ActiveReports''' is a [[.NET Framework|.NET]] reporting tool used by developers of [[WinForms]], [[ASP.NET]], and [[HTML5]] applications. It was originally developed by [[Data Dynamics]], which was then acquired by [[GrapeCity]]. ActiveReports is a set of components and tools that facilitates the production of reports to display data in documents and web-based formats. It is written in managed C# code and allows [[Visual Studio]] programmers to leverage their knowledge of C# or [[Visual Basic.NET]] when programming with ActiveReports.

Among the components included with ActiveReports are exports to file formats such as [[PDF]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], and [[TIFF]]. The main components are a [[Visual Studio]] integrated report designer, and an API that developers use to create customized reports from a variety of data sources. ActiveReports Standard Edition also includes a Visual Query Designer, a customizable Windows Viewer control, an [[HTML5]] Viewer control, and a [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] Viewer control.

The integrated report designer handles three types of reports:

* Section Reports with banded sections like the original ActiveReports (reminiscent of [[Microsoft Access]] reports)
* Page Reports with a fixed layout for forms 
* RDL Reports with a continuous page layout like the original Data Dynamics Reports (uses [[Report Definition Language]])

The Professional Edition of ActiveReports includes the Standard Edition tools plus an End-User Report Designer control that developers use to host the report designer in their own Microsoft Windows applications to let end users create and modify reports. It also includes a server-side ASP.NET web viewer with Flash, PDF, and HTML viewer types; ASP.NET HTTP Handlers that export reports to HTML or PDF format without custom code; a [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] viewer; and advanced PDF encryption and rendering features.

==ActiveReports Server==
ActiveReports Server is a [[Scalability|scalable]] server platform with built in [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]. It provides a secure and [[Extensibility|extensible]] report server to publish reports designed in ActiveReports. A comprehensive [[Representational state transfer|RESTful API]] enables integration of the [[Responsive web design|responsive]] [[HTML5]] Report Portal for end users to view, schedule and export reports.

==Known Issues==

In the past, ActiveReports was known to be unable to handle large reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.asp.net/p/1454550/3327154.aspx?Re+System+Out+of+Memory+Exception+active+reports+asp+net+C+&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was ongoing across years and versions.&lt;ref&gt;http://arhelp.grapecity.com/groups/topic/approach-to-building-a-large-report/#post-502669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9365434/pdf-tmp-file-are-not-deleted-and-out-of-memory-exception-when-cachetodisk-is-us&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, development efforts have focused on improving large report handling in every release.

ActiveReports can be used in many ways, so each project can have a number of reasons for consuming memory. In newer versions, CacheToDisk and CacheToDiskLocation properties were added for PDF exports. Some other considerations that may cause too much memory use in section reports include:&lt;ref&gt;http://arhelp.grapecity.com/webhelp/AR10/index.html#OptimizingActiveReports.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Large or repeated images on every page 
* Subreports in repeating sections instantiated in the wrong event so that many new instances are created instead of one
* Summaries in header sections that delay rendering 
* Report and Document object instances not released from memory

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1384">'''Active Bat''' is a low-power, [[wireless]] indoor [[Acoustic location|location]] system accurate up to 3&amp;nbsp;[[Centimetre|cm]]. It is based on a principle of [[trilateration]], and relies on multiple [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] receivers embedded in the ceiling and measures [[time-of-flight]] to them.

Active Bat is an [[Indoor positioning system|indoor localization system]] which gives an accuracy within centimeters. This is a range based technique, which works by finding the distance to minimum of three reference nodes and then using [[multilateration]] technique to find the exact position. The distance to reference nodes is find out using the [[time of arrival]] of ultrasonic signals from the reference nodes.

In an air-jet loom, yarn is pulled from the supply package, and the measuring disc removes a length of yarn of the width of fabric being woven.  A clamp holds the yarn and an auxiliary air nozzle forms it into the shape of a hairpin.  The main nozzle blows the yarn, the clamp opens, and the yarn is carried through the shed.  At the end of the insertion cycle, the clamp closes, the yarn is beaten in and cut, and the shed is closed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://textileapex.blogspot.com/2014/08/operation-principle-air-jet.html|title=Operation principle of an air jet loom|last=Sayed|first=Mohammed Abu|date=August 2014|website=Textile Apex|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has been done to analyze factors that contribute to compressed air use, a major source of energy consumption, in air-jet looms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jabbar|first=Abdul|date=September 1, 2014|title=Statistical Model for Predicting Compressed Air Consumption on Air-Jet Looms|url=|journal=Journal of Engineered Fabrics &amp; Fibers|volume=9| issue =  3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air-jet loom was invented in Czechoslovakia in the 20th century and was later refined by Swiss, Dutch, and Japanese companies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

An '''analog sampled filter''' an [[electronic filter]] that is a [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid]] between an [[analog filter|analog]] and a [[digital filter]]. The input signal is [[analog (signal)|analog]], and usually stored in [[capacitor]]s. The [[time domain]] is [[Discrete time|discrete]], however. Distinct analog samples are shifted through an array of holding capacitors as in a [[bucket brigade]]. Analog adders and amplifiers do the arithmetic in the signal domain, just as in an [[analog computer]].

Note that these filters are subject to [[aliasing]] phenomena just like a digital filter, and [[anti-aliasing filter]]s will usually be required. See: [[Filter design]]

Companies such as [[Linear Technology]] and [[Maxim Integrated Products|Maxim]] produce [[integrated circuit]]s that implement this functionality. Filters up to the 8th order may be implemented using a single chip. Some are fully configurable; some are pre-configured, usually as [[low-pass filter]]s.

Due to the high filter order that can be achieved in an easy and stable manner, single chip analog sampled filters are often used for implementing anti-aliasing filters for digital filters. The analog sampled filter will in its turn need yet another anti-aliasing filter, but this can often be implemented as a simple 1st order low-pass [[analog filter]] consisting of one series [[resistor]] and one [[capacitor]] to [[ground (electricity)|ground]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5857">A '''binary explosive''' or '''two-component explosive''' is an [[explosive]] consisting of two components, neither of which is explosive by itself, which have to be mixed in order to become explosive. Examples of common binary explosives include [[Oxyliquit]] (liquid oxygen/combustible powder), [[ANFO]] (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil), [[Kinestik]] ([[ammonium nitrate]]/[[nitromethane]]), [[Tannerite]] and [[ammonal]] (ammonium nitrate/aluminum), and FIXOR (nitroethane/physical sensitizer).

Binary explosives are often used in commercial applications because of their greater handling safety. 

==United States law==

In the United States, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] regulations allow the components of some binary explosives to be legally purchased, when neither one is an explosive by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.atf.gov/explarson/fedexplolaw/2007edition/index.htm|date= November 2007|accessdate  = March 11, 2009|publisher= [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]]|page        = 4|title= Federal Explosives Law and Regulations, Questions and Answers|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091008040315/http://www.atf.gov/explarson/fedexplolaw/2007edition/index.htm|archivedate= October 8, 2009|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATF advises: "Persons manufacturing explosives for their own personal, non-business use only (e.g., personal target practice) are not required to have a Federal explosives license or permit." A prohibited person (a person barred by federal law from buying or owning a firearm) cannot legally possess mixed explosives. Explosives for lawful target practice must be used once mixed: any transport, storage or commercial use of mixed explosives falls under federal explosives laws,&lt;ref name=ATF1&gt;[https://www.atf.gov/explosives/binary-explosives Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, "Binary Explosives"], atf.gov, 22 Sep 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be transported in mixed form without following strict regulations including insurance, packaging, signage on the transport vehicle, storage magazines, etc.

Various regulations also govern the storage of unmixed explosives. As oxidizers and combustibles, the unmixed components still have some shipping restrictions in the United States.&lt;ref name=USPS1&gt;[https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c3_022.htm 344: Flammable Solids (Hazard Class 4) - USPS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USPS2&gt;[https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c3_023.htm 345: Oxidizing Substances, Organic Peroxides (Hazard Class 5) - USPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Maryland law intended specifically to ban the sale or ownership of consumer products containing binary explosive components (such as [[Tannerite]] brand rifle targets) became effective on October 1, 2012, and expanded the definition of an explosive to include, in addition to "bombs and destructive devices designed to operate by chemical, mechanical, or explosive action", "two or more components that are advertised and sold together with instructions on how to combine the components to create an explosive".&lt;ref&gt;Maryland House Bill [http://legiscan.com/MD/bill/HB875/2012 875] (May 22, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2013, the [[United States Forest Service]] (USFS) and the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney's office]] in [[Denver]] announced that the USFS is implementing a closure order to prohibit the use of unpermitted explosives, particularly exploding targets, on all USFS lands in the Rocky Mountain Region. This region includes [[United States National Forest|national forests]] and [[United States National Grassland|grasslands]] in the states of [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], and [[South Dakota]]. According to the USFS, at least 16 [[wildfire]]s in the Western states had been associated with exploding targets. It cost more than $33 million to extinguish the fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mike M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2038">'''BodyKom''' is a mobile [[heart]] monitoring service that enable care personnel to receive the [[ECG]] of heart patients via the mobile network. The patients can be mobile and perform their everyday activities yet remain under observation. The caregiver receives diagnosis data immediately when the patient’s heart starts acting abnormally. Through a backend system the clinician can set patient individual limits to support finding the abnormal heart functionality for the patient. Measures can be initiated automatically, for example by notifying the clinician and informing relatives.

The use of BodyKom does not require any change in the care routines at the hospital, other than the patient getting a new type of patient kit which includes ECG [[electrode]]s, a small portable sensor and a smart cell phone. Monitoring data is collected by the sensor and is wirelessly transferred to the cell phone. The ECG data is then transferred via the mobile network to a decision support system for adjustment and then forwarded to the caregivers system for analysis. From a medical and technical point of view the patient is connected in the same way as with conventional ECG methods, like using a [[Holter monitor]].

BodyKom was developed by Kiwok in cooperation with Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden.

[[File:AGM Ancient Greek Pair of Terracotta Boots.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] pair of terracotta boots. Early geometric period cremation burial of a woman, 900 BC, [[Ancient Agora Museum]], [[Athens]]]]
[[File:Cowboy boots.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cowboy boots]] custom made for President [[Harry S. Truman]].]]
A '''boot''' is a type of [[footwear]] and not a specific type of [[shoe]]. Most boots mainly cover the [[foot]] and the [[ankle]], while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the [[human leg|leg]], sometimes as far as the [[knee]] or even the [[hip]]. Most boots have a [[heel (shoe)|heel]] that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the [[sole (shoe)|sole]], even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of [[leather]] or [[Natural rubber|rubber]], modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality &amp;ndash; protecting the foot and leg from [[water]], extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a [[Steel-toe boot|steel toe]]) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking), or may have [[hobnail]]s on their undersides to protect against wear and to get better grip; and for reasons of style and [[fashion]].

In some cases, the wearing of boots may be required by laws or regulations, such as the regulations in some jurisdictions requiring workers on construction sites to wear steel-toed safety boots. Some [[uniform]]s include boots as the regulated footwear. Boots are recommended as well for motorcycle riders. [[High-top]] [[athletic shoe]]s are generally not considered boots, even though they do cover the ankle, primarily due to the absence of a distinct heel. In Britain, the term may be used to refer to football (soccer) [[cleat (shoe)|cleat]]s.

==History==
[[File:Oxhide boots. Loulan, Xinjiang. Early Han 220 BCE - 8 CE.jpg|thumb|Oxhide boots from [[Loulan (town)|Loulan]], Xinjiang, China. [[Former Han]] dynasty 220 BC – AD 8.]]
Early boots consisted of separate [[leggings]], soles, and uppers worn together to provide greater ankle protection than shoes or [[sandal]]s.  Around 1000 BC, these components were more permanently joined to form a single unit that covered the feet and lower leg, often up to the knee. A type of soft leather ankle boots were worn by [[nomads]] in eastern Asia and carried to China to India and Russia around AD 1200 to 1500 by [[Mongol]] invaders. The [[Inuit]] and [[Aleut]] natives of Alaska developed traditional winter boots of [[caribou]] skin or sealskin featuring decorative touches of seal intestine, dog hair and suchlike. The early [[Dutch Masters]] were the first to define the boot in European [[iconography]], in spite of the fact that the Chinese had been using footwear that the average Frenchman or Portuguese sailor of the day would have recognized as a boot for centuries at that time. Most historians agree, though, that the first codified definition of the boot was entered into law by Royal decree during the Hundred Years' War, when the Duke of Wales wrote, "that sturdy, stiff shyue off a type ne'er seent heretofore wi' high scuppers and ye nailes on the souyle." Sporadic wars were fought among city states during this time as the Protestants rejected that definition, but history vindicated the Duke eventually, and the Roche family of Nantucket actually rose to prominence more as a result if their trade in these boots in the colonies than from their whaling endeavors. [[Europe]]an boots were influenced by military styles, featuring thick soles and turnover tops that were originally designed to protect horse mounted soldiers. In the 1700s, distinctive, thigh-high boots worn by [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] soldiers fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War]] influenced the development of the iconic heeled [[cowboy boots]] worn by cattlemen in the [[American west]].&lt;ref name="McDonald2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fiona McDonald|title=Shoes and Boots Through History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCyp2q7nQAkC|accessdate=26 January 2012|date=30 July 2006|publisher=Gareth Stevens|isbn=978-0-8368-6857-9|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and uses==

===Practical uses===
[[File:S3 safety footwear.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 20345:2004 compliant S3 steel-toed safety boots designed for construction workers.]]
[[File:A-12 OXCART Flight Suit Boots - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|A pair of A-12 [[OXCART]] Flight Suit Boots]]
Boots which are designed for walking through snow, shallow water and mud may be made of a single closely stitched design (using leather, rubber, canvas, or similar material) to prevent the entry of water, snow, mud or dirt through gaps between the laces and tongue found in other types of shoes.  Waterproof [[gumboot]]s are made in different lengths of uppers. In extreme cases, thigh-boots called [[waders (footwear)|waders]], worn by [[Fisherman|anglers]], extend to the hip.  Such boots may also be insulated for warmth. With the exception of [[gum boots]], boots sold in general retail stores may be considered "water resistant," as they are not usually fully waterproof, compared to high-end boots for fishers or hikers.
 
Speciality boots have been made to protect steelworkers' feet and calves if they accidentally step in puddles of molten metal, to protect workers from a variety of chemical exposure, to protect workers from construction site hazards and to protect feet from extreme cold (e.g., with insulated or inflatable boots for use in Antarctica). Most work boots are "laceups" made from leather. Formerly they were usually shod with [[hobnail (footwear)|hobnails]] and heel- and toe-plates, but now can usually be seen with a thick rubber sole, and often with steel toecaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://drewsboots.com/content/making-sure-your-work-boots-make-grade |title=Making Sure Your Work Boots Make the Grade |work=Drew's Boots |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boots are normally worn with [[sock]]s to prevent chafes and [[blister]]s, to absorb [[sweat]], to improve the foot's grip inside the boot, or to insulate the foot from the cold. Before socks became widely available, [[footwraps]] were worn instead.

Specialty boots have been designed for many different types of [[sport]]s, particularly [[equestrianism|riding]], [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], [[Ice skating|ice-skating]], and sporting in wet/damp conditions.

===Fashion and fetish use===
[[File:Dr Martens, black, old.jpg|thumb|200px|A pair of "classic" black leather Doc Martens. While these boots were originally designed as workwear (they are resistant to petrol, alkaline chemicals and other substances), they were adopted as a fashion item by the [[skinhead]] and [[punk subculture]]s.]]
[[Bovver boot]]s, [[Doc Martens]] boots and [[army boots]] were adopted by [[skinhead]]s and [[punk fashion|punks]] as part of their typical dress and have migrated to more mainstream fashion, including women's wear.&lt;ref name="DeMello2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and footwear: a cultural encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|pages=65–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602195904/http://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA65|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a more rugged alternative to [[dress shoe]]s, [[dress boots]] may be worn (though these can be more formal than shoes). [[Fashion]]able boots for women may exhibit all the variations seen in other [[fashion footwear]]: tapered or spike [[Heel (shoe)|heels]], platform [[Sole (shoe)|soles]], pointed toes, [[zipper]] closures and the like. The popularity of boots as fashion footwear ebbs and flows. Singer [[Nancy Sinatra]] popularized the fad of women wearing boots in the late 1960s with her song "[[These boots are made for walking]]". They were popular in the 1960s and 1970s (particularly knee-high boots), but diminished in popularity towards the end of the 20th century. In the 2010s, they are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, especially designs with a long bootleg. Boot bolos, boot bracelets, boot straps, boot chains, and boot harnesses are used to decorate boots. Sandal boots also exist.

[[File:PinkVisual boots.jpg|thumb|150px|High leather boots are the object of sexual attraction by some people, notably [[boot fetish]]ists.]]
[[Image:Aa hobnailedboots 01.jpg|thumb|A pair of hobnailed boots]]
Boots have become the object of [[sexual attraction]] for some people and they have become a standard accessory in the [[BDSM]] scene (where leather, latex and PVC boots are favoured) and a fashion accessory in music videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.xbiz.com/article_piece.php?id=173135|title=Kinky Boots: An Enduring Symbol in Fetish Fashion|author=XBIZ|work=XBIZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work Boots for Men ~ Every Occasion!|url=http://www.bootratings.com/|website=Bootratings|accessdate=16 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215040216/http://www.bootratings.com/|archivedate=15 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knee- or thigh-high leather boots are worn by some strippers and [[pornography]] models and actresses. Boots have even become a [[sexual fetish]] for devotees known as [[boot fetishism|boot fetishists]] and [[foot fetishism|foot fetishists]].

==As symbols ==

=== In heraldry ===
[[File:Blason Aresches.svg|thumb|200px|Coat of arms of [[Aresches]] municipality in France displays a boot in the [[dexter and sinister|heraldic left]] field.]]
As boots have been used by riders for millennia, they were used by knights. As a consequence, albeit not common, boots came to be used as [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]s in [[heraldry]].

Because of the origin of heraldry as insignia used by mounted warriors like the medieval knights, when boots are used in heraldry, they are often displayed as riding boots, even if the [[blazon]] might not specify it as such. They are sometimes adorned with spurs, which may or may not have another [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] (colour) than the boot and the background field.

Boots were also used in coats of arms of [[shoemaker]]s' [[guild]]s and in shop signs outside their shops.

*Boots that are particularly old and well worn, or a similarly tough item are referred to as being tough and strong with the phrase "tough as old boots."&lt;ref name=Macmillan&gt;{{cite web|title=American English Thesaurus|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/thesaurus/british/tough#as-tough-as-old-boots_1|work="as tough as old boots" phrase|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited 2009–2012|accessdate=25 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112135156/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/thesaurus/british/tough#as-tough-as-old-boots_1|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A discarded boot may be used in the construction of a [[musical instrument]] known as the ''"[[Monkey stick|mendoza]]."''
*Tall (high) boots may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a tool to provide better leverage in getting the boots on. The figurative use  "to pull one's self up by one's bootstraps" in the sense of "ability to perform a difficult task without external help" developed in the 19th century  in US English.&lt;ref&gt;"It's been widely suggested that the "bootstrap" metaphor originated in the legendary tales of Baron von Münchhausen. As Chris Waigl recently pointed out on the Eggcorn Database (commenting on "boots-trap"), the original German version has a scene in which Münchhausen gets out of a swamp by pulling on his own hair. In an American retelling (supposedly), the Baron uses his bootstraps to pull himself out of a similar predicament. None of the 19th-century cites I've seen allude to the Münchhausen story -- instead, they often refer to pulling oneself over a fence or up a steeple. So if Münchhausen really pulls himself up by his bootstraps in an American version (which I have yet to verify), then the writer probably took advantage of preexisting imagery for an absurdly impossible task." Benjamin Zimmer,  American Dialect Society, 11 August 2005{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "bootstrapping" was subsequently used in a metaphorical sense in a number of fields, notably computing (which uses the term "[[bootup]]" to describe the process of starting a computer and in [[entrepreneurship]], which uses the term "bootstrapping" to describe start-up companies which are launched without major external financing.
*To "die with one's boots on" means to die while one is still actively involved in work or to go down fighting. Popularized by [[Western (genre)|Wild West]] movies.&lt;ref name=FreeDictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=boot|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/boot|publisher=The Free Dictionary, 2012 by Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Boot camp (disambiguation)|Boot camp]]: a colloquial term for the initial [[recruit training]] of a new recruit enlisting in a [[military]] organization or armed force. In this context, a "boot" is just such a recruit.
*[[Stormtrooper]]s and other agents of authority or units used for political strongarm tactics such as intimidation are typically referred to by their detractors as "[[jackboot]]ed thugs," a reference to the hobnailed military jackboot of the World War I German Stormtrooper and later [[Nazi]] uniform. Authoritarian rule, either by hostile military forces, or by groups of armed intimidators, is imposed by "jackboot tactics."
*To "give one the boot" means to kick one out (of a job, a club, etc.) or expel one, either literally or figuratively.
*To "put the boot in" is an idiom for inflicting violence on someone.
*"The boot is on the other foot now" means that a situation has become reversed—a previous victor is now losing, for example.
*Wearing "[[seven-league boots]]" references a classic children's [[fairy tale]] and indicates that a person or company can cover great distances, figuratively or literally, in a single stride.
*To "shake/quake in one's boots" means to be very frightened, and is mostly used sarcastically.
*"Knocking boots" is slang for having sex, regardless of whether either person is wearing boots.

==Acquisition history==
In July 2014, Brightstar Corp. and Bharti Enterprises announced that they entered into an agreement to provide various mobile technologies and services to the Indian market. As part of the agreement, a Brightstar subsidiary acquired a majority interest in Beetel Teletech Limited, a leading company in the distribution and sale of communication and media devices, enterprise and IT products in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brightstar and Bharti Group Partner To Bring Latest Mobile Technologies To Indian Marketplace|url= http://www.brightstar.com/media/press-releases/brightstar-and-bharti-group-partner-to-bring-latest-mobile-technologies-to}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Brightstar Corp. completed its acquisition of 20:20 Mobile, a leading provider of distribution and integrated supply chain to the European mobile industry.

'''Degrees Brix''' (symbol °Bx) is the [[sugar]] content of an aqueous solution.
One degree Brix is 1 gram of [[sucrose]] in 100 grams of solution and represents the strength of the solution as [[percentage by mass]]. If the solution contains dissolved solids other than pure sucrose, then the °Bx only approximates the dissolved solid content. The °Bx is traditionally used in the [[wine]], [[sugar]], [[carbonated beverage]], [[fruit juice]], [[maple syrup]] and [[honey]] industries.

Comparable scales for indicating sucrose content are the [[Plato scale|degree Plato]] (°P), which is widely used by the [[brewing industry]], and the degree Balling, which is the oldest of the three systems and therefore mostly found in older textbooks, but also still in use in some parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, J.S., D. E. Briggs, R. Stevens and T. W. Young, ''Malting and Brewing Science, Vol 2 Hopped Wort and Beer'', Chapman &amp; Hall, London,1971&lt;/ref&gt;

A sucrose solution with an [[apparent specific gravity]] (20°/20&amp;nbsp;°C) of 1.040 would be 9.99325 °Bx or 9.99359 °P while the representative sugar body, the [[International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis]] (ICUMSA), which favors the use of [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]], would report the solution strength as 9.99249%. Because the differences between the systems are of little practical significance (the differences are less than the precision of most common instruments) and wide historical use of the Brix unit, modern instruments calculate mass fraction using ICUMSA official formulas but report the result as °Bx.

==Background==
In the early 1800s, Karl Balling, followed by [[Adolf Ferdinand Wenceslaus Brix|Adolf Brix]], and finally the ''Normal-Commissions'' under Fritz Plato, prepared pure sucrose solutions of known strength, measured their specific gravities and prepared tables of percent sucrose by mass vs. measured specific gravity. Balling measured specific gravity to 3 decimal places, Brix to 5, and the Normal-Eichungs Kommission to 6 with the goal of the Commission being to correct errors in the 5th and 6th decimal place in the Brix table.

Equipped with one of these tables, a brewer wishing to know how much sugar was in his [[wort]] could measure its specific gravity and enter that specific gravity into the Plato table to obtain °Plato, which is the concentration of sucrose by percentage mass. Similarly, a [[vintner]] could enter the specific gravity of his must into the Brix table to obtain the °Bx, which is the concentration of sucrose by percent mass. It is important to point out that neither wort nor must is a solution of pure sucrose in pure water. Many other compounds are dissolved as well but these are either sugars, which behave very similarly to sucrose with respect to specific gravity as a function of concentration, or compounds which are present in small amounts (minerals, [[hops|hop]] [[acid]]s in wort, [[tannins]], acids in must). In any case, even if °Bx are not representative of the exact amount of sugar in a must or fruit juice they can be used for comparison of relative sugar content.

==Measurement==
===Specific gravity===
As specific gravity was the basis for the Balling, Brix and Plato tables, dissolved sugar content was originally estimated by measurement of specific gravity using a [[hydrometer]] or [[pycnometer]]. In modern times, hydrometers are still widely used, but where greater accuracy is required, an electronic [[oscillating U-tube]] meter may be employed. Whichever means are used, the analyst enters the tables with specific gravity and takes out (using interpolation if necessary) the sugar content in [[percent by mass]]. If the analyst uses the Plato tables (maintained by the [[American Society of Brewing Chemists]]&lt;ref&gt;"ASBC Methods of Analysis", ASBC; St. Paul Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer&lt;/ref&gt;) he or she reports in °P. If using the Brix table (the current version of which is maintained by NIST and can be found on their website),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/circularofbureau440bate/page/632 |p=632 |title=Polarimetry, Saccharimetry and the Sugars. Table 114: Brix, apparent density, apparent specific gravity, and grams of sucrose per 100 ml of sugar solutions |last1=Bates |first1=Frederick |date=1 May 1942 |publisher=National Bureau of Standards |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he or she reports in °Bx. If using the ICUMSA tables,&lt;ref&gt;"ICUMSA Methods Book" op. cit. Specification and Standard SPS-4 Densimitry and Tables: Sucrose – Official; Glucose, Fructose and Invert Sugars – Official&lt;/ref&gt; he or she would report in mass fraction (m.f.). It is not, typically, actually necessary to consult tables as the tabulated °Bx or °P value can be printed directly on the hydrometer scale next to the tabulated value of specific gravity or stored in the memory of the electronic U-tube meter or calculated from polynomial fits to the tabulated data. Both ICUMSA and ASBC have published suitable polynomials; in fact, the ICUMSA tables are calculated from the polynomials. The opposite is true with the [[American Society of Brewing Chemists|ASBC]] polynomial. Also note that the tables in use today are not those published by Brix or Plato. Those workers measured true specific gravity reference to water at 4&amp;nbsp;°C using, respectively, 17.5&amp;nbsp;°C and 20&amp;nbsp;°C, as the temperature at which the density of a sucrose solution be measured. Both NBS and ASBC converted to [[apparent specific gravity]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C/20&amp;nbsp;°C. The ICUMSA tables are based on more recent measurements on sucrose, fructose, glucose and invert sugar, and they tabulate true density and weight in air at 20&amp;nbsp;°C against mass fraction.

===Refractive index===
Dissolution of sucrose and other sugars in water changes not only its specific gravity but its optical properties in particular its [[refractive index]] and the extent to which it rotates the plane of linearly [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] light. The refractive index, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, for sucrose solutions of various percentage by mass has been measured and tables of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; vs. °Bx published. As with the hydrometer, it is possible to use these tables to calibrate a [[refractometer]] so that it reads directly in °Bx. Calibration is usually based on the ICUMSA tables,&lt;ref&gt;"ICUMSA Methods Book", op. cit.; Specification and Standard SPS-3 Refractometry and Tables – Official; Tables A-F&lt;/ref&gt; but the user of an electronic refractometer should verify this.

===Infrared absorption===
Sugars also have known [[infrared]] absorption spectra and this has made it possible to develop instruments for measuring sugar concentration using NIR (Near Infra Red) and FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry) techniques. In the former case, in-line instruments are available which allow constant monitoring of sugar content in sugar refineries, beverage plants, wineries, etc. As with any other instruments, NIR and FT-IR instruments can be calibrated against pure sucrose solutions and thus report in °Bx, but there are other possibilities with these technologies, as they have the potential to distinguish between sugars and interfering substances.

== Tables ==
===Specific gravity===
Approximate values of °Bx can be computed from 231.61 × (S − 0.9977), where S is the [[apparent specific gravity]] of the solution at 20&amp;nbsp;°C/20&amp;nbsp;°C. More accurate values are available from:

'''°'''&lt;math&gt;Bx = 182.4601S^3-775.6821S^2+1262.7794S-669.5622&lt;/math&gt;, 

derived from the NBS table with S as above. This should not be used above S = 1.17874 (40 °Bx). RMS disagreement between the polynomial and the NBS table is 0.0009 °Bx. The [[Plato scale]] can be approximated by the Lincoln Equation: 

°&lt;math&gt;P = (463-205S)(S-1)&lt;/math&gt; 

or values obtained with high accuracy with respect to the ASBC table from the ASBC polynomial:

°&lt;math&gt;P = 135.997S^3 - 630.272S^2 + 1111.14S - 616.868&lt;/math&gt;

The difference between the °Bx and °P as calculated from the respective polynomials is: 

°&lt;math&gt;P-&lt;/math&gt;°&lt;math&gt;Bx= 46.4631S^3-145.4101S^2+151.6394S-52.6942&lt;/math&gt; 

The difference is generally less than ±0.0005 °Bx or °P with the exception being for weak solutions. As 0 °Bx is approached °P tend towards as much as 0.002 °P higher than the °Bx calculated for the same specific gravity. Disagreements of this order of magnitude can be expected as the NBS and the ASBC used slightly different values for the density of air and pure water in their calculations for converting to apparent specific gravity. It should be clear from these comments that Plato and Brix are, for all but the most exacting applications, the same. Note: all polynomials in this article are in a format that can be pasted directly into a spreadsheet.

===Refractive index===
When a refractometer is used, the Brix value can be obtained from the polynomial fit to the ICUMSA table: 

°&lt;math&gt;Bx= 11758.74(nD)^5 -88885.21(nD)^4 + 270177.93(nD)^3 - 413145.80(nD)^2 + 318417.95(nD) -99127.4536&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;nD&lt;/math&gt; is the refractive index measured at the wavelength of the sodium D line (589.3&amp;nbsp;nm) at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. Temperature is very important as refractive index changes dramatically with temperature. Many refractometers have built in "Automatic Temperature Compensation" (ATC) which is based on knowledge of the way the refractive index of sucrose changes. For example, the refractive index of a sucrose solution of strength less than 10 °Bx is such that a 1&amp;nbsp;°C change in temperature would cause the Brix reading to shift by about 0.06 °Bx. Beer, conversely, exhibits a change with temperature about three times this much. It is important, therefore, that users of refractometers either make sure the sample and prism of the instrument are both at very close to 20&amp;nbsp;°C or, if that is difficult to ensure, readings should be taken at 2 temperatures separated by a few degrees, the change per degree noted and the final recorded value referenced to 20&amp;nbsp;°C using the Bx vs. Temp slope information.

==Usage==
{{See also|Ripeness in viticulture}}
The four scales are often used interchangeably since the differences are minor.
*Brix is primarily used in fruit juice, [[wine making]], [[carbonated beverage]] industry, [[starch]] and the [[sugar]] industry.
*Plato is primarily used in [[brewing]].
*Balling appears on older saccharimeters and is still used in the [[South Africa]]n wine industry and in some breweries.
*[[Oechsle scale|Oechsle]] as direct reading for the sugar content is primary used in wine making in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Luxembourg]]. 

Brix is used in the food industry for measuring the approximate amount of sugars in [[fruits]], [[vegetables]], juices, [[wine]], soft drinks and in the starch and sugar manufacturing industry. Different countries use the scales in different industries: In brewing, the UK uses [[Gravity (beer)|specific gravity]] X 1000; Europe uses [[Plato scale|Plato degrees]]; and the US use a mix of specific gravity, degrees Brix, [[Baumé scale|degrees Baumé]], and degrees Plato. For fruit juices, 1.0 degree Brix is denoted as 1.0% sugar by mass.  This usually correlates well with perceived sweetness.

Modern optical Brix meters are divided into two categories. In the first are the Abbe-based instruments in which a drop of the sample solution is placed on a prism; the result is observed through an eyepiece. The critical angle (the angle beyond which light is totally reflected back into the sample) is a function of the refractive index and the operator detects this critical angle by noting where a dark-bright boundary falls on an engraved scale. The scale can be calibrated in Brix or refractive index. Often the prism mount contains a thermometer which can be used to correct to 20&amp;nbsp;°C in situations where measurement cannot be made at exactly that temperature. These instruments are available in bench and handheld versions.

Digital refractometers also find the critical angle, but the light path is entirely internal to the prism. A drop of sample is placed on its surface, so the critical light beam never penetrates the sample. This makes it easier to read turbid samples. The light/dark boundary, whose position is proportional to the critical angle, is sensed by a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] array. These meters are also available in bench top (laboratory) and portable (pocket) versions. This ability to easily measure Brix in the field makes it possible to determine ideal harvesting times of fruit and vegetables so that products arrive at the consumers in a perfect state or are ideal for subsequent processing steps such as vinification.

Due to higher accuracy and the ability to couple it with other measuring techniques (%CO2 and %alcohol), most soft drink companies and breweries use an oscillating U-tube density meter.  Refractometers are still commonly used for fruit juice.

==Brix and actual dissolved solids content==
When a sugar solution is measured by [[refractometer]] or density meter, the °Bx or °P value obtained by entry into the appropriate table only represents the amount of dry solids dissolved in the sample if the dry solids are exclusively sucrose. This is seldom the case. Grape juice ([[must]]), for example, contains little sucrose but does contain glucose, fructose, acids, and other substances. In such cases, the °Bx value clearly cannot be equated with the sucrose content, but it may represent a good approximation to the total sugar content. For example, an 11.0% by mass D-Glucose ("grape sugar") solution measured 10.9 °Bx using a hand held instrument.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} For these reasons, the sugar content of a solution obtained by use of refractometry with the ICUMSA table is often reported as "Refractometric Dry Substance" (RDS)&lt;ref&gt;"ICUMSA Methods Book, op. cit. Method GS4/3/8-13 (2009) "The Determination of Refractometric Dry Substance (RDS %) of Molasses – Accepted and Very Pure Syrups (Liquid Sugars), Thick Juice and Run-off Syrups – Official",&lt;/ref&gt; which could be thought of as an equivalent sucrose content. Where it is desirable to know the actual dry solids content, empirical correction formulas can be developed based on calibrations with solutions similar to those being tested. For example, in sugar refining, dissolved solids can be accurately estimated from refractive index measurement corrected by an optical rotation (polarization) measurement.

Alcohol has a higher refractive index (1.361) than water (1.333). As a consequence, a refractometer measurement made on a sugar solution once fermentation has begun will result in a reading substantially higher than the actual solids content. Thus, an operator must be certain that the sample they are testing has not begun to ferment. Brix or Plato measurements based on specific gravity are also affected by fermentation, but in the opposite direction; as ethanol is less dense than water, an ethanol/sugar/water solution gives a Brix or Plato reading which is artificially low.

Leverich}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often made from industrial [[cotton]] which may be [[bleach]]ed white or left the fiber’s natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include [[wool]], [[bamboo]], and unbleached [[hemp]]. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of [[microfiber]] toweling or an external waterproof layer of [[polyurethane laminate]] (PUL) may be used. [[Polyester]] fabrics microfleece or suedecloth are often used inside cloth diapers as a "stay-dry" [[wicking]] liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.

Modern cloth diapers come in a host of shapes, including preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, fitted diaper with covers and pocket or "stuffable" diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloth Diapering|url=http://extremeparenthood.com/baby/toilet/diapering/cloth-diapering-simple-sweet/|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many design features of modern [https://www.superbottoms.com/ cloth diapers] have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, such as the use of the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material.&lt;ref name="ip.com" /&gt;

==History==

Traditionally, cloth diapers consisted of a folded square or rectangle of [[linen]] cloth, cotton [[flannel]], or stockinet, which was fastened with [[safety pin]]s. Today, this type of diaper is referred to as a '''flat'''. The flat was commonly used in the late 1800s in Europe and North America.

In the early part of the 20th century, cloth users were boiling diapers as they became aware of bacteria. During World War II, the increase of working mothers brought the need for the "diaper service". Fresh cotton diapers would be delivered on an as-needed basis.

In 1946, a Westport housewife named Marion Donovan, invented the "Boater", a waterproof covering for cloth diapers. Marion was granted 4 patents for her designs, including the use of plastic snaps that replaced the traditional and dangerous "safety pins".

In 1950, the '''prefold''' diaper was invented by a diaper service owner and produced by Curity. The prefold diaper consisted of a standard "flat" diaper, but pre-folded and sewn together. Also in 1950, the Safe-T Di-Dee diaper was invented. The diaper was preformed and was the first pinless, snap-on diaper- this was the first '''fitted''' diaper. It was invented by Sybil Geeslin (Kennedy) who subsequently sold the patent. They were then sold as Keystone Safe-T Di-Dee Diapers and were nationally distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.diaperjungle.com/history-of-diapers.html |title=The History of Diapers - Disposable &amp; Cloth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the disposable diaper rapidly took hold and cloth diaper use fell out of favor. The "Safe Diaper Clip," an alternative to traditional safety pins, was invented and patented in 1961 by Edward Moonan of Boonville, NY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=2968852 |status=patent|title=Diaper Clip|gdate=January 24, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; but never took off, due to drop in use of cloth diapers.

In the late 1980s, cloth diaper users re-emerged with environmental issues concerning the use of disposables. By the late 1990s and the beginning of the next decade, many large cloth diaper manufacturing companies were well established.

In 1987 Bummis, a [[Canada|Canadian]] company, invented the modern '''[[Plastic pants|diaper cover]]''' to go over flats and prefolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.bummis.com/ |title=Bummis About us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1987, the Snappi diaper fastener was invented in [[South Africa]] to be used with prefolds or flats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.snappibabyusa.com/snappi-cloth-diaper-fastener/|title = Snappi Diaper Fastener instead of Diaper Pins.|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151108232807/http://www.snappibabyusa.com/snappi-cloth-diaper-fastener/|archivedate = 2015-11-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still widely used today.

In 1995, the Motherease company was formed and began selling by mail order in the US, although the owner (Erika Froese) had been developing and selling her diapers since 1991 (mostly in Canada) and using cloth since 1981. Motherease was {{According to whom|most well known for their One Size Fitted cloth diaper|date=August 2018}}.

Catherine McDiarmid's BornToLove.com, a Canadian site, was one of the first major diaper websites to emerge in 1997 as the web took off.
In 1999, Poochies and HoneyBoy! diapers were developed and {{According to whom|became quite popular|date=August 2018}}, some selling for over $200.00 per diaper. Cuddlebuns Cloth Diapers were introduced to the diapering community in 1999 and were a one-size diaper that could fit babies from infancy to potty training with adjustable sizing. This is known today as a one-size diaper. All three of these diapers brand patterns eventually became available for the general public to sew through cottage licensing, and are now owned by BabyByYou! Also in 1999, Kissaluvs started an online business to sell fitted and contour diapers. These years also saw a tremendous amount of growth in the amount of moms who begin sewing their own diapers, referred to as "Work at Home Moms" or WAHMs.

The UK market was slower to get started than the USA, with a few domestic manufacturers such as Earthwise and Snugglenaps being established in the late 1990s, alongside importers of brands such as Motherease, Bummis and Kooshies.  The first multi-brand ecommerce online shop was opened by Twinkleontheweb, with others following on. The Real Nappy Association was formed by members of WEN the Women's Environmental Network, with the first Real Nappy Week being held in 1997 to promote the use of cloth diapers in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Real Nappy Week |publisher=The Great British Nappy Hunt |url=http://greatbritishnappyhunt.co.uk/realnappyweek.html |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000,  Fuzzi Bunz opened an online store selling the first '''pocket diaper'''. Originally, they were fleece on the outside and the inside. Later they were made with PUL (a waterproof laminated polyester fabric used in virtually all Cloth diaper covers today) outers and fleece inners. Both looks were different from what you see today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shop.fuzzibunz.com/aboutus.asp |title=FuzziBunz About us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sharktankblog.com/tereson-dupuy-of-fuzzibunz-interview/ |title=Tereson Dupuy Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies quickly followed suit, included TotsBots and Nature Babies in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Baby Kicks, and Stacinator fleece diaper covers.

The phrase "hyena" was also coined around this time, or shortly thereafter, when Kendell from Freshies commented on how all the diapering mamas were so ruthless in their stalking of hard-to-get diapers. She said, in a joking way, that "they're just like a pack of hyenas, closing in for the kill" and the term stuck. So now hyena diapers are the hard to get, but much sought after diaper brands available today.

In 2003, "Wahm Boutique" and "Tuesday Bear" (the first WAHM congos{{definition needed|date=August 2018}} for diapers) and other WAHM items were opened to the public.

Also in 2003, wool soakers became {{According to whom|instantly popular|date=August 2018}}, which resulted in a slew of WAHMs selling hand knit wool covers/soakers. In 2004 and 2005, the soakers evolved into wool longies or pants.
[[File:Prefold met snappi.jpg|thumb|Prefold with Snappi closure. A water proof cover will be added to prevent leaks. ]]
2002 and 2003 are also known by many experienced cloth diapers WAHMS as the diaper war years. Larger cloth diaper companies began threatening smaller ones with legal action and accusations of pattern or patent infringement. Motherease threatened legal action as they tried to protect their pattern for the one size diaper, and Fuzzi Bunz threatened legal action to protect their patent on pocket diapers. Many small WAHM diaper makers closed, deciding that the industry was too cutthroat.

In 2004, Karen Fegelman, the owner of Kool Sheep Soakers, figured out how to program a simple shopping-cart system that would not oversell, and that would be super-affordable and easy for a WAHM to use. Hyena Cart was born. It is still used by WAHMS everywhere today as their only method of selling or as a supplement system{{Citation needed|reason=highly unlikely that a 2004 shopping cart is the only method of selling small businesses in 2018 use.|date=August 2018}}.

2004 and 2005 were also the host to an explosion of growth in the cloth diapering community. Many new cloth diaper sewing and retail businesses were started. The presence of WAHM congos{{definition needed|date=August 2018}} also saw a tremendous amount of growth.

Also, in 2004 and 2005, designer diapers were the rage. Some more sought after brands can be sold at auction for $200–300.00, with some charity auctions bringing in over $500.00 for a single cloth diaper. Online forums exploded with cloth diapering communities (MDC{{definition needed|date=August 2018}} taking the lead) and many new web sites dedicated to cloth diaper information. Diaper sewing is a hot pastime and many online resources, patterns, and diaper fabric stores were opened.

In 2006, the bumGenius diaper by Cotton Babies was introduced, as was the Thirsties brand of diaper covers. {{According to whom|Swaddlebees became a favorite among pocket diaper users.|date=August 2018}} A flushable diaper called a [[gDiaper]] was introduced in the US.

In 2009, the GroVia Hybrid Diaper was introduced by The Natural Baby Company. A major component of this modern cloth diapering system, the BioSoaker, was awarded US patent 8115050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=8115050 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Boingo Baby Diaper Fastener(Us Patent Pending) hit the market as the first innovation for diaper fasteners in 25 years. An Alternative for diaper pins it {{According to whom|gained quick popularity|date=August 2018}} and regularly sells out due to supply and demand{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

In 2011 Namaste Mama was awarded a patent for their adjustable elastic one size Evolution Diaper. They were awarded a second patent in 2013 granting further coverage for the adjustable elastic design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7914507 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Evolution Diaper is now manufactured under their sister brand, Boingo Baby.

2012 saw explosion of cloth diaper "co-ops" on the website [[Facebook]] where groups of people would purchase cloth diapers in bulk from the manufacturer and distribute them to the members.

In 2013, the Cotton Babies company was awarded a patent for their bumGenius diaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=8518007 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a resurgence of the "diaper wars" in 2002, with Cotton Babies pursuing Facebook co-ops, small business, and WAHM for patent violation.

In 2014 Diaper Diamond received a patent &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=8434173 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their cloth diaper sprayer shield that makes rinsing cloth diapers easier and cleaner.

==Cloth diaper types==
*[[File:Prefold.jpg|thumb|Prefold diaper. This can be folded around the child and closed with a pin or other kind of closure, and covered with a wrap or cover. ]]''Covers'' or ''wraps''- Covers, also called wraps, are waterproof coverings for diapers that are not waterproof on their own. Covers must be used with all of the following diapers:
**''Flats'' – Flat diapers are a large, single layer, square or rectangle of absorbent cloth.  Birdseye cotton or [[muslin]] are the most commonly used materials, but flats can also be [[terry cloth]] or [[flannel]]. Any absorbent material may be considered a "flat" if it is composed of one single layer. Flats may or may not be hemmed or otherwise finished at the edges.  Flats must be folded into the desired shape before they are usable as a diaper.
** ''Prefolds'' – Prefolds are a rectangular piece of absorbent fabric that has been folded, layered, and then sewn so that the center strip of the diaper has more layers of absorbent material than the sides.  This reduces bulk while still providing enough absorbency where it is needed.  Prefolds get their name because before their invention, flats were the common diaper type available.  Flats require folding in order to obtain the appropriate number of layers of absorbent material in the wet zone.  A "prefold" is pre-folded and sewn down so that less folding is required at the time of the diaper change.  Prefolds typically have 4 to 6 layers of material in the center and 2 to 4 layers on the edges.
** ''Shaped diapers'' – Shaped diapers are much like a prefold except instead of the square shape, they are a triangle, T-shaped, X-shaped, or Y-shaped. They are not commonly used today as contour diapers have generally replaced them. Even so, prefolds (the rectangle shape) remain the most popular pre-folded diaper of the three (prefolds, shaped diapers, and contours).
** ''Contours'' –  Contoured diapers are much like a shaped diaper or prefold except they are cut and sewn into a general hourglass shape.  This is done so that no folding is required before they are ready to be used as a diaper and also to reduce bulkiness.
** ''Tie-up diapers'' – This type of cloth diaper has to be folded, and then it is fasten together by using the strings attached to the diaper. These are not commonly used today.
**[[File:AI2 Cloth Diaper w-Internal Gussets (8665110605).jpg|thumb|Handmade all-in-2 diaper.]]''Fitteds'' – Fitted diapers are hourglass shaped absorbent diapers that have elastic at the legs in order to better contain feces and urine.  They usually also have a built in closure such as velcro or snaps that is used to secure the diaper onto the baby.  There are several subtypes of fitted diapers including closureless fitteds (those that lack velcro or snaps), prefitteds (fitteds made from pre-fold diapers), and pocket fitteds (pocket diapers that use absorbent materials for all the layers instead of wicking or waterproof materials). Fitteds are popular today, particularly for use overnight when a diaper capable of holding more urine without leaking is needed.
*''Pocket diapers'' – Pocket diapers are hourglass shaped and have closures to secure them onto the baby (generally snaps or velcro). They consist of a waterproof outer layer and an inner layer that are sewn together on three sides to create a pocket. The inner layer may be made of a moisture wicking material or an absorbent material.  The pocket is then stuffed with absorbent insert that can be customized based on the absorbency level required for each baby.  The most common inserts are made of microfiber, bamboo or charcoal bamboo.  One subtype of pocket diapers is the sleeve diaper, which is sewn only on two sides instead of three so that the pocket may be accessed from both the front and back of the diaper.
* ''All-in-one diaper'' – An all in one (AIO) diaper consists of a waterproof outer layer sewn together with absorbent material on the inside.  There may also be an additional inner layer of moisture-wicking material. All-in-ones are hourglass shaped and have a velcro, snap, or other closure to secure them on the baby.
* ''All-in-two diaper'' – An all-in-two- diaper (AI2) is a diaper with two parts.  An all-in-two diaper consists of a waterproof diaper cover  with fasteners and an absorbent insert.  The insert is a rectangle or hourglass pad of absorbent material, that may or may not have a moisture wicking material as its top layer.  The insert snaps or lays into the cover and may be removed when soiled or wet.  The cover may be reused throughout the day by replacing the insert at each change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Choosing the Right Cloth Diaper |publisher=babble.com |url=http://www.babble.com/baby/baby-care/best-cloth-diaper-changing-baby-environmentally-friendly-diapering-guide/ |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Hybrid diapers - A hybrid diaper is similar to an all-in-two diaper in that it is typically composed of a waterproof diaper cover and an absorbent insert.  The reason for the "hybrid" name is that the same waterproof diaper cover can be used with a cloth absorbent insert OR a disposable insert.  Most users use a hybrid diaper when their lifestyle includes a lot of travel, daycare, or other activities where flexibility is required.
* Cloth Diaper Liners are useful in order to keep your diapers cleaner.  Just lay them on top of the diaper to use. They can be made of paper or cellulose which are degradable, or polyester fleece which is washable and being non-absorbent will dry out as baby's body heat evaporates any moisture through to the diaper so it dries out and acts as a stay-dry layer in the diaper.  For diaper rash, silk or silver liners have a soothing and antibacterial action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Nappy Boosters and Liners |publisher=Miranda Stamp |url=http://www.twinkleontheweb.co.uk/acatalog/Nappy_Boosters_and_Liners.html |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cloth Diaper Extenders- Cloth diapers extenders are apair of additional snaps with buttons that can be attached to a small size baby diaper to turn it to a bigger size. Using extenders, the baby diapers which usually last 15-17 kg babies can be used for older babies as well. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Super Extenders- Convert your baby diaper to toddler diaper|publisher=superbottoms.com |url=https://www.superbottoms.com/product/super-extenders-toddler-diaper/ |accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3537">'''Computer-aided assessment''' (or "'''computer-assisted assessment'''") is a term that covers all forms of assessments, whether [[Summative assessment|summative]] (i.e. tests that will contribute to formal qualifications) or [[Formative assessment|formative]] (i.e. tests that promote learning but are not part of a course's marking), delivered with the help of computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologyenhancedlearning.net/tel-initiatives/computer-aided-assessment/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017152903/http://technologyenhancedlearning.net/tel-initiatives/computer-aided-assessment/|title=Computer Aided Assessment - Technology Enhanced Learning|archivedate=17 October 2011|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This covers both assessments delivered on computer, either online or on a local network, and those that are marked with the aid of computers, such as those using Optical Mark Reading (OMR). There are number of open source online tools to handle exams conducted on OMR sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Quiz OMR" : An extension to Moodle to provide online support for offline quizzes conducted on OMR sheets http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&amp;rid=3601&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer-aided assessment can be viewed in a few different ways. Technically, assignments that are written on a computer and researched online are computer-aided assessments.  One of the most common forms of computer-aided assessment (in terms of [[e-learning]]) is online quizzes or exams. These can be implemented online, and also marked by the computer by putting the answers in. Many content management systems will have easy to set up and use systems for online exams.

It is also envisaged that computer-based formative assessment, in particular, will play an increasingly important role in learning,&lt;ref&gt;Gomersall 2005&lt;/ref&gt; with the increased use of banks of question items for the construction and delivery of dynamic, on-demand assessments. This can be witnessed by current projects such as the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|SQA]]'s SOLAR Project.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Qualifications Authority 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of these assessments has been frequently demonstrated in studies, both in the form of positive student feedback and improvement in student performance (see, for example, Einig (2013) or Marriott and Lau (2008)).

'''Cropping''' is the removal of unwanted outer areas from a photographic or illustrated image. The process usually consists of the removal of some of the peripheral areas of an image to remove extraneous trash from the picture, to improve its [[framing (visual arts)|framing]], to change the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], or to accentuate or isolate the subject matter from its background. Depending on the application, this can be performed on a physical photograph, artwork, or film footage, or it can be achieved [[workstation|digitally]] by using [[image editing]] [[software]]. The process of cropping is common to the [[photography|photographic]], [[film]] processing, [[broadcasting]], [[graphic design]], and [[offset printing|printing]] businesses.

==Cropping in photography, print &amp; design==
[[File:vinepyrennees.jpg|thumb|right|Wide view, uncropped photograph]]
[[File:vinepyrennees crop.jpg|thumb|right|Cropped version, accentuating the subject]]
In the printing, graphic design and photography industries, cropping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the removal of unwanted areas from the periphery of a photographic or illustrated [[image]]. Cropping is one of the most basic [[photo manipulation]] processes, and it is carried out to remove an unwanted object or irrelevant noise from the periphery of a [[photograph]], to change its aspect ratio, or to improve the overall [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.croppola.com
 | title = Automatic image cropping to improve composition
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In telephoto photography, most commonly in avian and [[aviation]] photography, an image is cropped to magnify the primary subject and further reduce the angle of view -- when a lens of sufficient focal length to achieve the desired magnification directly was not available. It is considered one of the few editing actions permissible in modern [[photojournalism]] along with tonal balance, color correction and [[unsharp masking|sharpening]]. A cropping made by trimming off the top and bottom margins of a photograph, or a film, produces an view that mimics the [[panoramic photography|panoramic]] format (in photography) or the [[widescreen]] format in [[cinematography]] and [[broadcasting]]. Neither of these formats is cropped as such, but rather they are products of highly specialized optical configurations and camera designs.

=== Graphic examples (photography) ===
'''Cropping in order to emphasize the subject:'''
&lt;gallery widths=200 heights=200 perrow=2&gt;
File:Calanit004.jpg|Cropped image of [[Anemone coronaria]], aspect ratio 1.065, in which the flower fills most of the frame
File:Kalanit01.jpg|The original photo, aspect ratio 1.333, in which the flower uses only a small part of the frame
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Cropping in order to remove unwanted details/objects:'''
&lt;gallery widths=200 heights=200 perrow=2&gt;
File:Chartzit001.JPG|Cropped image of [[Garland chrysanthemum]], aspect ratio 16:4
File:Teva 17 3 (64).JPG|The original photo,  aspect ratio 1.333, the lower right part shows some white-colored trash and the upper right shows a dead flower, and both are unwanted objects.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Cropping in cinematography &amp; broadcasting==

In certain circumstances, film footage may be cropped to change it from one aspect ratio to another, without stretching the image or filling the blank spaces with [[letterbox]] bars (fig. 2).

Concerns about aspect ratios are a major issue in [[filmmaking]]. Rather than cropping, the cinematographer usually uses [[Open matte|mattes]] to increase the latitude for alternative aspect ratios in projection and broadcast. [[Anamorphic format|Anamorphic]] optics (such as [[Panavision]]  lenses) produce a [[full-frame]], horizontally compressed image from which broadcasters and projectionists can matte a number of alternative aspect ratios without cropping relevant image detail. Without this, widescreen reproduction, especially for television broadcasting, is dependent upon a variety of soft matting techniques such as letterboxing, which involves varying degrees of image cropping [http://www.filmbug.com/dictionary/aspect-ratios.php](see figures 2, 3 and 4)

Since the advent of [[widescreen]] television, a similar process removes large chunks from the top &amp; bottom to make a standard 4:3 image fit a 16:9 one, losing 25 percent of the original image. This process has become standard in the United Kingdom,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} for television programs in which many archive clips are used. This gives them a zoomed-in, cramped image with reduced ??. Another option is a process called [[Letterbox#Pillarboxing and windowboxing|pillarboxing]], where black bands are placed down the sides of the screen, allowing the original image to be shown full-frame within the wider aspect ratio (fig. 6). See [[Aspect ratio (image)#criticism|this article]] for a fuller description of the problem.

&lt;Gallery caption="Typical cropping in cinematographic and broadcast applications" widths="200px" heights="120px" perrow="3"&gt;

&lt;!-- File:Pillarboxed.jpg|Figure 6:&lt;br /&gt;A pillarboxed image, allowing the full 4:3 frame to be viewed within a cropped 16:9 widescreen --&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Additional methods==
Various methods may be used following cropping or may be used on the original image.
* [[Vignetting]] is the accentuation of the central portion of an image by blurring, darkening, lightening, or desaturation of peripheral portions of the image
* The use of nonrectangular [[Mat (picture framing)|mat]] or [[picture frame]] may be used for selection of portions of a larger image

==Uncropping==
It is not possible to "uncrop" a cropped image unless the original still exists or undo information exists: if an image is cropped and saved (without undo information), it cannot be recovered without the original.

However, using [[texture synthesis]], it is possible to artificially add a band around an image, synthetically "uncropping" it. This is effective if the band smoothly blends with the existing image, which is relatively easy if the edge of the image has low detail or is a chaotic natural pattern such as sky or grass, but does not work if discernible objects are cut off at the boundary, such as half a car. An [http://registry.gimp.org/node/16113 uncrop] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] exists for the [[GIMP]] image editor.

'''Deep reactive-ion etching''' ('''DRIE''') is a highly [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] [[etching (microfab)|etch]] process used to create deep penetration, steep-sided holes and trenches in [[wafer (semiconductor)|wafer]]s/substrates, typically with high [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s.  It was developed for [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), which require these features, but is also used to excavate trenches for high-density [[capacitor]]s for [[dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] and more recently for creating through silicon vias ([[Through-silicon via|TSVs]]) in advanced 3D wafer level packaging technology.

There are two main technologies for high-rate DRIE: cryogenic and Bosch, although the Bosch process is the only recognised production technique.  Both Bosch and cryo processes can fabricate 90° (truly vertical) walls, but often the walls are slightly tapered, e.g. 88° ("reentrant") or 92° ("retrograde").

Another mechanism is sidewall passivation: SiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; [[functional group]]s (which originate from sulphur hexafluoride and oxygen etch gases) condense on the sidewalls, and protect them from lateral etching. As a combination of these processes deep vertical structures can be made.

==Cryogenic process==
In cryogenic-DRIE, the wafer is chilled to −110&amp;nbsp;°C (163 [[kelvin|K]]).  The low temperature slows down the [[chemical reaction]] that produces isotropic etching.  However, [[ion]]s continue to bombard upward-facing surfaces and etch them away.  This process produces trenches with highly vertical sidewalls. The primary issues with cryo-DRIE is that the standard masks on substrates crack under the extreme cold, plus etch by-products have a tendency of depositing on the nearest cold surface, i.e. the substrate or electrode.

==Bosch process==
[[File:Bosch process PILLAR.jpg|thumb|alt=A silicon pillar fabricated using the Bosch process|A silicon micro-pillar fabricated using the Bosch process]]
The Bosch process, named after the German company [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] which patented the process,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5501893.html Basic Bosch process patent application]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6531068.html Improved Bosch process patent application]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6284148.html Bosch process "Parameter Ramping" patent application]&lt;/ref&gt;  also known as pulsed or time-multiplexed etching, alternates repeatedly between two modes to achieve nearly vertical structures:

# A standard, nearly [[isotropy|isotropic]] [[plasma etch]].  The plasma contains some ions, which attack the wafer from a nearly vertical direction. [[Sulfur hexafluoride]] [SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is often used for [[silicon]].
# Deposition of a chemically inert [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer.  (For instance, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (Octafluorocyclobutane) source gas yields a substance similar to [[Teflon]].)

[[File:Bosch process sidewall.jpg|thumb|alt=Undulating sidewall as a result of the Bosch process|Undulating sidewall of a silicon structure created using the Bosch process]]
Each phase lasts for several seconds.  The passivation layer protects the entire substrate from further chemical attack and prevents further etching.  However, during the etching phase, the directional [[ion]]s that bombard the substrate attack the passivation layer at the bottom of the trench (but not along the sides).  They collide with it and [[sputter]] it off, exposing the substrate to the chemical etchant.

These etch/deposit steps are repeated many times over resulting in a large number of very small [[isotropic]] etch steps taking place only at the bottom of the etched pits.  To etch through a 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm silicon wafer, for example, 100–1000 etch/deposit steps are needed.  The two-phase process causes the sidewalls to undulate with an amplitude of about 100–500 [[nanometre|nm]].  The cycle time can be adjusted: short cycles yield smoother walls, and long cycles yield a higher etch rate.

==Applications==
RIE "deepness" depends on application:
* in DRAM memory circuits, capacitor trenches may be 10–20&amp;nbsp;µm deep,
* in MEMS, DRIE is used for anything from a few micrometers to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm.
* in irregular chip dicing, DRIE is used with a novel hybrid soft/hard mask to achieve sub-millimeter etching to dice silicon dies into lego-like pieces with irregular shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Ghoneim | first1= Mohamed | last2 = Hussain | first2= Muhammad | title = Highly Manufacturable Deep (Sub-Millimeter) Etching Enabled High Aspect Ratio Complex Geometry Lego-Like Silicon Electronics| journal= small | date= 1 February 2017 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/smll.201601801/full | doi=10.1002/smll.201601801 | volume=13 | page=1601801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Mendis | first= Lakshini | title= Lego-like Electronics | newspaper= Nature Middle East | date= 14 February 2017 | url=http://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/article/10.1038/nmiddleeast.2017.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Berger | first= Michael | title=Lego like silicon electronics fabricated with hybrid etching masks | newspaper= Nanowerk | date= 6 February 2017 | url= http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=45763.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What distinguishes DRIE from RIE is etch depth: Practical etch depths for RIE (as used in [[integrated circuit|IC]] manufacturing) would be limited to around 10&amp;nbsp;µm at a rate up to 1&amp;nbsp;µm/min, while DRIE can etch features much greater, up to 600&amp;nbsp;µm or more with rates up to 20&amp;nbsp;µm/min or more in some applications.

DRIE of glass requires high plasma power, which makes it difficult to find suitable mask materials for truly deep etching. Polysilicon and nickel are used for 10–50&amp;nbsp;µm etched depths. In DRIE of polymers, Bosch process with alternating steps of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; etching and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; passivation take place. Metal masks can be used, however they are expensive to use since several additional photo and deposition steps are always required. Metal masks are not necessary however on various substrates (Si [up to 800&amp;nbsp;µm], InP [up to 40&amp;nbsp;µm] or glass [up to 12&amp;nbsp;µm]) if using chemically amplified negative resists.

Gallium ion implantion can be used as etch mask in cryo-DRIE. Combined nanofabrication process of focused ion beam and cryo-DRIE was first reported by N Chekurov ''et al'' in their article "The fabrication of silicon nanostructures by local gallium implantation and cryogenic deep reactive ion etching" (Nanotechnology, 2009).

===Precision Machinery===

DRIE has enabled the use of silicon mechanical components in high-end wristwatches. According to an engineer at [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], “There is no limit to geometric shapes with DRIE,”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolesnikov-Jessop | first = Sonia | title = Precise Future of Silicon Parts Still Being Debated | newspaper = The New York Times | location = New York | date = 23 November 2012 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/fashion/24iht-acaw2-silicon24.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; With DRIE it is possible to obtain an [[aspect ratio]] of 30 or more,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yeom | first1 = Junghoon | last2 = Wu | first2 = Yan | last3 = Selby | first3 = John C. | last4 = Shannon | first4 = Mark A. | title = Maximum achievable aspect ratio in deep reactive ion etching of silicon due to aspect ratio dependent transport and the microloading effect | journal = J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B | date = 31 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that a surface can be etched with a vertical-walled trench 30 times deeper than its width.

This has allowed for silicon components to be substituted for some parts which are usually made of steel, such as the [[hairspring]]. Silicon is lighter and harder than steel, which carries benefits but makes the manufacturing process more challenging.

[[File:ERating Levels.png|(small)px|framed|The four levels of the eRating certification]]
'''eRating''' is a certification, education, and labeling program for the passenger transportation sector developed by the [[Certification for sustainable transport|Certification for Sustainable Transport]] (CST) at the [[University of Vermont]].&lt;ref name="erating"&gt;http://www.erating.org/images/pdfs/CST_1.0_Program_Manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The eRating certification system is used by the Certification for Sustainable Transportation to rate vehicles based on criteria such as [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]] per passenger mile, emissions, [[Alternative fuel|alternative fuels]], purchase of [[Carbon offset|carbon offsets]], and any training programs that the driver has undergone that may help with [[Energy-efficient driving|energy efficient driving]]. If enough standards are met, the vehicle is given an eRating certification.&lt;ref name="erating" /&gt;

== Program description ==
The Certification for Sustainable Transportation's (CST) eRating certification program is an independent, third party certification, education, and labeling initiative for owners and operators, manufacturers, and passengers of transportation vehicles. The eRating certification program also functions as a sustainability index that weighs factors such as greenhouse gasses per passenger mile, environmental impacts, and even the use of alternative fuels and technologies in the transportation industry.&lt;ref name="uma.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uma.org/pdf/bmn111513.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224083925/http://www.uma.org/pdf/bmn111513.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major works were used in developing the CST eRating certification program: the Federal Trade Commission’s Part 26-Guide for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, and the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling (ISEAL) Alliance planning framework. In May 2012, the CST finalized Step B-3, and transitioned to step E-1 to launch the CST eRating certification program.&lt;ref name="erating" /&gt; The CST was designed to help improve economic, environmental, and energy efficiency within the passenger transportation sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.teamtrailways.com/certification-for-sustainable-transportation-program-launches-origins-at-univ-of-vermont/ |title=Certification for Sustainable Transportation Program Launches; Origins at Univ. of Vermont |publisher=Team Trailways |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program uses research-based criteria to evaluate vehicles and includes the driver training programs "Idle Free" and "Eco-Driving 101" to improve efficiency.

=== Idle Free Training Program ===
This course teaches drivers about the health, environmental, and financial impacts of idling a vehicle. Health experts, vehicle manufacturers, and vehicle operators have all given their testimony about the advantages of idle-free driving. Upon completion of the course, drivers are then able to take an "idle-free pledge", in which they promise to follow the idling guidelines set forth in the course. Completion of this course earns 20 points towards an eRating certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erating.org/transportation-company-education/courses |title=Training Programs |publisher=Erating.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eco-Driving 101 Training Program ===
This course teaches drivers about eco-driving. Eco-driving is a set of simple driving habits that result in using less fuel, generating fewer emissions, and increasing safety. The course first explains the science behind eco-driving, as well as the environmental and mechanical benefits of doing so. Drivers are taught techniques such as avoiding aggressive acceleration, speeding and braking monitoring speed to maintain efficient and consistent speed; keeping RPM levels as low as possible for the speed and keeping the vehicle properly maintained, that they can use in their everyday driving in order to cut back on fuel consumption.&lt;ref name="uma.org"/&gt; The typical eco-driver can increase fuel efficiency  by 10-30%. For organizations putting their drivers through this online training program, 20 points will be awarded towards the organizations eRating certification once they reach the 80% driver completion threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov//ODOT/TD/TP_RES/docs/2012NWTC/2012NWTC_Presentations/28_CertificationSustainableTrans.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610204816/http://www.oregon.gov//ODOT/TD/TP_RES/docs/2012NWTC/2012NWTC_Presentations/28_CertificationSustainableTrans.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
The program benefits owners, operators, and manufacturers by helping them reduce vehicle operation costs, save energy, and promote their businesses. The program also benefits consumers by helping them identify and choose the highest performing, lowest impact forms of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotourismconference.org/news/2012/certification-for-sustainable-transportation-cst |title=Certification for Sustainable Transportation: Benefits and Opportunities for Operators and Consumers &amp;#124; Ecotourism and Sustainable Tourism Conference |publisher=Ecotourismconference.org |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether displayed on a bus, boat, train, car, bicycle, or plane, an eRating certification label signifies that CST has thoroughly evaluated and certified the vehicle.&lt;ref name="erating" /&gt;

== eRating levels and criteria ==
Various features of the vehicle being considered for certification are examined. There are four levels of certification for a vehicle(s) in the eRating program: e1, e2, e3, and e4. The CST uses a point system, or sustainability index, to determine the certification level of a given vehicle.&lt;ref name="erating" /&gt; Points are given for more efficient features and attributes of the vehicle, with 100 being required for entry level, or e1, certification. e1 certification represents entry-level certification and e4 certification indicates the highest level. Only the most energy efficient, lowest impacts forms of transportation are eligible for certification; a certification label on a vehicle, be it e1, e2, e3, or e4, lets consumers know that the vehicle has met a set of rigorous sustainability criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erating.org/operators/rating-levels |title=eRating &amp; Criteria |publisher=Erating.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certification standards overview ===
The CST eRating certification program aims to provide recognition through certification to transportation systems, fleets, operators and individual vehicles that help the passenger transportation sector:

· Reduce greenhouse gas and other harmful emissions

· Increase energy efficiency

· Utilize alternative fuels and new technologies

The CST eRating certification program will offer four levels of certification on a per vehicle basis to qualifying operators: e1, e2, e3 and e4 certification; e1 certification represents entry-level certification and e4 certification indicates the highest level of certification available. The application process determines which level of certification an operator qualifies. Points are earned based on the following:

· Vehicle technology

· Operation of the vehicle(s) at certain efficiency levels

· Use of particular operating procedures within a company

· Use of specific policies and educational programs within a company

=== Greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile ===
Points are earned if the vehicle's greenhouse gas emission levels are at least 50% below the U.S. average for 2000-2009 (.274&amp;nbsp;kg per passenger mile). Minimum qualifications for vehicles must be greater than or equal to an average of 148 passenger miles per gallon. Higher levels of efficiency earn greater points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.megabus.com/participates-in-green%20Coach-certification-program.aspx |title=Megabus.com Participates in Green Coach Certification Program |publisher=Us.megabus.com |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criteria pollutant emissions ===
Points are awarded for the use of technologies that reduce emissions such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxide. Pollutant producing vehicles, such as those with leaky exhaust systems or that produce excessive amounts of smoke, are automatically disqualified for certification.&lt;ref name="erating" /&gt;

=== Alternative fuels ===
The use of alternative fuels besides gasoline or diesel earns a vehicle points ranging from 5-100 towards certification. Qualifying fuels must be used a minimum of 80% of the time.&lt;ref name="erating" /&gt;&lt;ref name="busride"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://busride.com/2012/12/the-best-of-busride-green-awards/ |title=The Best of BUSRide Green Awards &amp;#124; BUSRide Digital |publisher=Busride.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121134743/http://busride.com/2012/12/the-best-of-busride-green-awards/ |archivedate=2014-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenhouse gas offsets ===
Optional points can be earned by purchasing greenhouse gas offsets from endorsed carbon-trading programs.&lt;ref name="busride" /&gt; These GHG reduction credits must be purchased through the Climate Action Reserve or Verified Carbon Standard or from another verified organization. These credits must be purchased in the region of intended use and must not be more than two years old. Generally 1 point will be awarded toward certification for every 5% of emissions offset.&lt;ref name="erating" /&gt;

'''Emiran culture''' was a culture that existed in the [[Levant]] ([[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) between the [[Middle Paleolithic]] and the [[Upper Paleolithic]] periods.

Emiran culture apparently developed from the local [[Mousterian]] without rupture, keeping numerous elements of the Levalloise-Mousterian, together with the locally typical [[Emireh point]]. The Emireh point is the type tool of stage one of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], first identified in the Emiran culture.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age sites in Lebanon, p. 48 &amp; Figure IV, 4, p. 150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YsRRwAACAAJ|accessdate=21 July 2011|year=1965|publisher=Imprimerie Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous stone blade tools were used, including curved knives similar to those found in the [[Chatelperronian]] culture of Western Europe.

The Emiran eventually evolved into the [[Antelian]] culture, still of Levalloise tradition but with some [[Aurignacian]] influences.

According to [[Dorothy Garrod]], the Emireh point, known from several sites in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]],  is the hallmark of this culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vROM3JrrRa0C&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=emireh+point+israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KwCNSnaJb6&amp;sig=8QNCT80dYEbXlgEumNarGonX02o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_7RBUbD0GLLY4QTXg4DABQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=emireh%20point%20israel&amp;f=true Archaeology in Cultural Systems, Sally R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2252">In [[combustion]], '''Emmons problem''' describes the flame structure which develops inside the boundary layer, created by a flowing oxidizer stream on flat fuel (solid or liquid) surfaces. The problem was first studied by [[Howard Wilson Emmons]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, H. W. (1956). The film combustion of liquid fuel.

The Elliptic Emmons Problem. In ICHMT DIGITAL LIBRARY ONLINE. Begel House Inc..&lt;/ref&gt; The flame is of [[diffusion flame]] type because it separates fuel and oxygen by a flame sheet. The corresponding problem in a quiescent oxidizer environment is known as [[Clarke–Riley diffusion flame]].

==Burning rate&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;==
Consider a semi-infinite fuel surface with leading edge located at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and let the free stream oxidizer velocity be &lt;math&gt;U_\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Through the solution &lt;math&gt;f(\eta)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Blasius equation]] &lt;math&gt;f'''+ff''=0&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the self-similar [[Howarth–Dorodnitsyn transformation|Howarth–Dorodnitsyn coordinate]]), the mass flux &lt;math&gt;\rho v&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[density]] and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is vertical velocity) in the vertical direction can be obtained

:&lt;math&gt;\rho v = \rho_\infty \mu_\infty \sqrt{\frac{2\xi}{U_\infty}} \left(f'\rho \int_0^\eta \rho^{-1} \ d\eta - f\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = \int_0^x \rho_\infty \mu_\infty \ dx.&lt;/math&gt;

In deriving this, it is assumed that the density &lt;math&gt;\rho \sim 1/T&lt;/math&gt; and the viscosity &lt;math&gt;\mu \sim T&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature. The subscript &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; describes the values far away from the fuel surface. The main interest in combustion process is the fuel burning rate, which is obtained by evalutaing &lt;math&gt;\rho v&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\eta=0&lt;/math&gt;, as given below,

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_o v_o = \rho_\infty \mu_\infty \left[\frac{2U_\infty}{\mu_\infty^2}\int_0^x \rho_\infty \mu_\infty \ dx\right]^{-1/2} [-f(0)].&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the [[Hvalsey Church]] in Greenland.]]
'''Medieval architecture''' in '''North America''' is an [[anachronism]]. Some structures in [[North America]] can however be classified as medieval, either by age or origin. In some rare cases these structures are seen as evidence on [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]. Although much of this is [[pseudoscience]], these buildings are of interest to American scholars of [[medieval architecture]].

==Pre-Columbian buildings==
* [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Foundations of eight structures, visible today only as mounds because they were reburied in a conservation effort. Includes modern reconstructions.
* [[Church of Hvalsey]], a Norse church in [[Greenland]].  Additional remains of Norse-era settlements.

==Transported buildings==
Medieval building that have been transported to North America in modern times.
* [[The Cloisters]] museum, [[New York City]], a branch of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] housed in a complex integrating elements from several different medieval structures
* [[St. Bernard de Clairvaux Church]], a 12th-century cloister from Spain, reassembled in Florida
* Elements of a 12th-century cloister from [[Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines Abbey]], a Romanesque portal, and a 15th-century chapel in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]
* Part of a Romanesque cloister in the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], Ohio
* [[St. Joan of Arc Chapel|Chapel of St Martin de Sayssuel]], ([[St. Joan of Arc Chapel]]),  [[Marquette University]], [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]
* [[Agecroft Hall]], [[Richmond, Virginia]]
* Chapterhouse of the [[Santa María de Óvila|Abbey of María de Óvila]], under reconstruction at the [[Abbey of New Clairvaux]],  [[Vina, California]]
* A 1524 sidechapel from France in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]

Other later period buildings were also transported like the Cotswold Cottage, built in the early 17th century in [[Chedworth]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], now in [[The Henry Ford]] museum in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. The [[Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury]], London, which was designed by Sir [[Christopher Wren]] in 1677 is now in [[Fulton, Missouri]]. It includes a spiral staircase which probably dates to the 15th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39859">'''Farmer-managed natural regeneration''' ('''FMNR''') is a low-cost, sustainable [[land restoration]] technique used to combat poverty and hunger amongst poor [[subsistence farmer]]s in developing countries by increasing [[food production|food]] and timber production, and [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] to [[Extremes on Earth|climate extreme]]s. It involves the systematic regeneration and management of [[tree]]s and shrubs from tree stumps, roots and seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983; and Francis, R 2012, Project Manager, Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, World Vision Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
FMNR is especially applicable, but not restricted to, the [[dryland tropics]]. As well as returning degraded [[cropland]]s and [[grazing land]]s to productivity, it can be used to restore degraded forests, thereby reversing [[biodiversity loss]] and reducing vulnerability to [[climate change]]. FMNR can also play an important role in maintaining not-yet-degraded landscapes in a productive state, especially when combined with other [[sustainable land management]] practices such as [[conservation agriculture]] on cropland and holistic management on rangelands.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
FMNR adapts centuries-old methods of woodland management, called [[coppicing]] and [[pollarding]], to produce continuous tree-growth for fuel, building materials, food and fodder without the need for frequent and costly replanting. On farmland, selected trees are trimmed and pruned to maximise growth while promoting optimal growing conditions for annual crops (such as access to water and sunlight).&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Bank. 2008, Turning Back the Desert: How Farmers Have Transformed Niger's Landscapes and Livelihoods, Chapter 3 in World Resources 2008: Roots of Resilience – Growing the Wealth of the Poor, http://www.wri.org/publication/world-resources-2008-roots-of-resilience.&lt;/ref&gt; When FMNR trees are integrated into crops and grazing pastures there is an increase in [[crop yield]]s, [[soil fertility]] and organic matter, [[soil moisture]] and leaf fodder. There is also a decrease in wind and heat damage, and [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sahel]] region of Africa, FMNR has become a potent tool in increasing [[food security]], resilience and climate change adaptation in poor, subsistence farming communities where much of [[sub-Saharan]] Africa's poverty exists. FMNR is also being promoted in [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Myanmar]].

FMNR complements the evergreen agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;Evergreen Agriculture – the incorporation of trees into crop land and pastures. The three types of evergreen agriculture are: Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, the planting of trees in conventional crop fields, and conservation agriculture with trees. Evergreen agriculture is one of several types of [[agroforestry]].&lt;/ref&gt; conservation agriculture and [[agroforestry]] movements. It is considered a good entry point for resource-poor and risk-averse farmers to adopt a low-cost and low-risk technique. This in turn has acted as a stepping stone to greater agricultural intensification as farmers become more receptive to new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Garrity, D 2012, UNCCD Drylands Ambassador, Distinguished Board Research Fellow and former Director General of the World Agroforestry Centre, Chairman of Landcare International.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Throughout the [[developing world]], immense tracts of farmland, grazing lands and [[forest]]s have become degraded to the point they are no longer productive. [[Deforestation]] continues at an alarming rate. In Africa's drier regions, 74 percent of rangelands and 61 percent of rain-fed croplands are damaged by moderate to very severe [[desertification]]. In some African countries deforestation rates exceed planting rates by 300:1.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, A 1990, The Threatening Desert: Controlling desertification, pp 3, 141, 142, 215, 298, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Degraded land has an extremely detrimental effect on the lives of subsistence farmers who depend on it for their food and livelihoods. Subsistence farmers often make up to 70-80 percent of the population in these regions and they regularly suffer from hunger, malnutrition and even famine as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D, Dettmann, P, Rinaudo, T, Tefera, H and Tofu, A 2010, Poverty Alleviation and Environmental Restoration Using the Clean Development Mechanism: A Case Study from Humbo, Ethiopia, Environmental Management (2011) 48:322–333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrity, D, Akinnifesi, F, Ajayi, O, Weldesemayat, S, Mowo, J, Kalinganire, A, Larwanou, M and Bayala, J 2010, Evergreen Agriculture: a robust approach to sustainable food security in Africa, Food Security (2010) 2:197–214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the Sahel region of Africa, a band of savannah which runs across the continent immediately south of the Sahara Desert, large tracts of once-productive farmland are turning to desert.&lt;ref&gt;Tougiani, A, Guero, C and Rinaudo, T 2008, Community mobilisation for improved livelihoods through tree crop management in Niger, GeoJournal (2009) 74:377–389.&lt;/ref&gt; In tropical regions across the world, where rich soils and good rainfall would normally assure bountiful harvests and fat livestock, some environments have become so degraded they are no longer productive.
Severe famines across the African Sahel in the 1970s and 80s led to a global response, and stopping desertification became a top priority. Conventional methods of raising exotic and indigenous tree species in nurseries were used – planting out, watering, protecting and weeding. However, despite investing millions of dollars and thousands of hours labour, there was little overall impact.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, A 1990, The Threatening Desert: Controlling desertification, p 301, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conventional approaches to reforestation in such harsh environments faced insurmountable problems and were costly and labour-intensive. Once planted out, drought, sand storms, pests, competition from weeds and destruction by people and animals negated efforts. Low levels of community ownership were another inhibiting factor.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing indigenous vegetation was generally dismissed as 'useless bush', and it was often cleared to make way for exotic species. Exotics were planted in fields containing living and sprouting stumps of indigenous vegetation, the presence of which was barely acknowledged, let alone seen as important.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an enormous oversight. In fact, these living tree stumps are so numerous they constitute a vast 'underground forest' just waiting for some care to grow and provide multiple benefits at little or no cost –and each stump can produce between 10 and 30 stems each. During the process of traditional land preparation, farmers saw the stems as weeds and slashed and burnt them before sowing their food crops. The net result was a barren landscape for much of the year with few mature trees remaining. To the casual observer, the land was turning to desert. Most concluded that there were no trees present and that the only way to reverse the problem was through tree planting.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, established indigenous trees continued to disappear at an alarming rate. In Niger, from the 1930s until 1993, forestry laws took tree ownership and responsibility for the care of trees out of the hands of the people; and even though ineffective and uneconomic, reforestation through conventional tree planting seemed to be the only way to address desertification at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Brough, W and Kimenyi, M 2004, “Desertification” of the Sahel: Exploring the role of property rights, Property and Environment Research Center, Vol 2, No. 2, June 2004, http://perc.org/articles/desertification-sahel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Bank. 2008, Turning Back the Desert: How Farmers Have Transformed Niger's Landscapes and Livelihoods, Chapter 3 in World Resources 2008: Roots of Resilience – Growing the Wealth of the Poor, http://www.wri.org/publication/world-resources-2008-roots-of-resilience.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and spread==

In the early 1980s, in the Maradi region of the Republic of Niger, the missionary organisation, Serving in Mission (SIM), was unsuccessfully attempting to reforest the surrounding districts using conventional means. In 1983, SIM began experimenting and promoting FMNR amongst about 10 farmers. During the severe famine of 1984, a food-for-work program was introduced that saw some 70,000 people exposed to FMNR and its practice on around 12,500 hectares of farmland. From 1985 to 1999, FMNR continued to be promoted locally and nationally as exchange visits and training days were organised for various NGOs, government foresters, Peace Corps Volunteers and farmer and civil society groups. Additionally, SIM project staff and farmers visited numerous locations across Niger to provide training.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004 it was ascertained that FMNR was being practiced on over five million hectares or 50 percent of Niger's farmland – an average reforestation rate of 250,000 hectares per year over a 20-year period. This transformation prompted Senior Fellow of the World Resources Institute, Chris Reij to comment that "this is probably the largest positive environmental transformation in the Sahel and perhaps all of Africa”.&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Bank. 2008, Turning Back the Desert: How Farmers Have Transformed Niger's Landscapes and Livelihoods, Chapter 3 in World Resources 2008: Roots of Resilience – Growing the Wealth of the Poor, http://www.wri.org/publication/world-resources-2008-roots-of-resilience.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hertsgaard, M 2009, Regreening Africa, The Nation, 7 December 2009, http://www.thenation.com/article/regreening-africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2004, World Vision Australia and World Vision Ethiopia initiated a forestry-based carbon sequestration project as a potential means to stimulate community development while engaging in environmental restoration. An innovative partnership with the World Bank, the Humbo Community-based Natural Regeneration Project involved the regeneration of 2,728 hectares of degraded native forests. This brought social, economic and ecological benefits to the participating communities. Within two years, communities were collecting wild fruits, firewood and fodder, and reported that wildlife had begun to return and erosion and flooding had been reduced. In addition, the communities are now receiving payments for the sale of carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D, Dettmann, P, Rinaudo, T, Tefera, H and Tofu, A 2010, Poverty Alleviation and Environmental Restoration Using the Clean Development Mechanism: A Case Study from Humbo, Ethiopia, Environmental Management (2011) 48:322–333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank 2012, Ethiopia: Humbo Assisted Natural Regeneration, http://wbcarbonfinance.org/Router.cfm?Page=Projport&amp;ProjID=9625.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the Humbo project, FMNR spread to the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia where 20,000 hectares have been set aside for regeneration, including 10-hectare FMNR model sites for research and demonstration in each of 34 sub-districts.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Government of Ethiopia has committed to reforest 15 million hectares of degraded land using FMNR as part of a climate change and renewable energy plan to become carbon neutral by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP 2012, Programme document for Ethiopia (2012–2015), www.et.undp.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task...&lt;/ref&gt;

In Talensi, northern Ghana, FMNR is being practiced on 2,000-3,000 hectares and new projects, initiated by World Vision, are introducing FMNR into three new districts. In the Kaffrine and Diourbel regions of Senegal, FMNR has spread across 50,000 hectares in four years.&lt;ref&gt;World Vision Australia Monitoring and Evaluation Reports (internal documents).&lt;/ref&gt; World Vision is also promoting FMNR in Indonesia, Myanmar and East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of both independently promoted and spontaneous FMNR movements occurring. In Burkina Faso, for example, an increasing part of the country is being transformed into agroforestry parkland. And in Mali, an ageing agroforestry parkland of about 6 million hectares is showing signs of regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;World Agroforestry Center 2012, Improving Sustainable Productivity in Farming Systems and Enhanced Livelihoods through Adoption of Evergreen Agriculture in Eastern Africa, Research Proposal to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, World Agroforestry Center, Nairobi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reij, C 2012, African Re-greening Initiatives Blog, see http://www.africa-regreening.blogspot.com.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key principles==

FMNR depends on the existence of living tree stumps or roots in crop fields, grazing pastures, woodlands or forests. Each season bushy growth will sprout from the stumps/roots often appearing like small shrubs. Continuous grazing by livestock, regular burning and/or regular harvesting for fuel wood results in these 'shrubs' never attaining tree stature. On farmland, standard practice has been for farmers to slash this regrowth in preparation for planting crops, but with a little attention this growth can be turned into a valuable resource without jeopardising, but in fact, enhancing crop yields.&lt;ref&gt;Ndour, B, Sarr, A et Mbaye, A 2010, Projects Baysatol/SFLEI – Rapport d'Activities, Institut Sénégalais de Recherches Agricoles (ISRA), Centre National de Recherches Agronomiques, Replublique du Senegal Ministere de l'Agriculture / World Vision Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrity, D, Akinnifesi, F, Ajayi, O, Weldesemayat, S, Mowo, J, Kalinganire, A, Larwanou, M and Bayala, J 2010, Evergreen Agriculture: a robust approach to sustainable food security in Africa, Food Security (2010) 2:197–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

For each stump, a decision is made as to how many stems will be chosen to grow. The tallest and straightest stems are selected and the remaining stems culled. Best results are obtained when the farmer returns regularly to prune any unwanted new stems and side branches as they appear. Farmers can then grow other crops between and around the trees. When farmers want wood they can cut the stem(s) they want and leave the rest to continue growing. The remaining stems will increase in size and value each year, and will continue to protect the environment. Each time a stem is harvested, a younger stem is selected to replace it.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various naturally occurring tree species can be used which may also provide berries, fruits and nuts or have medicinal qualities. In Niger, commonly used species include: ''[[Strychnos spinosa]]'', ''[[Balanites aegyptiaca]]'', ''[[Boscia senegalensis]]'', ''[[Ziziphus]]'' spp., ''[[Annona senegalensis]]'', ''[[Poupartia birrea]]'' and ''[[Faidherbia albida]]''. However, the most important determinants are whatever species are locally available, their ability to re-sprout after cutting, and the value local people place on those species.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Faidherbia albida'', also known as the 'fertiliser tree', is popular for intercropping across the Sahel as it fixes nitrogen into the soil, provides fodder for livestock, and shade for crops and livestock. By shedding its leaves in the wet season, ''Faidherbia'' provides beneficial light shade to crops when high temperatures would otherwise damage crops or retard growth. Leaf fall contributes useful nutrients and organic matter to the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Garrity, D, Akinnifesi, F, Ajayi, O, Weldesemayat, S, Mowo, J, Kalinganire, A, Larwanou, M and Bayala, J 2010, Evergreen Agriculture: a robust approach to sustainable food security in Africa, Food Security (2010) 2:197–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of FMNR is not confined to croplands. It is being practised on grazing land and in degraded communal forests as well. When there are no living stumps, seeds of naturally occurring species are used. In reality, there is no fixed way of practising FMNR and farmers are free to choose which species they will leave, the density of trees they prefer, and the timing and method of pruning.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
[[File:FMNR example 1.png|thumbnail|centre]]
FMNR depends on the existence of living tree stumps, tree roots and seeds to be re-vegetated.  These can be in crop fields, grazing lands or degraded forests. New stems, which sprout from these stumps and tree roots, can be selected and pruned for improved growth. Sprouting tree stumps and roots may look like shrubs and are often ignored or even slashed by farmers or foresters. However, with culling of excess stems and by selecting and pruning of the best stems, the re-growth has enormous potential to rapidly grow into trees.

[[File:FMNR example 2.jpeg|thumbnail|centre]]Seemingly treeless fields may contain seeds and living tree stumps and roots which have the ability to sprout new stems and regenerate trees. Even this 'bare' millet field in West Africa contains hundreds of living stumps per hectare which are buried beneath the surface like an underground forest.

[[File:FMNR 3 example.png|thumbnail|centre]] '''Step 1.''' Do not automatically slash all tree growth, but survey your farm noting how many and what species of trees are present.
'''
[[File:FMNR example 4.png|thumbnail|center]] '''Step 2'''. Select the stumps which will be used for regeneration.

[[File:FMNR example 5.png|thumbnail|center]] '''Step 3'''. Select the best five or so stems and cull unwanted ones. This way, when you want wood you can cut the stem(s) that are needed and leave the rest to continue growing. These remaining stems will increase in size and value each year, and will continue to protect the environment and provide other useful materials and services such as fodder, humus, habitat for useful pest predators and protection from the wind and sun. Each time one stem is harvested, a younger stem is selected to replace it.

[[File:FMNR example 6.png|thumbnail|center]] Tag selected stems with a coloured rag or paint. Work with the whole community to draw up and agree on laws which will protect the trees being pruned and respect each person's rights. Where possible, include government forestry staff and local authorities in planning and decision making.

==Benefits==

FMNR can restore degraded farmlands, pastures and forests by increasing the quantity and value of woody vegetation, by increasing biodiversity and by improving soil structure and fertility through leaf litter and nutrient cycling. The reforestation also retards wind and water erosion; it creates wind-breaks which decrease soil moisture evaporation, and protects crops and livestock against searing winds and temperatures. Often, dried up springs reappear and the water table rises towards historic levels; insect eating predators including insects, spiders and birds return, helping to keep crop pests in check; the trees can be a source of edible berries and nuts; and over time the biodiversity of plant and animal life is increased.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Vision Australia 2012, Turning 'Deserts' into Food Bowls by Releasing the Underground Forest – Latest developments in Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, internal briefing paper, World Vision Australia, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; FMNR can be used to combat deforestation and desertification and can also be an important tool in maintaining the integrity and productivity of land that is not yet degraded.

Trials, long-running programs and anecdotal data indicate that FMNR can at least double crop yields on low fertility soils.&lt;ref&gt;Ndour, B, Sarr, A et Mbaye, A 2010, Projects Baysatol/SFLEI – Rapport d'Activities, Institut Sénégalais de Recherches Agricoles (ISRA), Centre National de Recherches Agronomiques, Replublique du Senegal Ministere de l'Agriculture / World Vision Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sahel, high numbers of livestock and an eight-month dry season can mean that pastures are completely depleted before the rains commence. However, with the presence of trees, grazing animals can make it through the dry season by feeding on tree leaves and seed pods of some species, at a time when no other fodder is available.&lt;ref&gt;Reij, C, Tappan, G, and Smale, M 2009. Re-Greening the Sahel: Farmer-led innovation in Burkina Faso and Niger, Chapter 7 in: Spielman, D, Pandya-Lorch, R (eds): Millions Fed – proven successes in agricultural development, International Food Policy Research Institute, US, pp 53-58, see http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc64ch07.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Vision Australia 2012, Turning 'Deserts' into Food Bowls by Releasing the Underground Forest – Latest developments in Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, internal briefing paper, World Vision Australia, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; In north east Ghana, more grass became available with the introduction of FMNR because communities worked together to prevent bush fires from destroying their trees.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well designed and executed FMNR projects can act as catalysts to empower communities as they  negotiate land ownership or user rights for the trees in their care. This assists with self-organisation, and with the development of new agriculture-based micro-enterprises (e.g. selling firewood, timber and handcrafts made from timber or woven grasses).&lt;ref&gt;World Vision Australia 2012, Turning 'Deserts' into Food Bowls by Releasing the Underground Forest – Latest developments in Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, internal briefing paper, World Vision Australia, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional approaches to reversing desertification, such as funding tree planting, rarely spread beyond the project boundary once external funding is withdrawn. By comparison, FMNR is cheap, rapid, locally led and implemented. It uses local skills and resources – the poorest farmers can learn by observation and teach their neighbours. Given an enabling environment, or at least the absence of a 'disabling' environment, FMNR can be done at scale and spread well beyond the original target area without ongoing government or NGO intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

World Vision evaluations of FMNR conducted in Senegal and Ghana in 2011 and 2012 found that households practising FMNR were less vulnerable to extreme weather shocks such as drought and damaging rain and wind storms.&lt;ref&gt;Diagne, M 2012, Evaluation Finale du Projet Beysatol, World Vision Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weston, P and Hong, R 2012, End-of-Phase Evaluation Report: Talensi FMNR Project, World Vision Australia / World Vision Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table summarises FMNR's benefits which fit the sustainable development model of economic, social and environmental benefits:

==Key success factors and constraints==

While there are numerous accounts of the uptake and spread of FMNR independent of aid and development agencies, the following factors have been found to be beneficial for its introduction and spread: 
	
* Awareness creation of FMNR's potential.
* Capacity building through workshops and exchange visits.
* Awareness of the devastating effects of deforestation. The adoption of FMNR is more likely when communities acknowledge their situation and the need to take action. This perception of need can be supported by education.
* An FMNR champion/facilitator from within the community who encourages, challenges and trains peers. This is critical during the first three to five years, and continues to be important for up to 10 years. Regular site visits also ensure early detection and remedial action on resistance and threats to FMNR through deliberate damage to trees and theft.
* The buy-in of all stakeholders including their agreement on any by-laws created for FMNR and the consequences for infringements. Stakeholders include FMNR practitioners, local, regional and national government departments of agriculture and forestry, men, women, youth, marginalised groups (including nomadic herders), cultivators and commercial interests.
* Stakeholder buy-in is also important to create a critical mass of FMNR adopters in order to change social attitudes from a position of apathy or active participation in deforestation to one of proactive sustainable tree management through FMNR.
* Government support through the creation of favourable policies, [[positive reinforcement]] of actions facilitating the spread of FMNR, and disincentives for actions working against the spread of FMNR. FMNR practitioners need to be confident that they will benefit from their labours (either private or community ownership of trees, or legally binding user rights). 
* Reinforcement of existing organisational structures (farmers clubs, development groups, traditional leadership structures) or establishment of new structures which will provide a framework for communities to practise FMNR on a local, district or region-wide basis.
* A communications strategy which includes education in schools, radio programs and engagement with religious and traditional leaders to become advocates.
* Establishment of a legal, transparent and accessible market for FMNR wood and non-timber forest products, enabling practitioners to benefit financially from their activities.

Brown et al. suggest that the two main reasons why FMNR has spread so widely in Niger are attitudinal change by the community of what constitutes good land management practices, and farmers' ownership of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D, Dettmann, P, Rinaudo, T, Tefera, H and Tofu, A 2010, Poverty Alleviation and Environmental Restoration Using the Clean Development Mechanism: A Case Study from Humbo, Ethiopia, Environmental Management (2011) 48:322–333.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers need the assurance that they will benefit from their labour. Giving farmers either outright ownership of the trees they protect, or tree-user rights, has made it possible for large-scale farmer-led reforestation to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and future directions==

Over nearly 30 years, FMNR has changed the farming landscape in some of the poorest countries in the world, including parts of Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal, providing subsistence farmers with the methods necessary to become more food secure and resilient against severe weather events.&lt;ref&gt;Reij, C, Tappan, G, and Smale, M 2009. Re-Greening the Sahel: Farmer-led innovation in Burkina Faso and Niger, Chapter 7 in: Spielman, D, Pandya-Lorch, R (eds): Millions Fed – proven successes in agricultural development, International Food Policy Research Institute, US, pp 53-58, see http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc64ch07.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hertsgaard, M 2011, The Great Green Wall: African Farmers Beat Back Drought and Climate Change with Trees – A quiet, green miracle has been growing in the Sahel, excerpt from Hertsgaard, M 2011, Hot: Living Through the Next 50 Years on Earth, publ Houghton Miflin Harcourt in Scientific American 28 January 2011, see http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=farmers-in-sahel-beat-back-drought-and-climate-change-with-trees.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011–12 food crisis in East Africa gave a stark reminder of the importance of addressing root causes of hunger. In the 2011 State of the World Report, Bunch concludes that four major factors – lack of sustainable fertile land, loss of traditional fallowing, cost of fertiliser and climate change – are coming together all at once in a sort of “perfect storm” that will almost surely result in an African famine of unprecedented proportions, probably within the next four to five years. It will most heavily affect the lowland, semi-arid to sub-humid areas of Africa (including the Sahel, parts of eastern Africa, plus a band from Malawi across to Angola and Namibia); and unless the world does something dramatic, 10 to 30 million people could die from famine between 2015 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, R 2011, Africa's Soil Fertility Crisis and the Coming Famine, Chapter 6 in the Worldwatch Institute report State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet, see http://www.worldwatch.org/sow11.&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration of degraded land through FMNR is one way of addressing these major contributors to hunger.

In recent years FMNR has come to the attention of global development agencies and grass roots movements alike. The World Bank, World Resources Institute, World Agroforestry Center, USAID and the [[Permaculture]] movement are amongst those either actively promoting or advocating for the uptake of FMNR and FMNR has received recognition from a number of quarters including:

* In 2010, FMNR won the Interaction 4 Best Practice and Innovation Initiative award in recognition of high technical standards and effectiveness in addressing the food security and livelihood needs of small producers in the areas of natural resource management and agro forestry.  
* In 2011, FMNR won the World Vision International Global Resilience Award for the most innovative initiative in the area of resilient development practice and natural environment and climate issues.  
* In 2012 FMNR won the Arbor Day Award for Education Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Arbor Day Awards, Nebraska City, US, see http://www.arborday.org/programs/awards/2012/?award=Education%20Innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, World Vision Australia – in partnership with the World Agroforestry Center and World Vision East Africa – held an international conference in Nairobi called Beating Famine to analyse and plan how to improve food security for the world's poor through the use of FMNR and Evergreen Agriculture. The conference was attended by more than 200 participants, including world leaders in sustainable agriculture, five East African ministers of agriculture and the environment, ambassadors and other government representatives from Africa, Europe and Australia, and leaders from non-government and international organisations.

Two major outcomes of the conference were:
# The establishment of a global FMNR network of key stakeholders to promote, encourage and initiate the scale-up of FMNR globally.
# Country, regional and global level plans as a basis for inter-organisation collaboration for FMNR scale-up.

The conference acted as a catalyst for media coverage of FMNR in some of the world's leading outlets and a noticeable increase in momentum for an FMNR global movement. This heightened awareness of FMNR has created an opportunity for it to spread exponentially worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, R 2012, Project Manager, Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, World Vision Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guardian/Observer 26 August 2012, Africa innovations: 15 ideas helping to transform a continent, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/africa-innovations-transform-continent; ABC Lateline 9 July 2012, Reforestation project adds hope to food crisis, Reporter Ginny Stein, http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2012/s3542254.htm; PBS Newshour 12 July 2012, Amidst Drought and Famine, Niger Leads West Africa in Addressing Crisis, https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/july-dec12/niger_07-12.html; Der Spiegel Online 18 June 2012, Begrünung in der Sahelzone – Mister Rinaudo will die Wüste, Aus Nairobi berichtet Horand Knaup, http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/sahelzone-fmnr-soll-ausbreitung-der-wueste-stoppen-a-838840.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

World Vision and the World Agroforestry Centrer are currently exploring opportunities for conducting conferences and workshops in new regions where FMNR is not yet established in order to stimulate further awareness and adoption.

A '''gas detector''' is a device that detects the presence of [[gas]]es in an area, often as part of a [[safety system]]. This type of equipment is used to detect a [[gas leak]] or other emissions and can interface with a [[control system]] so a process can be automatically shut down. A gas detector can sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring, giving them the opportunity to leave. This type of device is important because there are many gases that can be harmful to organic life, such as humans or animals.

Gas detectors can be used to detect [[combustible]], [[flammable]] and [[toxic]] gases, and [[oxygen]] depletion. This type of device is used widely in industry and can be found in locations, such as on oil rigs, to monitor manufacture processes and emerging technologies such as [[photovoltaic]]. They may be used in [[firefighting]].

'''Gas leak detection''' is the process of identifying potentially hazardous [[gas leaks]] by sensors. These sensors usually employ an audible alarm to alert people when a dangerous gas has been detected. Exposure to toxic gases can also occur in operations such as painting, fumigation, fuel filling, construction, excavation of contaminated soils, landfill operations, entering confined spaces, etc. Common sensors include combustible gas sensors, photoionization detectors, [[infrared point sensor]]s, [[ultrasonic sensor]]s, [[electrochemical gas sensor]]s, and [[semiconductor sensor]]s. More recently, infrared imaging sensors have come into use. All of these sensors are used for a wide range of applications and can be found in industrial plants, refineries, pharmaceutical manufacturing, fumigation facilities, paper pulp mills, aircraft and shipbuilding facilities, hazmat operations, waste-water treatment facilities, vehicles, indoor air quality testing and homes.

== History ==
Gas leak detection methods became a concern after the effects of harmful gases on human health were discovered. Before modern electronic sensors, early detection methods relied on less precise detectors. Through the 19th and early 20th centuries, coal miners would bring [[Domestic Canary|canaries]] down to the tunnels with them as an early detection system against life-threatening gases such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[methane]]. The canary, normally a very songful bird, would stop singing and eventually die if not removed from these gases, signaling the miners to exit the mine quickly.

The first gas detector in the industrial age was the ''flame safety lamp'' (or [[Davy lamp]]) was invented by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] (of England) in 1815 to detect the presence of methane (firedamp) in underground coal mines. The flame safety lamp consisted of an oil flame adjusted to specific height in fresh air. To prevent ignition with the lamps flame was contained within a glass sleeve with a mesh flame arrestor. The flames height varied depending on the presence of methane (higher) or the lack of oxygen (lower). To this day, in certain parts of the world flame safety lamps are still in service.

The modern era of gas detection started in 1926-1927 with the development of the catalytic combustion (LEL) sensor by Dr.Oliver Johnson. Dr Johnson was an employee of Standard Oil Company in California (now Chevron), he begun research and development on a method to detect combustible mixtures in air to help prevent explosions in fuel storage tanks. A demonstration model was developed in 1926 and denoted as the Model A. The first practical "electric vapor indicator" meter begun production in 1927 with the release of the Model B.

The worlds first gas detection company, Johnson-Williams Instruments (or J-W Instruments) was formed in 1928 in Palo Alto, CA by Dr Oliver Johnston and Phil Williams. J-W Instruments is recognized as the first electronics company in Silicon Valley. Over the next 40 years J-W Instruments pioneered many "firsts" in the modern age of gas detection, including making instruments smaller and more portable, development of a portable oxygen detector as well as the first combination instrument that could detect both combustible gases/vapors as well as oxygen.

Before the development of electronic household carbon monoxide detectors in the 1980s and 1990s, carbon monoxide presence was detected with a chemically infused paper that turned brown when exposed to the gas. Since then, many electronic technologies and devices have been developed to detect, monitor, and alert the leak of a wide array of gases.

As the cost and performance of electronic gas sensors improved, they have been incorporated into a wider range of systems. Their use in automobiles was initially for [[Exhaust gas|engine emissions control]], but now gas sensors may also be used to ensure passenger comfort and safety. Carbon dioxide sensors are being installed into buildings as part of [[demand-controlled ventilation]] systems. Sophisticated gas sensor systems are being researched for use in medical diagnostic, monitoring, and treatment systems, well beyond their initial use in [[operating room]]s. Gas monitors and alarms for carbon monoxide and other harmful gases are increasingly available for office and domestic use, and are becoming legally required in some jurisdictions.

Originally, detectors were produced to detect a single gas. Modern units may detect several toxic or combustible gases, or even a combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/instruments-controls/How-Gas-Detectors-Work|title=How Gas Detectors Work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer gas analyzers can break up the component signals from a complex aroma to identify several gases simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wali|first=Russeen|title=An electronic nose to differentiate aromatic flowers using a real-time information-rich piezoelectric resonance measurement|journal=Procedia Chemistry|date=2012|doi=10.1016/j.proche.2012.10.146|volume=6|pages=194–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Gas detectors can be classified according to the operation mechanism (semiconductors, oxidation, catalytic, photoionization, infrared, etc.). Gas detectors come packaged into two main form factors: portable devices and fixed gas detectors.

Portable detectors are used to monitor the atmosphere around personnel and are either hand-held or worn on clothing or on a belt/harness. These gas detectors are usually battery operated. They transmit warnings via audible and visible signals, such as alarms and flashing lights, when dangerous levels of gas vapors are detected.

Fixed type gas detectors may be used for detection of one or more gas types. Fixed type detectors are generally mounted near the process area of a plant or control room, or an area to be protected, such as a residential bedroom. Generally, industrial sensors are installed on fixed type mild steel structures and a cable connects the detectors to a [[SCADA]] system for continuous monitoring. A tripping interlock can be activated for an emergency situation.

=== Electrochemical ===
{{main article|Electrochemical gas sensor}}
[[Electrochemical gas sensor|Electrochemical gas detectors]] work by allowing gases to diffuse through a porous membrane to an electrode where it is either [[Redox|chemically oxidized or reduced]]. The amount of current produced is determined by how much of the gas is oxidized at the electrode,&lt;ref&gt;Detcon, http://www.detcon.com/electrochemical01.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505073321/http://www.detcon.com/electrochemical01.htm |date=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the concentration of the gas. Manufactures can customize electrochemical gas detectors by changing the porous barrier to allow for the detection of a certain gas concentration range. Also, since the diffusion barrier is a physical/mechanical barrier, the detector tended to be more stable and reliable over the sensor's duration and thus required less maintenance than other early detector technologies.

However, the sensors are subject to corrosive elements or chemical contamination and may last only 1–2 years before a replacement is required.&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent 4141800: Electrochemical gas detector and method of using same, http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4141800.html&lt;/ref&gt; Electrochemical gas detectors are used in a wide variety of environments such as refineries, gas turbines, chemical plants, underground gas storage facilities, and more.

=== Catalytic bead (pellistor) ===
Catalytic bead sensors are commonly used to measure combustible gases that present an explosion hazard when concentrations are between the [[lower explosion limit]] (LEL) and upper explosion limit (UEL). Active and reference beads containing platinum wire coils are situated on opposite arms of a Wheatstone bridge circuit and electrically heated, up to a few hundred degrees C. The active bead contains a catalyst that allows combustible compounds to oxidize, thereby heating the bead even further and changing its electrical resistance. The resulting voltage difference between the active and passive beads is proportional to the concentration of all combustible gases and vapors present. The sampled gas enters the sensor through a sintered metal frit, which provides a barrier to prevent an explosion when the instrument is carried into an atmosphere containing combustible gases. Pellistors measure essentially all combustible gases, but they are more sensitive to smaller molecules that diffuse through the sinter more quickly. The measureable concentration ranges are typically from a few hundred ppm to a few volume percent. Such sensors are inexpensive and robust, but require a minimum of a few percent oxygen in the atmosphere to be tested and they can be poisoned or inhibited by compounds such as silicones, mineral acids, chlorinated organic compounds, and sulfur compounds.

=== Photoionization ===
Photoionization detectors (PIDs) use a high-photon-energy UV lamp to ionize chemicals in the sampled gas. If the compound has an ionization energy below that of the lamp photons, an electron will be ejected, and the resulting current is proportional to the concentration of the compound. Common lamp photon energies include 10.0 eV, 10.6 eV and 11.7 eV; the standard 10.6 eV lamp lasts for years, while the 11.7 eV lamp typically last only a few months and is used only when no other option is available. A broad range of compounds can be detected at levels ranging from a few ppb to several thousand ppm. Detectable compound classes in order of decreasing sensitivity include: aromatics and alkyl iodides; olefins, sulfur compounds, amines, ketones, ethers, alkyl bromides and silicate esters; organic esters, alcohols, aldehydes and alkanes; H2S, NH3, PH3 and organic acids. There is no response to standard components of air or to mineral acids. Major advantages of PIDs are their excellent sensitivity and simplicity of use; the main limitation is that measurements are not compound-specific. Recently PIDs with pre-filter tubes have been introduced that enhance the specificity for such compounds as benzene or butadiene. Fixed, hand-held and miniature clothing-clipped PIDs are widely used for industrial hygiene, hazmat, and environmental monitoring.

=== Infrared point  ===
{{Main article|Infrared point sensor}}
Infrared (IR) point sensors use radiation passing through a known volume of gas; energy from the sensor beam is absorbed at certain wavelengths, depending on the properties of the specific gas. For example, carbon monoxide absorbs wavelengths of about 4.2-4.5 μm.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Muda, R., 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The energy in this wavelength is compared to a wavelength outside of the absorption range; the difference in energy between these two wavelengths is proportional to the concentration of gas present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

This type of sensor is advantageous because it does not have to be placed into the gas to detect it and can be used for [[remote sensing]]. Infrared point sensors can be used to detect [[hydrocarbons]]&lt;ref&gt;International Society of Automation, http://www.isa.org/Template.cfm?Section=Communities&amp;template=/TaggedPage/DetailDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=23377 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212231703/http://www.isa.org/Template.cfm?Section=Communities&amp;template=%2FTaggedPage%2FDetailDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=23377 |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other infrared active gases such as [[water vapor]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. IR sensors are commonly found in waste-water treatment facilities, refineries, gas turbines, chemical plants, and other facilities where flammable gases are present and the possibility of an explosion exists. The remote sensing capability allows large volumes of space to be monitored.

[[Exhaust gas|Engine emissions]] are another area where IR sensors are being researched. The sensor would detect high levels of carbon monoxide or other abnormal gases in vehicle exhaust and even be integrated with vehicle electronic systems to notify drivers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Infrared imaging ===
{{main article|Thermographic camera}}
Infrared image sensors include active and passive systems. For active sensing, IR imaging sensors typically scan a laser across the field of view of a scene and look for backscattered light at the absorption line wavelength of a specific target gas. Passive IR imaging sensors measure [[Absorption spectroscopy|spectral changes]] at each pixel in an image and look for specific [[spectral signature]]s that indicate the presence of target gases.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Naranjo and Shankar Baliga and Philippe Bernascolle, "IR gas imaging in an industrial setting," of ''Thermosense XXXII'', Proc. SPIE '''76610K''' (2010). {{doi|10.1117/12.850137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of compounds that can be imaged are the same as those that can be detected with infrared point detectors, but the images may be helpful in identifying the source of a gas.

=== Semiconductor ===
Semiconductor sensors detect gases by a chemical reaction that takes place when the gas comes in direct contact with the sensor. [[Tin dioxide]] is the most common material used in semiconductor sensors,&lt;ref&gt;Figaro Sensor, http://www.figarosensor.com/products/general.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the electrical resistance in the sensor is decreased when it comes in contact with the monitored gas. The resistance of the tin dioxide is typically around 50 kΩ in air but can drop to around 3.5 kΩ in the presence of 1% methane.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Vitz, E., 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This change in resistance is used to calculate the gas concentration. Semiconductor sensors are commonly used to detect hydrogen, oxygen, alcohol vapor, and harmful gases such as carbon monoxide.&lt;ref&gt;General Monitors, http://www.generalmonitors.com/downloads/literature/combustible/IR2100_DATA.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common uses for semiconductor sensors is in carbon monoxide sensors. They are also used in [[breathalyzer]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Because the sensor must come in contact with the gas to detect it, semiconductor sensors work over a smaller distance than infrared point or ultrasonic detectors.

=== Ultrasonic ===
[[Ultrasonic sensors|Ultrasonic gas leak detectors]] are not gas detectors per se. They detect the acoustic emission created when a pressured gas expands in a low pressure area through a small orifice (the leak). They use acoustic sensors to detect changes in the background noise of its environment. Since most high-pressure gas leaks generate sound in the ultrasonic range of 25&amp;nbsp;kHz to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, the sensors are able to easily distinguish these frequencies from background acoustic noise which occurs in the audible range of 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="gmigasandflame1"&gt;Naranjo, E., http://www.gmigasandflame.com/article_october2007.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ultrasonic gas leak detector then produces an alarm when there is an ultrasonic deviation from the normal condition of background noise. Ultrasonic gas leak detectors cannot measure gas concentration, but the device is able to determine the leak rate of an escaping gas because the ultrasonic sound level depends on the gas pressure and size of the leak.&lt;ref name="gmigasandflame1"/&gt;

Ultrasonic gas detectors are mainly used for remote sensing in outdoor environments where weather conditions can easily dissipate escaping gas before allowing it to reach leak detectors that require contact with the gas to detect it and sound an alarm. These detectors are commonly found on offshore and onshore oil/gas platforms, gas compressor and metering stations, gas turbine power plants, and other facilities that house a lot of outdoor pipeline.

=== Holographic ===
[[Holographic sensor|Holographic gas sensors]] use light reflection to detect changes in a polymer film matrix containing a hologram. Since holograms reflect light at certain wavelengths, a change in their composition can generate a colorful reflection indicating the presence of a gas molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/la102693m | pmid=20836549 | volume=26 | issue=19 | title=Holographic detection of hydrocarbon gases and other volatile organic compounds | journal=Langmuir | pages=15694–9 | last1 = Martínez-Hurtado | first1 = JL | last2 = Davidson | first2 = CA | last3 = Blyth | first3 = J | last4 = Lowe | first4 = CR| year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, holographic sensors require illumination sources such as white light or [[lasers]], and an observer or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] detector.

== Calibration ==
All gas detectors must be [[calibrated]] on a schedule. Of the two form factors of gas detectors, portables must be calibrated more frequently due to the regular changes in environment they experience. A typical calibration schedule for a fixed system may be quarterly, bi-annually or even annually with more robust units. A typical calibration schedule for a portable gas detector is a daily "bump test" accompanied by a monthly calibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=James |url=http://www.idealcalibrations.com/gas-detector-news/2010/10/14/article-calibration-who-needs-it-by-james-moore-occupational.html |title=Calibration: Who Needs It? |publisher=Occupational Health and Safety Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202185837/http://www.idealcalibrations.com/gas-detector-news/2010/10/14/article-calibration-who-needs-it-by-james-moore-occupational.html |archivedate=December 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every portable gas detector requires a specific [[calibration gas]] which is available from the manufacturer. In the US, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) may set minimum standards for periodic recalibration.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

=== Challenge (bump) test ===
Because a gas detector is used for employee/worker safety, it is very important to make sure it is operating to manufacturer's specifications. Australian standards specify that a person operating any gas detector is strongly advised to check the gas detector's performance each day and that it is maintained and used in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colhoun|first=Jacquie|url=http://www.aegissafety.com.au/index.php/gas-detection-blog/87-products/gas-detection/260-challenge-testing-your-gas-detector|title=Who is responsible for bump/challenge testing your gas detector|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227091425/http://www.aegissafety.com.au/index.php/gas-detection-blog/87-products/gas-detection/260-challenge-testing-your-gas-detector|archivedate=2014-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A challenge test should consist of exposing the gas detector to a known concentration of gas to ensure that the gas detector will respond and that the audible and visual alarms activate. It is also important inspect the gas detector for any accidental or deliberate damage by checking that the housing and screws are intact to prevent any liquid ingress and that the filter is clean, all of which can affect the functionality of the gas detector. The basic calibration or challenge test kit will consist of [[calibration gas]]/regulator/calibration cap and hose (generally supplied with the gas detector) and a case for storage and transport. Because 1 in every 2,500 untested instruments will fail to respond to a dangerous concentration of gas, many large businesses use an automated test/calibration station for bump tests and calibrate their gas detectors daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proflow.ca/gas-detection/bump-test-saves-lives.html|title=Bump test saves lives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oxygen concentration ==
Oxygen deficiency gas monitors are used for employee and workforce safety. [[Cryogenics|Cryogenic]] substances such as [[liquid nitrogen]] (LN2), liquid [[helium]] (He), and liquid [[argon]] (Ar) are inert and can displace oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in a confined space if a leak is present. A rapid decrease of oxygen can provide a very dangerous environment for employees, who may not notice this problem before they suddenly lose consciousness. With this in mind, an oxygen gas monitor is important to have when cryogenics are present. Laboratories, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] rooms, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and cryogenic suppliers are typical users of oxygen monitors.

Oxygen fraction in a breathing gas is measured by [[electro-galvanic oxygen sensor]]s. They may be used stand-alone, for example to determine the proportion of oxygen in a [[nitrox]] mixture used in [[scuba diving]],&lt;ref name=DANnitrox&gt;{{cite book |title=DAN Nitrox Workshop Proceedings |author=Lang, M.A. |year=2001 |publisher=Divers Alert Network |location=Durham, NC |page=197 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4855 |accessdate=2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as part of feedback loop which maintains a constant [[partial pressure]] of oxygen in a [[rebreather]].&lt;ref name=Goble&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goble, Steve |title=Rebreathers |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] Journal |volume=33 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=98–102 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7782 |accessdate=2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrocarbons and VOCs&lt;!--'VOC sensors' redirects here--&gt;==
{{further|Volatile organic compound#VOC sensors}}
Detection of hydrocarbons can be based on the mixing properties of gaseous hydrocarbons – or other [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) – and the sensing material incorporated in the sensor. The selectivity and sensitivity depends on the molecular structure of the VOC and the concentration; however, it is difficult to design a selective sensor for a single VOC. Many VOC sensors detect using a [[Electro-galvanic fuel cell|fuel-cell method]].

VOCs in the environment or certain atmospheres can be detected based on different principles and interactions between the organic compounds and the sensor components. There are electronic devices that can detect ppm concentrations despite not being particularly selective. Others can predict with reasonable accuracy the molecular structure of the volatile organic compounds in the environment or enclosed atmospheres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/la102693m |title=Holographic Detection of Hydrocarbon Gases and Other Volatile Organic Compounds |year=2010 |last1=MartíNez-Hurtado |first1=J.

R. |journal=Langmuir |volume=26 |issue=19 |pages=15694–9 |pmid=20836549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could be used as accurate monitors of the chemical fingerprint and further as health monitoring devices.

[[Solid-phase microextraction]] (SPME) techniques are used to collect VOCs at low concentrations for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2003.11.069 |title=Identification of volatile organic compounds emitted by a naturally aged book using solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry |year=2004 |last1=Lattuati-Derieux |first1=Agnès |last2=Bonnassies-Termes |first2=Sylvette |last3=Lavédrine |first3=Bertrand |journal=Journal of Chromatography A |volume=1026 |pages=9–18 |pmid=14870711 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct injection [[mass spectrometry]] techniques are frequently utilized for the rapid detection and accurate quantification of VOCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.trac.2011.04.005 |title=Direct-injection mass spectrometry adds the time dimension to (B)VOC analysis |year=2011 |last1=Biasioli |first1=Franco |last2=Yeretzian |first2=Chahan |last3=Märk |first3=Tilmann D. |last4=Dewulf |first4=Jeroen |last5=Van Langenhove |first5=Herman |journal=Trends in Analytical Chemistry |volume=30 |pages=1003–1017 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry|PTR-MS]] is among the methods that have been used most extensively for the on-line analysis of biogenic and antropogenic VOCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ellis |first1=Andrew M. |last2=Mayhew | first2=Christopher A. |date=2014 |title=Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry - Principles and Applications |location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd |isbn=978-1-405-17668-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAEiAgAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent PTR-MS instruments based on [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry]] have been reported to reach [[detection limit]]s of 20 pptv after 100 ms and 750 ppqv after 1 min measurement (signal integration) time. The [[Resolution (mass spectrometry)|mass resolution]] of these devices is between 7000 and 10,500 m/Δm, thus it is possible to separate most common isobaric VOCs and quantify them independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijms.2014.05.004 |title=A Proton Transfer Reaction-Quadrupole inferface Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-QiTOF): High speed due to extreme sensitivity |year=2014 |last1=Sulzer |first1=Philipp |last2=Hartungen |first2=Eugen |last3=Hanel |first3=Gernot |last4=Feil |first4=Stefan |last5=Winkler |first5=Klaus |last6=Mutschlechner |first6=Paul |last7=Haidacher |first7=Stefan |last8=Schottkowsky |first8=Ralf |last9=Gunsch |first9=Daniel |last10=Seehauser |first10=Hans |last11=Striednig |first11=Marcus |last12=Jürschik |first12=Simone |last13=Breiev |first13=Kostiantyn |last14=Lanza |first14=Matteo |last15=Herbig |first15=Jens |last16=Märk |first16=Lukas |last17=Märk |first17=Tilmann D. |last18=Jordan |first18=Alfons |journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry |volume=368 |pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Considerations for detection of hydrocarbon gases/risk control===
* Methane is lighter than air (possibility of accumulation under roofs)
* Ethane is slightly heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels/pits)
* Propane is heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels/pits)
* Butane is heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels/pits)

==Ammonia==
Gaseous [[ammonia]] is continuously monitored in industrial refrigeration processes and biological degradation processes, including exhaled breath. Depending on the required sensitivity, different types of sensors are used (e.g., [[flame ionization detector]], semiconductor, electrochemical, photonic membranes&lt;ref name="ablation1"&gt;J. L. Martinez Hurtado and C. R. Lowe (2014), Ammonia-Sensitive Photonic Structures Fabricated in Nafion Membranes by Laser Ablation, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces 6 (11), 8903-8908. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am5016588&lt;/ref&gt;). Detectors usually operate near the lower exposure limit of 25ppm;&lt;ref&gt;(OSHA) Source: Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials (Sixth Edition) by N. Irving Sax&lt;/ref&gt; however, ammonia detection for industrial safety requires continuous monitoring above the fatal exposure limit of 0.1%.&lt;ref name="ablation1"/&gt;

== Household safety ==
There are several different sensors that can be installed to detect hazardous gases in a residence. Carbon monoxide is a very dangerous, but odorless, colorless gas, making it difficult for humans to detect. Carbon monoxide detectors can be purchased for around US$20–60. Many local jurisdictions in the United States now require installation of carbon monoxide detectors in addition to smoke detectors in residences.

Handheld flammable gas detectors can be used to trace leaks from natural gas lines, propane tanks, butane tanks, or any other combustible gas. These sensors can be purchased for US$35–100.

==Research==
The European Community has supported research called the MINIGAS project that was coordinated by VTT Technical Research Center of Finland.&lt;ref name=Optics29Jan2013&gt;Matthew Peach, Optics.org.

'''''Helianthus annuus''''', the '''common sunflower''', is a large [[annual plant|annual]] [[forb]] of the genus ''[[Helianthus]]'' grown as a crop for its edible oil and edible fruits. This sunflower species is also used as wild bird food, as livestock forage (as a meal or a [[silage]] plant), in some industrial applications, and as an ornamental in domestic gardens. The plant was first domesticated in the [[Americas]]. Wild ''Helianthus annuus'' is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads. The domestic sunflower, however, often possesses only a single large [[inflorescence]] (flower head) atop an unbranched stem. The name ''sunflower'' may derive from the flower's head's shape, which resembles the sun, or from the impression that the blooming plant appears to slowly turn its flower towards the sun as the latter moves across the sky on a daily basis.

[[Sunflower seed]]s were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, where, along with [[sunflower oil]], they became a widespread cooking ingredient.

== Description ==
[[File:Helianthus whorl.jpg|thumb|left|Head displaying florets in spirals of 34 and 55 around the outside]]

The plant has an erect rough-hairy stem, reaching typical heights of {{convert|3|m|ft}}. The tallest sunflower on record achieved  {{convert|9.17|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Guiness&gt;{{cite web|title=Tallest Sunflower|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-sunflower|work=Guinness World Records|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunflower leaves are broad, coarsely toothed, rough and mostly alternate. What is often called the "[[flower]]" of the sunflower is actually a "[[Head (botany)|flower head]]" or [[pseudanthium]] of numerous small individual five-petaled flowers ("[[floret]]s"). The outer flowers, which resemble petals, are called [[ray flower]]s. Each "petal" consists of a [[ligule]] composed of fused petals of an asymmetrical ray flower. They are sexually sterile and may be yellow, red, orange, or other colors. The flowers in the center of the head are called [[disk flower]]s. These mature into fruit (sunflower "seeds"). The disk flowers are arranged spirally. Generally, each floret is oriented toward the next by approximately the [[golden angle]], 137.5°, producing a pattern of interconnecting [[spiral]]s, where the number of left spirals and the number of right spirals are successive [[Fibonacci number]]s. Typically, there are 34 spirals in one direction and 55 in the other; however, in a very large sunflower head there could be 89 in one direction and 144 in the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2gO2sBp4ipQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA217&amp;dq=large-sunflower+spirals+144+89|title=John A.

Most [[cultivar]]s of sunflower are variants of ''Helianthus annuus'', but four other species (all [[perennial]]s) are also domesticated. This includes ''H. tuberosus'', the [[Jerusalem Artichoke]], which produces edible tubers.

== Mathematical model of floret arrangement ==
[[Image:SunflowerModel.svg|thumb|Illustration of Vogel's model for ''n''=1&amp;nbsp;... 500]]
A model for the pattern of [[floret]]s in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H. Vogel in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;

To grow best, sunflowers need full sun. They grow best in fertile, moist, well-[[drainage|drained]] [[soil]] with heavy [[mulch]]. In commercial planting, seeds are planted {{convert|45|cm|ft|abbr=on}} apart and {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep.
Sunflower "whole seed" (fruit) are sold as a snack food, raw or after roasting in ovens, with or without salt and/or seasonings added. Sunflowers can be processed into a peanut butter alternative, [[sunflower butter]]. In Germany, it is mixed with rye flour to make ''Sonnenblumenkernbrot'' (literally: sunflower whole seed bread), which is quite popular in German-speaking Europe. It is also sold as food for birds and can be used directly in cooking and salads. Native Americans had multiple uses for sunflowers in the past, such as in bread, medical ointments, dyes and body paints.&lt;ref&gt;Pelczar, Rita. (1993) The Prodigal Sunflower. ''American Horticulturist'' 72(8).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunflower [[halva]] is popular in countries in [[Eastern Europe]], including [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Estonia]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]] as well as other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]]. It is made of sunflower seeds instead of [[sesame]].

Sunflower oil, extracted from the seeds, is [[Cooking oil|used for cooking]], as a [[carrier oil]] and to produce [[margarine]] and [[biodiesel]], as it is cheaper than [[olive oil]]. A range of sunflower varieties exist with differing fatty acid compositions; some 'high oleic' types contain a higher level of monounsaturated fats in their oil than even [[olive oil]].

The cake remaining after the seeds have been processed for oil is used as a livestock feed.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Hassoun P., Lessire M., Lebas F., 2016. Sunflower meal. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/732&lt;/ref&gt; The hulls resulting from the dehulling of the seeds before oil extraction can also be fed to domestic animals.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Hassoun P., Lessire M., Lebas F., 2018. Sunflower hulls and sunflower screenings. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/733&lt;/ref&gt; Some recently developed [[cultivar]]s have drooping heads. These cultivars are less attractive to [[Gardening|gardeners]] growing the flowers as [[ornamental plant]]s, but appeal to farmers, because they reduce bird damage and losses from some [[phytopathology|plant diseases]]. Sunflowers also produce [[latex]], and are the subject of experiments to improve their suitability as an alternative crop for producing [[hypoallergenic]] [[rubber]].

Traditionally, several Native American groups planted sunflowers on the north edges of their gardens as a "fourth sister" to the better known [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]] combination of [[Maize|corn]], [[beans]], and [[Squash (plant)|squash]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuepper and Dodson (2001) [http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/complant.html Companion Planting: Basic Concept and Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; Annual species are often planted for their [[Allelopathy|allelopathic]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;Nikneshan, P., Karimmojeni, P., Moghanibashi, M., Hosseini, N. (2011) ''Australian Journal of Crop Science.'' 5(11):1434-40. {{ISSN|1835-2707}}. [http://www.cropj.com/karimmojeini_5_11_2011_1434_1440.pdf Allelopathic potential of sunflower on weed management in safflower and wheat]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for commercial farmers growing commodity crops other than sunflowers, the wild sunflower, like any other unwanted plant, is often considered a [[weed]]. Especially in the Midwestern US, wild (perennial) species are often found in corn and soybean fields and can have a negative impact on yields.

Sunflowers can be used in [[phytoremediation]] to extract toxic ingredients from soil, such as lead, arsenic and uranium, and used in [[rhizofiltration]] to neutralize [[radionuclide]]s and other toxic ingredients and harmful bacteria from water. They were used to remove caesium-137 and strontium-90 from a nearby pond after the [[Chernobyl disaster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n3_v150/ai_18518620/?tag=content;col1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715211727/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n3_v150/ai_18518620/?tag=content;col1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |title=Botanical cleanup crews: using plants to tackle polluted water and soil |author=Adler, Tina |publisher=''Science News'' |date=July 20, 1996 |accessdate=2010-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar campaign was mounted in response to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110624/wl_asia_afp/japandisasteraccidentnuclearsunflowers|title=Sunflowers to clean radioactive soil in Japan|author=AFP|publisher=Yahoo News|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-25}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunflowers melt Fukushima's nuclear "snow"|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/19/us-japan-disaster-sunflowers-idUSTRE77I0PG20110819|accessdate=22 January 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=19 August 2011|author=Antoni Slodkowski|author2=Yuriko Nakao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heliotropism in ''Helianthus annuus'' ==
[[File:SunflowerSunset2.jpg|thumb|Flowerheads facing East, away from the late afternoon Sun.]]
[[File:2017-07-15 Ono-himawarino-oka-park (小野市立ひまわりの丘公園) ☆彡11.jpg|thumb|Sunflower just before sunset]]
A common misconception is that flowering sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky. Although immature flower buds exhibit this behaviour, the mature flowering heads point in a fixed (and typically easterly) direction throughout the day.&lt;ref name="Hangarter"&gt;"Many people are under the misconception that the flower heads of the cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus) track the sun... Immature sunflower flower heads do exhibit solar tracking and on sunny days the buds will track the sun across the sky from east to west... However, as the flower bud matures and blossoms, the stem stiffens and the flower head becomes fixed facing the eastward direction."  {{cite web|url=http://plantsinmotion.bio.indiana.edu/plantmotion/movements/tropism/solartrack/solartrack.html|title=Solar tracking: sunflower plants|last=Hangarter|first=Roger P|work=Plants-In-Motion website|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowers-org.com/helianthus-sunflower.html |title=Sunflowers in the blooming stage are not heliotropic anymore.

This alignment results from [[heliotropism]] in an earlier development stage, the young flower stage, before full maturity of flower heads ([[anthesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geochembio.com/biology/organisms/sunflower/|title=Sunflower, Developmental stages (life cycle) |work=GeoChemBio website|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young sunflowers orient themselves in the direction of the sun. At dawn the head of the flower faces east and moves west throughout the day. When sunflowers reach full maturity they no longer follow the sun, and continuously face east. Young flowers reorient overnight to face east in anticipation of the morning. Their heliotropic motion is a [[circadian]] rhythm, synchronized by the sun, which continues if the sun disappears on cloudy days or if plants are moved to constant light.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atamian|first=Hagop S.|last2=Creux|first2=Nicky M.|last3=Brown|first3=Evan A.|last4=Garner|first4=Austin G.|last5=Blackman|first5=Benjamin K.|last6=Harmer|first6=Stacey L.|date=2016-08-05|title=Circadian regulation of sunflower heliotropism, floral orientation, and pollinator visits|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/587|journal=Science|language=en|volume=353|issue=6299|pages=587–590|doi=10.1126/science.aaf9793|issn=0036-8075|pmid=27493185}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to regulate their circadian rhythm in response to the blue-light emitted by a light source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atamian|first=Hagop S.|last2=Creux|first2=Nicky M.|last3=Brown|first3=Evan A.|last4=Garner|first4=Austin G.|last5=Blackman|first5=Benjamin K.|last6=Harmer|first6=Stacey L.|date=2016-08-05|title=Circadian regulation of sunflower heliotropism, floral orientation, and pollinator visits|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/587|journal=Science|language=en|volume=353|issue=6299|pages=587–590|doi=10.1126/science.aaf9793|issn=0036-8075|pmid=27493185}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a sunflower plant in the bud stage is rotated 180°, the bud will be turning away from the sun for a few days, as resynchronization by the sun takes time.&lt;ref name="HäderLebert2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donat-Peter Häder|author2=Michael Lebert|title=Photomovement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nevsljDiCYC&amp;pg=PA673|accessdate=15 August 2010|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-50706-8|pages=673–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When growth of the flower stalk stops and the flower is mature, the heliotropism also stops and the flower faces east from that moment onward. This eastward orientation allows rapid warming in the morning and, as a result, an increase in pollinator visits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Sunflowers do not have a [[pulvinus]] below their [[inflorescence]]. A pulvinus is a flexible segment in the leaf stalks (petiole) of some plant species and functions as a 'joint'. It effectuates leaf motion due to reversible changes in [[turgor]] pressure, which occurs without growth. The sensitive plant's closing leaves are a good example of reversible leaf movement via pulvinuli.

== History ==
Although it was commonly accepted that the sunflower was first domesticated in what is now the southeastern US, roughly 5000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Blackman et al. (2011). [http://www.pnas.org/content/108/34/14360.full]. PNAS.&lt;/ref&gt; there is evidence that it was first domesticated in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;Lentz et al. (2008). [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/17/6232.full.pdf. PNAS.]&lt;/ref&gt; around 2600 BC. These crops were found in Tabasco, Mexico at the San Andres dig site. The earliest known examples in the United States of a fully domesticated sunflower have been found in Tennessee, and date to around 2300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Rieseberg, Loren H., et al. (2004). Origin of Extant Domesticated Sunflowers in Eastern North America. ''Nature'' 430.6996. 201-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Other very early examples come from rockshelter sites in Eastern Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Pollack (2012). [https://heritage.ky.gov/Documents/Native_History_KyTeachers.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American peoples]] used the sunflower as the symbol of their [[solar deity]], including the [[Tonatiuh|Aztecs]] and the [[Otomi people|Otomi]] of Mexico and the [[Tahuantinsuyu|Incas]] in South America. In 1510 early Spanish explorers encountered the sunflower in the Americas and carried its seeds back to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Putt, E.D.|title=Sunflower Technology and Production|editor=A.A.

[http://www.pnas.org/content/103/33/12223.full]. PNAS.&lt;/ref&gt; and to have become important agricultural commodities, the sunflower is currently the most economically important.

During the 18th century, the use of sunflower oil became very popular in Russia, particularly with members of the Russian Orthodox Church, because sunflower oil was one of the few oils that was allowed during [[Great Lent|Lent]], according to some [[Fasting#Rules|fasting traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;SUNFLOWERS: The Secret History. (2007). ''Kirkus Reviews'' 75.23:1236. ''Academic Search Complete.'' Web. 17 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century it was first commercialized in the [[Alexeyevka, Belgorod Oblast|village of Alexeyevka]] in [[Voronezh Governorate]] by the merchant named Daniil Bokaryov, who developed a technology suitable for its large-scale extraction, and quickly spread around. The town's coat of arms includes an image of a [[sunflower]] ever since.

Among the [[Zuni people]], the fresh or dried root is chewed by the medicine man before sucking venom from a snakebite and applying a [[poultice]]  to the wound.&lt;ref&gt;Camazine, Scott and Robert A. Bye (1980) A Study Of The Medical Ethnobotany Of The Zuni Indians of New Mexico.

* The sunflower is the [[state flower]] of the US state of [[Kansas]], and one of the city flowers of [[Kitakyūshū]], [[Japan]].
* The sunflower is often used as a symbol of [[green ideology]]. The sunflower is also the symbol of the [[Vegan Society]].
* During the late 19th century, the flower was used as the symbol of the [[Aesthetic Movement]].
* The flowers were the subject of [[Van Gogh]]'s [[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|''Sunflowers'' series of paintings]].
* The sunflower is the national flower of [[Ukraine]].
* The sunflower was chosen as the symbol of the [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist Church]] for many reasons, but mostly because it turns toward the sun as "Spiritualism turns toward the light of truth". As stated earlier in the article, this is in fact, not true. Modern Spiritualists often have art or jewelry with sunflower designs.&lt;ref&gt;Awtry-Smith, Marilyn J.

== Other species ==
There are many species in the sunflower genus ''Helianthus'', and many species in other genera that may be called sunflowers.

* The Maximillian sunflower (''[[Helianthus maximiliani]]'') is one of 38 species of [[perennial sunflower]] native to [[North America]]. The [[Land Institute]] and other breeding programs are currently exploring the potential for these as a perennial seed crop.
* The sunchoke ([[Jerusalem artichoke]] or ''Helianthus tuberosus'') is related to the sunflower, another example of [[perennial sunflower]].
* The Mexican sunflower is ''[[Tithonia]] rotundifolia''. It is only very distantly related to North American sunflowers.
* False sunflower refers to plants of the genus ''[[Heliopsis]]''.

==Sunflower hybrids==
In today's market, most of the sunflower seeds provided or grown by farmers are hybrids. Hybrids or hybridized sunflowers are produced by crossbreeding different types and species of sunflower, for example crossbreeding cultivated sunflowers with wild species of sunflowers. By doing so, new genetic recombinations are obtained ultimately leading to the production of new hybrid species. These hybrid species generally have a higher fitness and carry properties or characteristics that farmers look for, such as resistance to pathogens.&lt;ref name="Gontcharov, SV. Antonova 2006"&gt;Gontcharov, SV. Antonova, TS. and Saukova, SL. 2006. Sunflower breeding for resistance to fusarium. Helia [accessed September 14, 2014]; 29 (45): 49-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid, ''Helianthus annuus dwarf2''  does not contain the hormone gibberellin and does not display heliotropic behavior. Plants treated with an external application of the hormone display a temporary restoration of elongation growth patterns. This growth pattern diminished by 35% 7–14 days after final treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Hybrid Male Sterile and Male Fertile flowers that display heterogeneity have a low crossover of honeybee visitation. Sensory cues such as pollen odor, diameter of seed head, and height may influence pollinator visitation of pollinators that display constancy behavior patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Cinthia Susic|last2=Farina|first2=Walter M.|date=2016-03-01|title=Honeybee floral constancy and pollination efficiency in sunflower (Helianthus annuus) crops for hybrid seed production|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-015-0384-8|journal=Apidologie|language=en|volume=47|issue=2|pages=161–170|doi=10.1007/s13592-015-0384-8|issn=0044-8435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats and diseases==
One of the major threats that sunflowers face today is [[Fusarium]], a filamentous fungi that is found largely in soil and plants. It is a pathogen that over the years has caused an increasing amount of damage and loss of sunflower crops, some as extensive as 80 percent of damaged crops.&lt;ref name="Gontcharov, SV. Antonova 2006"/&gt;

[[Downy mildew]] is another disease to which sunflowers are susceptible. Its susceptibility to downy mildew is particular high due to the sunflower's way of growth and development. Sunflower seeds are generally planted only an inch deep in the ground. When such shallow planting is done in moist and soaked earth or soil, it increases the chances of diseases such as downy mildew.

Another major threat to sunflower crops is [[broomrape]], a parasite that attacks the root of the sunflower and causes extensive damage to sunflower crops, as high as 100 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Encheva, J. Christov, M and Shindrova, P. Developing Mutant Sunflower Line (Helianthus Annuus L.) By Combined Used Of Classical Method With Induced Mutagenesis and Embryo Culture Method.

{{for|the Canadian Senator|Joseph A. Day}}

'''Joseph Day''' (1855 in [[London]] – 1946) is a little-known&lt;ref name="Torrens, 3" &gt;{{harvnb|Torrens|1991|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; English engineer who developed the extremely widely used [[crankcase-compression two-stroke petrol engine]],&lt;ref name="Torrens, 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="U. Bath, Griffin"&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
as used for [[small engine]]s from lawnmowers to mopeds and small motorcycles. He trained as an engineer at the [[Crystal Palace School|Crystal Palace School of Engineering]] at [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] in London, began work at [[Stothert &amp; Pitt]] in Bath, and in 1889 designed the crankcase-compression [[two-stroke engine]] as it is widely known today (in contrast to the two-stroke engine designed by [[Dugald Clark]]), the Valve-less Two-Stroke Engine. In 1878 he started his own business, an iron foundry making cranes, mortar mills and compressors amongst other things. 

== Valveless two-stroke engine ==

He advertised a new design of "valveless air compressor" which he made on licence from the patentee, Edmund Edwards. By 1889, he was working on an engine design which would not infringe the patents that Otto had on the four-stroke,&lt;ref &gt;{{harvnb|Torrens|1991|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he eventually called the Valveless Two-Stroke Engine. In fact there were two flap valves in Joseph Day's original design, one in the inlet port, where you would probably find a reed valve on a modern two stroke, and one in the crown of the piston, because he did not come up with the idea of the transfer ports until a couple of years later. He made about 250 of these first two-port motors, fitting them to small generating sets, which won a prize at the International Electrical Exhibition in 1892.

It was one of Joseph Day's workmen, Frederick Cock, who made the modification which allowed the skirt of the piston to control the inlet port and do away with valves altogether, giving rise to the classic piston ported two stroke. Only two of these original engines have survived, one in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich,&lt;ref &gt;Engine Nº165, Mus. inv. L71747 illus. in {{harvnb|Torrens|1991|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the other in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London.

== American patent ==

The first American patent was taken out in 1894, and by 1906, a dozen American companies had taken licences. One of these, Palmers of Connecticut, managed by entrepreneur Julius Briner, had produced over 60,000 two-stroke engines before 1912.&lt;ref name="Boothroyd"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of these early engines found their way into motorcycles, or onto the back of boats.

== Bath factory ==

His company in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] was a general engineering one, and his engines were a sideline. Much of his money came from the manufacture of bread making machinery, and the prices of wheat were very turbulent around the turn of the Century. The profitability of Day’s factory fluctuated just as wildly. These were early days for the idea of the limited company, and shareholders, then as now, could panic and bring down a company that they thought to be under threat. The problem was made worse by the publication of rumours, or the deliberate orchestration of publicity campaigns in the press.

== Lawsuits ==

Joseph Day suffered from his involvement with both of the aforementioned, with the result that his firm was driven into bankruptcy. A flurry of lawsuits followed, with Day as either plaintiff or defendant. The Treasury Solicitor even tried to have him extradited from the USA where he had gone to try to sell his US patents in order to raise money. The case was eventually settled when the jury found that Day had no case to answer, but it all came too late, and he went into virtual retirement by the seaside. The development of his engine then passed to his licence holders in America, whose royalties restored his finances sufficiently to allow him to launch a spectacular new venture after the [[First World War]]. This new enterprise was the exploration for oil.

== Obscurity and death ==

Day lost most of his fortune exploring for oil in [[Norfolk]] in the east of England. A second financial disaster was the last straw, and Joseph Day disappeared from public view between 1925 and his death in 1946. His obscurity was so complete that a mere five years after his death, the Science Museum made a public appeal for biographical information about him – with no apparent result.

[[Liquefied natural gas]] ([[LNG]]) is the liquefied form of natural gas, which has a much smaller volume than natural gas in its gaseous form. This liquefied condition is used to facilitate the carriage of [[natural gas]] over long distances, often by sea, in specialized tanks. 

LNG port terminals are purpose-built port terminals designed to accommodate large [[LNG carrier]] ships designed to load, carry and unload  [[LNG]]. These LNG terminals are located adjacent to a gas liquefaction and storage plant (export), or to a gas regasification and storage plant (import), which are themselves connected to gas pipelines connected to on-shore or off-shore gas fields (export) or to storage and distribution plants (import).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11633">[[Image:Sony LocationFree logo.PNG|right|360px|Sony LocationFree logo]][[Sony]]'s '''LocationFree''' is the marketing name for a group of products and technologies for [[timeshifting]] and [[placeshifting]] [[streaming media|streaming]] video. The '''LocationFree Player''' is an [[internet]]-based multifunctional device used to stream live television broadcasts (including digital cable and satellite), [[DVD]]s and [[Digital Video Recorder|DVR]] content over a home network or the internet.  It is in essence a remote video streaming server product (similar to the [[Slingbox]]). It was first announced by Sony in Q1 2004 and launched early in Q4 2004 alongside a co-branded wireless tablet TV. The last LocationFree product was the LF-V30 released in 2007.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Sony LocationFree base station.PNG|right|Sony LocationFree base station]] --&gt;
The LocationFree base station connects to a home network via a wired Ethernet cable, or for newer models, via a wireless connection.  Up to three attached video sources can stream content through the network to local content provision devices or across the internet to remote devices. A remote user can connect to the internet at a wireless hotspot or any other internet connection anywhere in the world and receive streamed content. Content may only be streamed to one computer at a time. In addition, the original LocationFree Player software contained a license for only one client computer.  Additional (paid) licenses were required to connect to the base station for up to a total of 4 clients. 

On November 29, 2007 Sony modified its LocationFree Player policy to provide free access to the latest LocationFree Player LFA-PC30 software for Windows XP/Vista.  In addition, the software no longer requires a unique serial number in order to pair it with a LocationFree base station.[http://esupport.sony.com/perl/swu-download.pl?upd_id=3196&amp;SMB=YES] In December, 2007 Sony Dropped the $30 license fee for the LocationFree client. However, the software still requires registration to Sony's servers after 30 days.
 
Note (2016)...When attempting to register on-line, you are presented with a failed message and told that there is no internet connection. This may be operating system version related (Win 7, 8, 10) as the software was written for older Windows versions. The "free" version of the player, which can still be downloaded, will work for a time (30 days?) but then wants to be registered or have a key input. There does not seem to be a key available for the free version so the software must be removed and re-installed to continue using it. Any new units came with a CD of the software (usually an older version) along with a key, which can't be used on the free version. Two devices using the same key could not be registered to the same device. The same limitation is not present with the "free" software.

==Clients==

The player (server) can stream content to the following (client) devices:

*Windows or Mac computer ''- requires additional software''
*Mobile/cellular phones ''- coming later in 2007''
*Pocket PCs running [[Windows Mobile]]
*Smartphones/tablets running Android 2.2+
*Televisions ''- requires a Sony adapter''

Sony (Client) Products:

*Sony wireless Tablets (listed below)
*[[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) ''- system software version 2.50 or later (version 3.11 or later recommended due to inclusion of AVC support)''
*Sony Ericsson P990i ''- European Base Stations only''
*Sony VAIO laptops ''- starting Summer 2007, these laptops included an LF Vaio branded compatible client''

These products do not act as DVRs, since they do not allow content to be recorded to a hard drive.

A user can also access and control from anywhere in the world any device connected to the unit, and switch between multiple devices.

==BASE Station Models==
'''Base stations''' packaged with LocationFree Player installation disc and instructional DVD
*[http://www.sony.co.uk/view/ShowProduct.action?product=LF-PK1&amp;site=odw_en_GB&amp;pageType=Overview&amp;imageType=Main&amp;category=LF+LocationFree+Base+Station#tab LF-PK1]  ("PK" stands for "Pack" or "Package" as it is a package of the LF-B1 base station, LFA-PC2 LocationFree player software for the PC and instructional DVD)
**First standalone model sold without a tablet
**Only model in the North American market to ever come equipped with an RF coaxial input.  However the European model did not have an RF coaxial input.
**Wireless 11a/b/g.  Can also be used as a conventional Wi-fi access point if connected to a wired router via Ethernet.
**Three firmware versions released.  Version 1.000 was the original release version for Japan and North America.  Version 2.000 added support for the Sony PSP (with PSP firmware version 2.50 or higher).  An update was made available for Japanese and North American owners.  Version 3.000 was the original release version for the European version of the LF-PK1 meaning all European models shipped with this latest firmware version.  It increased the number of maximum clients that can be registered from 4 to 8.  It also enhanced the way settings were changed through the web interface.  Previously, whenever a setting was changed, the base station would have to be rebooted.  With the 3.000, setting changes no longer created a reboot.  An update program was offered for Japanese owners of the LF-PK1, however no update to firmware 3.000 has ever been made available for the North American model, nor can the Japanese 3.000 update be installed on the North American model.
*LF-B10
**Bundled with LFA-PC20 LocationFree player for the PC and instructional DVD
**Wired 10/100
** Two Infrared Ports

==LocationFree wireless tablet TV==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Sony LocationFree wireless TV.PNG|right|275px|Sony LocationFree wireless TV]] --&gt;
In October 2004 Sony unveiled a portable, wireless and rechargeable [[SVGA]] 12.1" [[LCD]] tablet screen with dualband [[Wi-Fi]] technology (IEEE 802.11a/b/g)
which can receive pictures from the LocationFree player up to 100 feet from the source signal. The TV also has web-browsing and email functions, a [[Memory Stick]] Duo slot and an on-screen hand-drawing function for use as a drawing tablet. The screen can also be used as an intelligent universal AV remote control. These tablets were bundled with Base Stations.

Three versions have been released:
*LF-X1
**Original 12" Model, Aspect ratio 4:3 (LF-X1M is monitor only)
**Besides included tablet, base station ONLY compatible with LFA-PC1 LocationFree player for the PC, sold separately. LFA-PC2 or later, as well as all other software players and the PSP are NOT compatible with this base station.
*LF-X5
**7" Model, Aspect ratio 16:9
**Besides included tablet, base station ONLY compatible with LFA-PC1 LocationFree player for the PC, sold separately. LFA-PC2 or later, as well as all other software players and the PSP are NOT compatible with this base station.
*LF-X11
**Bundled with same LF-B1 base station as LF-PK1. This means the base station can be also be paired with other devices just like the LF-PK1 such as a PSP. However the LF-X11 tablet cannot be paired with another LF-B1 or other LocationFree base station, it is permanently bonded with the included LF-B1 base station.
**Bundled with LFA-PC2 LocationFree player for the PC
**Wireless 11a/b/g. Base station can also be used as a conventional Wi-fi access point if connected to a wired router via Ethernet.
**Please read LF-PK1 description above for more information and details about the LF-B1 base station and its different firmware versions, as they are the same base station.

==Software==

A '''maize milling''' machine is a machine for processing [[maize]] or corn for safe consumption, such as for daily food use. 

The grain is first cleaned and then conditioned (dampening the maize with water and then allowing it to condition for some time to stay in a temper bin).

==Cleaning and conditioning==
Cleaning and conditioning of the maize is an important step in the process and refers to the removal of foreign material and all that is not maize kernels from the to-be milled grain that lowers the quality of the product such as husk, straw, dust, sand, and everything too big or too small and lighter than a maize kernel.

It also refers to the removal of poisonous seeds, and material harmful to the milling equipment such as [[metal]] and [[stones]]. Conditioning refers to the addition of moisture to the maize to allow the bran to be peeled off in flakes during milling with plate or roller mills, allowing easy separation in a [[sifter]] and, most importantly, to add mass to the meal.

==Milling and sifting==
Following this process, [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] can commence and may take several forms:

1. Adopt the [[Roller mill|Roller Mill]] to grinding the grain, the roller mill has Single roller mill, Double roller mill and Pneumatic roller mill, the mill adopt the grinding roller to work. In a complete maize milling plant, there are several Roller Mill to work together, they have different functions, the first mill mainly peeling the maize skin, the second and third will grinding the maize into granular size, and meanwhile to get some super fine [[flour]], and the granular sized product will go to the next mill to continue grinding.

2.While grinding time, use Double Bin sifter or Square Plan sifter to sift the meal from the miller,classification and sifting more super flour.In general,the sifting used to separate the flour and bran, also separate large size and small size to ensure flour quality.

==Final product packing==
After the maize is processed, it will come out in different final products like flour and [[grits]]. They are different from their granular size. For the packing, a Full-auto Flour Packing Machine is adopted, and the flour is packed into 5kg, 10kg, 25kg or 50kg bags.

==Best quality maize==
The best quality maize meal is therefore obtained by:

De-germinating the maize prior to milling
Milling with rollers rather than hammer mills or plate mills/disc mills.
Alternatively, if the budget is small, the whole maize, after cleaning and conditioning, may be milled by means of the plate mill only and then sifted (without de-germination). A significant part of the bran and germ meal would then be sifted off, resulting in a Special Sifted meal - of lower quality than roller milled meal and higher quality than hammer milled meal.

A further element of major importance is sifting. Milling and sifting, form the very essence of grain processing.
The sifters in every system should be one or more of the following:

Turbo sifters - two separation horizontally shafted with steel screens - high capacity but not sifting very fine - used in small capacity plate mill systems and as graders for samp and other primary grading after de-germinators.

Rotary sifters - three separation horizontally shafted with nylon screens - lower capacity but very fine screening - used in small capacity plate mill systems.

Mini plan sifters - relatively high capacity and very fine screening used as primary sifters for all mills of 1 ton per hour to 2.5 tons per hour.

Plan sifters in various sizes and numbers of passages: Very high capacity and fine screening - used in all mills with capacity of 2.5 ton per hour and more.

Industrial type mills can be constructed over one level, two levels, three levels or more, as existing buildings determine or as practical as the solution may be. High capacity mills normally require more levels to make use of gravity in moving product between mills and sifters.

Another option to consider, is to place a small mill (500-1,000&amp;nbsp;kg/h) in a container. This is only recommended for special applications where buildings are problematic, where the mill needs to be moved from time to time to another location, where temporary power is used and where the mill is located in very remote areas.

A '''mass driver''' or '''electromagnetic catapult''' is a proposed method of [[non-rocket spacelaunch]] which would use a [[linear motor]] to [[Acceleration|accelerate]] and [[catapult]] [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]]s up to high [[speed]]s.  All existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by [[electricity]] to make [[electromagnet]]s. Sequential firing of a row of [[electromagnet]]s [[accelerate]]s the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to [[momentum]]. 

Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a [[coilgun]] that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload. Once the payload has been accelerated, the two separate, and the holder is slowed and recycled for another payload.

Mass drivers can be used to propel spacecraft in three different ways: A large, ground-based mass driver could be used to launch spacecraft away from Earth, the [[Moon]], or another body.  A small mass driver could be on board a spacecraft, flinging pieces of material into space to propel itself. Another variation would have a massive facility on a moon or asteroid send projectiles to assist a distant craft.

Miniaturized mass drivers can also be [[Coilgun#Potential uses|used as weapons]] in a similar manner as classic firearms or cannon using chemical combustion.  Hybrids between coilguns and [[railgun]]s such as [[helical railgun]]s are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Kolm, H.|display-authors =etal|title =Electromagnetic Guns, Launchers, and Reaction Engines|publisher =MIT|date =1980|url =http://www.coilgun.info/theorymath/electroguns.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed mass drivers==
{{see also|Space gun}}
Mass drivers need no physical contact between moving parts because they guide their projectiles by dynamic magnetic levitation, allowing extreme reusability in the case of solid-state power switching, and a functional life of - theoretically - up to millions of launches.  While marginal costs tend to be accordingly low, initial development and construction costs are highly dependent on performance, especially the intended mass, acceleration, and velocity of projectiles.  For instance, while [[Gerard K. O'Neill|Gerard O'Neill]] built his first mass driver in 1976–1977 with a $2000 budget, a short [[Mass Driver 1|test model]] firing a projectile at 40&amp;nbsp;m/s and 33 [[g-force|g]],&lt;ref&gt;

after a comparable increase in funding, and, a few years later, researchers at the University of Texas estimated that a mass driver firing a 10 kilogram projectile at 6000&amp;nbsp;m/s would cost $47 million.&lt;ref name = massdriver2&gt;[http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ee070/Fall07/UNSECURE/Pictures%20of%20the%20Mass%20Driver%20discussed%20in%20class/Mass%20Driver%20Two%20-%20A%20Status%20Report.pdf IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Vol Mag-18, No. 1], January 1982.

For a given amount of energy involved, heavier objects go proportionally slower. Light objects may be projected at 20&amp;nbsp;km/s or more. The limits are generally the expense of energy storage able to be discharged quickly enough and the cost of power switching, which may be by semiconductors or by gas-phase switches (which still often have a niche in extreme pulse power applications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot256.nsf/veritydisplay/8a528b3efd5df655c12578470029b1f6/$file/eml08aw_high%20current%20high%20voltage%20switches%20for%20electromagnetic%20launch%20%28eml2008%29.pdf |title= High Current, High Voltage Solid State Discharge Switches for Electromagnetic Launch Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/pulse.html|title= Pulse Power Switching Devices - An Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA428435|title= Scanning the Technology: Modern Pulsed Power|accessdate= April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, energy can be stored inductively in superconducting coils. A 1&amp;nbsp;km long mass driver made of superconducting coils can accelerate a 20&amp;nbsp;kg vehicle to 10.5&amp;nbsp;km/s at a conversion efficiency of 80%, and average acceleration of 5,600 g.&lt;ref name=L5news&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth-based mass drivers for propelling vehicles to orbit, such as the [[StarTram]] concept, would require considerable capital investment.&lt;ref name = startram&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.startram.com/resources|title=StarTram2010: Maglev Launch: Ultra Low Cost Ultra High Volume Access to Space for Cargo and Humans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth's relatively strong gravity and relatively thick atmosphere make such an installation difficult, thus many proposals feature installing mass drivers on the [[moon]], where the lower [[gravity]] and [[Atmosphere of the Moon|lack of atmosphere]] greatly reduce the required velocity to reach lunar orbit.

Most serious mass-driver designs use superconducting coils to achieve reasonable energetic efficiency (often 50% to 90+%, depending on design).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|bibcode= 1980ITM....16..719K|title= Electromagnetic Launchers|doi= 10.1109/TMAG.1980.1060806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment may include a superconducting bucket or aluminum coil as the payload. The coils of a mass driver can induce [[eddy current]]s in a payload's aluminum coil, and then act on the resulting [[magnetic field]]. There are two sections of a mass driver. The maximum [[acceleration]] part spaces the coils at constant distances, and synchronizes the coil currents to the bucket. In this section, the acceleration increases as the velocity increases, up to the maximum that the bucket can take. After that, the constant acceleration region begins. This region spaces the coils at increasing distances to give a fixed amount of velocity increase per unit of time.

Based on this mode, a major proposal for the use of mass drivers involved transporting lunar-surface material to space habitats for processing using [[solar energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/Table_of_Contents1.html NASA, 1975: Space Settlements: A Design Study]. Retrieved 2011-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The Space Studies Institute showed that this application was reasonably practical.

In some designs, the payload would be held in a bucket and then released, so that the bucket can be decelerated and reused. A disposable bucket, on the other hand, would avail acceleration along the whole track.

===On Earth===
In contrast to cargo-only chemical [[space gun | space-gun]] concepts, a mass driver could be any length, affordable, and with relatively smooth acceleration throughout, optionally even lengthy enough to reach target velocity without excessive [[g-force|g forces]] for passengers. It can be constructed as a very long and mainly horizontally aligned [[launch track]] for spacelaunch, targeted upwards at the end, partly by bending of the track upwards and partly by [[Earth's curvature]] in the other direction.

Natural elevations, such as mountains, may facilitate the construction of the distant, upwardly targeted part. The higher up the track terminates, the less resistance from the atmosphere the launched object will encounter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacemonitor.blogspot.com/2007/03/magnetic-launch-system.html The Space Monitor - Magnetic Launch System]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 40 [[megajoule]]s per kilogram or less [[kinetic energy]] of projectiles launched at up to 9000&amp;nbsp;m/s velocity (if including extra for drag losses) towards [[low Earth orbit]] is a few [[kilowatt-hours]] per kilogram if efficiencies are relatively high, which accordingly has been hypothesized to be under $1 of electrical energy cost per kilogram shipped to [[Low Earth Orbit|LEO]], though total costs would be far more than electricity alone.&lt;ref name = startram/&gt;  By being mainly located slightly above, on or beneath the ground, a mass driver may be easier to maintain compared with many other structures of [[non-rocket spacelaunch]].  Whether or not underground, it needs to be housed in a pipe that is [[vacuum pump]]ed in order to prevent internal air [[Drag (physics)|drag]], such as with a mechanical shutter kept closed most of the time but a [[plasma window]] used during the moments of firing to prevent loss of vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA426465&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Advanced Propulsion Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

A mass driver on Earth would usually be a compromise system.  A mass driver would accelerate a payload up to some high speed which would not be enough for orbit. It would then release the payload, which would complete the launch with rockets.  This would drastically reduce the amount of velocity needed to be provided by rockets to reach orbit.  Well under a tenth of orbital velocity from a small rocket thruster is enough to raise [[perigee]] if a design prioritizes minimizing such, but hybrid proposals optionally reduce requirements for the mass driver itself by having a greater portion of [[delta-v]] by a rocket burn (or orbital [[momentum exchange tether]]).&lt;ref name = startram/&gt;  On Earth, a mass-driver design could possibly use well-tested [[Maglev train|maglev]] components.

To launch a space vehicle with humans on board, a mass driver's track would need to be several hundreds of kilometers long if providing almost all the velocity to [[Low Earth Orbit]], though a lesser length could provide major launch assist. Required length, if accelerating mainly at near a constant maximum acceptable [[g-force]] for passengers, is proportional to velocity squared.&lt;ref name = physics&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mot.html#mot1|title= Constant Acceleration}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, half of the velocity goal could correspond to a quarter as long of a tunnel needing to be constructed, for the same acceleration.&lt;ref name = physics/&gt; For rugged objects, much higher accelerations may suffice, allowing a far shorter track, potentially circular or [[Helix|helical]] (spiral).&lt;ref&gt;[http://techfreep.com/magnets-not-rockets-could-fling-satellites-into-space.htm techfreep.com - Magnets, Not Rockets, Could Fling Satellites Into Space]&lt;/ref&gt; Another concept involves a large ring design whereby a space vehicle would circle the ring numerous times, gradually gaining speed, before being released into a launch corridor leading skyward.

Mass drivers have been proposed for the disposal of nuclear waste in space: a projectile launched at much above Earth's [[escape velocity]] would escape the Solar System, with atmospheric passage at such speed calculated as survivable through an elongated projectile and a very substantial heatshield.&lt;ref name=L5news/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft-based mass drivers==
A [[spacecraft]] could carry a mass driver as its primary engine.  With a suitable source of electrical power (probably a [[nuclear reactor]]) the spaceship could then use the mass driver to accelerate pieces of matter of almost any sort, boosting itself in the opposite direction.  At the smallest scale of reaction mass, this type of drive is called an [[ion drive]].

No absolute theoretical limit is known for the size, acceleration or muzzle energy of linear motors.  However, practical engineering constraints apply for such as the power-to-mass ratio, [[waste heat]] dissipation, and the energy intake able to be supplied and handled.  Exhaust velocity is best neither too low nor too high.&lt;ref name = neofuel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neofuel.com/optimum/|title=Physics of Rocket Systems with Separated Energy and Propellant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a mission-dependent limited optimal exhaust velocity and [[Specific Impulse#Rockets|specific impulse]] for any thruster constrained by a limited amount of onboard spacecraft power.  Thrust and momentum from exhaust, per unit mass expelled, scales up linearly with its velocity ([[momentum]] = mv), yet kinetic energy and energy input requirements scale up faster with velocity squared ([[kinetic energy]] = {{frac||1|2}} mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  Too low exhaust velocity would excessively increase propellant mass needed under the [[rocket equation]], with too high a fraction of energy going into accelerating propellant not used yet.  Higher exhaust velocity has both benefit and tradeoff, increasing propellant usage efficiency (more momentum per unit mass of propellant expelled) but decreasing thrust and the current rate of spacecraft acceleration if available input power is constant (less momentum per unit of energy given to propellant).&lt;ref name = neofuel/&gt;

[[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|Electric propulsion]] methods like mass drivers are systems where energy does not come from the propellant itself.  (Such contrasts to [[chemical rocket]]s where [[propulsive efficiency]] varies with the ratio of exhaust velocity to vehicle velocity at the time, but near maximum obtainable specific impulse tends to be a design goal when corresponding to the most energy released from reacting propellants).  Although the specific impulse of an electric thruster itself optionally could range up to where mass drivers merge into [[particle accelerator]]s with fractional-lightspeed exhaust velocity for tiny particles, trying to use extreme exhaust velocity to accelerate a far slower spacecraft could be suboptimally low thrust when the energy available from a spacecraft's reactor or power source is limited (a lesser analogue of feeding onboard power to a row of spotlights, photons being an example of an extremely low momentum to energy ratio).&lt;ref name = neofuel/&gt;

For instance, if limited onboard power fed to its engine was the dominant limitation on how much payload a hypothetical spacecraft could shuttle (such as if intrinsic propellant economic cost was minor from usage of extraterrestrial soil or ice), ideal exhaust velocity would rather be around 62.75% of total mission [[delta-v|delta v]] if operating at constant specific impulse, except greater optimization could come from [[Specific Impulse#Rockets|varying exhaust velocity]] during the mission profile (as possible with some thruster types, including mass drivers and [[VASIMR|variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rockets]]).&lt;ref name = neofuel/&gt;

Since a mass driver could use any type of mass for reaction mass to move the spacecraft, a mass driver or some variation seems ideal for deep-space vehicles that scavenge reaction mass from found resources.

One possible drawback of the mass driver is that it has the potential to send solid reaction mass travelling at dangerously high relative speeds into useful orbits and traffic lanes.  To overcome this problem, most schemes plan to throw finely-divided [[dust]]. Alternatively, liquid oxygen could be used as reaction mass, which upon release would boil down to its molecular state. Propelling the reaction mass to solar [[escape velocity]] is another way to ensure that it will not remain a hazard.

==Hybrid mass drivers==

A mass driver on a [[spacecraft]] could be used to "reflect" masses from a stationary mass driver. Each deceleration and acceleration of the mass contributes to the [[momentum]] of the spacecraft.  The lightweight, fast spacecraft need not carry [[reaction mass]], and does not need much electricity beyond the amount needed to replace losses in the electronics, while the immobile support facility can run off power plants able to be much larger than the spacecraft if needed.  This could be considered a form of [[beam-powered propulsion]] (a macroscopic-scale analogue of a [[particle beam]] propelled magsail).  A similar system could also deliver pellets of fuel to a spacecraft to power another propulsion system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/5770056-4HSXxH/5770056.pdf Interstellar Propulsion Using a Pellet Stream for Mass Transfer].

Another theoretical use for this concept of propulsion can be found in [[space fountain]]s, a system in which a continuous stream of pellets in a circular track holds up a tall structure.

==Mass drivers as weapons==

Small to moderate size high-acceleration electromagnetic projectile launchers are currently undergoing active research by the US Navy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/Media-Center/Fact-Sheets/Electromagnetic-Railgun.aspx|title=U.S. Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use as ground-based or ship-based weapons (most often [[railgun]]s but [[coilgun]]s in some cases). On larger scale than weapons currently near deployment but sometimes suggested in long-range future projections, a sufficiently high velocity [[linear motor]], a mass driver, could in theory be used as intercontinental artillery (or, if built on the [[Moon]] or in orbit, used to [[Space weapon#Orbital bombardment|attack a location on Earth's surface]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15669700 Applications of coilgun electromagnetic propulsion technology].

==Practical attempts==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Northrup Electric Gun.png|thumb|140px|Edwin Northrup's 1937 Electric Gun Mass Driver]] --&gt;

One of the first engineering descriptions of an "Electric Gun" appears in the technical supplement of the 1937 science fiction novel "Zero to Eighty" by "Akkad Pseudoman",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pseudoman|first=Akkad|title=Zero to Eighty|date=1937|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pen name for the Princeton physicist and electrical entrepreneur [[Edwin Fitch Northrup]].  Dr. Northrup built prototype coil guns powered by kHz-frequency three phase electrical generators, and the book contains photographs of some of these prototypes.  The book describes a fictional circumnavigation of the moon by a two-person vehicle launched by a Northrup electric gun.

Later prototype mass drivers have been built since 1976 ([[Mass Driver 1]]), some constructed by the U.S. [[Space Studies Institute]] in order to prove their properties and practicality.  [[Coilgun#Potential uses|Military R&amp;D on coilguns]] is related, as are [[maglev|maglev trains]].

A '''measuring cup''' or '''measuring jug''' is a [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensil]] used primarily to measure the [[volume]] of liquid or bulk solid [[cooking]] ingredients such as flour and sugar, especially for volumes from about 50&amp;nbsp;[[millilitre|mL]] (2&amp;nbsp;[[fluid ounce|fl&amp;nbsp;oz]]) upwards. Measuring cups are also used to measure washing powder, liquid detergents and bleach for clothes washing. The cup will usually have a scale marked in cups and fractions of a cup, and often with fluid measure and weight of a selection of dry foodstuffs. 

Measuring cups may be made of [[plastic]], [[glass]], or [[metal]]. Transparent (or translucent) cups can be read from an external scale; metal ones only from a [[dipstick]] or scale marked on the inside.

==Capacity and scale==
Measuring cups usually have capacities from 250&amp;nbsp;mL (approx. 1 [[cup (unit)|cup]]) to 1000&amp;nbsp;mL (approx. 4 cups = 2 pints = 1 quart), though larger sizes are also available for commercial use. They usually have [[Graduation (instrument)|scale markings]] at different heights: the substance being measured is added to the cup until it reaches the wanted level. Dry measure cups without a scale are sometimes used, in sets typically of 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 1 cup. The units may be milliliters or fractions of a liter, or the cup (unit) with its fractions (typically 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4), pints, and often fluid ounces.  Dry measure cups are distinguished from liquid measure cups in that they are meant to be filled to the top so that excess may be scraped off and shallow for easy cleaning.  Liquid measure cups tend to be microwave safe for heating and clear to more easily judge the [[meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krystal|first1=Becky|title=Yes, you really do need two types of measuring cups. Here’s why.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2018/02/16/yes-you-really-do-need-two-types-of-measuring-cups-heres-why/|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes multiples of teaspoons and tablespoons are included. There may also be scales for the approximate weight for particular substances, such as flour and sugar.

==For dry measure==
[[File:MeasuringCups2.JPG|thumb|right|A set of plastic measuring cups which usually include one full cup measure, half a cup and one third of a cup]]
Many dry ingredients, such as granulated sugar, are not very [[compressibility|compressible]], so volume measures are consistent.  Others, notably flour, are more variable. For example, 1 cup of all-purpose flour sifted into a cup and leveled weighs about 100 grams, whereas 1 cup of all-purpose flour scooped from its container and leveled weighs about 140 grams.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Child and Simone Beck, [[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]], vol. 2, p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a measuring cup to measure bulk foods which can be compressed to a variable degree such as chopped vegetables or shredded cheese leads to large measurement uncertainties. It is easier to chop down the units for a better measure.

Prof '''Nicholas Kemmer''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[FRSE]] (7 December 1911 – 21 October 1998), was a Russian-born [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[physicist]] working in Britain, who played an integral and leading edge role in United Kingdom's [[British nuclear weapons|nuclear programme]], and was known as a mentor of [[Abdus Salam]] – a [[Nobel laureate]] in physics.

== Life ==

===Early life===
He was the son of Nicholas P. Kemmer and his wife, Barbara Statzer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], his family moved to Germany in 1922, where he was educated at Bismarckschule [[Hanover]] and then at the [[University of Göttingen]]. He received his doctorate in nuclear physics at the [[University of Zurich]] and worked as an assistant to [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who had to give strong arguments in 1936, before being allowed to employ a non-Swiss national.&lt;ref&gt;Charles P. Enz, Beat Glaus, Gerhard Oberkofler (eds.): ''Wolfgang Pauli und sein Wirken an der ETH Zürich'', vdh Hochschulverlag ETHZ Zürich, 1997, {{ISBN|3-7281-2317-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_VRy1KU8ShEC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62] (in German language)&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Kemmer moved to the Beit Fellowship at [[Imperial College London]].

===British Nuclear development===
He moved to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1940 to work on [[Tube Alloys]], the wartime atomic energy project. In 1940, when [[Egon Bretscher]] and [[Norman Feather]] showed that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would in theory produce substantial amounts of [[Plutonium|plutonium-239]] as a by-product, Kemmer (who was lodging at the Bretschers') proposed the names [[Neptunium]] for the new element 93 and [[Plutonium]] for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans [[Edwin M. McMillan]] and [[Philip Abelson]] at the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]], who had made the same discovery, fortuitously suggested the same names.

===Professorship===
He spent 1944–1946 in Canada.  At the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1953 to 1979, he was Tait Professor of [[Mathematical Physics]], creating the Tait Institute of Mathematical Physics in 1955. He was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1954. His proposers were [[Norman Feather]], [[Max Born]], Sir [[Edmund Whittaker]] and [[Alexander Aitken]]. He served as the Society's Vice-President from 1971 to 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1956&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; and won its [[Hughes Medal]] in 1966. Kemmer was awarded the [[J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Winners, the blue ribbon encyclopedia of awards |last=Walter |first=Claire |year=1982 |page= 438|publisher=Facts on File Inc.|isbn=9780871963864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=J.

Kemmer is credited to trained and work with Salam in [[Neutron scattering]] by using relativity equations. Salam later passed his research work to Pakistani physics students who went on to contribute in this field.

== Work and legacy ==

=== Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation ===
The Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation (DKP equation, also called ''Duffin–Kemmer equation'' or ''Kemmer equation'') plays a role in the description of the [[standard model]] of particles, together with the [[Yang-Mills field]]. The Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation is closely linked to the [[Proca action|Proca equation]]&lt;ref name="Kruglov-P26"&gt;Sergey Kruglov: ''Symmetry and electromagnetic interaction of fields with multi-spin. A Volume in Contemporary Fundamental Physics'', {{ISBN|1-56072-880-9}}, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6Elkxs9PaIC&amp;pg=PA26 p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Klein–Gordon equation]].&lt;ref name="Capri-P25"&gt;Anton Z. Capri: ''Relativistic quantum mechanics and introduction to quantum field theory'', World Scientific, 2002, {{ISBN|981-238-136-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tTJHB5hepQUC&amp;pg=PA25 p. 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The DKP equation suffers the same drawback as the Klein–Gordon equation in that it calls for [[negative probability|negative probabilities]].&lt;ref name="Capri-P25"/&gt; The equation involves matrices which obey the [[Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau algebra]]. The work leading to the DKP equation, culminating in Kemmer's article,&lt;ref&gt;N. Kemmer: ''The particle aspect of meson theory'', Proceedings of the Royal Society A, 10. November 1939, vol.&amp;nbsp;173, no.&amp;nbsp;952, pp.&amp;nbsp;91–116, {{doi|10.1098/rspa.1939.0131}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been quoted as "the first attempt at writing down a satisfactory relativistic theory of elementary particles beyond the electron", and these equations have later been brought in unified form with the [[Dirac equation]] by [[Homi J. Bhabha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Animesh Datta]]: ''High-spin field theories and relativistic quantum mechanics of bosons'', In Emerson D.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to robotics:

'''[[Robotics]]''' is a  branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

The word "robot" was introduced to the public by Czech writer [[Karel Čapek]] in his play [[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]], published in 1920. The term "robotics" was coined by [[Isaac Asimov]] in his 1941 science fiction short-story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]"&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' the term "robotics" was first used in the short story "Liar!" published in the May, 1941 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Nature of robotics ==
Robotics can be described as:

* An [[applied science]] &amp;ndash; scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment.
** A branch of [[computer science]] &amp;ndash;
** A branch of [[electrical engineering]] &amp;ndash;
** A branch of [[mechanical engineering]] &amp;ndash;

* A branch of [[technology]]   &amp;ndash;

== Branches of robotics ==

* [[Adaptive control]] &amp;ndash; control method used by a controller which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain.

** [[Machine vision]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Robot kinematics|Kinematics]]  &amp;ndash; study of [[Motion (physics)|motion]], as applied to robots. This includes both the design of linkages to perform motion, their power, control and stability; also their planning, such as choosing a sequence of movements to achieve a broader task.
* [[Laboratory robotics]] &amp;ndash; the act of using robots in biology or chemistry labs
* [[Robot learning]] &amp;ndash; learning to perform tasks such as obstacle avoidance, control and various other motion-related tasks
* [[Direct manipulation interface]] &amp;ndash; In computer science, direct manipulation is a human–computer interaction style which involves continuous representation of objects of interest and rapid, reversible, and incremental actions and feedback.

[[File:Microstrip Hairpin Filter And Low Pass Stub Filter.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|[[Printed circuit]] planar transmission lines used to create [[filter (signal processing)|filters]] in a {{nowrap|20 GHz}} [[spectrum analyser]].  The structure on the left is called a [[hairpin filter]] and is an example of a [[band-pass filter]].

'''Planar transmission lines''' are [[transmission line]]s with [[electrical conductor|conductors]], or in some cases [[dielectric]] (insulating) strips, that are flat, ribbon-shaped lines.  They are used to interconnect components on [[printed circuit]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s working at [[microwave]] frequencies because the planar type fits in well with the manufacturing methods for these components.  Transmission lines are more than normal simple interconnections.  With normal interconnections the propagation of the [[electromagnetic wave]] along the wire is fast enough to be considered instantaneous, and the [[voltage]] at each end of the wire can be considered identical.  If the wire is longer than a large fraction of a [[wavelength]] (one tenth is often used as a rule of thumb) these assumptions are no longer true and [[Telegrapher's equations|transmission line theory]] must be used instead.  At lower frequencies, these considerations are only necessary for the cables connecting different pieces of equipment, but at microwave frequencies the distance at which transmission line theory becomes necessary is measured in millimetres.  Hence the need for transmission lines ''within'' a circuit.

There are several different types of planar transmission line.  The earliest type of planar transmission line was conceived during [[World War II]] by Robert M. Barrett.  It is known as [[stripline]], and is one of the four main types in modern use, along with [[microstrip]], [[suspended stripline]], and [[coplanar waveguide]]*.  All four of these types consist of a pair of conductors (although in three of them, the return conductor is through the [[ground plane]]).  Consequently, they have a dominant mode of transmission (the [[normal mode|mode]] is the [[field pattern]] of the [[electromagnetic wave]]) that is identical, or near-identical, to the mode found in a pair of wires.  Other planar types, such as slotline, finline, and imageline, transmit along a strip of dielectric, and [[substrate integrated waveguide]] forms a dielectric waveguide within the [[Substrate (electronics)|substrate]] with rows of posts.  These types cannot support the same mode as a pair of wires, and consequently they have different transmission properties.  Many of these types have a narrower [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and in general they produce more signal distortion than pairs of conductors.  Their advantages depend on the exact types being compared, but can include low loss and a better range of [[characteristic impedance]].

Planar transmission lines can be used for constructing components as well as  interconnecting them.  At microwave frequencies it is often the case that individual components in a circuit are themselves larger than a significant fraction of a wavelength.  This means they can no longer be treated as [[lumped element model|lumped components]], that is, treated as if they existed at a single point.  Lumped [[passive component]]s are often impractical at microwave frequencies for this reason, or because the values required are impractically small to manufacture.  A pattern of transmission lines can be used for the same function as these components.  Whole circuits, called [[distributed element circuit]]s, can be built this way.  The method is often used for [[distributed element filter|filter]]s.  This method is particularly appealing for use with printed and integrated circuits because these structures can be manufactured with the same processes as the rest of the assembly simply by applying patterns to the existing substrate.  This gives the planar technologies a big economic advantage over other types, such as [[coaxial cable]].

{{*}}&lt;small&gt;Some authors make a distinction between ''transmission line'', a line that uses a pair of conductors, and ''waveguide'', a line that either does not use conductors at all, or just uses one conductor to constrain the wave in the dielectric. Others use the terms synonymously.  This article includes both kinds, so long as they are in a planar form.  Names used are the common ones and do not necessarily indicate the number of conductors.  The term ''waveguide'' when used unadorned, means the hollow, or dielectric filled, metal kind of [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]].&lt;/small&gt;

== General properties ==
[[File:Stripline.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|An [[RF power amplifier]] incorporating planar circuit structures.  The amplifier on the left feeds its output into a set of [[distributed element filter|planar transmission line filters]] in the centre.  The third circuit block on the right is a circulator to protect the amplifier from accidental [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|reflections]] of the power back from the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]]]
Planar [[transmission line]]s are those transmission lines in which the conductors are essentially flat.  The conductors consist of flat strips, and there are usually one or more [[ground plane]]s parallel to the flat surface of the conductors.  Transmission lines can also be constructed in non-planar formats such as wires or [[coaxial cable]].  As well as interconnections, there are a wide range of circuits that can be implemented in transmission lines.  These include [[distributed element filter|filters]], [[power dividers and directional couplers|power dividers, directional couplers]], [[impedance matching]] networks, and [[Choke (electronics)|choke]] circuits to deliver [[biasing]] to active components.  The principal advantage of the planar types is that they can be manufactured using the same processes used to make [[printed circuit]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s, particularly through the [[photolithography]] process.  The planar technologies are thus particularly well suited to mass production of such components.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 9|Ishii, p. 1223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making circuit elements out of transmission lines is most useful at [[microwave]] frequencies.  At lower frequencies the longer [[wavelength]] makes these components too bulky.  At the higher microwave frequencies planar transmission line types are generally too [[Insertion loss|lossy]] and [[waveguide]] is used instead.  Waveguide, however, is more bulky and more expensive to manufacture.  At still higher frequencies [[dielectric waveguide]] (such as [[optical fibre]]) becomes the technology of choice.  However, there are planar types of dielectric waveguide.&lt;ref&gt;Yeh &amp; Shimabukuro, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;  The most widely used planar types are [[stripline]], [[microstrip]], [[suspended stripline]], and [[coplanar waveguide]].&lt;ref&gt;Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modes ==
[[File:Planar modes.svg|thumb|alt=diagrams|Field patterns for selected modes: A, quasi-TEM in microstrip,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 270, 279&lt;/ref&gt; B, quasi-TEM in CPW (even mode), slotline mode in CPW (odd mode)&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An important parameter for transmission lines is the [[normal mode|mode]] of transmission employed.  The mode describes the electromagnetic [[field pattern]]s caused by the geometry of the transmission structure.&lt;ref&gt;Flaviis, p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible for more than one mode to exist simultaneously on the same line.  Usually, steps are taken to suppress all modes except the operational one.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some devices, such as the [[dual-mode filter]], rely on the transmission of more than one mode.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, pp. 255–260&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TEM mode ===
The mode found on ordinary conductive wires and cables is the transverse electromagnetic mode ([[TEM mode]]).  This is also the dominant mode on some planar transmission lines.  In the TEM mode the [[field strength]] vectors for the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]] are both transverse to the direction of travel of the wave and [[orthogonal]] to each other.  An important property of the TEM mode is that it can be used at low frequencies; all the way down to zero ([[direct current|DC]]).&lt;ref name=TEM/&gt;

Another feature of the TEM mode is that on an ideal transmission line (one that meets the [[Heaviside condition]]) there is no change of line transmission parameters ([[characteristic impedance]] and signal [[group velocity]]) with the frequency of transmission.  Because of this, ideal TEM transmission lines do not suffer from a form of distortion called [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].  Dispersion is where different frequency components travel at different velocities resulting in the wave shape (which may represent the transmitted information) becoming "smeared out" in the direction of the line length.  All other modes suffer from dispersion which puts a limit on the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] achievable.&lt;ref name=TEM&gt;{{multiref|Oliner, p. 556|Maas, p. 16|Becherrawy, sect. 12.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quasi-TEM modes ===
Some planar types, notably microstrip, do not have a homogeneous dielectric; it is different above and below the line.  Such geometries cannot support a true TEM mode; there is some component of the [[electromagnetic field]] parallel to the direction of the line.  However, the transmission can be ''nearly'' TEM.  Such a mode is referred to as quasi-TEM.  Discontinuities placed on a TEM line, such as gaps and posts, which are used to construct filters and other devices, have an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] that is purely [[electrical reactance|reactive]].  That is, they can store energy, but do not dissipate it.  In most quasi-TEM lines, these structures additionally have a [[electrical resistance|resistive]] component to the impedance.  This resistance is a result of [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] from the structure and causes the circuit to be lossy.  The same problem occurs at bends and corners of the line.  These problems can be mitigated by using a high [[permittivity]] material as the [[Substrate (electronics)|substrate]].  This causes a higher proportion of the wave to be contained in the dielectric, making for a more homogeneous transmission medium and a mode closer to TEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Oliner, pp. 557–559|Das &amp; Das, pp. 58–59|Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transverse modes ===
{{main|Transverse mode}}
In hollow metal [[waveguide]]s and [[optical waveguide]]s there are an unlimited number of other [[transverse mode]]s that can occur. However, the TEM mode cannot be supported since it requires [[electrical conductor|conductors]] to propagate.  The transverse modes are classified as either ''transverse electric'' (TE) or ''transverse magnetic'' (TM) (also called respectively H and E modes) according to whether, respectively, all of the electric field, or all of the magnetic field is transverse.  There is always a longitudinal component of one field or the other.  The exact mode is identified by a pair of indices counting the number of wavelengths or half-wavelengths along specified transverse dimensions.  These indices are usually written without a separator, for instance TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.  The exact definition depends on whether the waveguide is rectangular, circular, or elliptical.  For [[microwave cavity|waveguide resonators]] a third index is introduced to the mode for wavelengths in the longitudinal direction.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp. 52–53, 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature of TE and TM modes is that there is a definite [[cutoff frequency]] below which transmission will not take place.  The cutoff frequency depends on mode and the mode with the lowest cutoff frequency is called the ''dominant mode''.  Multi-mode propagation is generally undesirable.  Because of this, circuits are often designed to operate in the dominant mode at frequencies below the cutoff of the next highest mode.  Only one mode, the dominant mode, can exist in this band.&lt;ref&gt;Flaviis, pp. 539–542&lt;/ref&gt;

Some planar types that are designed to operate as TEM devices can also support TE and TM modes unless steps are taken to suppress them.  The ground planes or shielding enclosures can behave as hollow waveguides and propagate these modes.  Suppression can take the form of shorting screws between the ground planes or designing the enclosure to be too small to support frequencies as low as the operational frequencies of the circuit.  This is similar to coaxial cable which can support circular TE and TM modes that do not require the centre conductor to propagate.  Likewise, these modes can be suppressed by reducing the diameter of the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Rao, p. 227|Sander &amp; Reed, p. 268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Longitudinal-section modes ===
Longitudinal-section electric (LSE) modes and longitudinal-section magnetic (LSM) modes are hybrid modes that can occur in planar types with non-homogeneous transmission media.  When determining whether a structure can support a particular TE mode, one sets the electric field in the {{mvar|z}} direction (the longitudinal direction of the line) to zero and then solves [[Maxwell's equations]] for the [[boundary condition]]s set by the physical structure of the line.  One can just as easily set the electric field in the {{mvar|x}} direction to zero and ask what modes that gives rise to.  Such modes are designated LSE&lt;sup&gt;{x}&lt;/sup&gt; modes.  Similarly there can be LSE&lt;sup&gt;{y}&lt;/sup&gt; modes and, analogously for the magnetic field, LSM&lt;sup&gt;{x}&lt;/sup&gt; and LSM&lt;sup&gt;{y}&lt;/sup&gt; modes.  It turns out that the LSE modes are a [[superposition principle|linear superposition]] of the corresponding TE and TM modes.  In other words, in general, they have a longitudinal component of both electric and magnetic field.  Likewise the LSM modes are found by setting one of the transverse components of magnetic field to zero with analogous results.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang &amp; Li, pp. 294–299&lt;/ref&gt;

When dealing with longitudinal-section modes, the TE and TM modes are sometimes written as LSE&lt;sup&gt;{z}&lt;/sup&gt; and LSM&lt;sup&gt;{z}&lt;/sup&gt; for a consistent set of notations.  The LSE and LSM modes are subsets of hybrid electromagnetic (HEM) modes.  There are some structures that are unable to support a pure TE or TM mode and consequently the transmission mode must necessarily be hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang &amp; Li, pp. 188, 294, 332&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other important parameters ==
The [[characteristic impedance]] of a line is the impedance encountered by a wave travelling along the line.  It depends only on the line geometry and materials and is not changed by the line termination.  It is necessary to [[impedance matching|match]] the characteristic impedance of the planar line to the [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of the systems to which it is connected.  Furthermore, many filter designs require lines with a number of different characteristic impedances.  Thus, it is an advantage for a technology to have a good range of achievable impedances.  Narrow lines have a higher impedance than broad lines.  The highest impedance achievable is limited by the resolution of the manufacturing process which imposes a limit on how narrow the lines can be made.  The lower limit is determined by the width of line at which unwanted transverse resonance modes might arise.&lt;ref name="EdSteer98"/&gt;

[[Q factor|''Q'' factor]] (or just ''Q'') is the ratio of energy stored to energy dissipated per cycle.  It is the main parameter characterising the quality of [[resonator]]s.  In transmission line circuits, resonators are frequently constructed of transmission line sections to build filters and other devices.  Their ''Q'' factor limits the steepness of the filter [[skirt (filtering)|skirts]] and its [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].  The main factors determining ''Q'' of a planar type are the permittivity of the dielectric (high permittivity increases ''Q'') and the [[dielectric loss]]es, which decrease ''Q''.  Other factors detracting from ''Q'' are the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the conductor and radiation losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Edwards &amp; Steer, p. 98|Heinen &amp; Klein, p. 823|Mazierska &amp; Jacob, p. 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{*}}&lt;small&gt; ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative permittivity]] of the substrate&lt;/small&gt;

== Substrates ==
There are a wide range of substrates that are used with planar technologies.  For printed circuits, glass-reinforced epoxy ([[FR-4]] grade) is commonly used.  High permittivity [[ceramic]]-[[PTFE]] laminates (e.g. [[Rogers Corporation]] 6010 board) are expressly intended for microwave applications.  At the higher microwave frequencies, a ceramic material such as [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina) might be used for hybrid [[microwave integrated circuit]]s (MICs).  At the very highest microwave frequencies, in the [[millimetre band]], a crystalline substrate might be used such as [[sapphire]] or [[quartz]].  [[Monolithic microwave integrated circuit]]s (MMICs) will have substrates composed of the [[semiconductor]] material of which the chip is built such as [[silicon]] or [[gallium arsenide]], or an oxide deposited on the chip such as [[silicon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Rogers &amp; Plett 162"/&gt;

The electrical properties of the substrate of most interest are the [[relative permittivity]] (ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) and the [[loss tangent]] ({{delta}}).   The relative permittivity determines the characteristic impedance of a given line width and the group velocity of signals travelling on it.  High permittivity results in smaller printed components, aiding miniaturisation.  In quasi-TEM types, permittivity determines how much of the field will be contained within the substrate and how much is in the air above it.  The loss tangent is a measure of the dielectric losses.  It is desirable to have this as small as possible, especially in circuits which require high ''Q''.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Rogers &amp; Plett, p. 162|Garg, p. 759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical properties of interest include the thickness and mechanical strength required of the substrate.  In some types, such as suspended stripline and finline, it is advantageous to make the substrate as thin as possible.  Delicate semiconductor components mounted on a flexing substrate can become damaged.  A hard, rigid material such as quartz might be chosen as the substrate to avoid this problem, rather than an easier-to-machine board.  In other types, such as homogeneous stripline, it can be much thicker.  For [[printed antenna]]e, that are [[conformal antenna|conformal to the device shape]], flexible, hence very thin, substrates are required.  Thickness required for electrical performance depends on the permittivity of the material.  Surface finish is an issue; some roughness may be required to ensure adhesion of the metallisation, but too much causes conductor losses.  Thermal properties can be important.  Thermal expansion changes the electrical properties of lines and can break [[plated through hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Edwards &amp; Steer, p. 98|Menzel, p. 81|Garg, p. 759|Osterman &amp; Pecht, p. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
=== Stripline ===
[[File:stripline structure.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|Stripline]]
{{main|Stripline}}
Stripline is a strip conductor embedded in a [[dielectric]] between two ground planes.  It is usually constructed as two sheets of dielectric clamped together with the stripline pattern on one side of one sheet.  The main advantage of stripline over its principal rival, microstrip, is that transmission is purely in the TEM mode and is free of dispersion, at least over the distances encountered in stripline applications.  Stripline is capable of supporting TE and TM modes but these are not generally used.  The main disadvantage is that it is not as easy as microstrip to incorporate [[discrete component]]s.  For any that are incorporated, cutouts have to be provided in the dielectric and they are not accessible once assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Oliner, pp. 557–559|Wanhammar, p. 138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Suspended stripline ====
[[File:Suspended stripline structure.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|Suspended stripline]]
{{main|Air stripline}}
Suspended stripline is a type of [[air stripline]] in which the substrate is suspended between the ground planes with an air gap above and below.  The idea is to minimise dielectric losses by having the wave travel through air.  The purpose of the dielectric is only for mechanical support of the conductor strip.  The mixed media of air and dielectric leads, in theory, to the transmission mode not being pure TEM.  However, a thin dielectric renders this effect negligible.  Suspended stripline is used in the mid microwave frequencies where it is superior to microstrip with respect to losses, but not as bulky or expensive as waveguide.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Maichen, pp. 87–88|Oliner, p. 558|Rosloniec, p. 253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other stripline variants ====
[[File:Stripline variants.svg|thumb|left|upright=2.0|alt=diagrams|Stripline variants: A, standard,&lt;ref name="Oliner 558 Bhat 4 Jarry20"&gt;{{multiref|Oliner, p. 558|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 4|Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; B, suspended,&lt;ref name="Bhat 5 Edwards 92"&gt;{{multiref|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 5|Edwards &amp; Steer p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; C, bilateral suspended,&lt;ref&gt;Oliner, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; D, two conductor&lt;ref name="Jarry &amp; Beneat 20"&gt;Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{clear}}
The idea of two conductor stripline is to compensate for air gaps between the two substrates.  Small air gaps are inevitable because of manufacturing tolerances and the thickness of the conductor.  These gaps can promote radiation away from the line between the ground planes.  Printing identical conductors on both boards ensures the fields are equal in both substrates and the electric field in the gaps due to the two lines cancels out.  Usually, one line is made slightly undersize to prevent small misalignments effectively widening the line, and consequently reducing the characteristic impedance.&lt;ref name="Maloratsky 10"/&gt;

The bilateral suspended stripline has more of the field in the air and almost none in the substrate leading to higher ''Q'', compared to standard suspended stripline.  The disadvantage of doing this is that the two lines have to be bonded together at intervals less than a quarter wavelength apart.  The bilateral structure can also be used to couple two independent lines across their broad side.  This gives much stronger [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] than side-by-side coupling and allows coupled-line filter and directional coupler circuits to be realised that are not possible in standard stripline.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Maloratsky, p. 24|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microstrip ===
[[File:Microstrip structure.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|Microstrip]]
{{main|Microstrip}}
Microstrip consists of a strip conductor on the top surface of a dielectric layer and a ground plane on the bottom surface of the dielectric.  The [[electromagnetic wave]] travels partly in the dielectric and partly in the air above the conductor resulting in quasi-TEM transmission.  Despite the drawbacks of the quasi-TEM mode, microstrip is often favoured for its easy compatibility with printed circuits.  In any case, these effects are not so severe in a miniaturised circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Das &amp; Das, pp. 58–59|Oliner, pp. 561–562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another drawback of microstrip is that it is more limited than other types in the range of characteristic impedances that it can achieve.  Some circuit designs require characteristic impedances of {{nowrap|150 Ω}} or more.  Microstrip is not usually capable of going that high so either those circuits are not available to the designer or a transition to another type has to be provided for the component requiring the high impedance.&lt;ref name="EdSteer98"/&gt;
[[File:Microstrip Inverted F antenna.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=diagram|Microstrip [[inverted-F antenna]]]]
The tendency of microstrip to radiate is generally a disadvantage to the type, but when it comes to creating [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]e it is a positive advantage.  It is very easy to make a [[patch antenna]] in microstrip, and a variant of the patch, the [[planar inverted-F antenna]], is the most widely used antenna in mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Yarman, p. 67|Oliner, p. 559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microstrip variants ====
[[File:Microstrip variants.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|left|alt=diagrams|Microstrip variants: A, standard,&lt;ref name="Oliner 558 Bhat 4 Jarry20"/&gt; B, suspended,&lt;ref name="Bhat 5 Jarry 20 Edwards 92"&gt;{{multiref|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 5|Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 20|Edwards &amp; Steer p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; C, inverted,&lt;ref name="Bhat 5 Jarry 20 Edwards 92"/&gt; D, in box,&lt;ref name="Jarry &amp; Beneat 20"/&gt; E, trapped inverted&lt;ref name="Edwards &amp; Steer 92"&gt;Edwards &amp; Steer p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{clear}}
Suspended microstrip has the same aim as suspended stripline; to put the field into air rather than the dielectric to reduce losses and dispersion.  The reduced permittivity results in larger printed components, which detracts from miniaturisation, but is easier to manufacture.  Suspending the substrate increases the maximum frequency at which the type can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Edwards &amp; Steer, p. 94|Kneppo ''et al.'', p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inverted microstrip has similar properties to suspended microstrip with the additional benefit that most of the field is contained in the air between the conductor and the groundplane.  There is very little stray field above the substrate available to link to other components.   Trapped inverted microstrip shields the line on three sides preventing some higher order modes that are possible with the more open structures.  Placing the line in a shielded box avoids completely any stray coupling but the substrate must now be cut to fit the box.  Fabricating a complete device on one large substrate is not possible using this structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 94–95|Maloratsky, pp. 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coplanar waveguide ===
[[File:Coplanar waveguide structure.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|Coplanar waveguide]]
{{main|Coplanar waveguide}}
Coplanar waveguide (CPW) has the return conductors on top of the substrate in the same plane as the main line, unlike stripline and microstrip where the return conductors are ground planes above or below the substrate.  The return conductors are placed either side of the main line and made wide enough that they can be considered to extend to infinity.  Like microstrip, CPW has quasi-TEM propagation.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

CPW is simpler to manufacture; there is only one plane of metallization and components can be [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounted]] whether they are connected in series or shunt (that is, in parallel across the line).  Shunt components in stripline and microstrip require a connection through to the bottom of the substrate.  CPW is also easier to miniaturise; its characteristic impedance depends on the ratio of the line width to the distance between return conductors rather than the absolute value of line width.&lt;ref name="Simons 1"&gt;Simons, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its advantages, CPW has not proved popular.  Its disadvantages include that return conductors take up a large amount of board area that cannot be used for mounting components.  However, it is possible in some designs to achieve a greater density of components than microstrip.  More seriously, there is a second mode in CPW that has zero frequency cutoff called the slotline mode.  Since this mode cannot be avoided by operating below it, and multiple modes are undesirable, it needs to be suppressed.  It is an odd mode, meaning that the [[electric potential]]s on the two return conductors are equal and opposite.  Thus, it can be suppressed by bonding the two return conductors together.  This can be achieved with a bottom ground plane (conductor backed coplanar waveguide, CBCPW) and periodic plated through holes, or periodic [[wikt:airbridge|air bridges]] on the top of the board.  Both these solutions detract from the basic simplicity of CPW.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coplanar variants ====
[[File:Coplanar variants.svg|thumb|left|upright=2.8|alt=diagrams|CPW variants: A, standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 5|Edwards &amp; Steer p. 92|Wolff, p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; B, CBCPW,&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; C, coplanar strips,&lt;ref name="Bhat 5 Edwards 92"/&gt; D, embedded coplanar strips&lt;ref name="Edwards &amp; Steer 92"/&gt;]]
{{clear}}
Coplanar strips (also ''coplanar stripline''&lt;ref&gt;Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; or ''differential line''&lt;ref name="Edwards &amp; Steer 92"/&gt;) are usually used only for RF applications below the microwave band.  The lack of a ground plane leads to a poorly defined field pattern and the losses from stray fields are too great at microwave frequencies.  On the other hand, the lack of ground planes means that the type is amenable to embedding in multi-layer structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Wolff, pp. 3–4|Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 433-435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slotline ===
[[File:Slotline structure.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|Slotline]]
A slotline is a slot cut in the metallisation on top of the substrate.  It is the dual of microstrip, a dielectric line surrounded by conductor instead of a conducting line surrounded by dielectric.&lt;ref&gt;Grebennikov, sect. 1.8.4&lt;/ref&gt;  The dominant propagation mode is hybrid, quasi-TE with a small longitudinal component of electric field.&lt;ref name="Sisodia 8 17 Russer 13"&gt;{{multiref|Sisodia &amp; Gupta, p. 8.17|Russer &amp; Biebl, p. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slotline is essentially a [[balanced line]], unlike stripline and microstrip, which are [[unbalanced line]]s.  This type makes it particularly easy to connect components to the line in shunt; surface mount components can be mounted bridging across the line.  Another advantage of slotline is that high impedance lines are easier to achieve.  Characteristic impedance increases with line width (compare microstrip where it decreases with width) so there is no issue with printing resolution for high impedance lines.&lt;ref name="Sisodia 8 17 Russer 13"/&gt;

On the disadvantages of slotline, both characteristic impedance and group velocity vary strongly with frequency, resulting in slotline being more dispersive than microstrip.  Slotline also has a relatively low ''Q''.&lt;ref&gt;Sisodia &amp; Gupta, p. 8.17&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Slotline variants ====
[[File:Slotline variants.svg|thumb|left|upright=2.3|alt=diagrams|Slotline variants: A, standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 20|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 4|Edwards &amp; Steer p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; B, antipodal,&lt;ref name="Jarry &amp; Beneat 20"/&gt; C, bilateral&lt;ref name="Jarry &amp; Beneat 20"/&gt;]]
{{clear}}
Antipodal slotline is used where very low characteristic impedances are required.  With dielectric lines, low impedance means narrow lines (the opposite of the case with conducting lines) and there is a limit to the thinness of line that can be achieved because of the printing resolution.  With the antipodal structure, the conductors can even overlap without any danger of short-circuiting.  Bilateral slotline has similar advantages to bilateral air stripline.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kouzaev ''et al.'', p. 169|Wallace &amp; Andreasson, p. 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Substrate integrated waveguide ===
[[File:SIW structure.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|Substrate integrated waveguide]]
{{main|Post-wall waveguide}}
Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW), also called ''laminated waveguide'' or ''post-wall waveguide'', is a waveguide formed in the substrate dielectric by constraining the wave between two rows of posts or plated through holes and ground planes above and below the substrate.  The dominant mode is a quasi-TE mode.  SIW is intended as a cheaper alternative to hollow metal waveguide while retaining many of its benefits.  The greatest benefit is that, as an effectively enclosed waveguide, it has considerably less radiation losses than microstrip.  There is no unwanted coupling of stray fields to other circuit components.  SIW also has high ''Q'' and high power handling.  Additionally, as a planar technology, SIW is easier to integrate with other components.&lt;ref&gt;Wu &amp; Kishk, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

SIW can be implemented on printed circuit boards or as [[low temperature co-fired ceramic]] (LTCC).  The latter is particularly suited to implementing SIW.  Active circuits are not directly implemented in SIW, the usual technique is to implement the active part in stripline through a stripline to SIW transition.  Antennae can be created directly in SIW by cutting slots in the ground planes.  A [[horn antenna]] can be made by flaring the rows of posts at the end of a waveguide.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Wu &amp; Kishk, pp. 1–2|Fang, p. 231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== SIW variants ====
There is a SIW version of [[ridge waveguide]].  Ridge waveguide is a rectangular hollow metal waveguide with an internal longitudinal wall part way across the E-plane.  The principal advantage of ridge waveguide is that it has a very wide bandwidth.  Ridge SIW is not very easy to implement in printed circuit boards because the equivalent of the ridge is a row of posts that only go partway through the board.  However, the structure can be created more easily in LTCC.&lt;ref&gt;Garg, Bahl, Bozzi, p. 538–539&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finline ===
[[File:Finline structure.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|Finline]]
Finline consists of a sheet of metallised dielectric inserted into the [[E-plane]] of a rectangular metal waveguide.  However, the design is not intended to generate waveguide modes in the rectangular waveguide as such.  Instead, a line is cut in the metallisation exposing the dielectric and it is this that acts as a transmission line.  Finline is thus a type of dielectric waveguide and can be viewed as a shielded slotline.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Helszajn, pp. 241–242|Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 12|Menzel, p. 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finline is similar to ridge waveguide in that the metallisation of the substrate represents the ridge (the "fin") and the finline represents the gap.  Filters can be constructed in ridge waveguide by varying the height of the ridge in a pattern.  A common way of manufacturing these is to take a thin sheet of metal with pieces cut out (typically, a series of rectangular holes) and insert this in the waveguide in much the same way as finline.  However, a [[finline filter]] is able to implement patterns of arbitrary complexity whereas the metal insert filter is limited by the need for mechanical support and integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Helszajn, p. 201|Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finline has been used at frequencies up to {{nowrap|220 GHz}} and experimentally tested to at least {{nowrap|700 GHz}}.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;  At these frequencies it has a considerable advantage over microstrip for its low loss and it can be manufactured with similar low cost printed circuit techniques.  It is also free of radiation due to being completely enclosed in the rectangular waveguide.  A metal insert device has even lower loss because it is air dielectric, but has very limited circuit complexity.  A full waveguide solution for a complex design retains the low loss of air dielectric, but it would be much more bulky than finline and significantly more expensive to manufacture.  A further advantage of finline is that it can achieve a particularly wide range of characteristic impedances.  [[Biasing]] of [[transistor]]s and [[diode]]s cannot be achieved in finline by feeding bias current down the main transmission line, as is done in stripline and microstrip, since the finline is not a conductor.  Separate arrangements have to be made for biasing in finline.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 94, 97|Srivastava &amp; Gupta, p. 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finline variants ====
[[File:Finline variants.svg|thumb|left|upright=3.5|alt=diagrams|Finline variants: A, standard (unilateral),&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 20|Edwards &amp; Steer p. 92|Helszajn, p. 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; B, bilateral,&lt;ref name="Jarry 20 Helszajn 242"&gt;{{multiref|Jarry &amp; Beneat, p. 20|Helszajn, p. 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; C, antipodal,&lt;ref name="Jarry 20 Helszajn 242"/&gt; D, strongly coupled antipodal&lt;ref name="Jarry &amp; Beneat 20"/&gt; E, insulated&lt;ref&gt;Helszajn, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{clear}}
Unilateral finline is the simplest design and easiest to manufacture but bilateral finline has lower loss for similar reasons to the advantages of bilateral suspended stripline.  The high ''Q'' of bilateral finline often makes it the choice for filter applications.  Antipodal finline is used where very low characteristic impedance is required.  The stronger the coupling between the two planes, the lower the impedance.  Insulated finline is used in circuits that contain active components needing bias lines.  However, the ''Q'' of insulated finline is lower than other finline types so it is otherwise not usually used.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Srivastava &amp; Gupta, p. 83|Molnar, p. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imageline ===
[[File:Imageline structure.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|Imageline]]
Imageline, also ''image line'' or ''image guide'', is a planar form of [[dielectric slab waveguide]].  It consists of a strip of dielectric, often alumina, on a metal sheet.  In this type, there is no dielectric substrate extending in all horizontal directions, only the dielectric line.  It is so called because the ground plane acts as a mirror resulting in a line that is equivalent to a dielectric slab without the ground plane of twice the height.  It shows promise for use at the higher microwave frequencies, around {{nowrap|100 GHz}}, but it is still largely experimental.  For instance ''Q'' factors in the thousands are theoretically possible but radiation from bends and losses in the dielectric-metal adhesive severely detract from this figure.  A disadvantage of imageline is that the characteristic impedance is fixed at a single value of about {{nowrap|26 Ω}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 92–93, 97|Teshirogi, p. 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imageline supports TE and TM modes.  The dominant TE and TM modes have a cutoff frequency of zero, unlike hollow metal waveguides whose TE and TM modes all have a finite frequency below which propagation cannot occur.  As the frequency approaches zero, the longitudinal component of field diminishes and the mode asymptotically approaches the TEM mode.  Imageline thus shares the property of being able to propagate waves at arbitrarily low frequencies with the TEM type lines, although it cannot actually support a TEM wave.  However, imageline is not a suitable technology at lower frequencies.  Imageline must be precisely machined as surface roughness increases radiation losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 92–93|Zhang &amp; Li, p. 338|Teshirogi, p. 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imageline variants and other dielectric lines ====
[[File:Dielectric line variants.svg|thumb|upright=3.0|left|alt=diagrams|Imageline variants: A, standard, B, insular, C, trapped; other dielectric lines: D, ribline, E, strip dielectric guide, F, inverted strip dielectric guide&lt;ref name="Teshirogi 32 33"&gt;Teshirogi, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{clear}}
In insular imageline a thin layer of low permittivity insulator is deposited over the metal ground plane and the higher permittivity imageline is set on top of this.  The insulating layer has the effect of reducing conductor losses.  This type also has lower radiation losses on straight sections, but like the standard imageline, radiation losses are high at bends and corners.  Trapped imageline overcomes this drawback, but is more complex to manufacture since it detracts from the simplicity of the planar structure.&lt;ref name="Teshirogi 32 33"/&gt;

Ribline is a dielectric line machined from the substrate as a single piece.  It has similar properties to insular imageline.  Like imageline, it must be precisely machined.  Strip dielectric guide is a low permittivity strip (usually plastic) placed on a high permittivity substrate such as alumina.  The field is largely contained in the substrate between the strip and the ground plane.  Because of this, this type does not have the precise machining requirements of standard imageline and ribline.  Inverted strip dielectric guide has lower conductor losses because the field in the substrate has been moved away from the conductor, but it has higher radiation losses.&lt;ref&gt;Teshirogi, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple layers ===
Multilayer circuits can be constructed in printed circuits or monolithic integrated circuits, but LTCC is the most amenable technology for implementing planar transmission lines as multilayers.  In a multilayer circuit at least some of the lines will be buried, completely enclosed by dielectric.  The losses will not, therefore, be as low as with a more open technology.  However, very compact circuits can be achieved with multilayer LTCC.&lt;ref&gt;Jarry &amp; Beneat, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transitions ==
[[File:Planar transitions.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=diagrams|Transitions: A, microstrip to SIW,&lt;ref name=GBB539&gt;Garg, Bahl &amp; Bozzi, p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; B, CPW to SIW,&lt;ref name=GBB539/&gt; C, microstrip to CPW, the dotted line marks the boundary of the microstrip groundplane,&lt;ref&gt;Paolo, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; D, CPW to slotline&lt;ref&gt;Chang &amp; Hsieh, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Different parts of a system may be best implemented in different types.  Transitions between the various types are therefore required.  Transitions between types using unbalanced conductive lines are straightforward enough: this is mostly just a matter of providing continuity of the conductor through the transition and ensuring a good impedance match.  The same can be said for transitions to non-planar types such as coaxial.  A transition between stripline and microstrip needs to ensure that both ground planes of the stripline are adequately electrically bonded to the microstrip ground plane.  One of these groundplanes can be continuous through the transition, but the other ends at the transition.  There is a similar issue with the microstrip to CPW transition shown at C in the diagram.  There is only one ground plane in each type but it changes from one side of the substrate to the other at the transition.  This can be avoided by printing the microstrip and CPW lines on opposite sides of the substrate.  In this case the ground plane is continuous on one side of the substrate but a [[Via (electronics)|via]] is required on the line at the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Schantz, pp. 142–144|Paolo, pp. 101–102, 356–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitions between conductive lines and dielectric lines or waveguides are more complex.  In these cases a change of mode is required.  Transitions of this sort consist of forming some kind of antenna in one type that acts as a launcher into the new type.  Examples of this are coplanar waveguide (CPW) or microstrip converted to slotline or substrate integrated waveguide (SIW).  For wireless devices, transitions to the external antennae are also required.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Schantz, p. 144|Wolff, pp. 229–230|Garg, Bahl &amp; Bozzi, p. 539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitions to and from finline can be treated in a similar way to slotline.  However, it is more natural for finline transitions to go to waveguide; the waveguide is already there.  A simple transition into waveguide consists of a smooth exponential taper ([[Vivaldi antenna]]) of the finline from a narrow line to the full height of the waveguide.  The earliest application of finline was to launch into circular waveguide.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Menzel, p. 78|Bhartia &amp; Pramanick, pp. 2–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transition from a balanced to an unbalanced line requires a [[balun]] circuit.  An example of this is CPW to slotline.  Example D in the diagram shows this kind of transition and features a balun consisting of a dielectric [[radial stub]].  The component shown thus [[file:Air bridge.svg|alt=inline symbol|upright=0.2]] in this circuit is an air bridge bonding the two CPW ground planes together.  All transitions have some [[insertion loss]] and add to the complexity of the design.  It is sometimes advantageous to design with a single integrated type for the whole device to minimise the number of transitions even when the compromise type is not optimal for each of the component circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Schantz, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The development of planar technologies was driven at first by the needs of the US military, but today it can be found in household mass-produced items such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[satellite TV]] receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Oliner, p. 557|Bhat &amp; Koul, pp. 2–3|Räisänen &amp; Lehto, pp. 201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Thomas H. Lee (engineering professor)|Thomas H. Lee]], [[Harold A. Wheeler]] may have experimented with coplanar lines as early as the 1930s.  However, the first documented planar transmission line was stripline, invented by Robert M. Barrett and published by Barrett and Barnes in 1951.  Although publication did not occur until the 1950s, stripline had actually been used during [[World War II]].  According to Barrett, the first stripline power divider was built by V. H. Rumsey and H. W. Jamieson during this period.  Microstrip followed soon after in 1952 due to Grieg and Englemann.  However, the quality of common dielectric materials was at first not good enough for microwave circuits and consequently their use did not become widespread until the 1960s.  Stripline and microstrip were commercial rivals.  ''Stripline'' was the brand name of Airborne Instruments Laboratory Inc. (AIL) who made air stripline.  Microstrip was made by [[ITT Corporation|ITT]].  Later, dielectric filled stripline under the brand name ''triplate'' was manufactured by [[Sanders Associates]].  ''Stripline'' became a generic term for dielectric filled stripline and ''air stripline'' or ''suspended stripline'' is now used to distinguish the original type.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 3|Oliner, pp. 556–559|Lee, p. 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stripline was initially preferred to its rival because of the dispersion issue.  However, in the 1960s, the need to incorporate miniature solid-state components in MICs swung the balance to microstrip.  Miniaturisation also leads to favouring microstrip because its disadvantages are not so severe in a miniaturised circuit.  However, stripline is still chosen where operation over a wide band is required.&lt;ref&gt;Oliner, pp. 558–562&lt;/ref&gt;  The first planar slab dielectric line, imageline, is due to King in 1952.  Slotline, the first printed planar dielectric line type, is due to Cohn in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Coplanar waveguide is due to Wen in 1969.&lt;ref name="Simons 1"/&gt;  Finline, as a printed technology, is due to Meier in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava &amp; Gupta, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Robertson created finline-like structures much earlier (1955–56) with metal inserts.  Robertson fabricated circuits for [[diplexer]]s and couplers and coined the term ''finline''.&lt;ref&gt;Menzel, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, components made in planar types were made as discrete parts connected together, usually with coaxial lines and connectors.  However, it was quickly realised that the size of circuits could be hugely reduced by directly connecting components together with planar lines within the same housing.  This led to the concept of [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid]] MICs: ''hybrid'' because [[lumped element model|lumped]] components were included in the designs connected together with planar lines.  From the 1970s, there has been a great proliferation in new variations of the basic planar types to aid miniaturisation and mass production.  Further miniaturisation became possible with the introduction of MMICs.  In this technology, the planar transmission lines are directly incorporated in the semiconductor slab in which the [[integrated circuit]] components have been manufactured.  The first MMIC, an [[X band]] amplifier, is due to Pengelly and Turner of [[Plessey]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Oliner, pp. 562–563|Pfeiffer, pp. 27–28|Bhat &amp; Koul, pp. 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Planar circuit gallery.svg|thumb|upright=1.9|alt=diagrams|Planar circuits]]
A small selection of the many circuits that can be constructed with planar transmission lines are shown in the figure.  Such circuits are a class of [[distributed element circuit]]s.  Microstrip and slotline types of directional couplers are shown at A and B respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Blank &amp; Buntschuh, pp. 213–225&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, a circuit form in conducting lines like stripline or microstrip has a [[dual impedance|dual form]] in dielectric line such as slotline or finline with the roles of the conductor and insulator reversed.  The line widths of the two types are [[multiplicative inverse|inversely related]]; narrow conducting lines result in high impedance, but in dielectric lines the result is low impedance.  Another example of dual circuits is the [[bandpass filter]] consisting of coupled lines shown at C in conductor form and at D in dielectric form.&lt;ref&gt;Garg, Bahl &amp; Bozzi, pp. 296–298, 331–332&lt;/ref&gt;

Each section of line acts as a [[resonator]] in the coupled lines filters.  Another kind of resonator is shown in the SIW bandpass filter at E.  Here posts placed in the centre of the waveguide act as resonators.&lt;ref&gt;Wu &amp; Kishk, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  Item F is a slotline [[rat-race coupler|hybrid ring]] featuring a mixture of both CPW and slotline feeds into its [[port (circuit theory)|ports]].  The microstrip version of this circuit requires one section of the ring to be three-quarters wavelength long.  However, in the slotline/CPW version all sections are one-quarter wavelength because there is a 180° [[phase inversion]] at the slotline junction.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace &amp; Andreasson, pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4615">[[File:potato-ricer.jpg|right|thumb|Collage showing a potato ricer from four angles.]]A '''potato ricer''' (also called a '''ricer''') is a [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen implement]] used to process potatoes or other food by forcing it through a sheet of small holes, which are typically about the diameter of a grain of [[rice]].&lt;ref name=grimes&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimes|first=William (ed.)|title=Eating Your Words|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0195174062|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A common variety of potato ricer resembles a large [[garlic press]].  It has two long handles, one with a perforated basket at the end, the other with a flat surface that fits into the basket.  The food is placed in the basket, then the flat surface is pushed down into the basket by pressing the handles together, forcing the food through the holes.&lt;ref name=cooksinfo&gt;Potato Ricer. CooksInfo.com. Published 02/18/2007. Updated 05/27/2009. Web. Retrieved 11/29/2012 from http://www.cooksinfo.com/potato-ricer&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form, sometimes called a rotary ricer, is cone-shaped with small perforations all around the cone.  It comes with a wooden pestle that is used to push the food through the holes.&lt;ref name=rodale&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerras|first=Charles (ed.)|title=Rodale's Basic Natural Foods Cookbook|year=1989|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0671673386|edition=1st Fireside|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[food mill]] can be used as a substitute for a ricer.&lt;ref name=cooksinfo /&gt;

==Uses==
This tool is commonly used to rice potatoes, a process that forces cooked potatoes through the ricer and turns the potatoes into fine, thin shreds. The resulting potatoes are lighter and fluffier.  The process allows the full starch cells of high-starch potatoes to maintain their integrity and stay separate, giving the potatoes a fluffy, full texture.  At this point, milk, butter, and other additives can easily be blended to maintain the starch structure, the result being consistent mashed potatoes.  The process works since uniform texture is created due to the passing of potatoes through evenly sized holes, which ensures that the potatoes are smashed only once. With this method, the cell walls are much less likely to break open.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~roseh/recipes/Other/cooks/docID=778.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~roseh/recipes/starches.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressing cooked vegetables and fruits through the small holes produces a [[puree]] comparable to using a [[drum sieve]]. Many foods can now be pureed more easily in a [[food processor]]; however, a manual method such as ricing is best for potatoes, which are starchy and become glutinous when over-processed.&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=James|title=Essentials of Cooking|year=2003|publisher=Artisan|location=New York|isbn=1579652360|pages=94, 279|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ricers are often used to puree food for babies.&lt;ref name=sears&gt;{{cite book|last=Sears|first=Robert W.|title=HappyBaby: the Organic Guide to Baby's First 24 Months|year=2009|publisher=Harper|location=New York|isbn=9780061711367|edition=1st|author2=Marlow, Amy|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ricer can be used to remove excess water from foods such as cooked greens that are to be added to quiche,&lt;ref name=cooksinfo /&gt; thawed frozen spinach, and sliced or grated potatoes to improve the quality of [[potato chip]]s or [[hash brown]]s made from them.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Potters and ceramicists use ricers to extrude "hair" for human heads or animal sculptures such as sheep.

==Criticism==
Potato ricers are seen by some to be too bulky, and an unnecessary kitchen utensil. Many opponents of potato ricers will point out that mashing potatoes does a similar job.{{who?|date=October 2018}}

'''Professional Engineers Day''' was launched by the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] in 2016 to celebrate and raise public awareness of the contributions of [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|licensed professional engineers]] in the United States. As of 2015, there were 474,777 licensed professional engineers in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCEES Squared|url=http://ncees.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NCEES-Squared_web.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Professional Engineers Day was celebrated on August 3, 2016.

== History ==
The idea for Professional Engineers Day came from Tim Austin, PE, a professional engineer from Kansas who served as president of the National Society of Professional Engineers in 2015-16. While promotion of engineering in the US is common, such as the attention given to [[STEM fields]] and events such as the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]] and [[National Engineers Week (U.S.)]], which was also founded by NSPE in 1951, Austin believed attention should be paid specifically to the contributions of licensed professional engineers because of NSPE's core principle which states, "Being a licensed professional engineer means more than just holding a certificate and possessing technical competence.  It is a commitment to hold the public health, safety, and welfare above all other considerations."{{cite web|title=NSPE's Statement of Principles|url=https://www.nspe.org/membership/nspe-who-we-are-what-we-do/nspes-statement-principles}}

[[Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering|Licensing of professional engineers]] in the US began in 1907, when Clarence Johnston, the state engineer of Wyoming, presented a bill to the Wyoming legislature that would require registration for those representing themselves to the public as an engineer or land surveyor. The bill was later enacted, making the state the first in the US to register engineers and land surveyors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of NCEES|url=http://ncees.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/The-History-of-NCEES-full.pdf|publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 1907, Charles Bellamy of Wyoming received the first professional engineering license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Godat Bellamy, Wyoming's First Woman Legislator {{!}} WyoHistory.org|url=http://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/mary-godat-bellamy|website=www.wyohistory.org|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional Engineers Day is held the first Wednesday in August to mark that occasion. Incidentally, Bellamy’s wife, [[Mary Bellamy|Mary Godot Bellamy]], is also known for a first: the first woman elected to the Wyoming legislature.

Charles Bellamy founded Bellamy &amp; Sons Engineers in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor of Practice, Dr. William D. Bellamy|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/ceas/news/2013/130924/index.html|website=www.uwyo.edu|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.uwyo.edu/wyspe/index1.html Bellamy Chapter of the Wyoming Society of Professional Engineers] is named in his honor.

Today, for the purpose of protecting the public, all US states and territories license professional engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCEES member licensing boards|url=http://ncees.org/licensing-boards/|publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To mark the inaugural Professional Engineers Day in 2016, governors from Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Wisconsin signed proclamations recognizing the contributions licensed professional engineers make to their states and society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14927">'''Renewable Natural Gas (RNG)''', also known as '''Sustainable Natural Gas (SNG)''' or '''biomethane''', is a [[biogas]] which has been upgraded to a quality similar to [[fossil fuel|fossil]] [[natural gas]] and having a methane concentration of 90% or greater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al Mamun|first=Muhammad Rashed|last2=Torii|first2=Shuichi|date=2017|title=Enhancement of Methane Concentration by Removing Contaminants from Biogas Mixtures Using Combined Method of Absorption and Adsorption|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijce/2017/7906859/|journal=International Journal of Chemical Engineering|language=en|volume=2017|pages=1–9|doi=10.1155/2017/7906859|issn=1687-806X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A biogas is a gaseous form of [[methane]] obtained from [[biomass]]. By upgrading the quality to that of natural gas, it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing [[Pipeline transport|gas grid]] within existing appliances. Renewable natural gas is a subset of synthetic natural gas or [[substitute natural gas]] (SNG).

Renewable natural gas can be produced and distributed via the existing gas grid, making it an attractive means of supplying existing premises with [[renewable heat]] and renewable gas energy, while requiring no extra capital outlay of the customer. Renewable natural gas can be converted into [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) for direct use as fuel in transport sector. LNG pricing compete with gasoline or diesel as it can replace these fuels in the transport sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gastechnology.org/Training/Documents/LNG17-proceedings/Transport-13-Jim-Harger-Presentation.pdf The On-Road LNG Transportation Market in the US]&lt;/ref&gt;

The existing gas network allows distribution of gas energy over vast distances at a minimal cost in energy. Existing networks would allow biogas to be sourced from remote markets that are rich in low-cost biomass (Russia or Scandinavia for example).

The UK National Grid believes that at least 15% of all gas consumed could be made from matter such as sewage, food waste such as food thrown away by supermarkets and restaurants and organic waste created by businesses such as breweries.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/22/food-waste-green-biogas-tariff 'Food waste to provide green gas for carbon-conscious consumers']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, analysis conducted in 2011 by the Gas Technology Institute determined that renewable gas from waste biomass including agricultural waste has the potential to add up to 2.5 quadrillion Btu annually, being enough to meet the natural gas needs of 50% of American homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Gas Can Come From Renewable Sources|url=https://www.socalgas.com/smart-energy/benefits-of-natural-gas/renewable|website=www.socalgas.com|publisher=Sempre Energy|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minter|first1=George|title=SoCalGas’s Minter on Renewable Natural Gas as a Foundational Fuel|url=https://www.planningreport.com/2017/10/25/socalgas-minter-renewable-natural-gas-foundational-fuel|website=www.planningreport.com|publisher=David Abel|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In combination with [[power-to-gas]], whereby the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide fraction of biogas are converted to methane using electrolyzed [[hydrogen]], the renewable gas potential of raw biogas is approximately doubled. Many ways of methanising carbon dioxide/monoxide and hydrogen exist, including [[biomethanation]], the [[sabatier]] process and a new electrochemical process pioneered in the United States currently undergoing trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SoCalGas and Opus 12 Successfully Demonstrate Technology That Simplifies Conversion of Carbon Dioxide into Storable Renewable Energy|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/socalgas-and-opus-12-successfully-demonstrate-technology-that-simplifies-conversion-of-carbon-dioxide-into-storable-renewable-energy-300633313.html|website=prnewswire.com|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing ==
A biomass to SNG efficiency of 70% can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Cornerstone environmental group, LLC [http://www.mrec.org/MREC2009/09%20MREC%20Torresani%20Pipeline%20BioGas.pdf 'Biomethane / Natural Gas Interconnection Opportunities']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kachan &amp; Co. [http://www.kachan.com/research/bng-bio-natural-gas-report 'The Bio Natural Gas Opportunity']&lt;/ref&gt; Costs are minimised by maximising production scale and by locating an anaerobic digestion plant next to transport links (e.g. a port or river) for the chosen source of biomass. The existing gas storage infrastructure would allow the plant to continue to manufacture gas at the full utilisation rate even during periods of weak demand, helping minimise manufacturing capital costs per unit of gas produced.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands [http://www.ecn.nl/docs/library/report/2005/rx05187.pdf 'Heat from Biomass via Synthetic Natural Gas']&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable gas can be produced through three main processes
* anaerobic digestion of organic (normally moist) material
* thermal [[gasification]] of organic (normally dry) material
* production through the [[Sabatier reaction]]. In these cases, the gas from primary production has to be upgraded in a secondary step to produce gas that is suitable for injection into the gas grid.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Gas Technology Centre [http://www.dgc.dk/publikationer/konference/jkj_sustain_gas.pdf 'Sustainable Gas Enters the European Gas Distribution System']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial Development ==

===BioSNG===
Göteborg Energi opened the first demonstration plant for large scale production of bio-SNG through gasification of forest residues in [[Gothenburg|Gothenburg, Sweden]] within the [[GoBiGas]] project. The plant had the capacity to produce 20 megawatts-worth of bioSNG from about 30 MW-worth of biomass, aiming at a conversion efficiency of 65%. From December 2014 the bioSNG plant was fully operational and supplied gas to the Swedish natural gas grid, reaching the quality demands with a methane content of over 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GoBiGas|url = https://gobigas.goteborgenergi.se/English_version/About_GoBiGas|website = www.gobigas.goteborgenergi.se|accessdate = 2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was permanently closed due to economic problems in April 2018. Göteborg Energi had invested 175 million euro in the plant and intensive attempts for a year to sell the plant to new investors had failed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Investerade nästan två miljarder i Gobigas – nu läggs projektet ner|url = https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vast/investerade-nastan-tva-miljarder-i-biogasanlaggning-nu-laggs-projektet-ner|website = www.svt.se|accessdate = 2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It can be noted that the plant was a technical success, and performed as intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor: "The Gobigas Project A Technical Success"|url=https://www.di.se/hallbart-naringsliv/biogasflopp-i-goteborg-ger-miljardsmall-for-skattebetalarna/|website=https://www.di.se|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, natural gas is currently at a very low price given market conditions globally. It is expected the plant is to re-emerge around 2030 when economic conditions may be more favourable, with the possibility of a higher carbon price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LUNDIN|first1=KIM|title=Biogasflow in Gothenburg provides the taxpayer with an environmental standard|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vast/gobigas-projektet-en-succe|website=https://www.svt.se|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNG is of particular interest in countries with extensive natural gas distribution networks. Core advantages of SNG include compatibility with existing natural gas infrastructure, higher efficiency that Fisher-Tropsch fuels production and smaller-production scale than other second generation biofuel production systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Åhman |first=Max |title=Biomethane in the transport sector—An appraisal of the forgotten option |journal=Energy Policy |year=2010 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=208–217 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2009.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands has conducted extensive research on large-scale SNG production from woody biomass, based on the importation of feedstocks from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biosng.com/synthetic-natural-gas/ |title=BioSNG: Synthetic Natural Gas |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable natural gas plants based on wood can be categorised into two main categories, one being allothermal, which has the energy provided by a source outside of the gasifier. One example is the double-chambered fluidised bed gasifiers consisting of a separate combustion and gasification chambers. Autothermal systems generate the heat within the gasifier, but require the use of pure oxygen to avoid nitrogen dilution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van der Meijden |first=C.M. |title=Development of the MILENA gasification technology for the  production of Bio-SNG |year=2010 |publisher=ECN |location=Petten, Netherlands |url=http://www.ecn.nl/docs/library/report/2010/b10016.pdf |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, [[NNFCC]] found that any UK bioSNG plant built by 2020 would be highly likely to use ‘clean woody feedstocks' and that there are several regions with good availability of that source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/potential-for-biosng-production-in-the-uk-nnfcc-10-008 'Potential for BioSNG Production in the UK, NNFCC 10-008']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Energy Focus [http://www.newenergyfocus.com/do/ecco/view_item?listid=1&amp;listcatid=32&amp;listitemid=4152 'BioSNG could be economically attractive for renewable heat']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upgraded biogas===
In the UK, using [[anaerobic digestion]] is growing as a means of producing renewable [[biogas]], with nearly 90 biomethane injection sites built across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AD map - biomethane plants |url=http://adbioresources.org/map |website=ADBA |publisher=The Anaerobic Digestion &amp; Bioresources Association |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecotricity announced plans to supply green gas to UK consumers via the national grid.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/22/food-waste-green-biogas-tariff 'Food waste to provide green gas for carbon-conscious consumers']&lt;/ref&gt; Centrica also announced that it would begin injecting gas, manufactured from sewage, into the gas grid.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/05/human-waste-turned-renewable-gas 'Human waste turned into renewable gas to power homes']&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, FortisBC, a gas provider in British Columbia, injects renewably created natural gas into its existing gas distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;Kachan &amp; Co.[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/5/prweb8377459.htm 'New Bio Natural Gas May Assist In Adding Solar and Wind to Utility Renewable Power Generation, Study Finds']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sustainable synthetic natural gas====
Sustainable SNG is produced by high temperature oxygen blown slagging co-gasification at 70 to 75 bar pressure of biomass or waste residue. The advantage of a wide range of feedstocks is that much larger quantities of renewable SNG can be produced compared with biogas, with fewer supply chain limitations. A wide range of fuels with an overall biogenic carbon content of 50 to 55% is technically and financially viable. Hydrogen is added to the fuel mix during the gasification process, and carbon dioxide is removed by capture from the purge gas 'slip stream' syngas clean-up and catalytic methanation stages.

Large scale sustainable SNG will enable the UK gas and electricity grids to be substantially de-carbonised in parallel at source, while maintaining the existing operational and economic relationship between the gas and electricity grids. Carbon capture and sequestration can be added at little additional cost, thereby progressively achieving deeper de-carbonisation of the existing gas and electricity grids at low cost and operational risk. Cost benefit studies indicate that large scale 50% biogenic carbon content sustainable SNG can be injected into the high pressure gas transmission grid at a cost of around 65p/therm. At this cost, it is possible to re-process fossil natural gas, used as an energy input into the gasification process, into 5 to 10 times greater quantity of sustainable SNG. Large scale sustainable SNG, combined with continuing natural gas production from UK continental shelf and unconventional gas, will potentially enable the cost of UK peak electricity to be de-coupled from international oil denominated 'take or pay' gas supply contracts.

Applications:

* Electricity generation
* Space heating
* Process heating
* [[Biomass with carbon capture and storage]]
* Transportation fuel

==Environment==
In contrast to being renewable, biogas creates similar [[air pollution|environmental pollutants]] as ordinary natural gas fuel, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen sulfide and particulates. Any unburned gas that escapes contains methane, a long lived greenhouse gas. The key difference from ordinary natural gas is that it is often considered partly or fully [[Carbon neutrality|carbon neutral]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} the carbon dioxide contained in the biomass is naturally renewed in each generation of plants, rather than being released from fossil stores and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.

'''Revere Ware''' is a line of consumer and commercial kitchen wares introduced in 1939 by the [[Revere Brass &amp; Copper Corp.]] Focusing primarily on consumer cookware such as (but not limited to) skillets, sauce pans, stock pots, and tea kettles. Initially Revere Ware was the culmination of various innovative techniques developed during the 30's, the most popular being construction of Stainless Steel with rivetlessly attached bakelite handles, copper clad bases and rounded interiors for ease of cleaning. Over the next 40+ years, Revere Ware would introduce new series to position itself in competition with other manufacturers at various price points, or for specific specialty markets.&lt;ref name="History of Revere Copper and Brass"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revereware.org/info/id8.html |publisher=[[Revereware.org]] |title=History of Revere Copper and Brass |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 60's the profitability of Revere Ware began to level off. Coinciding with new series introductions, cost cutting measures were implemented in the manufacture of the traditional cookware. The bakelite handles were changed from two piece to one, and the thickness of utensil walls and copper cladding were reduced.&lt;ref name="The Evolution of Revere Ware (1932–1949)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reverewarehistory.wordpress.com/2012/03/25/revere-ware-history/ |publisher=[[reverewarehistory.wordpress.com]] |title=The Evolution of Revere Ware (1932–1949) |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the cookware division remained profitable, the seventies saw parent company Revere Brass &amp; Copper Corp. experience a shift of fortune. Transferring of its aluminum production from domestic to overseas manufacturing marked the beginning of the end.&lt;ref name="Expansion in the 1960s and 1970s"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/revere-ware-corporation-history//2012/03/25/revere-ware-history/ |publisher=[[fundinguniversity.com]] |title=Expansion in the 1960s and 1970s |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982 financial issues due to these failing aluminum operations forced Revere Brass &amp;  Copper to enter solvency. By 1985 the cookware subsidiary Revere Ware Incorporated, which had remained profitable, had been sold to [[Corning Inc. | Corning Glass Inc.]]. Within ten years Corning Glass inc. had expanded Revere Ware from the four lines at their acquisition, to over dozen lines, while ceasing any domestic manufacturing. In 1998 [[World Kitchen]] became the controlling parent company of Corning. During this period Revere Ware suffered from branding incoherency, with nearly a dozen new "Lines" introduced by 2006 before briefly leaving the market. Revere Ware has since been reintroduced, as World Kitchen currently (as of 2016) offers select variations; Copper-cored Stainless Steel, traditional copper-clad bottomed cookware and anodized non-stick aluminum.&lt;ref name="Reorganization in the 1980s"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/revere-ware-corporation-history//2012/03/25/revere-ware-history/ |publisher=[[fundinguniversity.com]] |title=Reorganization in the 1980s |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lines and series produced by Revere Ware==

===Pre-Corning-developed cookware (1939–1986)===

Revere Ware has introduced several lines since its inception. The main series has always been the 1400 line, featuring the classic curved, smooth knurled bakelite handles, stainless steel walls and copper bottoms. The Patriot Ware series functioned as Revere Wares economy line, briefly being marketed directly by mail order through J.C. Penney, with an exclusive ''Made Expressly for Penney's by Revere'' trademark. Copper Maid was another economy series introduced in 1957. In 1959, in response to leveling sales, the Designers' Group series was introduced, intended to reestablish Revere Ware as the premiere consumer cookware. The series would be sold until 1973, having some cross over with the Designer's Group products introduced in 1969. While historians and aficionados cite the 6000 Line Designers' Group pieces as the finest cookware manufactured by Revere Ware, the 6500 Line Designer's Group was a confusing addition that sold poorly.&lt;ref name="A Photographic History Of Revere Ware Lines"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revereware.org/info/id10.html

Other lines introduced to expand the Revere Ware brand were the heavy duty Institutional line, substituting Stainless Steel handles for the bakelites. A selection of this series was reintroduced as Patio Ware in 1956, attempting to cash in on the barbecue craze of 50's. The larger, more rugged handles of the 1800 line were marketed as made specifically for men's larger hands. Various aluminum products were also introduced, such as the Galaxy line. The Galaxy line featured Stainless Steel construction with a bonded aluminum lining. The 500 line was a series of miniature 1400 series cookware, marketed as toys for children, but manufactured to the same standards as all their consumer cookware. The mini sets, which were available through 1983, have become quite collectible.

Prior to the sale of Revere Ware to Corning Glass inc in 1985, the brand offered or had in development four series. The traditional 1400 series continued to sell well. The newly developed 2000 line, for use on the then-new 80's technology of Ceramic and Glass top stoves, featured heavy aluminum bottoms for good heat transfer. Both the ONXY line and the Micro-Fryer line were released after the sale, but were discontinued almost immediately as they were perceived as being in direct competition with existing products from subsidiaries of Corning.

===Post-Corning Glass Inc. acquisition cookware===

The first series developed and introduced after the Corning Glass inc acquisition was the Proline, a heavy gauge Stainless Steel product that would go through many arbitrary, minor changes during its run. Minor changes would happen frequently across all their lines, undermining consumer confidence. The Vista series was a reintroduction of the 1400 series, again with minor changes and now sold with glass lids taken from other Corning product lines. The Spectrum series featured aluminum non-stick pans with colored enamel bodies, and were imported from Thailand. only four years after the Vista Line hit store shelves, the Centura series was yet another reintroduction of the traditional 1400 line. The Centura series sold with less expensive materials, being made overseas, and were offered exclusively from Wal-Mart. Most other series introduced were contemporaries of other lines from Corning subsidiaries.

In 1998 Revere Ware, along with all of the divisions of Corning Consumer Products, were reorganized under the World Kitchen inc banner. While a handful of unique lines emerged after this restructure, it was three lines in particular that were significant as reintroductions, despite being produced overseas, and using less expensive materials. These series were the Tri-Ply Stainless series, based on the 7000 Stainless Revere Line introduced in 1974, the Copper Select series based on the Paul Revere Ware line of 1967, and finally the Copper Clad series of 2003, which was yet another reintroduction of the 1400 line.&lt;ref name="The End of Revere Ware as we Knew it"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revereware.org/info/id10.html

==1400 line==

The 1400 line is manufactured with all of Revere Wares defining features. Copper-clad bases, rounded corners for ease of cleaning, bakelite handles, and Vapor Seal lids. Early pans and skillets featured two piece handles, held together by rivets and screws. The earliest style of bakelite handles feature two screws, just a little more than an inch apart, near the pan side of the handle. Later, a screw was located at either end of the handle. By 1968, in a cost cutting measure, the bakelite was made from one piece and pressed onto the attached metal handle.

When identifying various utensils, know that skillets are always of a larger diameter, with a shallow depth and a single long handle. Sauce pans will have a relative depth, and also a single long handle. Stock Pots are generally four quarts or larger, and have two smaller handles for grasping at each side. Dutch Ovens are similarly constructed, but feature a flared edge at the top of the pot with a narrow seat for their larger, more pronouncedly domed lid to seal. &lt;u&gt;''The domed lids used for Dutch Ovens (and square Skillets) are distinctly different in shape than that of the traditional bell-lipped Stainless Steel lids. The walls of these Domed lids are noticeably taller than standard utensil lids.''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ref name="Terminology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revereware.org/info/id8.html
|publisher=[[Revereware.org]] |title=Terminology |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revere Ware double boilers and steamers come in three variations. The first (marked (1) below) is an insert, which nestles into the pan, supported by a lip and two small "ears", or flairs at the mouth of the insert. This variety remains almost entirely within the heating utensil while in use. The second (marked (2) below)is a ribbed design with a single handle, similar to a Sauce Pan in construction. Only a small portion of the Steamer/Double Boiler rests within the Heating utensil, to create a seal, while the remainder protrudes. The last variety (marked (3) below) is also ribbed, but features two small handles (much like stock pots) on either side, to facilitate ease of use.

Being the longest running &amp; cornerstone line of wares produced by Revere Ware, the 1400 series is an iconic part of American kitchens. At the height of 1400's popularity, nearly 5 and a half million pieces were shipping a year. It was the "Gold Standard" of American cookware, at its peak offering 39 items simultaneously (counting lids as separate pieces) across 12 distinct utensil types. While specialty items and minor revisions were occasionally made to the line, the 1400 series existed with a relative consistency before the sale to Corning Glass inc. in '85. The most iconic pieces are listed below.

'''Notes on Specialty items:''' The 1 qt. Combination Pan can be identified by its straight walled construction, opposed to a Skillet's flared walls, and will be stamped "1 qt." on post-1968 pieces.

Egg Poaching inserts and removable cups (1515 and 1520), either four or six, are placed into correspondingly sized Skillets. The poaching cup handles are designed with an exclusive "lock on" handle, and accept most any household fork for lifting.

Omelette Skillets have a specially designed domed shape, with nearly transparent transitions from pan-base to walls. This surface facilitates the ease of omelette preparing. As the primary purpose of the pan is omelettes, it is not intended for use with a lid.

==Proper measuring of Revere Ware utensils and lids==

'''How to properly measure Revere Ware diameters''': &lt;u&gt;''Pot and pan diameters''&lt;/u&gt; are measured from the interior of the walls. Measurements taken from the exterior of the walls often include the extra material of the rolled lip, giving the illusion of an additional quarter inch of width. As an example, re-sellers and collectors of vintage Revere Ware may measure a utensil as being 9.25" or 9 1/4", when in fact the pot should properly be measured 9". Skillets may also be improperly measured, as the cooking surface is slightly smaller than the marked or measured size. The marked skillet dimensions refer to interior circumference at the top most part of the flared walls, as the pans are designed to use a lid that coincides with this diameter. &lt;u&gt;''Lid Diameters''&lt;/u&gt; can also lend to confusion, as the correct Stainless Steel lids of vintage (pre-Corning) Revere Ware have belled lips. These belled lips facilitate the oft-advertised ''Vapor Seal'', a method of locking in moisture, which some believe retain nutrients. Re-sellers and collectors, when measuring the inner circumference of the bell flange, often measure the lids an eighth to a quarter of an inch narrower than proper size, or conversely, measure the outside of the bell flair, adding an additional 1/4" to 3/8" of an inch of diameter. A good rule of thumb is knowing all lids and utensils are designed to be measured at whole-inch increments, with the exception of 5.5" sauce pans and lids.

==Identifying early-era pieces==

Revere Ware is considered a highly collectible brand of cookware, much like certain cast iron cookware brands. Like all collectibles, some pieces have become more desirable than others. There have been many different lines and subtle changes incurred since 1939, yet most utensils retain a particularly universal look. Because of this, it can be tricky to identify specific years of pieces, especially within the 1400 line. Thankfully, there are easy ways to identify the most desirable periods.

===Pre-1968 trademarking===

Featuring far thicker copper cladding and steel walls, items produced prior to 1968 are the pieces most collectors seek. Most are identifiable by a "Double Ring" Trademark. The earliest Revere Ware products, produced in '''1939''', may have a Trademark that includes the name Riding Revere, as initially Revere Ware had not decided on the branding of their new product. Despite securing a patent for their Copper Cladding process in '''1942''', pieces from '''1939–1946''' featured a ''Pat. Pend.'' stamp underneath the logo. From '''1946–1968''' pieces feature the most prominent Trademark logo, the large double ring containing the Revere head outline, Copper Clad – Stainless Steel and Revere Ware. Below are the words ''Made under Process Patent''.  Production initially all took place in Rome, NY, but starting in 1949 expanded to California and then Illinois. Items made at these plants included additions to the Trademark; ''Riverside, CA'' or ''Clinton, IL''. Pieces made in Rome, NY are identified by not including a place of manufacture, prior to 1974.&lt;ref name="All Old Revere Ware is not Vintage Revere"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revereware.org/info/id7.html
 |publisher=[[Revereware.org]] |title=All Old Revere Ware is not "Vintage" Revere |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1968 trademarking===

Starting in 1968, the trademarking on the bottom of Revere Ware Utensils became simplified. Gone was the distinct "Double Ring" marking, and any mention of patent processes. This coincided with the decision to reduce the thickness of both the Copper Cladding, and the stainless steel walls of their products. While reducing the material used for manufacture proved a resourceful way to cut costs, it has been recognized as noticeably lowering quality and durability. Still, Revere Ware remained in demand, and pieces from the 1968–86 era continue to be popular entry items for collectors. The new, simplified trademark featured the familiar Revere silhouette, flanked by 1801, the year of the companies origin. Below this, in stark lettering, was printed ''REVERE WARE'', with an identifying marker for the size of the utensil (a new feature) and the location of manufacture.

A '''safety lamp''' is any of several types of [[Light fixture|lamp]] that provides illumination in [[coal mine]]s and is designed to operate in air that may contain [[coal dust]] or gases both of which are potentially flammable or explosive.  Until the development of effective electric lamps in the early 1900s miners used flame lamps to provide illumination.  Open flame lamps could ignite flammable gases which collected in mines, causing explosions and so safety lamps were developed to enclose the flame and prevent it from igniting the surrounding atmosphere.  Flame safety lamps have been replaced in mining with sealed explosion-proof electric lights.

==Background==

===Damps or gases===

Miners have traditionally referred to the various gases encountered during mining as [[Damp (mining)|damp]]s, from the [[Middle Low German]] word ''dampf'' (meaning "[[vapour]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Damps are variable mixtures and are historic terms.

* ''[[Firedamp]]'' - Naturally occurring flammable mixtures, principally methane.
* ''[[Blackdamp]]'' or ''Chokedamp'' - Nitrogen and carbon dioxide with no oxygen.  Formed by complete combustion of firedamp or occurring naturally.  Coal in contact with air will oxidize slowly and, if unused workings are not ventilated, pockets of blackdamp may develop.  Also referred to as ''azotic air'' in some 19th-century papers.
* ''[[Whitedamp]]'' - Formed by the incomplete combustion of coal, or firedamp.  The mixture may contain significant amounts of carbon monoxide, which is toxic and potentially explosive.
* ''[[Stinkdamp]]'' - Naturally occurring [[hydrogen sulphide]] and other gases.  The hydrogen sulphide is highly toxic, but easily detected by smell.  The other gases with it may be firedamp or blackdamp.
* ''[[Afterdamp]]'' - The gas from an explosion of firedamp or coal dust.  Contains varying proportions of blackdamp and whitedamp and is therefore suffocating, toxic, or explosive, or any combination of these.  Afterdamp may also contain stinkdamp.  Afterdamp may be a bigger killer following an explosion than the explosion itself.

===Open flame illumination===

Before the invention of safety lamps, miners used candles with open flames. This gave rise to [[Mining accident|frequent explosions]]. For example, at one colliery (Killingworth) in the north east of England, 10 miners were killed in 1806, 12 in 1809. In 1812, 90 men and boys were suffocated or burnt to death in the [[Felling mine disaster|Felling Pit near Gateshead]] and 22 in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smiles|1862|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvnb|Wood|1853}} describes the testing of a mine for firedamp.  A candle is prepared by being trimmed and excess fat removed.  It is held at arm's length at floor level in one hand, the other hand shielding out all except the tip of the flame.  As the candle is raised the tip is observed and if unchanged the atmosphere is safe.  If however the tip turns bluish-gray increasing in height to a thin extended point becoming a deeper blue, then firedamp is present.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon detecting firedamp the candle is lowered and arrangements made for the ventilating of the area or the deliberate firing of the firedamp after the end of a shift.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A man, known as a fireman (US/Canada), penitent or monk (both from the protective garb) edged forward with a candle on the end of a stick.  He kept his head down to allow the explosion to pass over him, but as soon as the explosion had occurred stood upright as much as possible to avoid the afterdamp.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;  As can be imagined this procedure did not always preserve the life of the man so employed.

When they came into regular use, [[barometer]]s were used to tell if [[atmospheric pressure]] was low which could lead to more firedamp seeping out of the coal seams into the mine galleries.  Even after the introduction of safety lamps this was still essential information, see [[Trimdon Grange]] for details of an accident where pressure was involved.

The lack of good lighting was a major cause of the eye affliction [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]].  Miners working in thin seams or when undercutting the coal had to lie on their side in cramped conditions.  The pick was swung horizontally to a point beyond the top of their head.  In order to see where they were aiming (and accurate blows were needed), the eyes needed to be straining in what would normally be the upwards and slightly to one side direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1916|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This straining led first to temporary nystagmus and then to a permanent disability.  Mild nystagmus would self-correct if a miner ceased to perform this work but if left untreated would force a man to give up mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1916|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lower levels of light associated with safety lamps caused an increase in the incidence of nystagmus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1916|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First attempts at safe lamps===
[[File:Stahlmuehle erstes schlagwettersicheres Geleucht anagoria.JPG|thumb|Spedding mill at the German mining museum, Bochum, Northrhine-Westfalia, Germany]]Both on the continent of Europe and in the UK dried fish skins were used.  From them a faint [[bioluminescence]] (often called phosphorescence) occurs.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smiles|1862|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another safe source of illumination in mines was bottles containing fireflies.&lt;ref name="Fordyce1973"&gt;{{harvnb|Fordyce|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flint and steel mills introduced by Carlisle Spedding (1696-1755) before 1733{{sfn|Lowther|1733}} had been tried with limited success.&lt;ref name="welshminers" /&gt; An example of a Spedding steel mill may be seen in the museum at [[Whitehaven]] where Spedding was manager of the collieries of [[Sir James Lowther, 4th Baronet]].&lt;ref name="Lakeland Mining Heritage" &gt;{{harvnb|Calvin|2000|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; A steel disk was rotated at high speed by a crank mechanism. Pressing a [[flint]] against the disk produced a shower of sparks and dim illumination.&lt;ref name="Lakeland Mining Heritage" /&gt; These mills were troublesome to use and were often worked by a boy, whose only task was to provide light for a group of miners.  It was assumed that the sparks had insufficient energy to ignite firedamp until a series of explosions at [[Wallsend]] colliery in 1784; a further explosion in June 1785 which the operator of the mill (John Selkirk) survived showed that ignition was possible.{{sfn|Sykes|1835|pp=32–33}}

The first safety lamp made by [[William Reid Clanny]] used a pair of bellows to pump air through water to a candle burning in a metal case with a glass window.  Exhaust gases passed out through water.  The lamp gave out only a weak light though it was intrinsically safe provided it was kept upright.  It was heavy and ungainly and required a man to pump it continuously.  It was not a practical success and Clanny subsequently changed the basis of operation of later lamps in the light of the Davy and Stephenson lamps.&lt;ref name="welshminers" /&gt;

==Oil lamps==

===Principles of operation===
Safety lamps have to address the following issues:
* Provide adequate light
* Do not trigger explosions
* Warn of a dangerous atmosphere

Fire requires three elements to burn: fuel, oxidant and heat; the [[Fire triangle|triangle of fire]]. Remove one element of this triangle and the burning will stop. A safety lamp has to ensure that the triangle of fire is maintained inside the lamp, but cannot pass to the outside.

* '''Fuel''' - this is the easiest part of the triangle to consider, there is fuel in the form of oil inside the lamp and fuel in the form of firedamp or coal dust outside.
* '''Oxidant''' - there is an oxidant in the form of air present outside the lamp.  The design of the lamp must allow the oxidant to pass into the lamp (and therefore exhaust gases to escape) or else the lamp will extinguish.
* '''Heat''' - heat can be carried by the exhaust gases, through conduction and through burning of firedamp drawn into the lamp passing back down the inlet.  Control of the transfer of heat is the key to manufacturing a successful safety lamp.

In the [[Geordie lamp]] the inlet and exhausts are kept separate.  Restrictions in the inlet ensure that only just enough air for combustion passes through the lamp.  A tall chimney contains the spent gases above the flame.  If the percentage of firedamp starts to rise, less oxygen is available in the air and combustion is diminished or extinguished.  Early Geordie lamps had a simple pierced copper cap over the chimney to further restrict the flow and to ensure that the vital spent gas did not escape too quickly.  Later designs used gauze for the same purpose and also as a barrier in itself.  The inlet is through a number of fine tubes (early) or through a gallery (later).  In the case of the gallery system air passes through a number of small holes into the gallery and through gauze to the lamp.  The tubes both restrict the flow and ensure that any back flow is cooled.  The flame front travels more slowly in narrow tubes (a key Stephenson observation) and allows the tubes to effectively stop such a flow.

In the Davy system a gauze surrounds the flame and extends for a distance above forming a cage.  All except the very earliest Davy lamps have a double layer at the top of the cage.  Rising hot gases are cooled by the gauze, the metal conducting the heat away and being itself cooled by the incoming air.  There is no restriction on the air entering the lamp and so if firedamp is entrained it will burn within the lamp itself.  Indeed, the lamp burns brighter in dangerous atmospheres thus acting as a warning to miners of rising firedamp levels.  The Clanny configuration uses a short glass section around the flame with a gauze cylinder above it.  Air is drawn in and descends just inside the glass, passing up through the flame in the centre of the lamp.

The outer casings of lamps have been made of brass or tinned steel.  If a lamp bangs against a hard piece of rock a spark could be generated if iron or untinned steel were employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trianco Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and development===

Within months of Clanny's demonstration of his first lamp, two improved designs had been announced: one by [[George Stephenson]], which later became the [[Geordie lamp]], and the [[Davy lamp]], invented by [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]]. Subsequently, Clanny incorporated aspects of both lamps and produced the ancestor of all modern oil safety lamps.

George Stephenson came from a mining family and by 1804 had secured the post of brakesman at Killingworth colliery.  He was present at both the 1806 and 1809 explosions in the pit. By 1810, he was engineman and responsible for machinery both above and below ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smiles|1862|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pit was a gassy pit and Stephenson took the lead in work to extinguish a fire in 1814.  For some years prior to 1815 he had been experimenting on the ''blowers'' or fissures from which gas erupted.  He reasoned that a lamp in a chimney could create a sufficient updraft that firedamp would not penetrate down the chimney.  Further observations of the speed of flame fronts in fissures and passageways led him to design a lamp with fine tubes admitting the air.

Sir Humphry Davy was asked to consider the problems of a safety lamp following the Felling explosion.  Previous experimenters had used coal gas (chiefly carbon monoxide) incorrectly, believing it to be the same as firedamp. Davy however performed his experiments with samples of firedamp collected from pits. As an experimental chemist, he was familiar with flames not passing through gauze; his experiments enabled him to determine the correct size and fineness for a miner's lamp.

Davy was awarded the [[Rumford Medal]] and  £1,000 by the [[Royal Society]] in 1816 and a £2,000 prize by the country's colliery owners,&lt;ref name=Davies22 /&gt; who also awarded 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s (£105) to Stephenson. However, the Newcastle committee also awarded Stephenson a £1,000 prize collected by subscription.&lt;ref name=Davies26 /&gt; Dr. Clanny was awarded a medal by the Royal Society of Arts in 1816.&lt;ref name="welshminers" /&gt;

Both the Davy and Stephenson lamps were fragile. The gauze in the Davy lamp rusted in the damp air of a coal pit and became unsafe, while the glass in the Stephenson lamp was easily broken, and allowed the flame to ignite firedamp in the mine. Later Stephenson designs also incorporated a gauze screen as a protection against glass breakage.&lt;ref name=dmmRainton/&gt;  Developments, including the Gray, Mueseler and Marsaut lamps, tried to overcome these problems by using multiple gauze cylinders, but glass remained a problem until [[toughened glass]] became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Geopedia.fr|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Were the flame to go out in a lamp, then there was a temptation for the collier to relight it. Some opened the lamps to light tobacco pipes underground.&lt;ref name=Improper&gt;{{harvnb|A Looker On|1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these practices were strictly forbidden; they clearly negated the whole point of the safety lamp. The miner was expected to return to the shaft to perform relighting, a round trip of up to a few miles.  For men on piece work, this meant a loss of income (perhaps 10% of their day's pay) and so was unpopular.  From the mid-century onwards, and particularly after the 1872 act, lamps had to have a lock mechanism which prevented the miner opening the lamp.  Two schemes existed; either a special tool was required which kept at the pit head or else opening the lamp extinguished the flame. The latter mechanism can be seen in the Mueseler, Landau and Yates lamps below.  Such a lamp was known as a ''protector'' lamp, a term picked up and used as a company name.{{sfn|Johnson|2014}}  Only on the return to the bank could the lamp man open the lamp for refilling and service. Various different locking mechanisms were developed; miners tended to be ingenious in finding ways of circumventing them.  A number of additional lamps were supposed to accompany each gang of men, but restricting the number was an obvious economy for the pit owners.

The light given out by these lamps was poor (particularly the Davy where it passed through the gauze); indeed, in early lamps worse than candles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1916|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem not solved until the introduction of electric lighting around 1900 and the introduction of battery-powered helmet lamps in 1930. The poor light provided yet another reason for miners to try to circumvent the locks.

Early lamps (the Davy, Geordie and Clanny) had the gauze exposed to air currents. It was quickly discovered that an air current could cause the flame to pass through the gauze. The flame playing directly on the gauze heats it faster than the heat can be conducted away, eventually igniting the gas outside the lamp.&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1879|loc=article: Safety lamps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table is compiled from {{harvnb|Hunt|1879|loc=article: Safety lamps}}:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Lamp !! Air velocity to cause flame to pass the gauze (ft/s) !! Time to explosion (s) !! Number of lamps to equal 1 standard candle !! Hours to burn 2 oz of oil

|-
| Clanny || 9 || 45 || 2.68 || 16.5
|-

|}

Following accidents such as Wallsend (1818), [[Trimdon Grange]] (1882) and the [[Bedford Colliery Disaster]] (1886), lamps had to be shielded against such currents. In the case of the Davy, a "Tin-can Davy" was developed which had a metal cylinder with perforations at the bottom and a glass window for the light from the gauze.  Clanny derived lamps had a metal shield (typically tinned iron) in the shape of a truncated cone, called a bonnet covering the gauze above the glass cylinder.&lt;ref name=LuptonSh&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Shielded Lamps}}&lt;/ref&gt; The important principle is that no direct current of air can impinge on the gauze. The shield had the disadvantage of not allowing the collier or the deputy to check that the gauze was in place and clean.  Lamps were therefore made so that they could be inspected and then the bonnet placed on and locked.

===Examples of lamps===

====Davy lamp====
[[File:Davy lamp.png|thumb|right|A Davy lamp]]
In the [[Davy lamp]] a standard oil lamp is surrounded by fine wire gauze, the top being closed by a double layer of gauze.

If firedamp is drawn into the flame it will burn more brightly and if the proportions are correct may even detonate.  The flame on reaching the gauze fails to pass through and so the mine atmosphere is not ignited.  However, if the flame is allowed to play on the gauze for a significant period, then it will heat up, sometimes as far as red heat.  At this point it is effective, but in a dangerous state.  Any further increase in temperature to white heat will ignite the external atmosphere.  A sudden draught will case a localised hot spot and the flame will pass through.  At a draught of between 4 and 6 feet per second the lamp becomes unsafe.&lt;ref name=LuptonDa&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Davy Lamps}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Wallsend in 1818 lamps were burning red hot (indicating significant firedamp).  A boy (Thomas Elliott) was employed to carry hot lamps to the fresh air and bring cool lamps back.  For some reason he stumbled; the gauze was damaged and the damaged lamp triggered the explosion.{{sfn|Sykes|1835|pp=33–34}}  At Trimdon Grange (1882) a roof fall caused a sudden blast of air and the flame passed through the gauze with fatal results (69 killed).&lt;ref name=Snagge/&gt;

Poor copies and ill-advised "improvements" were known, but changing dimensions either reduced the illumination or the safety.&lt;ref name=LuptonDa/&gt;  The poor light compared to either the Geordie or Clanny eventually led to the Davy being regarded as ''not a lamp but a scientific instrument for detecting the presence of firedamp''.&lt;ref name=welshminers/&gt;  Some pits continued to use candles for illumination, relying on the Davy to warn men when to extinguish them.

====Stephenson ("Geordie") lamp====
[[File:Stephenson-safety-lamp.jpg|thumb|Early form of Stephenson lamp shown with a Davy lamp on the left]]
In the earlier Geordie lamps an oil lamp is surrounded by glass.  The top of the glass has a perforated copper cap with a gauze screen above that.  The glass is surrounded by a perforated metal tube to protect it.

Later versions had an annular chamber around the base of the lamp into which air entered through small ({{frac|20}}") holes and from which air passed through gauze into the lamp.  The glass was surrounded by gauze so that in the event of a glass breakage the Geordie became a Davy.

If the current of air forced in through the tubes (later holes and gallery) by the lamp's situation was too strong, the flame grew, and the lamp could get red-hot.&lt;ref name=LuptonSt&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Stephenson Lamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lamp becomes unsafe in a current of from 8 to 12 feet per second, about twice the limit of the Davy's safe operating conditions.&lt;ref name=LuptonSt/&gt; However, this variation in the flame was not entirely bad. The intensity of the flame, air currents being equal, gives an indication of firedamp levels, so it is both a source of light and a sensor.

====Purdy lamp====
A development of the Geordie lamp was the Purdy.  A galley with gauze provided the inlet, above the glass was a chimney with perforated copper cap and gauze outer.  A brass tube protected the upper works, shielded them and kept them locked in position.  A sprung pin locked the whole together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Purdy|1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pin could only be released by applying a vacuum to a captive hollow screw; not something that a nicotine starved miner could do at the coal face.

====Improved Clanny lamp====
Clanny abandoned his pumps and candles and developed a safety lamp which combined features of both the Davy and Geordie.  The oil lamp was surrounded by a glass chimney with no ventilation from below.  Above the chimney is a gauze cylinder with a double top.  Air enters from the side and spent gases exit from the top.  In the presence of firedamp the flame intensifies.  The flame must be kept fairly high in normal use, a small flame permits the enclosed space to fill with firedamp/air mixture and the subsequent detonation may pass through the gauze.&lt;ref name=LuptonC&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Clanny Lamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A larger flame will keep the upper part full of burnt gas.  The Clanny gives more light than the Davy and can be carried more easily in a draught.  Lupton notes however ''it is superior in no other respect'', particularly as a test instrument.&lt;ref name=LuptonC/&gt;

The glass on a Clanny was secured by a large diameter brass ring which could be hard to tighten securely.  If a splinter occurred at the end of a crack, or indeed any other unevenness, then the seal might be compromised.  Such an incident occurred at Nicholson Pit in 1856 on a lamp being used by an overman to test for firedamp.  The mines inspector recommended that only Stephenson lamps were used for illumination and Davys for testing.  In particular "overmen ... whose lamps are mostly used to detect the presence gas{{sic}}, should avoid such [Clanny] lamps".&lt;ref name=dmmRainton/&gt;

====Mueseler lamp====
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b53 225-0.jpg|thumb|left|Mueseler lamp (on the left) and a derivative of the Geordie]]
The lamp is a modified Clanny designed by the Belgian Mathieu-Louis Mueseler.  The flame is surrounded by a glass tube surmounted by a gauze capped cylinder.  Air enters from the side above the glass and flows down to the flame before rising to exit at the top of the lamp.  So far this is just a Clanny, but in the Mueseler a metal chimney supported on an internal gauze shelf conducts the combustion products to the top of the lamp.&lt;ref name=LuptonMu&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Mueseler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Mueseler lamps were fitted with a mechanism which locked the base of the lamp.  Turning down the wick eventually released the base, but by then the flame was extinguished and therefore safe.&lt;ref name=NEIMMEmu&gt;{{harvnb|NEIMME|lamps|loc=page:Mueseler.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lamp was patented in 1840 and in 1864 the Belgian government made this type of lamp compulsory.&lt;ref name=NEIMMEmu/&gt;

In the presence of firedamp the explosive mixture is drawn through two gauzes (cylinder and shelf), burnt and then within the chimney are only burnt gases, not explosive mixture.  Like a Clanny, and the Davy before it, it acts as an indicator of firedamp, burning more brightly in its presence.  Later models had graduated shields by which the deputy could determine the concentration of firedamp from the heightening of the flame.  Whilst the Clanny will continue to burn if laid on its side, potentially cracking the glass; the Mueseler will extinguish itself due to the stoppage of convection currents.  The lamp is safe in currents up to 15 feet per second.&lt;ref name=LuptonMu/&gt;

====Marsaut lamp====
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b53 224-0.jpg|thumb|Marsaut lamp (on the right) showing a triple gauze variant]]
The Marsaut lamp is a Clanny with multiple gauzes.  Two or three gauzes are fitted inside each other which improves the safety in a draught.  Multiple gauzes will however interfere with the flow of air.  The Marsaut was one of the first lamps to be fitted with a shield, in the illustration (right) the bonnet can be seen surrounding the gauzes.&lt;ref name=LuptonMa&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Marsaut}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A shielded Marsaut lamp can resist a current of 30 feet per second.&lt;ref name="LuptonSh"/&gt;

====Bainbridge lamp====
The Bainbridge is a development of the Stephenson.  A tapered glass cylinder surrounds the flame, and above that the body is a brass tube.  The top of the tube is closed by a horizontal gauze attached to the body of the lamp by small bars to conduct heat away.  Air enters through a series of small holes drilled in the lower brass ring supporting the glass.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

====Landau's lamp====
[[File:Landau's safety lamp.jpeg|thumb|left|Miner's safety lamp designed by Landau prior to 1878.  Published in Dr Ure's Dictionary supplement of 1879]]
The lamp is in part a development of the Geordie.  Air enters into a ring near the base which is protected by gauze or perforated plate.  The air passes down the side of the lamp passing through a series of gauze covered holes and enters the base through another yet another series of gauze covered holes.  Any attempt to unscrew the base causes the lever (shown at ''f'' in the illustration) to extinguish the flame.  The gauze covered holes and passageways restrict the flow to that required for combustion, so if any part of the oxygen is replaced by firedamp, then the flame is extinguished for want of oxidant.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

The upper portion of the lamp uses a chimney like Mueseler and Morgan lamps.  The rising gases pass up the chimney and through a gauze.  At the top of the chimney a dished reflector diverts the gases out sideways through a number of holes in the chimney.  The gases then start to rise up the ''intermediate chimney'' before exiting through another gauze.  Gas finally passes down between the outermost chimney and the intermediate chimney, exiting a little above the glass.  The outer chimney is therefore effectively a shield.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

====Yates' lamp====
[[File:Yates's safety lamp.jpeg|thumb|Miner's safety lamp designed by Mr William Yates c. 1878, published in Dr Ure's Dictionary supplement of 1879]]
The Yates lamp is a development of the Clanny.  Air enters through the lower part of the gauze top and leaves through the upper part; there is no chimney.  The lower glass part of the lamp has seen some development however.  It is replaced by a silvered reflector having a ''strong lens or bull's-eye'' in it to allow the light out.  The result was a claimed 20 fold improvement in lighting over the Davy.  Yates claimed "the temptation to expose the flame to obtain more light is removed".&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

The base also contained an interlocking mechanism to ensure that the wick was lowered and the lamp extinguished by any attempt to open it.

The lamp was "much more expensive than the forms of lamp now in general use, but Mr, Yates states that the saving of oil effected by its use will in one year pay the additional cost".&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

====Evan–Thomas====
The Evan–Thomas lamp is similar to a shielded Clanny, but there is a brass cylinder outside the gauze above the glass.  It resists draughts well but the flame is dull.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Evan–Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Morgan====
The Morgan is a cross between the Mueseler and the Marsaut.  It is a shielded lamp with a series of disks at the top to allow spent fumes out and a series of holes lower down the shield to allow air in.  There is an inner and outer shield so that air cannot blow directly on the gauze but must first find its way through a slim chamber.  There are multiple gauzes, like the Mersaut, and there is an internal chimney like the Mueseler.  There is no "shelf" supporting the chimney, instead it hangs from an inverted cone of gauze.&lt;ref name=LuptonMo&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morgan will resist air up to 53 feet per second and is ''"sufficiently safe for every practical purpose"''.&lt;ref name=LuptonMo/&gt;

====Clifford====
The Clifford also has a double shield, but with a plain flat top.  The chimney is quite narrow with gauze covering the top.  The bottom of the chimney has a glass bell covering the flame.  The chimney is supported on a gauze shelf.  Air enters through the lower part of the outer shield, through the passage and into the lamp through the inner shield.  It is drawn down through the gauze then passes the flame and ascends the chimney.  At the top it leaves through gauze and the top of the double shield.  The inner chimney is made of copper coated with a fusible metal.  If the lamp gets too hot the metal melts and closes up the air holes, extinguishing the lamp.&lt;ref name=LuptonCl&gt;{{harvnb|Lupton|1893|loc=section: Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lamp has been tested and according to Lupton ''"successfully resisted every effort to explode it up to a velocity of more than 100 feet per second"''.&lt;ref name=LuptonCl/&gt;

==Electric lamps==
It was not until tungsten filaments replaced carbon that a portable electric light became a reality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} An early pioneer was Joseph Swan who exhibited his first lamp in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1881 &lt;ref name=Swan/&gt; and improved ones in subsequent years. The Royal Commission on Accidents in Mines set up in 1881 carried out extensive tests of all types of lamps and the final report in 1886 noted that there had been good progress made in producing electric lamps giving a light superior to that of oil lamps and expected economic and efficient lamps to become available soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royal Commission on Accidents in Mines|1886|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turned out not to be the case and progress was slow in attaining reliability and economy.  The Sussmann lamp &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into Britain in 1893 and following trials at Murton Colliery in Durham it became a widely used electric lamp with 3000 or so reported by the company in use in 1900 &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Home Office|1901|}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1910 there were only 2055 electric lamps of all types in use - about  0.25% of all safety lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Tarkenter|1993|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, an anonymous colliery owner, through the British government, offered a prize of £1000 ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1911|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) for the best lamp to specified requirements. There  were 195 entries. It was won by a German engineer with the CEAG lamp,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Tarkenter|1993|pp=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was hand-held and delivered twice the illumination of oil lamps, with a battery life of 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metcalfe|Metcalfe|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awards were made to 8 other lamps that met the judges' criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forster|1914|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly this stimulated development and over the next few years there was a marked increase in the use of electric lamps, especially the CEAG, Gray-Sussmann and Oldham, so by 1922 there were 294593 in use in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dron|1924|pp=150–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, [[Thomas Edison]] won the ''Ratheman medal'' for inventing a lightweight storage battery that could be carried on the back, powering a parabolic reflector that could be mounted on the miner's helmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New Wisdom Investment Limited|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive testing, 70,000 robust designs were in use in the US by 1916,.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brune|2010|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early electric lamps in Britain were hand held as miners were used to this and helmet lamps became common much later than in countries like the USA where helmet (cap) lamps had been the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitaker|1928|pp=146–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, safety lamps are mainly electric, and traditionally mounted on miners' helmets (such as the [[wheat lamp]]) or the [[Oldham headlamp]], sealed to prevent gas penetrating the casing and being ignited by electrical sparks.

Although its use as a light source was superseded by electric lighting, the flame safety lamp has continued to be used in mines to detect [[methane]] and [[blackdamp]], although many modern mines now also use sophisticated electronic [[gas detectors]] for this purpose.

As a new light source, [[LED]] has many advantages for safety lamps, including longer illumination times and reduced energy requirements. Combined with new battery technologies, such as the lithium battery, it gives much better performance in safety lamp applications. It is replacing conventional safety lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New Wisdom Investment Limited|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of Mine Safety and Health (OMSHR), a part of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (itself part of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in the United States has been investigating the benefits of LED headlamps.  A problem in mining is that the average age is increasing: 43.3 years in 2013 (in the USA) and as a person ages vision degenerates.&lt;ref name=OMSH&gt;{{harvnb|Office of Mine Safety and Health|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LED technology is physically robust compared to a filament light bulb, and has a longer life: 50,000 hours compared to 1,000 – 3,000.  Extended life reduces light maintenance and failures; according to OMSHR an average of 28 accidents per year occur in US mines involving lighting.  NIOSH has sponsored the development of cap lamp systems which they claim improve the "ability of older subjects to detect moving hazards by 15% and trip hazards by 23.7%, and discomfort glare was reduced by 45%".&lt;ref name=OMSH/&gt;  Conventional lights are strongly focussed in a beam, NIOSH LED lamps are designed to produce a wider more diffuse beam which is claimed to improve the perception of objects by 79.5%.&lt;ref name=OMSH/&gt;

The phrase the "sensor web" is also associated with a sensing system which heavily utilizes the [[World Wide Web]]. [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]]'s [[Sensor Web Enablement]] (SWE) framework defines a suite of web service interfaces and communication protocols abstracting from the heterogeneity of sensor (network) communication.&lt;ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The term "sensor web" was first used by Kevin Delin of NASA in 1997,&lt;ref name="Geosciences"/&gt;
to describe a novel wireless sensor network architecture where the individual pieces could act and coordinate as a whole.  In this sense, the term describes a specific type of [[sensor network]]: an '''amorphous network''' of spatially distributed [[sensor]] platforms ('''pods''') that wirelessly communicate with each other.  This amorphous architecture is unique since it is both synchronous and [[router (computing)|router]]-free, making it distinct from the more typical [[TCP/IP]]-like network schemes. A pod as a physical platform for a sensor can be orbital or terrestrial, fixed or mobile and might even have real time accessibility via the [[Internet]]. Pod-to-pod communication is both omni-directional and bi-directional where each pod sends out collected data to every other pod in the network. Hence, the architecture allows every pod to know what is going on with every other pod throughout the sensor web at each measurement cycle. The individual pods (nodes) were all hardware equivalent&lt;ref name="sensorwebbiosig"/&gt; and Delin's architecture did not require special gateways or routing to have each of the individual pieces communicate with one another or with an end user.  Delin's definition of a sensor web was an ''autonomous, stand-alone, sensing entity – capable of interpreting and reacting to the data measured – that does not necessarily require the presence of the World Wide Web to function''.&lt;ref&gt;

 |title=The Sensor Web: A New Instrument Concept
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
As a result, on-the-fly data fusion, such as false-positive identification and plume tracking, can occur within the sensor web itself and the system subsequently reacts as a coordinated, collective whole to the incoming data stream.  For example, instead of having uncoordinated smoke detectors, a sensor web can react as a single, spatially dispersed, fire locator.

The term "sensor web" has also morphed into sometimes being associated with an additional layer connecting sensors to the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;

The Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) initiative of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC) defines service interfaces which enable an interoperable usage of sensor resources by enabling their ''discovery'', ''access'', ''tasking'', as well as ''eventing and alerting''.&lt;ref name="NewGenSWE"&gt;

OGC's SWE initiative defines the term "sensor web" as ''an infrastructure enabling access to sensor networks and archived sensor data that can be discovered and accessed using standard protocols and application programming interfaces''. Through this abstraction from sensor details, their usage in applications is facilitated.

== Characteristics of Delin's ''sensor web'' architecture ==

Delin designed a sensor web as a web of interconnected pods. All pods in a sensor web are equivalent in hardware (there are no special "gateway" or "slave" pods). Nevertheless, there are additional functions that pods can perform besides participating in the general sensor web function. Any pod of a sensor web can be a ''portal pod'' and provides users access to the sensor web (both input and output).&lt;ref name="RFIDJrnl_NASA"&gt;
 [http://www.sensorwaresystems.com/historical/press/RFIDJrnl_NASA_Oct04.pdf NASA Creates Thinking RF Sensors]
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Access can be provided by RF modem, cell phone connections, laptop connections, or even an Internet Server.   In some cases, a pod will have an attached removable memory unit (such as a USB stick or a laptop) that stores collected data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=358630&amp;sk=&amp;date=&amp;pageID=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226005023/http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=358630 |archivedate=2009-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenorWebAntarctica2003"/&gt;

The term of ''mother pod'' refers to the pod that contains the master clock of the synchronous sensor web system.  The mother pod has no special hardware associated with it, its designation as a mother is merely based on the ID number associated with the pod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=358630 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311192531/http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=358630 |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often the mother pod serves as a primary portal point to the Internet, but this is done only for deployment convenience.   Early papers referenced the mother pod as "a prime node" if it additionally contained special hardware for a particular type of input/output device (say an RF modem).

Because of the inherent hopping of data within a sensor web, a pod with no attached sensors can be deployed as a ''relay'' with the single purpose of facilitating communication between the other pods and to expand the communication range to a particular end-point (such as a mother pod).&lt;ref name="SenorWebAntarctica2003"/&gt;  Sensors can be attached to relay pods at a later time and relays can also serve as portal pods.

Each pod usually contains:&lt;ref name="DelinSensorWebsInTheWildChapter2005"/&gt;
* one or more sensor leading to one or more data channel,
* a processing unit such as a [[micro-controller]] or [[microprocessor]],
* a two-way communication component such as a [[radio]] and [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] (radio ranges are typically limited by government spectrum requirements; unlicensed bands will allow for communication of a few hundred yards in unobstructed areas, although line of sight is not a requirement),
* an energy source such as a battery coupled with a [[solar cell]],
* a package to protect components against sometimes harsh environment,

Each pod also typically requires a support such as a pole or tripod.&lt;ref name="SenorWebAntarctica2003"&gt;
 [http://www.sensorwaresystems.com/historical/resources/Delin_et_al_Antarctica_2003.pdf Sensor Web in Antarctica: Developing an intelligent, autonomous platform for locating biological flourishes in cryogenic environments]
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The number of pods may vary, with examples of sensor webs with 12 to 30 pods.&lt;ref name="RFIDJrnl_NASA"/&gt;&lt;!-- Please add more extreme minimum/maximum referenced numbers --&gt; 
The shape of a sensor web may impact its usefulness, for instance a particular deployment&lt;ref name="SenorWebAntarctica2003"/&gt; 
made sure each pod was in range to communicate with at least two other pods. Sensor web measurement cycles have typically been between 30 seconds and 15 minutes for deployed systems thus far.&lt;ref&gt;
 [http://www.sensorwaresystems.com/historical/resources/huntington_sw5.shtml Huntington Botanical Gardens – Sensor Web 5.0]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensor webs consisting of pods have been deployed that have spanned miles and run continuously for years.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  
Sensor webs have been fielded in harsh environments (including deserts, mountain snowpacks, and Antarctica)&lt;ref&gt;

'''Spot Image''', a public limited company created in 1982 by the [[CNES|French Space Agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales]] (CNES), the [[Institut Géographique National|IGN]], and Space Manufacturers ([[Matra]], [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], SSC, etc.) is a subsidiary of Airbus Defence and Space (99%). The company is the commercial operator for the [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT Earth observation satellites]].

== Network and partners ==
Spot Image is a worldwide distributor of products and services using imagery from Earth observation satellites and works through a network of subsidiaries, local offices (Australia, Brazil, China, United States, Japan, Peru, Singapore), and partners. The goal is to provide on-the-spot service with worldwide availability.

Spot Image works with a network of more than 30 direct receiving stations handling images acquired by the SPOT satellites.

Spot Image collaborates with ESA’s GMES programme, shares geographic information with the OGC and contributes to the interoperability of web services; with Infoterra Global it continues to offer services for precision-agriculture.

== Satellites ==
[[File:Spot-5.jpg|thumb|SPOT 5 Satellite]]
The 3 [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellites]] in orbit (Spot  5, 6, and 7) provide images with a large choice of resolutions – from 2.5 m to 10 m. Spot Image also distributes multiresolution data from other optical satellites, in particular from [[Formosat-2]] (Taiwan) and [[Kompsat-2]] (South Korea), for which it has exclusive distribution rights, and from radar satellites ([[TerraSAR-X]], [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS]], [[Envisat]], [[Radarsat]]). Spot Image is also  the exclusive distributor of data from the very-high resolution [[Pleiades satellites]]. The launch of Pléiades-1, via a Soyuz rocket, was confirmed on December 16, 2011.  The second (Pléiades-2) was launched mid-2012.  Spot Image also offers infrastructures for receiving and processing, as well as added value options.

== Products ==
In addition to images, Spot Image proposes innovative added-value products to meet new user-needs:
* ortho-images (SPOTView ortho) whose location accuracy is less than 10 m RMS
* homogeneous territorial coverage, orthorectified (SPOTMaps), which come in natural colours with 2.5 m resolution
* 3D products (SPOT DEM) built from automatic correlation of stereoscopic pairs acquired by SPOT 5’s HRS (Haute Résolution Stéréoscopique, High Resolution Stereoscopic) instrument

Among the services offered by Spot File:
* Programming of SPOT satellites: direct-access satellite programming and regular revisit capability over the same point on the globe enable the acquisition of images over a selected area of interest.
* The SPOT archives: more than 18 million images of the whole world, collected by SPOT satellites since 1986, are archived and accessible on line, offering recent or historical geographic information.
	
On-line services:
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194027/http://gallery.spotimage.com/ SPOTGallery] giving the general public access to images chosen for aesthetic, cultural or thematic reasons,
* In partnership with Google Earth, ’One World, One Year‘ offers the best images from the SPOT satellites whose acquisition data is not more than one year old, for almost the entire planet.

== Planet Action, an initiative launched by Spot Image ==
Its goal is to encourage the Earth observation industry and geographic information professionals to support local projects searching for adaptive solutions to climate change problems.  The products and materials available to these professionals – satellite images, geographic information systems, image processing and display software – are indispensable for studying the impact of global warming on our planet, on local and global scales.
Planet Action supports projects that study:
* the impact on populations and habitat
* droughts, desertification and water resources
* vegetation, biodiversity and ecosystems,
* the oceans
* ice, glaciers and snow cover

'''Stockholm syndrome''' is a condition that causes [[kidnapping|hostages]] to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jameson|first=Celia | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=The Short Step From Love to Hypnosis: A Reconsideration of the Stockholm Syndrome|url=|journal=Journal for Cultural Research|volume=14.4|pages=337–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alliances, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent together, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. &lt;!--Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of "strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other."&lt;ref name = "McKenzie_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last = McKenzie | first = Ian K. | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Stockholm Syndrome Revisited | journal = Journal of Police Crisis Negotiations | date = 23 February 2004 | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–21 | doi = 10.1300/J173v04n01_02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI's]] Hostage Barricade Database System and [[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|Law Enforcement Bulletin]] shows that roughly 8% of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.&lt;ref name="Sundaram_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sundaram | first = Chandar S. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2013 | title = Stockholm Syndrome | journal = Salem Press Encyclopedia | via = Research Starters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI-1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fuselier | first = G.

This term was first used by foreign media in 1973 as [[Eponym|eponym]] when four hostages were taken during [[Norrmalmstorg robbery|a bank robbery]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The hostages defended their captors after being released and would not agree to testify in court against them.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adorjan | first1 = Michael | first2 = Tony | last2 = Christensen | first3 = Benjamin | last3 = Kelly | first4 = Dorothy | last4 = Pawluch | name-list-format = vanc | title = Stockholm Syndrome As Vernacular Resource | journal = The Sociological Quarterly | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | year = 2012 | pages = 454–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stockholm syndrome is ostensibly paradoxical because the sympathetic sentiments captives feel towards their captors are the opposite of the fear and disdain an onlooker may feel towards the captors.

There are four key components that generally lead to the development of Stockholm syndrome: 
* A hostage's development of positive feelings towards their captor
* No previous hostage-captor relationship
* A refusal by hostages to co-operate with police forces and other government authorities
* A hostage's belief in the humanity of their captor, for the reason that when a victim holds the same values as the aggressor, they cease to be perceived as a threat.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="McKenzie_2004" /&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sundaram_2013" /&gt;

Stockholm syndrome is considered a "contested illness", due to many law enforcement officers' doubt about the legitimacy of the condition.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Stockholm syndrome has also come to describe the reactions of some abuse victims beyond the context of kidnappings or hostage-taking. Actions and attitudes similar to those suffering from Stockholm syndrome have also been found in victims of [[sexual abuse]], [[human trafficking]], discrimination, terror, and political and religious oppression.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt;

==History==
=== Stockholm bank robbery ===
{{Main|Norrmalmstorg robbery}}
In 1973, [[Jan-Erik Olsson]], a convict on parole, took four employees of the bank (three women and one man) hostage during a failed bank robbery in [[Kreditbanken]], one of the largest banks in Stockholm, Sweden. He negotiated the release from prison of his friend [[Clark Olofsson]] to assist him. They held the hostages captive for six days (23–28 August) in one of the bank’s vaults. When they were released, none of them would testify against either captor in court; instead they began raising money for their defense.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; 

[[Nils Bejerot]], a Swedish [[criminologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] coined the term after [[Swedish Police|Stockholm police]] asked him for assistance with analyzing the victims' reactions to the 1973 bank robbery and their status as hostages. As the idea of [[brainwashing]] was not a new concept, Bejerot, speaking on "a news cast after the captives' release" instinctively reduced the hostages' reactions to a result of being brainwashed by their captors.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt; He called it ''Norrmalmstorgssyndromet'', meaning "The Norrmalmstorg Syndrome"; it later became known outside of Sweden as the Stockholm syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nilsbejerot.se/sexdagar_eng.htm |vauthors=Bejerot N |title=The six day war in Stockholm |journal=New Scientist |date=1974 |volume=61 |issue=886 |pages=486–487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally defined by psychiatrist [[Frank Ochberg]] to aid the management of hostage situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |vauthors=Ochberg F |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/08/opinion/oe-ochberg8 |title=The Ties That Bind Captive to Captor |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=8 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olsson later said in an interview:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the hostages' fault. They did everything I told them to. If they hadn't, I might not be here now. Why didn't any of them attack me? They made it hard to kill. They made us go on living together day after day, like goats, in that filth. There was nothing to do but get to know each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22447726|title=What is Stockholm syndrome?|last=Westcott|first=Kathryn | name-list-format = vanc |date=22 August 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other famous examples ===

==== Mary McElroy ====
[[Mary McElroy (kidnapping victim)|Mary McElroy]] was abducted from her home at age 25 by four men who held a gun to her, demanded her compliance, took her to an abandoned farmhouse, and chained her to a wall. She defended her kidnappers when she was released, explaining that they were only businessmen. She then continued to visit her captors while they were in jail. She eventually committed suicide and left the following note: “My four kidnappers are probably the only people on Earth who don't consider me an utter fool. You have your death penalty now – so, please, give them a chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mara | last = Bovsun | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/lady-kidnappers-article-1.396520 | title = Justice Story: The lady and her kidnappers | work = NY Daily News | access-date = 2018-04-08 | date = 11 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natascha Kampusch ====
[[Natascha Kampusch]] was kidnapped at age ten and kept in an insulated, dark room under the garage of Wolfgang Priklopil. She would receive a variation of kind, physically and sexually abusive, controlling, and permissive treatment from her captor. Eight years after her kidnapping, Natascha left and Priklopil committed suicide. After her kidnapper's death, Natascha lamented and kept a picture of him in her wallet.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Kampusch now owns the house in which she was imprisoned, saying, "I know it's grotesque – I must now pay for electricity, water and taxes on a house I never wanted to live in". It was reported that she claimed the house from Přiklopil's estate because she wanted to protect it from vandals and being torn down; she also noted that she has visited it since her escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1316125,00.html|title=Kidnap Victim Owns Her House of Horrors|publisher=Sky News|date=15 May 2008|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the third anniversary of her escape approached, it was revealed she had become a regular visitor at the property and was cleaning it out possibly to move in herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |title=Kampusch to auction off horror house items – Panorama – Austrian Times |website= |accessdate=15 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/688Ynv8tb?url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |archivedate=3 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Kampusch said she had retained the house because it was such a big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1245899/Natascha-Kampusch-If-I-sell-house-I-held-captive-half-years-I-make-sure-cellar-filled-in.html Natascha Kampusch: He put me inside the cellar for eight-and-a-half years, preserved alive like an Egyptian pharaoh], ''Daily Mail''. Retrieved 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The cellar was indeed filled in, though Kampusch still owns the house.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAxRCnoa9Aw Abductee Natascha Kampusch speaks out about her 8 years in captivity], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Patty Hearst ====
[[Patty Hearst]], the granddaughter of publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], was taken and held hostage by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]], "an urban guerilla group", in 1974. She was recorded denouncing her family as well as the police under her new name, "Tania", and was later seen working with the SLA to rob banks in San Francisco. She publicly asserted her sympathetic feelings towards the SLA and their pursuits as well. After her 1975 arrest, pleading Stockholm syndrome did not work as a proper defense in court, much to the chagrin of her defense lawyer, [[F. Lee Bailey]]. Her seven-year prison sentence was later commuted, and she was eventually presidentially pardoned by [[Bill Clinton]], who was informed that she was not acting under her own free will.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt;

==== Colleen Stan ====
In 1977, [[Kidnapping of Colleen Stan|Colleen Stan]] was hitchhiking to visit a friend in southern California when she was kidnapped by Cameron Hooker and his wife Janice and forced to live in a wooden restraining box underneath their bed. For seven years she was repeatedly raped and tortured by Cameron and forced to live life as a sort of domestic/sex slave. Even though she was allowed to socialize with Janice and even visit her mother, she still continued to live in the box and did not attempt to escape. She was eventually freed by Janice, who asked Stan to not disclose her abuse as Janice was attempting to reform Cameron. Stan remained silent until Janice finally decided to turn Cameron over to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mara | last = Bovsun | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/girl-box-article-1.1715494 | title=Hitchhiker kept as sex slave for seven years as 'Girl in the Box' | work = NY Daily News | access-date = 2018-04-08 | date = 9 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual abuse victims ===
There is evidence that some victims of ''childhood sexual abuse'' come to feel a connection with their abuser. They often feel flattered by the adult attention or are afraid that disclosure will create family disruption. In adulthood, they resist disclosure for emotional and personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jülich | first = Shirley | name-list-format = vanc | title = Stockholm Syndrome and Child Sexual Abuse | journal = Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 107–129 | date = 2005 | doi = 10.1300/J070v14n03_06 | pmid = 16203697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lima syndrome===
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
A similar form of Stockholm syndrome called ''Lima syndrome'' has been proposed, in which abductors develop sympathy for their hostages. An abductor may also have second thoughts or experience empathy towards their victims.

Lima syndrome was named after [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis|an abduction at the Japanese embassy]] in [[Lima]], Peru, in 1996, when members of a militant movement took hostage hundreds of people attending a party at the official residence of Japan's ambassador. Within a few hours, the abductors had set free most of the hostages, including the most valuable ones, because of sympathy towards them.&lt;ref name=ptsd&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kato N, Kawata M, Pitman RK | title=PTSD |year=2006 |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FUOHCwnHFKUC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Lima+Syndrome%22 |isbn = 978-4-431-29566-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Tansa|last= Musa  | name-list-format = vanc  | title = Africa Politics | url = http://www.ipsnews.net/1996/07/africa-politics-rwandas-revenge/ |work=[[International Press Service]] |date=10 July 1996 |access-date=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms and behaviours ==
{{Original research section|date=October 2016}}
Victims of the formal definition of Stockholm syndrome develop "positive feelings toward their captors and sympathy for their causes and goals, and negative feelings toward the police or authorities".&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; These symptoms often follow escaped victims back into their previously ordinary lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/coping-after-captivity/384577/|title=Coping After Captivity|last=Giambrone|first=Andrew | name-list-format = vanc |work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical and psychological effects ===

# Cognitive: confusion, blurred memory, refusal to accept the reality of events and recurring flashbacks.
# Emotional: lack of feeling, fear, helplessness, hopelessness, aggression, depression, guilt, dependence on captor and development of posttraumatic stress disorder. 
# Social: anxiety, irritability, cautiousness and estrangement. 
# Physical: increase in effects of pre-existing conditions; development of health conditions due to possible restriction from food, sleep, and exposure to outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander DA, Klein S | title = Kidnapping and hostage-taking: a review of effects, coping and resilience | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–21 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19147852 | pmc = 2627800 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2008.080347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coping mechanism ===
From a psychoanalytic lens, it can be argued that Stockholm syndrome arises strictly as a result of survival instincts. Strentz states, "the victim’s need to survive is stronger than his impulse to hate the person who has created the dilemma." A positive emotional bond between captor and captive is a "defense mechanism of the ego under stress".&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; These sentimental feelings are not strictly for show, however. Since captives often fear that their affection will be perceived as fake, they eventually begin to believe that their positive sentiments are genuine. The conception of Stockholm syndrome has grown to include victims of kidnappings or hostage instances, domestic or child abuse, human trafficking, incest, prisoners of war, political terrorism, cult members, concentration camp prisoners, slaves, and prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt; It is believed that women are especially prone to developing the condition.&lt;ref name = "Åse_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Åse|first1=Cecilia | name-list-format = vanc |title=Crisis Narratives and Masculinist Protection|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|date=22 May 2015|volume=17|issue=4|pages=595–610|doi=10.1080/14616742.2015.1042296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, Stockholm syndrome develops in captives when they engage in "face-to-face contact" with their captors, and when captors make captives doubt the likelihood of their survival by terrorizing them into "helpless, powerless, and submissive" states. This enables captors to appear merciful when they perform acts of kindness or fail to "beat, abuse, or rape" the victims.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Ideas like "dominance hierarchies and submission strategies" assist in devising explanations for the illogical reasoning behind the symptoms of those suffering from Stockholm syndrome as a result of any oppressive relationship.&lt;ref name="Åse_2015" /&gt; Partial activation of the capture-bonding psychological trait may lie behind [[battered woman syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=October 2016}}{{cite book|first=Libb|last=Thims | name-list-format = vanc |title=Human Chemistry (Volume Two)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGaghraz8AUC|year=2007 |publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4303-2840-7|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KGaghraz8AUC&amp;pg=PA604&amp;dq=%25captive–bonding%25+%25battered–wife+syndrome%25 604–605]}}&lt;/ref&gt; military basic training, fraternity [[hazing]], and sex practices such as [[BDSM|sadism/masochism or bondage/discipline]].&lt;ref name="hkhenson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henson |first=Keith | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evolutionary Psychology, Memes and the Origin of War |journal=Mankind Quarterly |date=Summer 2006 |volume=46 |issue=4 |url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2006/4/17/194059/296 |authorlink=Keith Henson |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209044509/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2006/4/17/194059/296 |archive-date=9 December 2012 |access-date=15 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possible evolutionary explanations ====

Evolutionarily speaking, research evidence exists to support the genuine scientific nature of Stockholm syndrome. Responses similar to those in human captives have been detected in some reptiles and mammals, primates in particular. Abuse and subsequent submission and appeasement by the victim have been observed among chimpanzees, leading to the theory that the Stockholm syndrome may have its roots in evolutionary needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cantor C, Price J | title = Traumatic entrapment, appeasement and complex post-traumatic stress disorder: evolutionary perspectives of hostage reactions, domestic abuse and the Stockholm syndrome | journal = The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 377–84 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17464728 | doi = 10.1080/00048670701261178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in the "environment of evolutionary adaptiveness" ([[Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|EEA]]) is thought by researchers such as Israeli military historian [[Azar Gat]] to be similar to that of the few remaining hunter-gatherer societies, who asserts that war and abductions were typical of human pre-history.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-scribd-10|&lt;sup&gt;[10&lt;/sup&gt;]] Being captured by neighbouring tribes was a relatively common event for women. In some of those tribes ([[Yanomamo]], for instance), practically everyone in the tribe is descended from a captive within the last three generations. As high as one in ten of females were abducted and incorporated into the tribe that captured them.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-hkhenson-15|&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;]]Being captured[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-11|&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] and having their children killed may have been common;[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] women who resisted capture risked being killed.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-13|&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] When [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is intense and persistent, adaptive traits (such as capture-bonding) become universal to the population or species.

==== Loving to survive ====
First published in 1994, author Dee Graham uses the Stockholm syndrome label to describe group or collective responses to trauma, rather than individual reactions. Graham focuses specifically on the impact of Stockholm syndrome on battered and abused women as a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://violentadegen.ro/wp-content/uploads/Loving-to-Survive-Graham.pdf|title=Loving to Survive|last=Graham|first=Dee L. R.|publisher=New York University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:1-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]She claimed that in both the psychological and societal senses, these women are defined by their sense of fear surrounding the threat of male violence. This constant fear is what drives these women to perform actions that they know will be pleasing to men in order to avoid emotional, physical, or sexual assault as a result of male anger. Graham draws parallels between women and kidnapping victims in the sense that these women bond to men to survive, as captives bond to their captors to survive.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:1-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Recovery ===
Recovering from Stockholm syndrome ordinarily involves "psychiatric or psychological counseling," where the patient is helped to realize that their actions and feelings stemmed from inherent human survival techniques. The process of recovery includes reinstating normalcy into the lives of victims, including helping the victim learn how to decrease their survival-driven behaviors.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:24-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;ref name="Åse_2015"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
=== Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM5, 2013) ===
This book is widely used as the "classification system for psychological disorders" by the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Stockholm syndrome has not historically appeared in the manual, as many believe it falls under [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Before the fifth edition (DSM5) was released, Stockholm syndrome was under consideration to be included under 'Disorders of Extreme Stress, Not Otherwise Specified'.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; The work was updated in 2013, but Stockholm syndrome was not present.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | author = American Psychiatry Association | title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5 | date = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | location = Washington | isbn = 978-0-89042-555-8 | edition = 5th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Namnyak, Tufton, Szekely, Toal, Worboys and Sampson (2008) ===
Researchers have found that although there is a lot of media coverage of Stockholm syndrome, there has not been a lot of professional research into the phenomena. What little research has been done is often contradictory and does not always agree on what Stockholm syndrome is. The term has grown beyond kidnappings to all kinds of abuse. Also, there is no clear definition of symptoms to ‘diagnose’ the ‘syndrome’.&lt;ref name="Namnyak_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Namnyak M, Tufton N, Szekely R, Toal M, Worboys S, Sampson EL | title = 'Stockholm syndrome': psychiatric diagnosis or urban myth? | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–11 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18028254 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01112.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin (1999) ===
A report by the FBI found that only 8% of kidnapping victims showed signs of Stockholm syndrome. The sensational nature of dramatic cases causes the public to perceive this phenomenon as the rule rather than the exception. For Stockholm syndrome to happen, FBI researchers have identified three key factors: the passage of time, continual contact, and small acts of kindness without direct and persistent abuse.&lt;ref name="FBI-1999"/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal | last = Fuselier | first = G. Dwayne | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 1999|title=Placing the Stockholm Syndrome in Perspective|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/fbi/stockholm_syndrome.pdf|journal=[[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin]]|volume=68|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

=== Robbins and Anthony (1982) ===
Robbins and Anthony, who had historically studied a condition similar to Stockholm syndrome, known as destructive cult disorder, observed in their 1982 study that the 1970s were rich with apprehension surrounding the potential risks of brainwashing. They assert that brainwashing’s media attention during this time resulted in the fluid reception of Stockholm syndrome as a psychological condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Elizabeth Aileen| name-list-format = vanc |date=31 December 2012|title=The use of the "Brainwashing" Theory by the Anti-cult Movement in the United States of America, pre-1996|url=http://journals.openedition.org/zjr/387|journal=Zeitschrift für Junge Religionswissenschaft | language=en|issue=7|doi=10.4000/zjr.387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victims ===
It is possible that the label Stockholm syndrome is used too freely in cases in which it may not apply. [[Elizabeth Smart]] has been held as a classic example of Stockholm syndrome; however, she denies that she ever had any emotional attachment to her abusers. Although she chose not to run away when she had the chance, she emphasized that the threats from her captors to her and her family, and the direct presence of her captors influenced her decision to stay. Once freed from her captors, she gladly reunited with her family and felt no empathy for her abusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | last= McLaughlin | first = Christen Marie | degree = Bachelor of Science | name-list-format = vanc | title = Fear or Love: Examining Stockholm Syndrome in the Elizabeth Smart Kidnapping case | date = 2015 | publisher = Salem State University | url = http://digitalcommons.salemstate.edu/honors_theses/72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films and television===
* In the 1977 TV series ''[[Lou Grant (season 1)|Lou Grant]]'', episode ''Hostages''. The hostage negotiator mentions Stockholm syndrome to Lou when hostage Carla Mardigian goes back after hostage taker lets her go to the toilet.
*In the opening sequence of ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), James Bond is "killed" in a training exercise by a prisoner he has released, since he doesn't anticipate that she might be suffering from Stockholm syndrome. This condition is also mentioned in The World is Not Enough, where Bond accuses Elektra King of having romantic feelings for her captor, Renard.
*In ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988), a book author, Dr. Hasseldorf, expresses his view that "by this time, the hostages should be going through the early stages of the Helsinki syndrome," an error compounded by news reporter Harvey Johnson's reply of "As in Helsinki, Sweden."
*In ''[[Babylon 5]]'''s 8th episode of Season 4, ''[[The Illusion of Truth]]'' (1997), Dr. Indiri states that [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|Sheridan]] is suffering from Helsinki syndrome.
*In the animated series ''[[Black Lagoon]]'', it is often contemplated by the protagonist whether or not he has Stockholm syndrome after he joins the pirates as a former hostage.
* In the second episode of [[Red Dwarf XII|Series XII]] of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', ''[[Siliconia]]'' (2017), the leader of the Mechanoid Intergalactic Liberation Front known as Wind suggests to [[Kryten]] that he is suffering from Stockholm syndrome based on his professed affection for his shipmates despite his seeming servitude.
* In the Spanish TV series [[Money Heist]] (Casa de Papel, 2017), all of the captors are nicknamed for cities -- Tokyo, Berlin, etc.  One of the hostages falls in love with one of the captors and joins them, earning her the nickname Stockholm.

===Other media===
*In music, many bands have published [[Stockholm syndrome (disambiguation)#songs|songs titled "Stockholm Syndrome"]], such as [[Yo La Tengo]], [[blink-182]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], and [[One Direction]]. Japanese-British singer [[Rina Sawayama]] has also released a song "Cyberstockholm Syndrome" based on the condition with an Internet-technological theme of online relationships. 
*In the video game ''[[Payday 2]]'', there is an available skill in the "Mastermind" tree called Stockholm Syndrome, which gives civilians (who are typically held hostage if not freed by police units or left unattended long enough) a chance to revive downed players and give them more weapon ammunition.

'''Techne Ltd.''' was a company founded in [[Cambridge]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] by [[Norman de Bruyne]] in 1948 to manufacture gelation timers and [[thermal cycler]] equipment. The company was sold after the founder's death by his son John. After changing hands many times, the company finally closed in 2005. Techne branded products are now manufactured by the parent company [[Barloworld Scientific Ltd.]] From the time of its formation until 1999 Techne was located in [[Duxford]] vicarage near Cambridge. At this point, however, the property was sold for housing development and the company moved to the [[industrial estate]] {{convert|100|yd}} up the road.

'''Terminal cleaning''' is a cleaning method used in healthcare environments to control the spread of infections.

== Justification ==
[[Nosocomial infections]] claim approximately 90,000 lives in the United States annually. When patients are hospitalized and identified as having [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] or infections that can be spread to other patients, best practices isolate these patients in rooms that are subjected to terminal cleaning when the patient is discharged.

Terminal cleaning reduces the spread of [[C. difficile infection|''C. difficile'' infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=M|last2=Olson|first2=A|last3=Drekonja|first3=D|last4=Shaukat|first4=A|last5=Schwehr|first5=N|last6=Shippee|first6=N|last7=Wilt|first7=TJ|date=March 2016|pmid=27148613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
Terminal cleaning methods vary, but usually include removing all detachable objects in the room, cleaning lighting and air duct surfaces in the ceiling, and cleaning everything downward to the floor. Items removed from the room are disinfected or sanitized before being returned to the room.

{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}

[[File:Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant, Filter Bed - geograph.org.uk - 1450096.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A trickling filter plant in the [[United Kingdom]]: The effluent from the primary settling tanks is sprayed onto a bed of coarse gravel (Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant)]]

A '''trickling filter''' is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] system. It consists of a fixed bed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[gravel]], [[slag]], [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], sphagnum [[peat moss]], [[porous media|ceramic]], or plastic media over which [[sewage]] or other [[wastewater]] flows  downward and causes a layer of [[microbial]] slime ([[biofilm]]) to grow, covering the bed of media. [[Wikt:aerobic|Aerobic]] conditions are maintained by splashing, diffusion, and either by [[forced-air]] flowing through the bed or natural convection of air if the filter medium is porous.

The terms '''trickle filter''', '''trickling biofilter''', '''biofilter''', '''biological filter''' and '''biological trickling filter''' are often used to refer to a '''trickling filter'''. These systems have also been described as roughing filters, intermittent filters, packed media bed filters, alternative septic systems, percolating filters, attached growth processes, and fixed film processes.

== Process description ==
[[Image:Trickle Filter.svg|thumb|right|264px|A typical complete trickling filter system]]
[[Image:Trickle Filter Cross-section.png|thumb|right|250px|Image 1. A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed of media in a trickling filter]]
[[File:Collapsed trickling filter at the WWTP in Norton (6845984347).jpg|thumb|Broken trickling filter unit at the [[sewage treatment plant]] in Norton, [[Zimbabwe]], showing importance of maintenance to prevent structural failure]]
Typically, sewage flow enters at a high level and flows through the primary settlement tank. The supernatant from the tank flows into a dosing device, often a tipping bucket which delivers flow to the arms of the filter. The flush of water flows through the arms and exits through a series of holes pointing at an angle downwards. This propels the arms around distributing the liquid evenly over the surface of the filter media.
Most are uncovered (unlike the accompanying diagram) and are freely ventilated to the atmosphere.

The removal of [[pollution|pollutants]] from the waste water stream involves both [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[adsorption]] of [[organic compounds]]  and some inorganic species such as [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions by the layer of microbial [[bio film]].  The filter media is typically chosen to provide a very high surface area to volume. Typical materials are often porous and have considerable internal surface area in addition to the external surface of the medium.  Passage of the waste water over the media provides dissolved [[oxygen]] which the bio-film layer requires for the [[biochemical]] [[oxidation]] of the organic compounds and releases [[carbon dioxide]] gas, water and other oxidized end products. As the bio film layer thickens, it  eventually sloughs off  into the liquid flow and subsequently forms part of the secondary  sludge. Typically, a trickling filter is followed by a [[clarifier]] or [[sedimentation tank]] for the separation and removal of the sloughed film.  Other filters utilizing higher-density media such as sand, foam and peat moss do not produce a sludge that must be removed, but require forced air blowers and backwashing or an enclosed anaerobic environment.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Biofilm===
The bio-film that develops in a trickling filter may become several millimetres thick and is typically a gelatinous matrix that contains many species of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[cilliate]]s and [[amoeba|amoeboid]] protozoa, [[annelid]]s, [[Nematode|round worm]]s and insect larvae and many other micro fauna. This is very different from many other bio-films which may be less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Within the thickness of the biofilm both aerobic and anaerobic zones can exist supporting both oxidative and reductive biological processes. At certain times of year, especially in the spring, rapid growth of organisms in the film may cause the film to be too thick and it may slough off in patches leading to the "spring slough".&lt;ref name="staffuni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/consultancy/dladmin/zCIWEMWWT/Activity5/act5.html|title=Municipal Wastewater Treatment Unit|publisher=Staffordshire University|access-date=19 February 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations==

A typical trickling filter is circular and between 10 metres and 20 metres across and between 2 metres to 3 metres deep. A circular wall, often of brick, contains a bed of filter media which in turn rests on a base of under-drains. These under-drains function both to remove liquid passing through the filter media but also to allow the free passage of air up through the filter media. Mounted in the center over the top of the filter media is a spindle supporting two or more horizontal perforated pipes which extend to the edge of the media. The perforations on the pipes are designed to allow an even flow of liquid over the whole area of the media and are also angled so that when liquid flows from the pipes the whole assembly rotates around the central spindle.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt; Settled sewage is delivered to a reservoir at the centre of the spindle via some form of dosing mechanism, often a tipping bucket device on small filters.

Larger filters may be rectangular and the distribution arms may be driven by hydraulic or electrical systems.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt;

==Types==
Single trickling filters may be used for the treatment of small residential septic tank discharges and very small rural sewage treatment systems. Larger centralized sewage treatment plants typically use many trickling filters in parallel.

Systems can be configured for single-pass use where the treated water is applied to the trickling filter once before being disposed of, or for multi-pass use where a portion of the treated water is cycled back and re-treated via a [[Feedback|closed loop]].  Multi-pass systems result in higher treatment quality and assist in removing Total Nitrogen (TN) levels by promoting [[nitrification]] in the aerobic media bed and [[denitrification]] in the anaerobic septic tank. Some systems use the filters in two banks operated in series so that the wastewater has two passes through a filter with a sedimentation stage between the two passes. Every few days the filters are switched round to balance the load. This method of treatment can improve nitrification and de-nitrification since much of the carbonaceous oxidative material is removed on the first pass through the filters.

=== Media types ===
Trickling may have a variety of types of filter media used to support the biofilm. Types of media most commonly used include [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[pumice]], plastic matrix material, open-cell [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], clinker, gravel, [[sand]] and [[geotextiles]].  Ideal filter medium optimizes [[surface area]] for microbial attachment, wastewater retention time, allows air flow, resists plugging is mechanically robust in all weathers allowing walking access across the filter and does not degrade.  Some residential systems require forced aeration units which will increase maintenance and operational costs.

===Industrial wastewater treatment===

The treatment of industrial wastewater may involve specialized trickling filters which use plastic media and high flow rates. Wastewaters from a variety of industrial processes have been treated in trickling filters. Such industrial wastewater trickling filters consist of two types:

* Large tanks or concrete enclosures filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Course ChE 101.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728064144/http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt |date=2011-07-28 }} Saudi Aramco Engineering Development Program, pages 62-65 including Figure 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vertical towers filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4351729&amp;id=U3c8AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=trickle+filter+%22packed+tower%22+wastewater Biological filter and process] U.S. patent 4,351,729, September 28, 1982, Assigned to Celanese Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.auburn.edu/~davisda/classes/facilities/presentations/Recirc_overview.pdf Lecture] by Dr. Allen Davis, [[Auburn University]], page 6 of 8 pdf pages including schematic of packed tower trickling filter){{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of inexpensive plastic tower packings has led to their use as trickling filter beds in tall towers, some as high as 20 meters.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1967|lccn=67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1960s, such towers were in use at: the Great Northern Oil's [[Pine Bend Refinery]] in [[Minnesota]]; the Cities Service Oil Company Trafalgar Refinery in [[Oakville, Ontario]] and at a kraft paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Bryan and D.H. Moeller, ''Aerobic Biological Oxidation Using Dowpac'', Paper 42, Conference on Biological Waste Treatment, Manhattan College, April 20, 1960. [http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~alleman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treated water effluent from industrial wastewater trickling filters is typically processed in a clarifier to remove the sludge that sloughs off the microbial slime layer attached to the trickling filter media as for other trickling filter applications.

Some of the latest trickle filter technology involves aerated biofilters of  plastic media in vessels using blowers to inject air at the bottom of the vessels, with either downflow or upflow of the wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Van Sperling|title= Activated Sludge and Aerobic Biofilm Reactors|edition= |publisher =IWA Publications|year=2007|isbn=1-84339-165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wash rack''' is a partly enclosed [[wikt:platform|platform]] that is used to wash [[vehicles]], [[heavy equipment]], tools, and parts by removing [[dirt]], [[Dirt|grime]], [[chemicals]], [[invasive species]], and other [[contaminants]] with a [[pressure washer]] in order to prevent [[corrosion]] and promote longer equipment lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Charles E.|title=Shortcuts put wash racks at risk|publisher=Bulk Transporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cars]], [[truck]]s, [[boats]], [[construction]] and maintenance equipment, and even [[aircraft]] and [[military vehicles]] can all be cleaned in a wash rack. Wash racks are usually [[Motion (physics)|mobile]] and constructed from [[steel]], although [[plastic]] wash racks exist as well as [[concrete]] formed alternatives which are sometimes installed in permanent facilities.

The term '''wash rack''' is also used to describe pads for washing horses. Wash racks for vehicle washing may be called closed-loop washing systems, heavy duty wash systems and degreasing pads.

Wash racks are often called "containment racks" or "containment pads" because their purpose is to contain [[effluent]] which often consists of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] that have been dislodged from the wash subject, and prevent it from [[draining]] off into the ground and causing [[stormwater]] [[Pollution|contamination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA - Stormwater Menu of BMPs|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=132|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the waste water is pumped out of the wash rack and into some sort of [[filtration]] system which removes the contaminates then sends the water either back into the pressure washer for reuse or into a [[sanitary sewer]].

The main [[purpose]] of a wash rack is to clean equipment while protecting the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] from [[contaminate]]s commonly found on construction, maintenance and military vehicles or equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travis Perkins Chooses Wash Rack|url=http://www.dfecology.it/eng_news.html|publisher=FE Ecology|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To comply with [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[regulations]], which are intended to prevent soil-borne [[insects]] or other [[potentially]] harmful organisms from entering the United States, U.S. military vehicles and equipment must be thoroughly washed before being [[shipped]] home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swedberg|first=Claire|title=U.S. Army Deploys 'Soldier-Friendly' System to Track Thousands of Vehicles in Kuwait|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?8946|publisher=RFID Journal|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, wash racks are commonly used by the [[US military]] to ensure vehicles are clean and safe before they are brought back into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wash Racks Use|url=http://www.army.mil/article/86884/|publisher=Army Mil|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[statistics]], wash racks help [[recycle]] thousands of [[gallons]] of water on a daily basis and are already part of many military construction projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wash racks recycle thousands of gallons of water|url=http://www.army.mil/article/86884/|publisher=Army Mil|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial water use was estimated at 18.5 billion gallons per day in the [[United States]] in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Water Use, the USGS Water Science School|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/wuin.html|publisher=US Geological Survey|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number that could be greatly reduced by using wash racks to recycle and [[reuse]] water.

According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], wash racks are also important in controlling the spread of [[noxious weeds]] and [[invasive species]] in the [[agricultural]] industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle Cleaning  Technology for Controlling the Spread of Noxious Weeds and Invasive Species|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/eng/pubs/pdf/05511203.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as forestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison of  Vehicle Washing  Systems: Prepared  for U.S. Forest  Service|url=http://weedeco.msu.montana.edu/rangewildland/Reducing_seed_dispersal/Joe_Invasiveshi.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
