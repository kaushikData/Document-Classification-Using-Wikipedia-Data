'''''Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities''''' is a [[compendium]] of [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities and sororities]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] first published in 1879. It covers national and international general (social), professional, and honor fraternities, including defunct organizations, with an overview of each society's history and traditions, ideals and symbols, and membership information. The 20th and most recent edition, published in 1991, was over 1200 pages long.

==History==
The reference work was compiled by [[William Raimond Baird]] (1848-1917), an 1878 graduate of the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]]. He exhaustively researched other fraternal organizations when he was seeking a suitable partner to merge with his own Alpha Sigma Chi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umainebeta.org/bh_history.php UMaine Beta History]&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually selected [[Beta Theta Pi]], which absorbed ΑΣΧ in 1879. As no authoritative resource on the subject existed, Baird published his research for the benefit of the public as ''American College Fraternities''.

Baird and Beta Theta Pi held the rights for some time before selling them to [[George Banta]], publisher of ''[[Banta's Greek Exchange]]''. The [[Banta Corporation|Banta Publishing Company]] of [[Menasha, Wisconsin]] released several editions before spinning the publication off to the Baird's Manual Foundation, which published editions in 1977 and 1991.

:''For banking in England, see [[English bank]]''
The '''Bank of English''' is a representative subset of the 4.5 billion words [[COBUILD]] [[text corpus|corpus]], a collection of English texts. These are mainly British in origin, but content from North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries is also being included.

The majority of the texts are from written English, collected from websites, newspapers, magazines and books, but there is also a large component of spoken data using material from radio, TV and informal conversations. The Bank of English totals 650 million running words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collins.co.uk/page/The+Collins+Corpus The Collins Corpus]&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the corpus are held both at [[HarperCollins]] Publishers and the [[University of Birmingham]]. The version at Birmingham can be accessed for academic research.

The Bank of English forms part of the ''Collins Word Web'' together with the French, German and Spanish corpora.

The '''Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets''' ('''BioGRID''') is a curated [[biological database]] of [[protein]]-protein interactions, [[epistasis|genetic interactions]], [[chemical]] interactions, and [[post-translational modification]]s created in 2003 (originally referred to as simply the [[General Repository for Interaction Datasets]] (GRID)&lt;ref name="pmid12620108"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Mike Tyers, Bobby-Joe Breitkreutz, and Chris Stark at the [[Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)|Mount Sinai Hospital]]. It strives to provide a comprehensive curated resource for all major [[model organism]] [[species]] while attempting to remove redundancy to create a single mapping of data. Users of The '''BioGRID''' can search for their [[protein]] or [[publication]] of interest and retrieve annotation, as well as curated data as reported, by the primary literature and compiled by in house large-scale curation efforts. The BioGRID is hosted in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], United States and is partnered with the [[Saccharomyces Genome Database]]. The BioGRID is funded by the [[BBSRC]], [[NIH]], and [[CIHR]]. BioGRID is a member of the [http://imex.sourceforge.net/ International Molecular Exchange Consortium] (IMEx).

==History==
The '''BioGRID''' was originally published and released as simply the [[General Repository for Interaction Datasets]]&lt;ref name="pmid12620108" /&gt; but was later renamed to the BioGRID&lt;ref name="pmid16381927" /&gt; in order to more concisely describe the project, and help distinguish it from several [[grid computing|GRID Computing]] projects with a similar name. Originally separated into [[organism]] specific databases, the newest version now provides a unified front end allowing for searches across several organisms simultaneously. The BioGRID was developed initially as a project at the [[Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] but has since expanded to include teams at the Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et en Cancérologie at the [[Université de Montréal]], the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at [[Princeton University]], and the Wellcome Trust Center for Cell Biology at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. The BioGRID's original focus was on curation of binary protein-protein and genetic interactions, but has expanded over several updates&lt;ref name="pmid16381927" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25428363" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23203989"&gt;

==Abstract==
The Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) is an open access database that houses genetic and protein interactions curated from the primary biomedical literature for all major [[model organism]] species and humans. {{As of|2014|09|01}},&lt;ref name="pmid25428363"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BioGRID contains 749,912 interactions as drawn from 43,149 publications that represent 30 model organisms. BioGRID data are freely distributed through partner model organism databases and meta-databases and are directly downloadable in a variety of formats. In addition to general curation of the published literature for the major model species, BioGRID undertakes themed curation projects in areas of particular relevance for biomedical sciences, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system and various human disease-associated interaction networks. BioGRID curation is coordinated through an Interaction Management System (IMS) that facilitates the compilation interaction records through structured evidence codes, phenotype ontologies, and gene annotation. The BioGRID architecture has been improved in order to support a broader range of interaction and post-translational modification types, to allow the representation of more complex multi-gene/protein interactions, to account for cellular phenotypes through structured ontologies, to expedite curation through semi-automated text-mining approaches, and to enhance curation quality control. Through comprehensive curation efforts, BioGRID now includes a virtually complete set of interactions reported to date in the primary literature for budding yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''), thale cress (''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''), and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'').

'''Bradt Travel Guides''' is a publisher of [[travel guide]]s founded in 1974 by [[Hilary Bradt]] and her husband George, who co-wrote the first Bradt Guide on a river barge on a tributary of the [[Amazon river|Amazon]],&lt;ref name="Madagascar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Austin|first1=Daniel|title=Madagascar|date=2017|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides, The Globe Pequot Press|location=Chalfont  St Peter|isbn=9781784770488|edition=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since then Bradt has grown into a leading independent travel publisher, with growth particularly in the last decade. It has a reputation for tackling destinations overlooked by other guide book publishers. Bradt guides have been cited by [[The Independent]] as covering "parts of the world other travel publishers don't reach"&lt;ref name="Benin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Stuart|title=Benin|year=2006|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides, The Globe Pequot Press|location=[[Guilford, Connecticut]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and nearly two-thirds of the guides on the publisher's list have no direct competition in English from other travel publishers. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bradtguides.com/advance-information-sheets "Bradt Travel Guides: Information for Bookshops"]&lt;/ref&gt;

These include guides to parts of [[Asia]], [[Latin America]] and [[Africa]], in particular, which traditionally have not been widely covered by guidebook publishers, or do not have a long history of tourism. Bradt also has an extensive list of regional European guides to destinations such as the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Vendee]] and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].

The guides give a brief summary of the history of the destination. Each guide then covers the basics such as geography and climate, wildlife, languages and culture, healthcare and media. Subsequent chapters are usually arranged on a geographical basis, addressing the main cities or regions of the destination in systematic order. According to [[Michael Palin]]: "Bradt Guides are expertly written and longer on local detail than any others".&lt;ref name="Benin"/&gt;

Bradt guides are often written by writers who live in the country or region they are writing about or have travelled there extensively over many years, rather than professional travel writers. As such, they may be written somewhat unconventionally compared with normal tourist guides. Bradt guides often relay information about the nature of the local people, based on the experiences of the author. The health chapters are written in collaboration with a well-travelled doctor: [[Jane Wilson-Howarth]] or Felicity Nicholson.

In 2010 Bradt launched the Slow Travel series of UK regional guides, now 16 titles strong. And the publisher also has a list of travel narratives and nature writing from authors such as [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]], Brian Jackman and [[Princess Michael of Kent]].

Bradt Travel Guides is based in [[Chalfont St. Peter]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England and co-publishes with Globe Pequot in [[Guilford, Connecticut]] in the United States.

Bradt has won or been shortlisted for many awards, including: [[Sunday Times]] Small Publisher of the Year in 1997; Gold Award in the [[Wanderlust (magazine)|Wanderlust]] Best Guidebook Awards in 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2016; [[Which?]] magazine's Top Recommended Travel Guide Publisher in 2011 and 2012; and a shortlisting for Independent Publisher of the Year at the [[British Book Awards]], 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bradtguides.com/about-bradt "Bradt Travel Guides: About Bradt"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Hilary Bradt was awarded an [[MBE]] for services to the Tourist Industry and to Charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=58729 |date=14 June 2008 |page=14 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bretherick 3 to 7 eds.jpg|thumb|right|300px|2nd to 7th editions]]
'''Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards''' is a well-established source of information on [[chemical safety]], often known by its author’s name, and often cited in the chemical and [[chemical engineering]] literature. In recent editions it has been in two volumes, volume 1 being individual compounds and hazardous reactions, volume 2 being groups and other information relevant to reactive chemical hazards, arranged by topic.

==History==
In 1964, research chemist [[Leslie Bretherick]] read of a violent explosion in a laboratory, and knew that the same journal had reported a similar incident with the same chemicals 16 years earlier.&lt;ref name=Bretherick1964&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bretherick | first1=Leslie | title=Chromium Trioxide Oxidation Risks | journal=[[Chemistry &amp; Industry]] | year=1964 | page=1196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realising that there was no central source of literature on dangerous chemical reactions, he set out to create one, combing through the literature in his spare time.  In 1971 his employers ([[BP]]) allowed him to do this in half his work time&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite journal 
 | last1=Barker | first1=P.E. | last2=Bretherick | first2=L. | last3=Kay | first3=F.A.A. | journal=[[J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.]] | year=1993 | volume=33 | issue=2 | page=184-192 | title=Problems and Solutions in the Development of Hard and Soft Versions of a Chemical Reaction Hazards Database | doi=10.1021/ci00012a001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book was published in 1975 entitled ''Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards''.&lt;ref name=Preface1&gt;Bretherick, L., (1975) Preface to ''Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards'' Butterworths (London)&lt;/ref&gt;  The work involved creating what was effectively a database on paper of substances and literature references, arranged by empirical formula, and converting this into a book.
This was well received as “an invaluable reference work” &lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, A.F., (1976) ''Journal of Occupational Accidents'', 195-6&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer wrote ““Bretherick” (the name under which this book must surely become known)”.&lt;ref name=Cumberland&gt;Cumberland, R. F., (1975) ''Journal of Hazardous Materials'', Vol.1(3), 269&lt;/ref&gt;  A revised second edition followed in 1979, with a reviewer stating “that “Bretherick” is an essential first reference”&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;Thomson, B. J.. (1979) ''Journal of Occupational Accidents'', 2 255&lt;/ref&gt; As well as corrections and additional reactions, this contained a new section dealing with groups of compounds and some other matters.
A third edition followed in 1985, Bretherick having retired in 1982 in order to work full-time on the project.&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;&lt;ref name=third&gt;Preface to the Third Edition, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
In the preface to the 4th edition (1989) he announced that his eyesight was failing.&lt;ref name=Fourth&gt;Preface to the Fourth Edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, he did not contribute new material to further editions, which was done by others. The 5th edition (1995) was edited by Peter G. Urben and as the book was larger, was split into two volumes.  
Leslie Bretherick died in April 2003&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Jay | last1=Young | year=2003 | journal=Chemical Health and Safety | volume=10 | issue=4 | page=46 | title=Obituary | doi=10.1016/S1074-9098(03)00066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 6th edition (1999), the 7th edition (2007) and the 8th edition (2017) were also edited by Urben.

==Electronic Versions==
[[File:Bretherick database versions 1.0 2.0.jpg|thumb|right|Database 1.0 and 2.0]]
A version of the 4th edition was also made available on [[floppy disk]]s in the form of a database, allowing searches for hazard by class or topic and also partial name.&lt;ref name=Whitbeck&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Whitbeck | first1=Michael | year=1992 | journal=[[J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.]] | volume=32 | issue=4 | page=395 | title=Bretherick's Reactive Chemical Hazards Database. Version 1.00 | doi=10.1021/ci00008a605}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent editions were supported by an equivalent on CD-ROM.&lt;ref name=Langerman&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Neal | last1=Langerman | year=2000 | journal=Chemical Health and Safety | volume=7 | issue=2 | page=53 | title=Bretherick’s “Reactive Chemical Hazards Database, Version 3.0” | doi=10.1016/S1074-9098(00)00086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The difficulties of converting the book into a database have been described.&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;

The '''Broel Museum''' (Broelmuseum) was an [[art museum]], focusing on classical and applied arts of the 18th - 19th century. It's located on the [[Buda (Kortrijk)|Buda Island]] in [[Courtray]], [[Belgium]].  The building is a converted 18th-century [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] mansion, located at 6 Broelkaai. Since the end of 2014, the museum has closed its doors. Under the name of 'Broelkaai 6', the location is being turned into a platform for visual arts, and is scheduled to reopen in 2018.

==Exhibits==
The main focus of the museum is artists from the area, or who are currently living in Kortijk, including; [[Roelant Savery]], [[Karel van Mander]], [[Kerstiaen De Keuninck]], [[Louis Pierre Verwee]], [[Évariste Carpentier]], [[Louis Robbe]], [[Edward Woutermaertens]], [[Joos Vincent de Vos]] with a prominence of art from the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kortrijk.be/broelmuseum |title=Broelmuseum &amp;#124; Stad Kortrijk |publisher=Kortrijk.be |date= |accessdate=2011-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120144813/http://www.kortrijk.be/broelmuseum |archivedate=2011-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cigarette cards''' are [[trade cards]] issued by [[tobacco]] manufacturers to stiffen cigarette packaging and [[tobacco advertising|advertise cigarette brands]].

==History==
Beginning in 1875, cards depicting actresses, [[baseball]] players, [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] chiefs, and [[boxing|boxers]] were issued by the U.S.-based [[Allen and Ginter]] tobacco company. These are considered to be some of the first cigarette cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw |first=James A. |url=http://www.wclynx.com/burntofferings/adsallen_and_ginter.html |title=Allen &amp; Ginter's champions |accessdate=2006-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405192229/http://www.wclynx.com/burntofferings/adsallen_and_ginter.html |archivedate=2006-04-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tobacco companies such as [[Goodwin &amp; Co.]] soon followed suit.  They first emerged in the U.S., then the UK, then, eventually, in many other countries.

In the UK, [[W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills]] in 1887 were one of the first companies to include advertising cards with their cigarettes, but it was [[John Player &amp; Sons]] in 1893 that produced one of the first general interest sets 'Castles and Abbeys'. Thomas Ogden soon followed in 1894 and in 1895, Wills produced their first set 'Ships and Sailors', followed by 'Cricketers' in 1896. In 1906, Ogden's produced a set of football cards depicting footballers in their club colours, in one of the first full-colour sets.

Each set of cards typically consisted of 25 or 50 related subjects, but series of over 100 cards per issue are known. Popular themes were 'beauties' (famous actresses, film stars and models), sporters (in the U.S. mainly baseball, in the rest of the world mainly football and cricket), nature, military heroes and uniforms, heraldry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Heraldic_tobacco_cards Heraldic cigarette and tobacco cards]&lt;/ref&gt; and city views.

Today, for example, sports and military historians study these cards for details on uniform design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/hockey/024002-2001-e.html?PHPSESSID=rq9jcm5ucr4uim576lt6808ik4 Backcheck: A Hockey Retrospective] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001083136/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/hockey/024002-2001-e.html?PHPSESSID=rq9jcm5ucr4uim576lt6808ik4 |date=2007-10-01 }} at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Some very early cigarette cards were printed on [[silk]] which was then attached to a paper backing. They were discontinued in order to save paper during [[World War II]], and never fully reintroduced thereafter.

===World record price===
Early in 2007, a world record price was paid in America for a single card &amp;ndash; [[United States dollar|$]]2,350,000. This card was resold later in the year for another world record price, $2,800,000. The card in question featured [[Honus Wagner]], one of the great names in U.S. baseball at the turn of the 20th century. Wagner was a dedicated non-smoker and objected when America's biggest tobacco corporation planned to picture him on a cigarette card without his permission. Threats of legal action prevented its release, but a few slipped out, and it was one of these that stunned the collecting world when it was auctioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://londoncigarettecard.co.uk Cigarette Card History] World Record - London Cigarette Card Company&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cigarette cards==

[[File:Taddy Clown.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An original Taddy's Clowns and Circus Artistes Card]]
Another notable and sought-after set of cards is the untitled series issued by [[Taddy]] and known by collectors as "Clowns and Circus Artistes".  While not the rarest cards in existence (there are a number of series in which only one known example remains), they are still very rare and command high prices whenever they come up for auction.

The Mecca cigarette trading card for [[George H. Sutton|George Sutton]] is also notable for it depicts him with hands. Sutton was known as "the handless billiard player"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sutton plays fine billiards; Handless Player's Remarkable Work Against Expert Thomas Gallagher. New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1903/03/17/archives/sutton-plays-fine-billiards-handless-players-remarkable-work.html | work=The New York Times | date=1903-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for mastering the game with such a handicap.

==Classification and Cataloguing==

The system devised to codify 19th Century American tobacco issues has its origin in the 'American Card Catalog' (ACC), written by Jefferson Burdick. Burdick listed the American Tobacco Cards in one section, broken down by companies that issued the card series and by the types of cards. The 19th Century issues were prefixed with 'N' (N1-N694) and the 20th with 'T'. (T1-T235).&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, R and Mitchell, T, (1999) 'American Tobacco Cards: Price Guide and Checklist', Virginia: Tuff Stuff Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===The World Tobacco Index (WTI)===
The World Tobacco Index (WTI), published by the Cartophilic Society of Great Britain (CSGB),&lt;ref&gt;The Cartophilic Society of Great Britain (2000) 'The (New) World Tobacco Issues Index: Part 1', London: The Cartophilic Society of Gt. Britain Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; lists all known tobacco issues from around the world and is still being updated today on reports of new finds. Using a similar alphanumeric system, it assigns a code based on the name of manufacturer, rather than the century in which the cards were issued. For example, Burdick's N2 'Celebrated American Indian Chiefs' by Allen &amp; Ginter is listed as A400-030 (a), with the larger N42 series listed as A400-030 (b).

===LCCC - Cigarette Card Catalogue===
The catalogue contains details of cigarette cards and silks issued at home and abroad from the 19th century to the present day, quoting up-to-date values for cards in top condition. The original price guide now in its 84th year of publication. The catalogue has reference numbers to cross reference with the British Tobacco Issues Handbook, Ogdens, G Phillips and Wills reference books giving information for British Tobacco series which will be a great help to collectors to identify cards especially unnumbered or untitled series. More info : [http://www.londoncigcard.co.uk/catalogues.php Cigarette Card Catalogue]

===LCCC - Trade Card Catalogue===
The catalogue gives an up-to-date price guide for odd cards, sets and special albums. First published in 1974, this catalogue is devoted entirely to non-tobacco cards plus a section, which details over 350 reprinted series. The catalogue covers a magnificent selection of well over 6,000 series by non-tobacco firms, such as Brooke Bond Tea, Bassett, A &amp; BC Gum, Topps, as well as the newer companies like Rittenhouse, Inkworks, Golden Era, Rockwell, Hunter etc. Cards from the early 1900s by Fry and Cadbury right up to the latest series of Harry Potter, Star Wars TV &amp; Films, Cricket, Footballers, Military, Motoring etc. More info : [http://www.londoncigcard.co.uk/catalogues.php Trade Card Catalogue]

As well as the series title and manufacturer, cards may also exhibit different back varieties to advertise the different brands of cigarette produced by a firm. For example, the English manufacturer Edwards, Ringer and Bigg's 1917 'War Map of the Western Front' was issued with both 'Exmoor Hunt' and 'New York Mixture' tobacco advertised on the backs. Whilst this was commonplace, the number of varieties varies greatly between manufacturers; F. &amp; J. Smith's 1913 series entitled 'Battlefields of Great Britain' for example has 15 different backs.

==Resurgence==
[[Doral (cigarette)|Doral]], an [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] brand, started printing cigarette cards in the year 2000. These were the first cigarette cards from a major manufacturer since the 1940s.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_3_42/ai_69277563 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050719081434/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_3_42/ai_69277563 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2005-07-19 |title = Doral Revives Collector Cards with Purchase |work =  |publisher = [[Brandweek]] |date = 2001-01-15 |accessdate = 2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the small company Carreras in the UK issued cigarette cards with Turf brand cigarettes for a short period in the 1950s and 1960s, Black Cat brand in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franklyncards.com/one/cighist.htm Franklyn Cards: A brief history of cigarette cards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322211542/http://www.franklyncards.com/one/cighist.htm |date=March 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catalogues, for example: Murray Cards (International). Catalogue of Cigarette &amp; Other Trade Cards. 3.ed. (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, card-like coupons with special offers have often been included in cigarette packets over the years.

The first set of "Doral Celebrate America" cards featured the 50 states in two releases, 2000 and 2001. Later themes include American [[festivals]], [[Automobile|cars]], [[national parks]], and 20th century events.

[[Natural American Spirit]], another [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] brand, also includes cigarette cards on their packs, with information on such things as windpower, diversity, and their farmers.

Philip Morris USA started including "Information For Smokers" cigarette cards in certain packs. One provides information on quitting smoking and the other states that "Light, "Ultra Light", "Mild", "Medium", and "Low Tar" cigarettes are just as harmful as "Full Flavor" ones.

==Legacy==
The largest cigarette card collection on record is that of [[Edward Wharton-Tigar]]. His collection, bequeathed to the British Museum following his death in 1995, is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the largest collection of its kind. His autobiography, "Burning Bright", details both his obsession with collecting cigarette cards, as well as his business life, which included becoming President of Selection Trust &amp;ndash; at the time, one of the largest mining companies in the world &amp;ndash; as well as his lifelong passion for cricket, which culminated in his presidency of Kent Cricket Club. When asked what others thought of his collecting he said the following:

'If to collect cigarette cards is a sign of eccentricity, how then will posterity judge one who amassed the biggest collection in the world? Frankly, I care not'.&lt;ref&gt;Wharton-Tigar, E. (1987) 'Burning Bright: The Autobiography of Edward Wharton-Tigar' London: Metal Bulletin Books, p.254&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the president of the Cartophilic Society of Great Britain until his death in 1995.

The '''Colonial Cottage Museum''' is an [[heritage register|heritage-listed]] former cottage and now museum at Bow Street, [[Merriwa, New South Wales|Merriwa]], [[Upper Hunter Shire]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It is also known as '''Merriwa Cottage''' and '''Cottage Museum'''. The property is owned by the Upper Hunter Shire Council and was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-259&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045354|Cottage Museum|hr=00259|fn=S90/05334 &amp; HC 32903|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The cottage was built between 1847 and 1856 as a private residence. The cottage was made from local sandstone quarried that was pushed down on timber slabs. The cottage served as a series of banking businesses until the 1950s when it became a private residence. The original building consisted of four rooms, a cellar area and a separate kitchen at the rear of the building, since removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mgnsw.org.au/organisations/merriwa-colonial-museum/|title=Merriwa Colonial Museum|work=Museums &amp; Galleries of NSW|date=n.d.|access-date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aumuseums.com/nsw/hunter/merriwa-colonial-museum-historical-society|title=Merriwa Colonial Museum &amp; Historical Society|work=Australian Museums and Galleries|date=n.d.|access-date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative psychology''' refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species from insects to primates.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papini, M.R. (2003). Comparative Psychology. In ''Handbook of Research Methods in Experimental Psychology''. Ed. Stephen F. Davis. Blackwell. Malden, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single [[organism]] to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both [[proximate and ultimate causation]].  &lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"&gt;Dewsbury, D. (1984). ''Comparative Psychology in the Twentieth Century''. Hutchinson Ross Publishing Company. Stroudsburg, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | year = 1963 | title = On aims and methods of ethology | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 410–33 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.

Third, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see [[Tinbergen's four questions]].

==History==
The 9th century scholar [[al-Jahiz]] wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants.&lt;ref name=Amber-376&gt;{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th century Arabic writer [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) wrote the ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', an early treatise dealing with the effects of [[zoomusicology|music on an imals]]. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or retarded with the use of [[Arabic music|music]], and shows other examples of how music can affect [[ethology|animal behavior]], experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the [[Western world]] continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Plott|2000|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of "pre-" and "post-Darwin" because his contributions were so influential.   theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the "anecdotal movement" led by [[George Romanes]] who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a "rudimentary human mind".&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt; Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"&gt;Dewsbury, D. (1978). ''Comparative Animal Behavior''. McGraw-Hill Book Company. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. [[Douglas Alexander Spalding]] was called the "first experimental biologist",&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt; and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. [[Jacques Loeb]] emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, [[Sir John Lubbock]] is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]] is thought to be "the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word".&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt;

Throughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term "comparative psychology" is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.

A persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;  However, the definition of "intelligence" in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism, and focuses on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation are plagued with practical and theoretical problems.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt; In the literature, "intelligence" is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]).&lt;ref name="Wynne, C. D. L., 1978"&gt;Wynne, C. D. L. (1978). ''Animal Cognition: The Mental Lives of Animals''. Palgrave. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;

==Species studied==
[[Image:Cat brain.jpg|right|thumb|the brain of a cat]]
A wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike]] began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical [[rat]], which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.

Skinner introduced the use of [[pigeon]]s, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of [[primate]]; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by [[Harry F. Harlow]]'s studies of [[maternal deprivation]] in [[rhesus monkey]]s. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg, W.N. and L.A. Kellogg. (1933) ''The Ape and The Child: A Comparative Study of the Environmental Influence Upon Early Behavior''. Hafner Publishing Co., New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named [[Gua (chimpanzee)|Gua]] was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs' infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended 9 months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.

Nonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] 350 words in [[American Sign Language]]. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, [[Loulis (chimpanzee)|Loulis]]. A criticism of Washoe's acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated.&lt;ref&gt;Terrace (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage-Rumbaugh (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Klaus Zuberbühler |title=Linguistic capacity of non-human animals |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science |volume=6 |date=2015 |pages=313-321 |doi=10.1002/wcs.1338 
 |url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/8091/Zuberbuehler_2015_WIRCS_Linguistic_AM.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; All great apes have been reported to have the capacity of allospecific symbolic production.

Interest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be [[intelligence (trait)|intelligent]] have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of [[corvid]], parrots — especially the [[grey parrot]] — and [[dolphin]]s. Alex (Avian Learning EXperiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg,&lt;ref&gt;Pepperberg, I. M. 1991 A communicative approach to animal cognition: a study of conceptual abilities of a grey parrot. In: ''Cognitive Ethology: the Minds of Other Animals'' (Ed. Carolyn A. Ristau), Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale New Jersey; Hove and London England.&lt;/ref&gt; who found that the African gray parrot [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]] did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a  level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John W. Pilley |author2=Alliston K. Reid |title=Border collie comprehends object names as verbal referents |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=86 |date=2011 |pages=184–195 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2010.11.007 
 |url=http://webs.wofford.edu/reidak/Pubs/Pilley%20and%20Reid%202011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a [[Border Collie]] named [[Chaser (dog)|Chaser]] was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.

==Animal cognition==
{{main|Animal cognition}}
Researchers who study [[animal cognition]] are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans.  For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and [[animal cognition]] are heavily overlapping research categories.&lt;ref  name="Menzel"&gt;p. 2, Menzel, R. &amp; Fischer, J. (2010) ''Animal Thinking: Contemporary Issues in Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;Wasserman &amp; Zentall (eds) (2006); ''Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, Sara J. (2010); ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior (2nd Ed)'', Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders of animal behavior==
{{Further|Animal psychopathology}}
Veterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Common causes of disordered behavior in captive or [[pet]] animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation. These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases. For example, [[rat]]s who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human [[psychosis]], like biting their owners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the [[dog breed|breed]] as well as on the individual animal's character. For example, [[huskies]] have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian|url=http://www.preloved.co.uk/blog/permalink/17/interview-siberian-husky-club-of-great-britain.html|title=Interview - Siberian Husky Club of Great Britain|publisher=''Preloved''|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dass|first=Dr. Amrita|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081023/jsp/careergraph/story_10004432.jsp|title=Pet Peeves|publisher=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|''The Telegraph'' (Calcutta)]]|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on [[ethological]] studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Human-animal relationships==
{{Main|Anthrozoology}}

The relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society's understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. [[Domestication]] has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, Molly. "Animals and Anthropology." Society and Animals: ''Journal of Human-Animal Studies''. 2002. Web. &lt;http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/sa/sa10.4/mullin.shtml&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ingold &lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Ted, ed. ''What Is an Animal?'' Routledge, 1994. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as "not people," and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: "Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals."  With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who isn't, that is, the outsider.

''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals,&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, Daniel. "Health; Children and Their Pets: Unexpected Psychological Benefits." The ''New York Times''. 1990. Web. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/us/health-children-and-their-pets-unexpected-psychological-benefits.html?src=pm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically of children with their pets. It's been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids' social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, "It made the children more cooperative and sharing." It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.

Furthermore, in an edition of ''Social Science and Medicine'' it was stated, "A random survey of 339 residents from [[Perth, Western Australia]] were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Lisa, Billie Giles-Corti, and Max Bulsara. "The Pet Connection: Pets as a Conduit for Social Capital?" ''Social Science and Medicine'' 61. 2005. 1159–73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.

[[Esperanto]] and [[Novial]] are two different [[constructed language|constructed]] [[international auxiliary languages]]. Their main difference is that while Esperanto is a schematic language, with an invarying grammar, Novial is a naturalistic language, whose grammar and vocabulary varies to try to retain a "natural" sound. Demographically, Esperanto has thousands of times more speakers than Novial.

==Alphabet and pronunciation==
Both Esperanto and Novial are written using versions of the [[Latin alphabet]]. The Esperanto alphabet has 28 letters: 22 without [[diacritic]]s and 6 with diacritics unique to Esperanto: ''ĉ'', ''ĝ'', ''ĥ'', ''ĵ'', ''ŝ'' and ''ŭ''. Novial uses the standard 26 letters of the Latin alphabet with no diacritics.

In Esperanto one letter corresponds to one [[phoneme]] and one phoneme to one letter: there are no digraphs. Novial has 3 [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: ''ch'', ''sh'' and ''qu''; ''c'' and ''q'' are unique to these digraphs (except in foreign proper nouns) and permit no ambiguity; when ''s'' and ''h'' are separate phonemes this is indicated by separating with a hyphen: ''s-h''.  Novial permits some 2-vowel combinations to be pronounced either as 2 separate [[vowel]]s or as [[diphthong]]s; for example, ''au'', ''eu'' and ''oi'' may be pronounced as ''a + w'', ''e + w'' and ''o + y'', respectively, and ''ie'', ''io'' and ''ia'' as ''y + e'', ''y + o'' and ''y + a'', respectively.

In handwriting neither Esperanto nor Novial presents any problem. However, the diacritics of Esperanto require special methods for typing and printing. The original method was a set of digraphs now known as the "h-system", but with the rise of computer word processing a so-called "x-system" has become equally popular. These systems are described in the article [[Esperanto orthography]]. However, with the advent of [[Unicode]], the need for such work-arounds has lessened.

==Personal pronouns==

The [[personal pronoun]]s of Esperanto all end in ''i'' and some may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment (especially ''mi'' and ''ni''). The personal pronouns of Novial use various vowels making them more distinct, although some differ only in the initial consonant (e.g. ''nus'', ''vus'' and ''lus''). A later form of ''nus'' – ''nos'', more distinct from ''vus'' – has sometimes been used. Novial does not distinguish familiar and polite forms of “you” (e.g. French ''tu'' and ''vous''). Novial’s inventor argued that such a distinction has no place in a language intended solely for international use. The distinction is available in Esperanto {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} but is little used in practice.

&lt;div style="font-size: 85%;"&gt;¹ ''ci'' and ''thou'', while technically the familiar form of the word "you" in Esperanto and English, respectively, are almost never used. Results on Google have shown that ''ci''  is used less than half of one percent of the amount ''vi'' is in Esperanto. Zamenhof himself did not include the pronoun in the first book on Esperanto and only later reluctantly; later he recommended against using ''ci'' on the grounds that different cultures have conflicting traditions regarding the use of the familiar and formal forms of "you", and that a universal language should avoid the problem by simply using the formal form in all situations. Novial uses only ''vu'' as the singular "you".

² ''tiu'', "that person", is usually used in this circumstance, because many people find it unnatural to use "it" referring to humans.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from Ĝiism and Giism, Hiism and Riism as proposed reforms replace "Fundamento"-pronouns (''ri'' instead of "li, ŝi, ĝi"; or "li" as [[utrum]] and ''hi'' instead of [[Fundamento de Esperanto|Fundamento]] "li"). Other proposals are variations of those four.
&lt;/div&gt;

The Novial system displays a systematic correspondence between singular and corresponding plural forms (i.e. ''vu'', ''vus''; ''lo'', ''los''; ''la'', ''las''; ''lu'', ''lus''; ''le'', ''les''). Strictly speaking "we" is not the plural of "I", because "many I’s" is nonsensical. Jespersen suggested that ''nu'', the singular of ''nus'', could be used as a "royal we". The optional marking of sex in Novial, especially in the third person plural, permits greater flexibility than in Esperanto, at least in this case. Exactly the same system is applied to other pronouns and to nouns with natural sex differences.

==Marking gender==

The system of [[Esperanto vocabulary#Gender|sex marking for Esperanto nouns]] is frequently criticised for being asymmetric and male biased. In contrast Novial has one symmetric, unbiased system for both nouns and pronouns which marks either male, female, [[epicene]] or inanimate.

==Verbal systems==

The grammars of Novial and Esperanto differ greatly in the way that the various [[grammatical tense|tense]]s, [[grammatical mood|mood]]s and [[grammatical voice|voice]]s of [[verb]]s are expressed. Both use a combination of [[auxiliary verb]]s and verb endings. However, Novial uses many more auxiliary verbs and few endings, while Esperanto uses only one auxiliary verb and a greater number of verb endings.

In Novial all verb forms are independent of person (1st, 2nd or 3rd persons) and number (singular or plural). In Esperanto verb forms are independent of the person but compound tenses, with [[participle]]s, require the participle (which is an adjective) to agree with the subject of the verb in number (singular or plural). 

The [[continuous tense]]s are less common in both Esperanto and Novial than in English.

In the following table endings are separated from stems by hyphens. Alternative forms with the same meaning are in brackets. In the Esperanto forms (j) indicates agreement when the subject of the verb is plural.

===Passive voice===

The difference between the '''passive of becoming''' and the '''passive of being''' is not always immediately obvious to English speakers because their forms can often be the same. However, in English the passive of becoming is often expressed with the verb ''get'' in the sense of ''become'' as well as with the verb ''be''. 

====Passive voice of becoming====

Esperanto uses an appropriate form of the [[auxiliary verb]] ''esti'' (''to be'') followed by a passive participle (present, past or future according to sense). With many verbs Esperanto may, instead of the passive voice, use the suffix ''-iĝ-'' to form an intransitive verb of becoming, which is conjugated in the active voice (see table below).

Novial uses the auxiliary verb ''bli'' (''to get, become, be'' from the equivalent auxiliary verb ''bli'' in Scandinavian languages) followed by the root form of the verb. The various tenses and moods are expressed regularly using the other auxiliary verbs ''ha'', ''had'', ''sal'', ''saled'' and ''vud'', the word order corresponding to the English.

====Passive voice of being====

The passive voice of being is generally expressed in English with an appropriate form of the verb ''to be'' followed by the past participle. It is formed in the same way in Esperanto and Novial. Note  that in contrast to the passive of becoming, in the Novial passive of being the auxiliary verb is followed by the past participle, which ends in ''-t''.

== Word formation ==
In Esperanto, most words are created from a set number of roots, endings, and affixes. This allows for a comparatively low number of words to be extended to a described vocabulary, resulting in easy learning. However, some{{Who|date=October 2011}} argue that results in heavy reliance on common affixes. For example, Esperanto notoriously{{Says who|date=October 2011}} relies heavily on the prefix ''mal-'' to form the opposite of an adjective or verb.  The equivalent prefix in Novial, ''des-'', is used to a much lesser degree.

==Language sample for comparison==
{{Wikibooks|Novial}}
{{Esperanto sidebar |expanded=Criticism}}
Here is [[the Lord's Prayer]] in both languages:

{|
|-
||'''Esperanto version:'''
:Patro nia, kiu estas en la ĉielo,
:Via nomo estu sanktigita.
:Venu Via regno,
:plenumiĝu Via volo,
:kiel en la ĉielo, tiel ankaŭ sur la tero.
:Nian panon ĉiutagan donu al ni hodiaŭ.
:Kaj pardonu al ni niajn ŝuldojn,
:kiel ankaŭ ni pardonas al niaj ŝuldantoj.
:Kaj ne konduku nin en tenton,
:sed liberigu nin de la malbono.
:Amen. 
||'''Novial version:'''
:Nusen Patre, kel es in siele,
:mey vun nome bli sanktifika,
:mey vun regno veni;
:mey on fa vun volio 
:kom in siele anke sur tere.
:Dona a nus disidi li omnidiali pane,
:e pardona a nus nusen ofensos,
:kom anke nus pardona a nusen ofensantes,
:e non dukte nus en tentatione,
:ma liberisa nus fro malu.  
:Amen.

This is a '''comparison of [[BitTorrent]] [[website|site]]s''' that includes most of the most popular sites. These sites typically contain multiple torrent files and an index of those files.

==Features==
*[[BitTorrent]] sites may operate a [[BitTorrent tracker]]. Operating a tracker should not be confused with hosting content.
*A directory allows users to browse the content available on a website based on various categories. A directory is also a site where users can find other websites.
*BitTorrent sites may either focus on certain content — such as [[etree]] that focuses on [[Concert|live concerts]]— or may have no particular focus, like [[The Pirate Bay]]. Some sites specialize as [[Web search engine|search engines]] of other BitTorrent sites.
*Most private trackers do not make the news and therefore this comparison but are listed on sites like [http://torrentinvites.org/trackerlist.php torrentinvites.org] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/trading-sellling-torrent-site-invites-public-service-or-outright-menace-131110/|title=torrent site invites}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As noted by lifehacker sites like [https://pre.corrupt-net.org corrupt-net.org] rank trackers by "pre time"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lifehacker.com/5683783/corrupt-net-shows-you-which-torrent-trackers-get-new-releases-first|title=which torrent trackers get new releases first}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Google downranking==
In October 2014, [[Google Search]] results were affected by anti-piracy algorithms, which includes downranking popular BitTorrent sites in search results. The algorithm works when Google users search for movie, music or software titles in combination with terms such as "download," "watch" and "torrent". Popular BitTorrent sites are demoted in the list; the traffic reduction depends on the site, but some sites experienced nearly a 50% reduction in visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://torrentfreak.com/googles-new-downranking-hits-pirate-sites-hard-141023/ Google's New Search Downranking Hits Torrent Sites Hard] October 23, 2014. Retrieved 5 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site comparison==
&lt;!-- A website needs at least to be ranked 500,000 or better --&gt;
The following table compares the features of some of the most popular BitTorrent websites; it is not comprehensive with regard to listing all of the popular BitTorrent trackers, especially private trackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/wiki/reading|title=reading - trackers|website=www.reddit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] global ranking is accurate as of December 4, 2017.

A [[railway]] or [[railroad]] is a [[Track (rail transport)|track]] where the vehicle travels over two [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[steel]] [[I-beam|bars]], called [[Rail profile|rails]]. The rails   support and guide the wheels of the vehicles, which are traditionally either [[train]]s or [[tram]]s. Modern [[light rail]] is a relatively new innovation which combines aspects of those two modes of transport. However fundamental differences in the track and wheel design are important, especially where trams or light railways and trains have to share a section of track, as sometimes happens in congested areas.

== Terminology ==
 [[File:Flanged wheel.jpg|thumb|300px|A flanged wheel on a train]]

Both trams and trains  have [[flange]]d iron [[wheel]]s with a horizontal section transferring the vehicle  weight to the rail and a vertical flange "inboard" to guide the vehicle along the rail using its inside edge.

==Difference in technique in curves==
[[Tram|Rail vehicle]] wheels are usually mounted on a solid [[axle]], so they turn at the same speed. When a vehicle turns the outer wheel has to travel further than the inner wheel. On a road vehicle, this is usually achieved by allowing the wheels to move independently, and fixing the front wheels in an arrangement known as [[Ackermann steering geometry]].

Trains and trams can turn corners without wheel-slip because the outer horizontal part of the wheels has a slightly [[Cone (geometry)|tapered]] [[Rim (wheel)#Railroad usage|rim]]. The guide [[flange]] (ridge) is on the inside to prevent the vehicle from slipping sideways off the rails. The horizontal (cone-shaped) rim makes contact with the slightly [[wiktionary:convex|convex]] top of a steel [[Rail profile|rail]] in different (horizontal) places so that the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel.

With both tram and train wheels, this happens naturally because the tires are cone shaped sloping surfaces: the inside diameter is a few millimeters larger than the outside. As the track starts to curve, the train tries to run straight. The wheel flange presses against the side of the curved rail so the "contact point" between rail and wheel moves a few [[millimeter]]s outwards, making the effective diameter of the outer wheel temporarily larger, and equally opposite: the effective diameter of the inner wheel effectively becomes temporarily smaller. This technique works well on large-radius curves which are [[cant (road/rail)|canted]], but not as well on tight curves and railway [[Railroad switch|switches]] (also known as "points"). This is because the [[Track geometry|geometry]] or cant of the track is more difficult to optimize for every possible combination of vehicle and direction of travel.

City trams often use tight curves - sometimes with a [[Minimum railway curve radius|radius]] of much less than about {{convert|20|m|1}}, and canting may be impossible because the surface is shared with road vehicles or [[pedestrian zones]] or [[sidewalk]]s, so the track often has to be flush with the [[road surface]] or pavement. In sharp curves, the rail grooves are sometimes made very shallow&lt;!-- Yea right, who rolls those? --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}, which causes the outer wheel to temporarily ride up onto the edge of its flange. This increases the wheel diameter and the curve can be taken more easily. In extreme cases, the rail has a groove so that the rim of the flange can take most of the weight, the "out-board" tire (on the outer radius of the outer rail) acting as no more than a vertical plate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} &lt;!-- This sounds like nonsense --&gt;

In contrast, a train wheel is almost never designed to transfer weight through the flange rim, and some train wheels may be damaged if this should happen even once.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} &lt;!-- This sounds like nonsense --&gt;

== Track junctions ==
[[Image:Strijkregel in wissel.jpg|thumb|Right, the guard rail, which prevents the opposite wheel from [[Derailment|derailing]] on the [[Railroad turnout#Frog .28common crossing.29|frog]] common crossing at the left.]]

The point where two straight but intersecting railroads cross is called a [[Railroad turnout#Frog .28common crossing.29|frog]]. A groove through each rail allows the wheel flanges to pass through the intersecting rails. Without countermeasures each wheel would dip into the groove and strike the frog point gap causing unacceptable wear. The point where two tracks join and the vehicle can take one of two directions is called a [[railway switch]]. This works on the same principle, except that the inner rail is almost continuous and the outer rail has a gap for the flange to pass through.

With a train this problem is solved by using a wide tire. Train [[Rail profile|rails]] usually cross at a shallow [[angle]]. In the middle of the interchange there is a supporting frog. The tire is guided on each side by guide rails and some portion of the tire always maintains rail contact. This method is not feasible with trams and light railways.{{According to whom|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Tram tires are generally narrower than train tires. Trams use bigger crossing angles and tighter [[Minimum railway curve radius|curve radii]] are more likely than for train tracks. To cope with this difficulty the wheels of trams temporarily transfer the weight of the tram onto the flange to reduce wear on both the frog point and the horizontal surface of the tram wheels. Train wheels are not designed to bear such weight on their flanges.&lt;!-- That's all nonsense --&gt;{{According to whom|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

A tram wheel which runs on the flange rather than on the horizontal tyre has a larger effective diameter, so the distance travelled per revolution is greater. On the outside track of the curve this is an advantage. It may be necessary to compensate the inner wheel or allow for some slippage. Modern trams and trams tend to have thicker and wider tires which allow for a greater (horizontal) conical section and so greater effective diameter variation and turning ability.

== Interoperability problems ==
[[Image:TreinTramwielprofiel.svg|thumb|200px|Difference in form and profile of the wheel and the rail of a train (left, blue) and a tram (right, green).]]
At the [[Junction (rail)|junctions]] of [[Track (rail transport)|train tracks]], the gap in the frog or switch rail is wide. &lt;!-- and deep.  Because train wheels are larger and wider and the flanges do not have to carry vertical loads, they can be designed to cope with gaps in the rail which might defeat the smaller tram-wheels.  this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;  So [[tram]]s can be accommodated.
&lt;!-- Since tram flanges are generally unable to carry the weight of the vehicle, a tram with traditional wheels cannot drive on train rails without "falling into the gap" designed for the flanges of train cars on the crossing line. Modern [[light rail]], [[tram]], or [[tram-train]] equipment, using tram rails in city centers, and on interurban sections of train railroads now have interoperable flanges combined with wide tires. {{Clarify|date=May 2014}}--&gt;
&lt;!--what is an interoperable flange? this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;

The main problem with a train on tram rails is the relatively narrow width of frog and switch gaps and [[Groove (engineering)|channels]] of the [[groove rail]]s designed to accommodate the narrow flanges of tram wheels &lt;!-- on the crossing line --&gt;. The wider flanges of train wheels increase the risk of derailment at these points. On routes where train carriages are driven on tram tracks (as in the past in parts of [[Trams in The Hague|The Hague]]), wider &lt;!-- and deeper --&gt; grooves  are required as a compromise that is practical as wide grooved [[girder rail]] is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirthrail.com/en/product_girder.htm Wirth Girder Rail]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skelton-metals.com/railsections_eurogirderguardrail.htm Grooved or girder rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231441/http://www.skelton-metals.com/railsections_eurogirderguardrail.htm |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantictrack.com/international/espanol/pdf/MRT_Brochure.pdf MRT Track &amp; Services Co., Inc / Krupp, T and girder rails, scroll down.]&lt;/ref&gt; A larger [[structure gauge]] would also be required &lt;!-- , requiring greater care and lower speeds for both types of vehicle.  this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;  This was also done in [[Pacific Electric|Los Angeles]] and in [[British Columbia Electric Railway|Vancouver]] as well as elsewhere in North America. The usually or normally limited structure gauge, and [[Minimum railway curve radius|tight curves]], on tram tracks will also prevent [[train]]s from using tram tracks.

In North America the groove would have to be a minimum of {{convert|2+1/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wide and by extension, the maximum distance between the inside faces of the guard flanges of the grooved rails can be no more than {{convert|52+1/4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}, see below.

 Design tolerances
 Design tolerances that affect the lateral displacement of the body include the following:	
1. Lateral tolerance between wheels and rails	
Two types of flanges are permitted on railroad wheels - narrow and wide. The maximum
lateral movement T1 possible for a new wheel set centered on in-gage track is a function of
the flange type and is determined by the following formula:	
CAUTION: Use only English Units in Formulas in this Recommended Practice	

 T1 = .5[gt-(gw+2fn)]
 = .59375” ({{convert|0.59375|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}})  for narrow-flange wheels
 = .375" ({{convert|0.375|in|mm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for wide-flange wheels	

Where: gt = standard track gage at a point “5/8” ({{convert|5/8|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) below top of rail = 56.5" ({{convert|56.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}})
 
gw = minimum gage of wheel set between backs of flanges = 53” ({{convert|53|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}})
 
fn = minimum thickness of new wheel flange = 1.15625” ({{convert|1.15625|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for narrow flange or = 1.375" ({{convert|1.375|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for wide flange

==Mixed vehicle rail design &lt;!-- Nonsense --&gt;==
{{main|Tram-train|Interurban}}
[[File:VancouverTram.jpg|thumb|The [[British Columbia Electric Railway|ex BR Rail #1207]], of the [[Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway|VDHR]], [[Street running|ran on streets]] as well as on main lines. Its [[Janney coupler]] swings nearly 180°]]
Rural and suburban lines can be made compatible for use by several types of vehicles. For example, the [[narrow gauge railway]] used by [[Charleroi Metro]] in [[Belgium]] is ridden by trams, but the tracks are built to train track standards.&lt;!-- which does not permit the vertical load to be borne by the flange --&gt;&lt;!-- Nonsense --&gt; Trams nonetheless run smoothly on the old [[Vicinal tramway|NMVB]] tram net in [[Anderlues]], where shallow groove rails are used{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}. Between The Hague and [[Rotterdam]], an old railway line was converted for [[RandstadRail]] into a route able to carry both the [[Rotterdam Metro]], which uses vehicles built to train standards as well as [[Trams in The Hague|The Hague trams]] which uses vehicles built to tram standards. The [[Electroliner]]s which ran out of [[Chicago]] on the [[Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad]], and afterwards on the [[Norristown High Speed Line]], were another example.

The '''''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''''' ('''DSM''') is published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) and offers a common language and standard criteria for the [[classification of mental disorders]]. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, [[psychiatric drug]] regulation agencies, [[health insurance]] companies, [[pharmaceutical companies]], the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the [[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders]], produced by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]].&lt;ref&gt;The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: ''"Blue Book"'' ([http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines]) und "Green Book" ([http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf Diagnostic criteria for research])&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM is now in its fifth edition, the [[DSM-5]], published on May 18, 2013. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and [[psychiatric hospital]] statistics, and from a [[United States Army]] manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have  incrementally added to the total number of [[mental disorders]], although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.

The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) is the other common manual for mental disorders. It is distinguished from the DSM in  it covers health as a whole. While the DSM is the most popular diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US, the ICD is used more in Europe and other parts of the world, giving it a far larger reach than the DSM. The [[DSM-IV-TR codes|DSM-IV-TR]] (4th. ed.) contains specific codes allowing comparisons between the DSM and the ICD manuals, which may not systematically match because revisions are not simultaneously coordinated.&lt;ref&gt;In Appendix G: "ICD-9-CM Codes for Selected General Medical Conditions and Medication-Induced Disorders"&lt;/ref&gt; Though recent editions of the DSM and ICD have become similar due to collaborative agreements, each one contains information absent from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Psychological Association | year = 2009 | title = ICD VS. DSM | url = http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/10/icd-dsm.aspx | journal = Monitor on Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = 9| page = 63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the DSM received praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria, it also generated [[Criticism of the DSM-IV|controversy and criticism]]. Critics, including the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], argue the DSM represents an unscientific and subjective system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Christopher|title=The NIMH Withdraws Support for DSM-5|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201305/the-nimh-withdraws-support-dsm-5|publisher=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are ongoing issues concerning the [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial [[symptom]]s; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from "[[Normality (behavior)|normality]]"; possible [[cultural bias]]; and [[medicalization]] of human distress.&lt;ref name=frana&gt;{{cite web |url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1688399 |title=The New Crisis in Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis |author=[[Allen Frances]]  |date=17 May 2013 |work=Annals of Internal Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="concept&amp;evolution"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dalal PK, Sivakumar T | year = 2009 | title = Moving towards ICD-11 and DSM-5: Concept and evolution of psychiatric classification | url = http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2009/51/4/310/58302 | journal = Indian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 310–319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/160/1/4 | pmid = 12505793  | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.1.4 | volume=160 | issue=1 |date=January 2003 | pages=4–12 | title = Distinguishing Between the Validity and Utility of Psychiatric Diagnoses | last1 = Kendell | first1 = R. | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | last2 = Jablensky | first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17329740  | doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.024026 | volume=190 |date=March 2007 | pages=210–6 | title = Diagnostic stability of psychiatric disorders in clinical practice | last1 = Baca-Garcia | first1 = E. | last2 = Perez-Rodriguez | first2 = M.

==Uses and definition==
Many mental health professionals use the manual to determine and help communicate a patient's diagnosis after an evaluation; hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies in the US also often require a DSM diagnosis for all patients treated. The DSM can be used clinically in this way, and to categorize patients using diagnostic criteria for research purposes. Studies done on specific disorders often recruit patients whose symptoms match the criteria listed in the DSM for that disorder. An international survey of psychiatrists in sixty-six countries compared the use of the [[ICD-10]] and DSM-IV; it  found the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the latter was more valued for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mezzich|first=Juan E.|year=2002|title=International Surveys on the Use of ICD-10 and Related Diagnostic Systems|journal=Psychopathology|volume=35|issue=2–3|pages=72–75|publisher=|doi=10.1159/000065122|url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&amp;ArtikelNr=65122&amp;Ausgabe=228600&amp;ProduktNr=224276|format=guest editorial, abstract|accessdate=2008-09-02|pmid=12145487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
The initial impetus for developing a classification of mental disorders in the United States was the need to collect statistical information. The first official attempt was the [[United States census, 1840|1840 census]], which used a single category: "[[idiocy]]/[[insanity]]". Three years later, the [[American Statistical Association]] made an official protest to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], stating that "the most glaring and remarkable errors are found in the statements respecting [[nosology]], prevalence of insanity, blindness, deafness, and dumbness, among the people of this nation", pointing out that in many towns [[African-Americans]] were all marked as insane, and calling the statistics essentially useless.

The [[Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane]] was formed in 1844, changing its name in 1892 to the American Medico-Psychological Association, and in 1921 to the present American Psychiatric Association (APA).

Edward Jarvis and later [[Francis Amasa Walker]] helped expand the census, from two volumes in 1870 to twenty-five volumes in 1880. Frederick H. Wines was appointed to write a 582-page volume called ''Report on the Defective, Dependent, and Delinquent Classes of the Population of the United States, As Returned at the Tenth Census (June 1, 1880)'' (published 1888). Wines used seven categories of mental illness: [[dementia]], [[dipsomania]] (uncontrollable craving for alcohol), [[epilepsy]], [[mania]], [[melancholia]], [[monomania]] and [[paresis]]. These categories were also adopted by the Association.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/psych54000/a History of the DSM] Nathaniel Deyoung, Purdue University. Retrieved 9th Sept 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, together with the National Commission on [[Mental health|Mental Hygiene]] (now [[Mental Health America]]), the APA developed a new guide for mental hospitals called the ''Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane''. This included twenty-two diagnoses and would be revised several times by the APA over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/statisticalmanu00assogoog Statistical manual for the use of institutions for the insane (1918)] University of Michigan via Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[New York Academy of Medicine]], the APA also provided the psychiatric [[nomenclature]] subsection of the US general medical guide, the ''Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease'', referred to as the ''Standard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Greenberg | first1=S | last2=Shuman | first2=DW | last3=Meyer | first3=RG | title=Unmasking forensic diagnosis | journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry | volume=27 | issue=1 | pages=1–15 | year=2004 | pmid=15019764 | doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2004.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DSM-I (1952)===
[[World War II]] saw the large-scale involvement of US psychiatrists in the selection, processing, assessment, and treatment of soldiers. This moved the focus away from mental institutions and traditional clinical perspectives. A committee headed by psychiatrist [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[William C. Menninger]] developed a new classification scheme called Medical 203, that was issued in 1943 as a War Department Technical Bulletin under the auspices of the [[Office of the Surgeon General]].&lt;ref name="Houts2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Houts A.C. | year = 2000 | title = Fifty years of psychiatric nomenclature: Reflections on the 1943 War Department Technical Bulletin, Medical 203 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/72506618/abstract | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = 7| pages = 935–967 | doi = 10.1002/1097-4679(200007)56:7&lt;935::AID-JCLP11&gt;3.0.CO;2-8 | pmid = 10902952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreword to the DSM-I states the [[US Navy]] had itself made some minor revisions but "the Army established a much more sweeping revision, abandoning the basic outline of the Standard and attempting to express present day concepts of mental disturbance. This nomenclature eventually was adopted by all Armed Forces", and "assorted modifications of the Armed Forces nomenclature [were] introduced into many clinics and hospitals by psychiatrists returning from military duty." The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] also adopted a slightly modified version of Medical 203.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1949, the [[World Health Organization]] published the sixth revision of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases]] (ICD), which included a section on mental disorders for the first time. The foreword to DSM-1 states this "categorized mental disorders in rubrics similar to those of the Armed Forces nomenclature." An APA Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics was empowered to develop a version specifically for use in the United States, to standardize the diverse and confused usage of different documents. In 1950, the APA committee undertook a review and consultation. It circulated an adaptation of Medical 203, the VA system, and the Standard's Nomenclature to approximately 10% of APA members. 46% replied, of which 93% approved, and after some further revisions (resulting in its being called DSM-I), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was approved in 1951 and published in 1952. The structure and conceptual framework were the same as in Medical 203, and many passages of text were identical.&lt;ref name="Houts2000"/&gt; The manual was 130 pages long and listed 106 mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Grob, GN. (1991) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=2006685  Origins of DSM-I: a study in appearance and reality] ''Am J Psychiatry.'' April;148(4):421–31.&lt;/ref&gt; These included several categories of "personality disturbance", generally distinguished from "neurosis" (nervousness, [[egodystonic]]).&lt;ref name="Oldham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=John M.

In 1952, the APA listed homosexuality in the DSM as a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] personality disturbance. ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'', a large-scale 1962 study of homosexuality by [[Irving Bieber]] and other authors, was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was very influential in the medical profession.&lt;ref&gt;Edsall, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1956, however, the psychologist [[Evelyn Hooker]] performed a study comparing the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference.&lt;ref&gt;Edsall, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2016}} Her study stunned the medical community and made her a heroine to many gay men and lesbians,&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2016}} but homosexuality remained in the DSM until May 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=drBejRLWkHkC&amp;pg=PA76 |chapter=The Transformation of Mental Disorders in the 1980s: The DSM-III, Managed Care, and "Cosmetic Psychopharmacology" |page=76 |title=Medicating Children: ADHD and Pediatric Mental Health |first1=Rick |last1=Mayes |first2=Catherine |last2=Bagwell |first3=Jennifer L. |last3=Erkulwater |publisher=Harvard University Press |date= 2009 |accessdate=2013-12-03 |isbn=978-0-674-03163-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DSM-II (1968)===
In the 1960s, there were many challenges to the concept of [[mental illness]] itself. These challenges came from psychiatrists like [[Thomas Szasz]], who argued mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts; from sociologists such as [[Erving Goffman]], who said mental illness was another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; from [[behavioural psychologist]]s who challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; and from gay rights activists who criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. A study published in ''Science'' by [[Rosenhan experiment|Rosenhan]] received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Stuart A, Kirk &amp; Herb Kutchins 1994"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk&amp;kutchins.htm |title=The Myth of the Reliability of DSM |author1=Stuart A, Kirk |author2=Herb Kutchins |year=1994 |work=Journal of Mind and Behavior, 15(1&amp;2) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307115815/http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk%26kutchins.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the APA was closely involved in the next significant revision of the mental disorder section of the ICD (version 8 in 1968), it decided to go ahead with a revision of the DSM. It was published in 1968, listed 182 disorders, and was 134 pages long. It was quite similar to the DSM-I. The term "reaction" was dropped, but the term "[[neurosis]]" was retained. Both the DSM-I and the DSM-II reflected the predominant [[psychodynamic]] psychiatry,&lt;ref name = "Revolution"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1002/jhbs.20103|author1=Mayes, R.  |author2=Horwitz, AV.|year=2005|title=DSM-III and the revolution in the classification of mental illness|journal=J Hist Behav Sci|pmid= 15981242|volume=41|issue=3|pages=249–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they also included biological perspectives and concepts from [[Kraepelin]]'s system of classification. Symptoms were not specified in detail for specific disorders. Many were seen as reflections of broad underlying conflicts or maladaptive reactions to life problems, rooted in a distinction between neurosis and [[psychosis]] (roughly, anxiety/depression broadly in touch with reality, or [[hallucinations]]/[[delusions]] appearing disconnected from reality). Sociological and biological knowledge was incorporated, in a model that did not emphasize a clear boundary between normality and abnormality.&lt;ref name="Transformation"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = M. | date = March 1993 | title = DSM-III and the transformation of American psychiatry: a history | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?itool=abstractplus&amp;db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=abstractplus&amp;list_uids=8434655 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 150 | issue = 3| pages = 399–410 | pmid = 8434655 | doi=10.1176/ajp.150.3.399}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that personality disorders did not involve emotional distress was discarded.&lt;ref name=Oldham/&gt;

An influential 1974 paper by [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] and [[Joseph L. Fleiss]] demonstrated the second edition of the DSM (DSM-II) was an unreliable diagnostic tool.&lt;ref name=SpitzerFleiss1974&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Spitzer | first= Robert L. | last2= Fleiss | first2=Joseph L.| title= A re-analysis of the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis| journal= British Journal of Psychiatry| volume=125|pages= 341–347 |year = 1974 | doi= 10.1192/bjp.125.4.341 | pmid= 4425771 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found different practitioners using the DSM-II rarely agreed when diagnosing patients with similar problems. In reviewing previous studies of eighteen major diagnostic categories, Fleiss and Spitzer concluded "there are no diagnostic categories for which reliability is uniformly high. Reliability appears to be only satisfactory for three categories: mental deficiency, organic brain syndrome (but not its subtypes), and alcoholism. The level of reliability is no better than fair for psychosis and [[schizophrenia]] and is poor for the remaining categories".&lt;ref name="Kirk &amp; Kutchins"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kirk |first=Stuart A. |author2=Kutchins, Herb |year=1994 |title=The Myth of the Reliability of DSM |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=15 |issue=1&amp;2 |pages=71–86 |url=http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk&amp;kutchins.htm |accessdate=2008-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307115815/http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk%26kutchins.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sixth printing of the DSM-II, 1974====
As described by [[Ronald Bayer]], a psychiatrist and gay rights activist, specific protests by [[gay rights]] activists against the APA began in 1970, when the organization held its convention in [[San Francisco]]. The activists disrupted the conference by interrupting speakers and shouting down and ridiculing psychiatrists who viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 1971, gay rights activist [[Frank Kameny]] worked with the [[Gay Liberation Front]] collective to demonstrate against the APA's convention. At the 1971 conference, Kameny grabbed the microphone and yelled: "Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Bayer ''Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis'' (1981) Princeton University Press p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

This activism occurred in the context of a broader [[anti-psychiatry]] movement that had come to the fore in the 1960s and was challenging the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis. Anti-psychiatry activists protested at the same APA conventions, with some shared slogans and intellectual foundations.&lt;ref&gt;McCommon, B.

Presented with data from researchers such as [[Alfred Kinsey]] and [[Evelyn Hooker]], the sixth printing of the DSM-II, in 1974, no longer listed homosexuality as a category of disorder. After a vote by the APA trustees in 1973, and confirmed by the wider APA membership in 1974, the diagnosis was replaced with the category of "sexual orientation disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spitzer | first1 = R.L. | year = 1981 | title = The diagnostic status of homosexuality in DSM-III: a reformulation of the issues | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/2/210 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 138 | issue = 2| pages = 210–215 | pmid = 7457641 | doi=10.1176/ajp.138.2.210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DSM-III (1980)===
In 1974, the decision to create a new revision of the DSM was made, and [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] was selected as chairman of the task force. The initial impetus was to make the DSM nomenclature consistent with the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD), published by the [[World Health Organization]]. The revision took on a far wider mandate under the influence and control of Spitzer and his chosen committee members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Speigel |first=Alix |url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050103fa_fact?050103fa_fact |title=The Dictionary of Disorder: How one man revolutionized psychiatry |date=3 January 2005 |website=The New Yorker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212180933/http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050103fa_fact?050103fa_fact |archive-date=12 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One goal was to improve the uniformity and validity of psychiatric diagnosis in the wake of a number of critiques, including the famous [[Rosenhan experiment]]. There was also a need to standardize diagnostic practices within the US and with other countries after research showed psychiatric diagnoses differed between Europe and the US.&lt;ref name="PMID5774702"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/125/10S/30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100824224731/http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/125/10S/30 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-08-24 | pmid = 5774702 | issue = 10 Suppl | date = April 1969 | pages = 21–9 | last1 = Cooper | first1 = JE | last2 = Kendell | first2 = RE | last3 = Gurland | first3 = BJ | last4 = Sartorius | first4 = N | last5 = Farkas | first5 = T | title = Cross-national study of diagnosis of the mental disorders: some results from the first comparative investigation | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | doi = 10.1176/ajp.125.10s.21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of these criteria was an attempt to facilitate the pharmaceutical regulatory process.

The criteria adopted for many of the mental disorders were taken from the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] (RDC) and [[Feighner Criteria]], which had just been developed by a group of research-orientated psychiatrists based primarily at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and the [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]]. Other criteria, and potential new categories of disorder, were established by consensus during meetings of the committee, as chaired by Spitzer. A key aim was to base categorization on colloquial English descriptive language (which would be easier to use by federal administrative offices), rather than assumptions of cause, although its categorical approach assumed each particular pattern of symptoms in a category reflected a particular underlying pathology (an approach described as "[[Emil Kraepelin|neo-Kraepelinian]]"). The [[psychodynamic]] or [[physiologic]] view was abandoned, in favor of a [[regulatory]] or [[legislative]] model. A new "multiaxial" system attempted to yield a picture more amenable to a statistical population census, rather than a simple [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Spitzer argued "mental disorders are a subset of medical disorders" but the task force decided on the DSM statement: "Each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome."&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt; The [[personality disorders]] were placed on axis II along with mental retardation.&lt;ref name=Oldham/&gt;

The first draft of the DSM-III was prepared within a year. It introduced many new categories of disorder, while deleting or changing others. A number of the unpublished documents discussing and justifying the changes have recently come to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lane| first = Christopher| title = Shyness: How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness| year = 2007| publisher = Yale University Press| isbn = 0-300-12446-5| page = 263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Field trials sponsored by the U.S. [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) were conducted between 1977 and 1979 to test the reliability of the new diagnoses. A controversy emerged regarding deletion of the concept of neurosis, a mainstream of [[psychoanalytic]] theory and therapy but seen as vague and unscientific by the DSM task force. Faced with enormous political opposition, the DSM-III was in serious danger of not being approved by the APA Board of Trustees unless "neurosis" was included in some capacity; a political compromise reinserted the term in parentheses after the word "disorder" in some cases. Additionally, the diagnosis of [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation|ego-dystonic homosexuality]] replaced the DSM-II category of "sexual orientation disturbance".

Finally published in 1980, the DSM-III was 494 pages and listed 265 diagnostic categories. It rapidly came into widespread international use and has been termed a revolution or transformation in psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Transformation"/&gt;

When DSM-III was published, the developers made extensive claims about the reliability of the radically new diagnostic system they had devised, which relied on data from special field trials. However, according to a 1994 article by [[Stuart A. Kirk]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Twenty years after the reliability problem became the central focus of DSM-III, there is still not a single multi-site study showing that DSM (any version) is routinely used with high reliably by regular mental health clinicians. Nor is there any credible evidence that any version of the manual has greatly increased its reliability beyond the previous version. There are important methodological problems that limit the generalisability of most reliability studies. Each reliability study is constrained by the training and supervision of the interviewers, their motivation and commitment to diagnostic accuracy, their prior skill, the homogeneity of the clinical setting in regard to patient mix and base rates, and the methodological rigor achieved by the investigator ...&lt;ref name="Stuart A, Kirk &amp; Herb Kutchins 1994"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===DSM-III-R (1987)===
In 1987, the DSM-III-R was published as a revision of the DSM-III, under the direction of Spitzer. Categories were renamed and reorganized, and significant changes in criteria were made. Six categories were deleted while others were added. Controversial diagnoses, such as pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder and [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic personality disorder]], were considered and discarded. "Ego-dystonic homosexuality" was also removed and was largely subsumed under "sexual disorder not otherwise specified", which can include "persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spiegel |first1=Alix |date=18 January 2002 |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/204/81-words |title=81 Words |first2=Ira |last2=Glass |website=This American Life |location=Chicago |publisher=WBEZ Chicago Public Radio }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the DSM-III-R contained 292 diagnoses and was 567 pages long. Further efforts were made for the diagnoses to be purely descriptive, although the introductory text stated for at least some disorders, "particularly the Personality Disorders, the criteria require much more inference on the part of the observer" (p. xxiii).&lt;ref name=Oldham/&gt;

===DSM-IV (1994)===
In 1994, DSM-IV was published, listing 410 disorders in 886 pages. The task force was chaired by [[Allen Frances]]. A steering committee of twenty-seven people was introduced, including four psychologists. The steering committee created thirteen  work groups of five to sixteen members. Each work group had about twenty advisers.&lt;!-- .{{clarify|date=July 2013}} --&gt; The work groups conducted a three-step process: first, each group conducted an extensive literature review of their diagnoses; then, they requested data from researchers, conducting analyses to determine which criteria required change, with instructions to be conservative; finally, they conducted multicenter field trials relating diagnoses to clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Allen |last1=Frances |first2=Avram H. |last2=Mack |first3=Ruth |last3=Ross |first4=Michael B. |last4=First |date=2000 |orig-year=1995 |chapter-url=http://www.acnp.org/G4/GN401000082/CH081.html |chapter=The DSM-IV Classification and Psychopharmacology |title=Psychopharmacology: The Fourth Generation of Progress |publisher=American College of Neuropsychopharmacology |editor1-first=Floyd E. |editor1-last=Bloom |editor2-first=David J. |editor2-last=Kupfer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schaffer David | year = 1996 | title = A Participant's Observations: Preparing DSM-IV | url = https://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/PDF/1996/Aug/schaffer.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 325–329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major change from previous versions was the inclusion of a clinical significance criterion to almost half of all the categories, which required symptoms cause "clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning". Some personality disorder diagnoses were deleted or moved to the appendix.&lt;ref name=Oldham/&gt;

===DSM-IV-TR (2000)===
A "text revision" of the DSM-IV, known as the DSM-IV-TR, was published in 2000. The diagnostic categories and the vast majority of the specific criteria for diagnosis were unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=American Psychiatric Association |url=http://www.psych.org/practice/dsm/summary-of-practice-relevant-changes-to-the-dsm-iv-tr |title=Summary of Practice-Relevant Changes to the DSM-IV-TR |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513233545/http://www.psych.org/practice/dsm/summary-of-practice-relevant-changes-to-the-dsm-iv-tr |archive-date=13 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The text sections giving extra information on each diagnosis were updated, as were some of the diagnostic codes to maintain consistency with the ICD. The DSM-IV-TR was organized into a five-part axial system. The first axis incorporated clinical disorders. The second axis covered [[personality disorders]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. The remaining axes covered medical, psychosocial, environmental, and childhood factors functionally necessary to provide diagnostic criteria for health care assessments.

The DSM-IV-TR characterizes a mental disorder as "a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual [which] is associated with present distress ... or disability ... or with a significant increased risk of suffering." It also notes "no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of 'mental disorder' ... different situations call for different definitions". It states "there is no assumption that each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries dividing it from other mental disorders or from no mental disorder" (APA, 1994 and 2000).

====DSM-IV-TR Categorization====

The DSM-IV is a categorical classification system. The categories are prototypes, and a patient with a close approximation to the prototype is said to have that disorder. DSM-IV states, "there is no assumption each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries" but isolated, low-grade and non-criterion (unlisted for a given disorder) symptoms are not given importance.&lt;ref&gt;Maser, JD. &amp; Patterson, T. (2002) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=12462864 Spectrum and nosology: implications for DSM-5] ''Psychiatric Clinics of North America'', December, 25(4)p855-885&lt;/ref&gt; Qualifiers are sometimes used, for example mild, moderate or severe forms of a disorder. For nearly half the disorders, symptoms must be sufficient to cause "clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning", although DSM-IV-TR removed the distress criterion from [[tic disorder]]s and several of the [[paraphilia]]s due to their [[egosyntonic]] nature. Each category of disorder has a numeric code taken from the [[ICD coding system]], used for health service (including insurance) administrative purposes.

====DSM-IV-TR Multi-axial system{{anchor|Multi-axial system}}====

With the advent of the DSM-5 in 2013, the APA eliminated the longstanding multiaxial system for mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 2014|title=The Removal of the Multiaxial System in the DSM-5: Implications and Practice Suggestions for Counselors|url=http://tpcjournal.nbcc.org/the-removal-of-the-multiaxial-system-in-the-dsm-5-implications-and-practice-suggestions-for-counselors/|journal=The Professional Counselor Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=191–201|last1=Kress|first1=Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the DSM-IV organized each psychiatric diagnosis into five dimensions (axes) relating to different aspects of disorder or disability:
* '''''Axis I''':'' All psychological diagnostic categories except mental retardation and personality disorder
* '''''Axis II''':'' [[Personality disorders]] and mental retardation
* '''''Axis III''':'' General medical condition; acute medical conditions and physical disorders
* '''''Axis IV''':'' Psychosocial and environmental factors contributing to the disorder
* '''''Axis V''':'' [[Global Assessment of Functioning]] or Child Global Assessment of Functioning [cGAF]  
Mental/Psychiatric/Behavioral/Learning conditions include, but are not limited to: [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety disorders]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[autism spectrum disorders]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia nervosa]], and [[schizophrenia]].

'''Personality Disorders include, but are not limited to''': [[paranoid personality disorder]], [[schizoid personality disorder]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]], [[histrionic personality disorder]], [[avoidant personality disorder]], [[dependent personality disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]; and organic intellectual disabilities.

'''Common medical/physical conditions or diseases''' that may result in and/or exacerbate some of the aforementioned mental/psychiatric conditions OR that may be aggravated by the aforementioned mental/psychiatric conditions include, but are not limited to: brain injuries, terminal diseases, pregnancy, cancer, epilepsy, idiopathic physiological conditions and virtually any other conditions, ailments and/or injuries which may affect the patient's mental health.. Many Biopsychosocial Assessments incorporate multiple factors that adversely affect the patient's, client's and/or subject's overall well-being and homeostasis.

Typical psychosocial influences that are usually listed as having negative impact on life, mentality and health include, but are not limited to: Environmental factors of dysfunction such as those experienced within home, school and work; Social factors such as issues with drug use (not diagnosed), enabling friends and conflicts with coworkers; Family complications such as divorce, social service involvement and court ordered placements; Various stressors such as recent accident, natural disaster and other traumatic occurrences (i.e. assault, death, abuse); Financial problems such as bankruptcy, job loss and debts; and service needs such as lack of medical insurance, inability to find adequate treatment and inaccessibility to necessary state and federal programs.

====Sourcebooks====

The DSM-IV does not specifically cite its sources, but there are four volumes of "sourcebooks" intended to be APA's documentation of the guideline development process and supporting evidence, including literature reviews, data analyses and field trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DSM-IV Sourcebook|date=1994|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0-89042-065-2|volume=1|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DSM-IV Sourcebook|date=1996|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0-89042-069-0|volume=2|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DSM-IV Sourcebook|date=1997|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0-89042-073-7|volume=3|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 1999|title=DSM-IV Sourcebook, vol. 4 (Book Forum: Assessment and Diagnosis)|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=173760|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=156|issue=10|page=1655|doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1655|last1=Sadock|first1=Benjamin J.|accessdate=2013-12-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206233357/http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=173760|archivedate=2013-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sourcebooks have been said to provide important insights into the character and quality of the decisions that led to the production of DSM-IV, and hence the scientific credibility of contemporary psychiatric classification.&lt;ref name="Poland01vol1"&gt;Poland, JS.

===DSM-5 (2013)===
{{Main|DSM-5}}
The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the DSM-5, was approved by the Board of Trustees of the APA on December 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Caroline |last=Cassels |date=2 December 2012 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/775496 |title=DSM-5 Gets APA's Official Stamp of Approval |publisher=WebMD, LLC |website=Medscape |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published on May 18, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explainer: what is the DSM?|url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-dsm-14127|work=The Conversation Australia|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=2013-05-21|first=Peter |last=Kinderman|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the DSM-5 contains extensively revised diagnoses and, in some cases, broadens diagnostic definitions while narrowing definitions in other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Books blast new version of psychiatry's bible, the DSM|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/12/dsm-psychiatry-mental-disorders/2150819/|accessdate=2013-05-21|newspaper=USA Today|date=12 May 2013|author=Sharon Jayson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-5 is the first major edition of the manual in twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DSM-5 Changes: What Parents Need To Know About The First Major Revision In Nearly 20 Years|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/20/dsm5-changes-what-parents-need-to-know_n_3294413.html|accessdate=2013-05-21|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=20 May 2013|author=Catherine Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant change in the fifth edition is the deletion of the subtypes of [[schizophrenia]] ([[paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid]], [[disorganized schizophrenia|disorganized]], [[catatonic schizophrenia|catatonic]], [[undifferentiated schizophrenia|undifferentiated]] and [[residual schizophrenia|residual]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5 |website=American Psychiatric Association |date=17 May 2013 |url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226050453/http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deletion of the subsets of [[Autism spectrum|autistic spectrum disorder]] (namely, [[Asperger's syndrome]], [[classic autism]], [[Rett syndrome]], [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] and [[pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]]) was also implemented, with specifiers with regard to intensity (mild, moderate and severe). Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, with three levels: 1 (requiring support), 2 (requiring substantial support) and 3 (requiring very substantial support).

During the revision process, the APA website periodically listed several sections of the DSM-5 for review and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.dsm5.org/pages/default.aspx|work=DSM-5 Development|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=2013-05-21|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future revisions and updates===
Beginning with the fifth edition, it is intended diagnostic guidelines revisions will be added more often to keep up with research in the field.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite web|title=About DSM-5: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.dsm5.org/about/pages/faq.aspx|website=DSM-5 Development |publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=24 May 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524233846/http://www.dsm5.org/about/pages/faq.aspx |archive-date=24 May 2015 |quote=[T]he research base of mental disorders is evolving at different rates for different disorders, diagnostic guidelines will not be tied to a static publication date but rather to scientific advances.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable the DSM-5 is identified with [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Arabic]] rather than [[Roman numerals]]. Beginning with DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association will use decimals to identify incremental updates (e.g., DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2) and whole numbers for new editions (e.g., DSM-5, DSM-6),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Harold |first1=Eve |last2=Valora |first2=Jamie |title=APA Modifies ''DSM'' Naming Convention to Reflect Publication Changes |location=Arlington, VA |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |date=9 March 2010 |url=http://psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2010-News-Releases/DSM-Name-Change.aspx |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613144808/http://psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2010-News-Releases/DSM-Name-Change.aspx |archive-date=13 June 2010 |quote=Beginning with the upcoming fifth edition, new versions of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)'' will be identified with Arabic rather than Roman numerals, marking a change in how future updates will be created, ...

== Criticism ==

===Reliability and validity concerns===
The revisions of the DSM from the 3rd Edition forward have been mainly concerned with diagnostic reliability—the degree to which different diagnosticians agree on a diagnosis. It was argued {Henrik Walter} that a science of psychiatry can only advance if diagnosis is reliable. If clinicians and researchers frequently disagree about the diagnosis of a patient, then research into the causes and effective treatments of those disorders cannot advance. Hence, diagnostic reliability was a major concern of DSM-III.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} When the diagnostic reliability problem was thought to be solved, subsequent editions of the DSM were concerned mainly with "tweaking" the diagnostic criteria.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Unfortunately, neither the issue of reliability or validity was settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=S. Nassir |last1=Ghaemi |first2=James L., IV |last2=Knoll |first3=Theodore |last3=Pearlman |date=14 October 2013 |title=Why DSM-III, IV, and 5 are Unscientific |website=Psychiatric Times: Couch in Crisis Blog |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/couch-crisis/why-dsm-iii-iv-and-5-are-unscientific }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is a blog post|date=August 2016}} However, most psychiatric education post DSM-III focused on issues of treatment—especially drug treatment—and less on diagnostic concerns.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In fact, Thomas R. Insel, director of the NIMH, stated in 2013 that the agency would no longer fund research projects that rely exclusively on DSM criteria due to its lack of validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Insel|first=Thomas |date=29 April 2013 |title=Transforming Diagnosis |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml|website=Director's Blog |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field trials of DSM-5 brought the debate of reliability back into the limelight as some disorders showed poor reliability. For example, [[major depressive disorder]], a common mental illness, had a poor reliability [[Cohen's kappa|kappa]] statistic of 0.28, indicating that clinicians frequently disagreed on this diagnosis in the same patients. The most reliable diagnosis was major neurocognitive disorder with a kappa of 0.78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freedman |first1=Robert |last2=Lewis |first2=David A. |last3=Michels |first3=Robert |last4=Pine |first4=Daniel S. |last5=Schultz |first5=Susan K. |last6=Tamminga |first6=Carol A. |last7=Gabbard |first7=Glen O. |last8=[[Susan Shur-Fen|Gau]] |first8=[[Susan Shur-Fen]] |last9=Javitt |first9=Daniel C. |last10=Oquendo |first10=Maria A. |last11=Shrout |first11=Patrick E. |last12=Vieta |first12=Eduard |last13=Yager |first13=Joel |date=January 2013 |title=The Initial Field Trials of DSM-5: New Blooms and Old Thorns |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=170 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12091189 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=1555604 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115024502/http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=1555604 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-15 |pmid=23288382 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superficial symptoms===
By design, the DSM is primarily concerned with the signs and symptoms of mental disorders, rather than the underlying causes. It claims to collect them together based on statistical or clinical patterns. As such, it has been compared to a naturalist's field guide to birds, with similar advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McHugh Paul R | year = 2005 | title = Striving for Coherence: Psychiatry's Efforts Over Classification | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/293/20/2526?ijkey=e5f8d881d7f6c0d853ce55e1ac5b693c5c53a950&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | issue = 20| pages = 2526–2528 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.20.2526 | pmid=15914753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a causative or explanatory basis, however, is not specific to the DSM, but rather reflects a general lack of pathophysiological understanding of psychiatric disorders. As [[DSM-III]] chief architect [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] and [[DSM-IV]] editor Michael First outlined in 2005, "little progress has been made toward understanding the [[pathophysiology|pathophysiological]] processes and cause of mental disorders. If anything, the research has shown the situation is even more complex than initially imagined, and we believe not enough is known to structure the classification of psychiatric disorders according to etiology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spitzer, First  | year = 2005 | title = Classification of Psychiatric Disorders | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/294/15/1898 | journal = JAMA | volume = 294 | issue = 15| pages = 1898–1899 | doi=10.1001/jama.294.15.1898| pmc = 1801862 | pmid=20313414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM's focus on superficial symptoms is claimed to be largely a result of necessity (assuming such a manual is nevertheless produced), since there is no agreement on a more explanatory classification system.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Reviewers note, however, that this approach is undermining research, including in genetics, because it results in the grouping of individuals who have very little in common except superficial criteria as per DSM or ICD diagnosis.&lt;ref name="concept&amp;evolution"/&gt;

Despite the lack of consensus on underlying causation, advocates for specific [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] paradigms have nonetheless faulted the current diagnostic scheme for not incorporating evidence-based models or findings from other areas of science. A recent example is [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]]' criticism that the DSM does not differentiate between genuine cognitive malfunctions and those induced by psychological [[adaptations]], a key distinction within evolutionary psychology but one that is widely challenged within general psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Dominic |last1=Murphy |first2=Stephen |last2=Stich |date=16 December 1998 |url=http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ArchiveFolder/Research%20Group/Publications/Mad/Madhouse.html |title=Darwin in the Madhouse: Evolutionary Psychology and the Classification of Mental Disorders |accessdate=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205122638/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ArchiveFolder/Research%20Group/Publications/Mad/Madhouse.html |archive-date=5 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leda Cosmides |author2=John Tooby | year = 1999 | title = Toward an Evolutionary Taxonomy of Treatable Conditions | url = http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/papers/taxonomywakefield99.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 108 | issue = 3| pages = 453–464 | doi=10.1037/0021-843x.108.3.453 | pmid=10466269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11227812  | volume=39 | issue=3 |date=March 2001 | pages=309–14 | last1 = McNally | first1 = RJ | title = On Wakefield's harmful dysfunction analysis of mental disorder | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | doi = 10.1016/S0005-7967(00)00068-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the strong [[Operationalization|operationalist]] viewpoint, which contends that reliance on [[operational definition]]s, as purported by the DSM, necessitates that intuitive concepts like [[Depression (mood)|depression]] be replaced by specific measurable concepts before they are scientifically meaningful. One critic states of [[psychologists]] that "Instead of replacing 'metaphysical' terms such as 'desire' and 'purpose', they used it to legitimize them by giving them operational definitions ... the initial, quite radical operationalist ideas eventually came to serve as little more than a 'reassurance fetish' (Koch 1992) for mainstream methodological practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

A 2013 review published in the ''[[European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience]]'' states "that psychiatry targets the [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomena]] of [[consciousness]], which, unlike [[somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] [[symptom]]s and [[medical sign|signs]], cannot be grasped on the analogy with material thing-like objects." As an example of the problem of the superficial characterization of psychiatric signs and symptoms, the authors gave the example of a [[patient]] saying they "feel depressed, sad, or down", showing that such a statement could indicate various underlying experiences: "not only [[depression (mood)|depressed mood]] but also, for instance, [[irritability|irritation]], [[anger]], loss of meaning, varieties of [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[ambivalence]], [[rumination (psychology)|ruminations]] of different kinds, hyper-reflectivity, thought pressure, psychological [[anxiety]], varieties of [[depersonalization]], and even [[auditory hallucination|voices]] with negative content, and so forth." The [[structured interview]] comes with "danger of over confidence in the face value of the answers, as if a simple 'yes' or 'no' truly confirmed or denied the [[diagnostic criteria|diagnostic criterion]] at issue." The authors gave an example: A [[patient]] who was being administered the [[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV|Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis I Disorders]] denied [[thought insertion]], but during a "conversational, [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] interview", a [[semi-structured interview]] tailored to the patient, the same [[patient]] admitted to experiencing [[thought insertion]], along with a [[delusion|delusional elaboration]]. The authors suggested 2 reasons for this discrepancy: either the patient did not "recognize his own [[qualia|experience]] in the rather blunt, implicitly either/or formulation of the structured-interview question", or the [[qualia|experience]] did not "fully articulate itself" until the patient started talking about his experiences.&lt;ref name = nordgaard1&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The psychiatric interview: validity, structure, and subjectivity | journal = [[European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience]] | volume = 263 | issue = 4 | pages = 353–364 |date=June 2013 | doi = 10.1007/s00406-012-0366-z | pmid = 23001456|author1 = Julie Nordgaard|author2 = Louis A.

=== Overdiagnosis ===
Dr. Allen Frances being an outspoken critic of the DSM-5 states that "normality is an endangered species," for the reason of "fad diagnoses" and an "epidemic" of over-diagnosing, and suggests that the "DSM-5 threatens to provoke several more [epidemics]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/overdiagnosis-mental-disorders-and-the-dsm-5/|title=Overdiagnosis, Mental Disorders and the DSM-5|date=2010-07-26|work=World of Psychology|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201006/psychiatric-fads-and-overdiagnosis|title=Psychiatric Fads and Overdiagnosis|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers state that changes in diagnostic criteria reduce thresholds for a diagnosis, which results in increases in prevalence rates following each published version of the DSM for ADHD&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Rae|last2=Mitchell|first2=Geoffrey K.|last3=Batstra|first3=Laura|date=2013-11-05|title=Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: are we helping or harming?|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6172|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=347|pages=f6172|doi=10.1136/bmj.f6172|issn=1756-1833|pmid=24192646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruchmüller, Katrin,Margraf, Jürgen,Schneider, Silvia|first=|date=February 2012|title=Is ADHD diagnosed in accord with diagnostic criteria?

===Dividing lines===
Despite caveats in the introduction to the DSM, it has long been argued that its [[Classification of mental disorders|system of classification]] makes unjustified categorical distinctions between disorders and uses arbitrary cut-offs between normal and abnormal. A 2009 psychiatric review noted that attempts to demonstrate natural boundaries between related DSM [[syndromes]], or between a common DSM syndrome and normality, have failed.&lt;ref name="concept&amp;evolution"/&gt; Some argue that rather than a categorical approach, a fully dimensional, spectrum or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spitzer |first1=Robert L. |last2=Williams |first2=Janet B.W. |last3=First |first3=Michael B. |last4=Gibbon |first4=Miriam |title=Biometric Research |website= Psychiatric Institute 2001-2002 |publisher=New York State Psychiatric Institute |url=http://nyspi.org/AR2001/Biometrics.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030307205740/http://nyspi.org/AR2001/Biometrics.htm |archive-date=7 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maser, JD &amp; Akiskal, HS. et al.

In addition, it is argued that the current approach based on exceeding a threshold of symptoms does not adequately take into account the context in which a person is living, and to what extent there is internal disorder of an individual versus a psychological response to adverse situations.&lt;ref&gt;Chodoff, P. (2005) [http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/40/11/17-a Psychiatric Diagnosis: A 60-Year Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122110/http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/40/11/17-a |date=2007-09-29 }} ''Psychiatric News'' June 3, 2005 Volume 40 Number 11, p17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wakefield | first1 = Jerome C. | last2 = PhD | first2 =  MF| last3 = PhD | first3 =  MB| last4 = PhD | first4 = DSW | last5 = Schmitz | first5 = Mark F. | last6 = First | first6 = Michael B. | last7 = MD | last8 = Horwitz | first8 = Allan V. | year = 2007 | title = Extending the Bereavement Exclusion for Major Depression to Other Losses: Evidence From the National Comorbidity Survey | url = http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/64/4/433 | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 433–440 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.64.4.433 | pmid = 17404120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM does include a step ("Axis IV") for outlining "Psychosocial and environmental factors contributing to the disorder" once someone is diagnosed with that particular disorder.

Because an individual's degree of impairment is often not correlated with symptom counts and can stem from various individual and social factors, the DSM's standard of distress or disability can often produce false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spitzer | first1 = RL | last2 = Wakefield | first2 = JC. | date = December 1999| title = DSM-IV diagnostic criterion for clinical significance: does it help solve the false positives problem? | doi = 10.1176/ajp.156.12.1856 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 12| pages = 1856–64 | pmid = 10588397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, individuals who do not meet symptom counts may nevertheless experience comparable distress or disability in their life.

===Cultural bias===
Psychiatrists have argued that published diagnostic standards relied on an exaggerated interpretation of neurophysiological findings and so understate the scientific importance of social-psychological variables.&lt;ref name=Widiger2000/&gt; Advocating a more culturally sensitive approach to psychology, critics such as [[Carl Bell (physician)|Carl Bell]] and Marcello Maviglia contend that researchers and service-providers often discount the cultural and ethnic diversity of individuals.&lt;ref name="wash-post"&gt;{{cite news | last= Vedantam |first= Shankar |date= June 26, 2005 |title = Psychiatry's Missing Diagnosis: Patients' Diversity Is Often Discounted |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/25/AR2005062500982.html |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, current diagnostic guidelines have been criticized{{by whom|date=October 2018}} as having a fundamentally Euro-American outlook. Although these guidelines have been widely implemented, opponents argue that even when a diagnostic criterion-set is accepted across different cultures, it does not necessarily indicate that the underlying constructs have any validity within those cultures; even reliable application can only demonstrate consistency, not legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Widiger2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Widiger TA, Sankis LM |title= Adult psychopathology: issues and controversies |journal= Annu Rev Psychol |volume= 51 |issue= 1|pages= 377–404 |year= 2000 |pmid= 10751976 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cross-cultural psychiatry|Cross-cultural]] psychiatrist [[Arthur Kleinman]] contends that the Western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the DSM-IV: the fact that disorders or concepts from non-Western or non-mainstream cultures are described as "culture-bound", whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever, is to Kleinman revelatory of an underlying assumption that Western cultural phenomena are universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kleinman A |title= Triumph or pyrrhic victory? The inclusion of culture in DSM-IV |journal= Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume= 4 |issue= 6 |pages= 343–4 |year= 1997 |pmid= 9385013 |doi= 10.3109/10673229709030563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cross-cultural critics largely share Kleinman's negative view toward the [[culture-bound syndrome]], common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented non-Western mental disorders still left out, and frustration that even those included were often misinterpreted or misrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, D. &amp; Munro, A. (1997) ''Troublesome Disguises: Underdiagnosed Psychiatric Syndromes'' Blackwell Science Ltd {{ISBN missing|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date= August 2016}}

Mainstream psychiatrists have also been dissatisfied with these new culture-bound diagnoses, although not for the same reasons. Robert Spitzer, a lead architect of the DSM-III, has held the opinion that the addition of cultural formulations was an attempt to placate cultural critics, and that they lack any scientific motivation or support. Spitzer also posits that the new culture-bound diagnoses are rarely used in practice, maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved. In general, the mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid, cross-cultural factors are either irrelevant or are only significant to specific symptom presentations.&lt;ref name="Widiger2000" /&gt; One of the results was the development of the Azibo Nosology by Daudi Ajani Ya Azibo as an alternative to the DSM to treat African and African American patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Atwell Irene |author2= Azibo Daudi A | year = 1991 | title = Diagnosing personality disorder in Africans (Blacks) using the Azibo nosology: Two case studies | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;UID=1992-13008-001 | journal = Journal of Black Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 1–22 | doi= 10.1177/00957984910172002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Azibo |first= Daudi Ajani ya |date= November 2014 |title= The Azibo Nosology II: Epexegesis and 25th Anniversary Update: 55 Culture-focused Mental Disorders Suffered by African Descent People |journal= Journal of Pan African Studies |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |pages= 32–176 |url= http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol7no5/4-Nov-Azibo-Noso.pdf |format= PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zulu |first= Itibari M. |title= The Azibo Nosology: An Interview with Daudi Ajani ya Azibo |journal= Journal of Pan African Studies |volume= 7 |issue =5 |pages= 209–214 |url= http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol7no5/12-Nov-Azibo-Zulu.pdf |format= PDF

Historically, the DSM tended to avoid issues involving [[religion]]; the DSM-5 relaxed this attitude somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;

This article invites the reader to explore salient issues in the emergence of a broader recognition of religion, spirituality and psychiatric diagnosis in the DSM-5.

===Medicalization and financial conflicts of interest===
It has also been alleged that the way the categories of the DSM are structured, as well as the substantial expansion of the number of categories, are representative of an increasing [[medicalization]] of human nature, which may be attributed to [[disease mongering]] by psychiatrists and [[pharmaceutical companies]], the power and influence of the latter having grown dramatically in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Healy D (2006) [http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030185&amp;ct=1 The Latest Mania: Selling Bipolar Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212110644/http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0030185&amp;ct=1 |date=2009-02-12 }} PLoS Med 3(4): e185.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, roughly half have had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry at one time, raising the prospect of a direct [[Conflict of interest#Relationship to medical research|conflict of interest]].&lt;ref name="Cosgrove"&gt;Cosgrove, Lisa, Krimsky, Sheldon, Vijayaraghavan, Manisha, Schneider, Lisa, [http://www.tufts.edu/~skrimsky/PDF/DSM%20COI.PDF Financial Ties between DSM-IV Panel Members and the Pharmaceutical Industry]&lt;/ref&gt; The same article concludes that the connections between panel members and the drug companies were particularly strong in those diagnoses where drugs are the first line of treatment, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, where 100% of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name = Cosgrove/&gt; In 2005, then APA President [[Steven Sharfstein]] released a statement in which he conceded that psychiatrists had "allowed the biopsychosocial model to become the bio-bio-bio model".&lt;ref&gt;Sharfstein, SS.

However, although the number of identified diagnoses has increased by more than 300% (from 106 in DSM-I to 365 in DSM-IV-TR), psychiatrists such as Zimmerman and Spitzer argue it almost entirely represents greater specification of the forms of pathology, thereby allowing better grouping of more similar patients.&lt;ref name="concept&amp;evolution"/&gt; However, [[William Glasser]] refers to the DSM as "phony diagnostic categories", arguing that "it was developed to help psychiatrists – to help them make money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpsychologist.com/2006/11/glasser-headlines-psychotherapy-conference/10879.html |title=(Susan Bowman, 2006) |publisher=The National Psychologist |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the publishing of the DSM, with tightly guarded copyrights, has in itself earned over $100&amp;nbsp;million for the APA.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;

===Clients, survivors, and consumer===
A client is a person who accesses psychiatric services and may have been given a diagnosis from the DSM, while a survivor self-identifies as a person who has endured a psychiatric intervention and the mental health system (which may have involved [[involuntary commitment]] and [[involuntary treatment]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} A term adopted by many users of psychiatric services is "consumer." This term was chosen to eliminate the "patient" label and restore the person to an active role as a user or consumer of services.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, L, Trachtman, H. and Duckworth, K. "From Within: A Consumer Perspective on Psychiatric Hospitals," in  Textbook of Hospital Psychiatry, S. Sharfstein, F. Dickerson and J. Oldham eds. American Psychiatric Publishing, 2009, pp.237-244.&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals{{Who|date=November 2014}} are relieved to find that they have a recognized condition that they can apply a name to and this has led to many people [[Self-diagnosis|self-diagnosing]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Others, however, question the accuracy of the diagnosis, or feel they have been given a "[[Labeling theory|label]]" that invites [[social stigma]] and [[discrimination]] (the terms "[[mentalism (discrimination)|mentalism]]" and "sanism" have been used to describe such discriminatory treatment).&lt;ref name="Sane"&gt;[http://www.socialinequities.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Ingram.Sanism-in-Theory-and-Practice.CI_.2011.pdf Sanism in Theory and Practice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317045503/http://www.socialinequities.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Ingram.Sanism-in-Theory-and-Practice.CI_.2011.pdf |date=2014-03-17 }} May 9/10, 2011.

Additionally, it has been noted that the DSM often uses definitions and terminology that are inconsistent with a [[recovery model]], and such content can erroneously imply excess psychopathology (e.g. multiple "[[comorbid]]" diagnoses) or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael T.

=== DSM-5 critiques ===
{{undue weight section|date=March 2017}}
Psychiatrist [[Allen Frances]] has been critical of proposed revisions to the DSM-5. In a 2012 ''New York Times'' editorial, Frances warned that if this DSM version is issued unamended by the APA, "it will medicalize normality and result in a glut of unnecessary and harmful drug prescription."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Frances |first=Allen |date=11 May 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/opinion/break-up-the-psychiatric-monopoly.html?_r=1 |title=Diagnosing the D.S.M. |newspaper=New York Times |edition=New York |page=A19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2, 2012 blog post in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', Frances provides his "... list of DSM 5's ten most potentially harmful changes":&lt;ref name=dsm5GuideNotBible&gt;{{cite web|last=Frances|first=Allen J.|title=DSM 5 Is Guide Not Bible—Ignore Its Ten Worst Changes: APA approval of DSM-5 is a sad day for psychiatry|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201212/dsm-5-is-guide-not-bible-ignore-its-ten-worst-changes|accessdate=2013-03-09|website=Psychology Today|date=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=August 2016}}

Frances and others have published debates on what they see as the six most essential questions in psychiatric diagnosis:&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=James |title=The Six Most Essential Questions in Psychiatric Diagnosis: A Pluralogue.

In 2011, psychologist [[Brent Robbins]] co-authored a national letter for the Society for Humanistic Psychology that has brought thousands into the public debate about the DSM. Over 15,000 individuals and [[mental health]] professionals have signed a petition in support of the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor co-authors letter about America's mental health manual|url=http://www.pointpark.edu/news-arts-sciences/professor-coauthors-letter-about-americas-mental-health-manual|website=Point Park University|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen other [[American Psychological Association]] divisions have endorsed the petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointpark.edu/NewsArtsSciences.aspx?id=467 |title=Professor co-authors letter about America's mental health manual |date=December 12, 2011 |work=Point Park University |access-date=2012-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329184708/http://www.pointpark.edu/NewsArtsSciences.aspx?id=467 |archive-date=2012-03-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins has noted that under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/26/MNJJ1M3DFK.DTL |title=Revision of psychiatric manual under fire|first=Erin |last=Allday |date=November 26, 2011 |work=San Francisco Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Two theories are presented in order to explain his nickname "Dik al-Jinn" ([[Cock (bird)|Cock]] of [[Jinn|al-Jinn]]):
* He would have been nicknamed so, because of his eyes whose green color evoked the plumage of the cock.
* For the funeral elegy poem ([[Rithā']]) which he composed for a cock served to him during a [[banquet]].&lt;ref name="Karine Sader"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karine Sader|title=Dîwân Dîk al-Jinn, Shâ'ir al-Hubb wa al-Mawt|year=2013|publisher=Dâr Sâdir|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the classic Arab criticism did not pay much attention to him, Dik al-Jinn remained famous for his debauchery and his love of wine that drove him to squander his fortune, and especially for the love he brought to "Ward", a Christian (later convert to [[Islam]]) from [[Homs]]; and "Bakr", a friend (probably another lover), whom he murdered both in a crisis of passionate love.

It seems that Dik al-Jinn inherited a large sum of money from his father, and that he would have lived on this nest egg, squandering it for his pleasures. He thus aroused the jealousy and disapproval of his cousin, "Abu Tayyib", who then made Dik al-Jinn believe that Ward and Bakr were dating one another. Being mad and jealous, Dik al-Jinn killed them both. Later on, he learned the truth and cried the rest of his life in funeral elegies that some critics, such as "Ibn Rashiq" recognize as models of their kind.&lt;ref name="Desiring Arabs"/&gt;

He is considered one of the masters of the poet [[Abu Tammam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William MacGuckin|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=6p0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=Dik+al-Jinn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=agV64oYwoA&amp;sig=jPBA-qNDwBQc89QQDTY0mh28kEY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Dik%20al-Jinn&amp;f=false|title=Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, Band 2|publisher=Oriental translation fund of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1843|page=133-134|isbn=9780226509600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry style==
Dik al-Jinn departs, like his contemporary [[Abu Nuwas]], standards of ancient poetry from [[Arabic poetry#Pre-Islamic poetry|Pre-Islamic]] [[qasida]] and its range of Bedouin themes. Leaving aside the long verses generally preferred by poets of the classical style, such as [[Tawil]], Dik al-Jinn composed above all on the [[basit]], kamil, and khafif meters. His [[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]] consists mainly of fragments and short pieces of amorous poetry ([[ghazal]]) and elegies addressed to "Ward". Another great part of his poetry is devoted to the love of wine. He also left some long pieces of praise (madîh) and a famous satire (hijâ') addressed to his cousin "Abu Tayyib".

His diwan has been collected by Sheikh Muhammad al-Samâwî, who was the first to gather his works.&lt;ref name="Karine Sader"/&gt;

==Trivia==
The story of Dik al-Jinn has similar aspects to [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Othello]].

'''Edward Sylvester Morse''' (June 18, 1838 &amp;ndash; December 20, 1925) was an [[United States|American]] [[zoologist]] and [[oriental studies|orientalist]].

==Early life==
Morse was born in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]] as the son of a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] deacon who held strict [[Calvinist]] beliefs. His mother, who did not share her husband's religious beliefs, encouraged her son's interest in the sciences. An unruly student, Morse was expelled from every school he attended in his youth — the Portland village school, the academy at [[Conway, New Hampshire]], in 1851, and Bridgton Academy in 1854 (for carving on desks). He also attended [[Gould Academy]] in [[Bethel, Maine]].  At Gould Academy, Morse came under the influence of Dr. Nathaniel True who encouraged Morse to pursue his interest in the study of nature.

He preferred to explore the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] in search of shells and snails, or go to the field to study the fauna and flora. However, despite his lack of formal education, the collections formed during adolescence soon earned him the visit of eminent scientists from Boston, Washington and even the United Kingdom. He was noted for his work with land snails, and before the age of twelve when he had discovered two new species: ''Helix Milium'' and ''H. astericus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yamasa.org/history/english/edward_morse.html Japanese History Online]
&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, he worked as a mechanical draftsman at the Portland Locomotive Company and a wood engraver attached to a Boston company. Morse was recommended by [[Philip Pearsall Carpenter]] to [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807–1873) at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at [[Harvard University]] for his intellectual qualities and talent at drawing, and served as his assistant in charge of conservation, documentation and drawing collections of [[mollusk]]s and [[brachiopod]]s until 1861.

During the [[American Civil War]], Morse attempted to enlist in the [[25th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|25th Maine Infantry]], but was turned down due to a chronic tonsil infection. On June 18, 1863, Morse married Ellen (“Nellie”) Elizabeth Owen in Portland.  The couple had two children, Edith Owen Morse and John Gould Morse (named after Morse's lifelong friend Major John Mead Gould).

==Career==
Morse rapidly became successful in the field of zoology, specializing in [[malacology]] or the study of mollusks. In March 1863, along with three other students of Agassiz, Morse co-founded the scientific journal ''[[The American Naturalist]],'' and he became one of its editors. The journal included a large number of his drawings. In 1864, he published his first work devoted to mollusks under the title ''Observations On The Terrestrial Pulmonifera of Maine, Including a Catalogue of All the Species of Terrestrial Mollusca and Fluvial Known to Inhabit the State''. In 1870 he published ''The Brachiopods, a Division of the Annelida'' wherein he reclassified [[brachiopod]]s as worms rather than mollusks. The work attracted the attention of [[Charles Darwin]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} From 1871 to 1874, Morse was appointed to the chair of comparative anatomy and zoology at [[Bowdoin College]].  In 1874, he became a lecturer at Harvard University. In 1876, Morse was named a fellow of the [[National Academy of Science]].

===Japan===
In June 1877 Morse first visited [[Japan]] in search of coastal brachiopods. His visit turned into a three-year stay when he was offered a post as the first professor of Zoology at the [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. He went on to recommend several fellow Americans as ''[[o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'' (foreign advisors) to support the modernization of Japan in the [[Meiji Era]]. To collect specimens, he established a marine biological laboratory at [[Enoshima]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].

While looking out of a window on a train between [[Yokohama]] and [[Tokyo]], Morse discovered the [[Ōmori]] [[shell mound]], the excavation of which opened the study in [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] in Japan and shed much light on the material culture of prehistoric Japan. He returned to Japan in 1881 to present a report of his findings to Tokyo Imperial University.

While in Japan, he authored a book ''[[Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings]]'' illustrated with his own line drawings. He also made a collection of over 5,000 pieces of Japanese pottery. He devised the term "cord-marked" for the [[sherd]]s of Stone Age pottery, decorated by impressing cords into the wet clay. The Japanese translation, "Jōmon," now gives its name to the whole [[Jōmon period]] as well as [[Jōmon pottery]].

Morse had much interest in [[Japanese ceramics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainememory.net/bin/Detail?ln=37353 Maine Historical Society ]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned on a third visit to Japan in 1882, during which he collected clay samples as well as finished ceramics. He brought back to Boston a collection amassed by government minister and amateur art collector [[Ōkuma Shigenobu]], who donated it to Morse in recognition of his services to Japan. These now form part of the "Morse Collection" of [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts in Boston]], whose catalog was written by [[Ernest Francisco Fenollosa]]. His collection of daily artifacts of the [[Japanese people]] is kept at the Peabody Essex Museum in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. The remainder of the collection was inherited by his granddaughter, Catharine Robb Whyte via her mother Edith Morse Robb and is housed at the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies, Banff, Alberta, Canada.

After leaving Japan, Morse traveled to Southeast Asia and Europe. In 1884 (at age 46), he was elected a vice president of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and became president of that association in 1886, 1887, 1888, 1889. During this period, he returned to Europe, and Japan in quest of pottery.

Morse became Keeper of Pottery at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1890. He was also a director of the [[Peabody Museum of Salem|Peabody Academy of Science]] (now part of and succeeded by the [[Peabody Essex Museum]]) in Salem&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John R., [http://www.pem.org/aux/pdf/mission/Grimes-Cabinets-Curiosity-Knowledge-sm.pdf "Curiosity, Cabinets, and Knowledge"], ''pem.org'', p. 4. Retrieved 2016-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1880 to 1914. In 1898, he was awarded the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] (3rd class) by the Japanese government. He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistm American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; He became chairman of the Boston Museum in 1914, and chairman of the Peabody Museum in 1915. He was awarded the [[Order of the Sacred Treasures]] (2nd class) by the Japanese government in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelhistorical.org/Edward_Sylvester_Morse.html The Courier Volume 26, No. 2 (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morse was a friend of astronomer [[Percival Lowell]], who inspired interest in the planet [[Mars]].  Morse would occasionally journey to the [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], during optimal viewing times to observe the planet.  In 1906, Morse published ''Mars and Its Mystery'' in defense of Lowell’s controversial speculations regarding the possibility of life on Mars.

He donated over 10,000 books from his personal collection to the Tokyo Imperial University. On learning that the library of the Tokyo Imperial University was reduced to ashes by the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], in his will he ordered that his entire remaining collection of books be donated to Tokyo Imperial University.

Morse died at his home in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] in 1925 of [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and was buried at the Harmony Grove Cemetery.

[[File:Gateway to the Great Books.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Volume one of ''Gateway to the Great Books'']]
'''''Gateway to the Great Books''''' is a 10-volume series of [[book]]s originally published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Inc. in 1963 and edited by [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]]. The set was designed as an introduction to the ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'', published by the same organization and editors in 1952. The set included selections – short stories, plays, essays, letters, and extracts from longer works – by more than one hundred authors. The selections were generally shorter and in some ways simpler than the full-length books included in the ''Great Books''.

==Authors==
A number of authors in the ''Great Books'' set – such as [[Plutarch]], [[Epictetus]], [[Tacitus]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[David Hume]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[William James]] – were also represented by shorter works in the ''Gateway'' volumes. In addition, several ''Gateway'' readings discussed authors in the ''Great Books'' series. For instance, a selection from [[Henry Adams]]'
''Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres'' critiqued the philosophy of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Indeed, many writers in the ''Gateway'' set were eventually "promoted" to the second edition (1990) of the ''Great Books'', such as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Molière]], [[Henry James]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[John Dewey]].

==Index, editorial material, criticism==
The set included an index similar to the ''Great Books''' ''[[Syntopicon]]'', along with reading plans of increasing difficulty. Hutchins contributed an introduction that was essentially a boiled-down version of the ''[[Great Conversation]]'', his preface to the ''Great Books''. The set contained biographical notes on the various authors, similar to those in the ''Great Books''. However, the set also contained editorial introductions to the selections, which were generally not included in the ''Great Books''. In another departure from the ''Great Books'' series, the set included black-and-white drawings of most of the authors by Chicago [[portraitist]] Fred Steffen, who also wrote brief notes describing the illustrations. Details from a number of these drawings were featured on the volume covers.

Although the editors maintained that many selections were appropriate to readers as young as seventh-grade students, the set included a fair amount of material challenging for the most experienced reader. The ''Gateway'' volumes were single-column with large, readable type.

'''''Historical Atlas of the American West''''' is a [[historical atlas]] and a standard reference work depicting the history and geography of the seventeen states comprising the American West. Written by Warren A. Beck and Ynez D. Haase, the atlas was published by the University of Oklahoma Press in 1989.

Each map is accompanied by a one-page description of the events depicted. The historical maps cover many periods; from the Spanish land grants to prisoner-of-war camps during World War II. The atlas also contains many maps of geological and meteorological interest as well as the agriculture and flora and fauna of the West.

{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=5}}
In [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion]], '''Humbaba''' ({{cuneiform|𒄷𒌝𒁀𒁀}} [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] spelling), also spelled '''Huwawa''' ({{cuneiform|𒄷𒉿𒉿}} [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] spelling) and surnamed ''the Terrible'', was a monstrous [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] of immemorial age raised by [[Utu]], the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;"Utu, I never knew a mother who bore me, nor a father who brought me up! I was born in the mountains—you brought me up!" ([http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1815.htm Gilgamesh and Huwawa, version A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230153028/http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1815.htm |date=2006-12-30 }}), or "The mother who bore me was in a cave in the mountains. The father who engendered me was a cave in the hills. Utu left me to live all alone in the mountains!" ([http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr18151.htm Gilgamesh and Huwawa, version B] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629164502/http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr18151.htm |date=2007-06-29 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Humbaba was the guardian of the [[Cedar Forest]], where the gods lived, by the will of the god [[Enlil]], who "assigned [Humbaba] as a terror to human beings. Gilgamesh defeated this great enemy."

==Description==
His face is that of a lion. "When he looks at someone, it is the look of death."&lt;ref name="Gilgamesh and Huwawa, version A"&gt;Gilgamesh and Huwawa, version A&lt;/ref&gt; "Humbaba's roar is a flood, his mouth is death and his breath is fire! He can hear a hundred leagues away any [rustling?] in his forest! Who would go down into his forest!"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Tablet II.&lt;/ref&gt; In various examples, his face is scribed in a single coiling line like that of the coiled entrails of men and beasts, [[Hepatoscopy|from which omens might be read]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]], ''Myths From Mesopotamia'', (Oxford University Press) 1989; S. Smith, "The face of Huwawa," ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'' '''26''' (1926:440&amp;ndash;42).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another description from Georg Burckhardt translation of Gilgamesh says, "he had the paws of a lion and a body covered in thorny scales; his feet had the claws of a vulture, and on his head were the horns of a wild bull; his tail and phallus each ended in a snake's head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burckhardt|first1=Georg|title=Das Gilgamesch-Epos - Eine Dichtung aus dem alten Orient.|date=1991|publisher=Rütten &amp; Loening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another description in a newly discovered tablet in [[Sulaymaniyah]] is somewhat positive about Humbaba:

{{quote|"Where Humbaba came and went there was a track, the paths were in good order and the way was well trodden ... Through all the forest a bird began to sing: A wood pigeon was moaning, a turtle dove calling in answer. Monkey mothers sing aloud, a youngster monkey shrieks: like a band of musicians and drummers daily they bash out a rhythm in the presence of Humbaba."

In this version of the story, Humbaba is beloved of the gods and a kind of king in the palace of the forest. Monkeys are his heralds, birds his courtiers, and his entire throne room breathes with the heady aroma of cedar resin.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35755273|title=Museum of Lost Objects: The Genie of Nimrud|first=Kanishk Tharoor and Maryam|last=Maruf|date=9 March 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The tablet goes on to portray Gilgamesh as an aggressor who destroys a forest unnecessarily, and his death is lamented by Enkidu.

==Demise==
Humbaba is first  mentioned in Tablet II of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'': after [[Gilgamesh]] and [[Enkidu]] become friends following their initial fight, they set out on an adventure to the Cedar Forest beyond the seventh mountain range, to slay Humbaba (Huwawa): "Enkidu," Gilgamesh vows, "since a man cannot pass beyond the final end of life, I want to set off into the mountains, to establish my renown there."&lt;ref name="Gilgamesh and Huwawa, version A" /&gt; Gilgamesh tricks the monster into giving away his seven "radiances" by offering his sisters as wife and concubine. When Humbaba's guard is down, Gilgamesh punches him and captures the monster. Defeated, Humbaba appeals to a receptive Gilgamesh for mercy, but Enkidu convinces Gilgamesh to slay Humbaba. In a last effort, Humbaba tries to escape but is decapitated by Enkidu, or in some versions by both heroes together; his head is put in a leather sack, which is brought to [[Enlil]], the god who set Humbaba as the forest's guardian. Enlil becomes enraged upon learning this and redistributes Humbaba's seven splendors (or in some tablets "auras"). "He gave Humbaba's first aura to the fields. He gave his second aura to the rivers. He gave his third aura to the reed-beds. He gave his fourth aura to the lions. He gave his fifth aura to the palace (one text has ''debt slaves''). He gave his sixth aura to the forests (one text has ''the hills''). He gave his seventh aura to [[Manungal|Nungal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nungal, the goddess of prisoners.&lt;/ref&gt; No vengeance was laid upon the heroes, though Enlil says, "He should have eaten the bread that you eat, and should have drunk the water that you drink! He should have been honored."

As each gift was given by Gilgamesh, he received a "terror" (= "radiance") in exchange, from Humbaba. The seven gifts successively given by Gilgamesh were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piney.com/GilgaHuw.html](lines 140–150)&lt;/ref&gt;
#his sister, Ma-tur,
#(a gap in the text),
#eca-flour,
#big shoes,
#tiny shoes,
#semi-precious stones, and
#a bundle of tree-branches.

While Gilgamesh thus distracts and tricks this spirit of the cedar forest, the fifty unmarried young men he has brought on the adventure are felling cedar timber, stripping it of its branches and laying it "in many piles on the hillside," ready to be taken away. Thus the adventure reveals itself in the context of a timber raid, bringing cedar wood to timberless [[Mesopotamia]].

As his death approaches, and Gilgamesh is oppressed with his own mortality, the gods remind him of his great feats: "…having fetched cedar, the unique tree, from its mountains, having killed Humbaba in the forest…"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1813.htm "The death of Gilgamesh" Segment F from Me-Turan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230152520/http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1813.htm |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconography of the [[apotropaic]] severed head of Humbaba, with staring eyes, flowing beard and wild hair, is well documented from the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]], continuing into [[Neo-Assyrian]] art and dying away during the [[Achaemenid]] rule. The severed head of the monstrous Humbaba found a Greek parallel in the myth of [[Perseus]]&lt;ref&gt;Noted at an early date by Clark Hopkins, "Assyrian elements in the Perseus–Gorgon story," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''38''' (1934:341-ff).&lt;/ref&gt; and the similarly employed head of [[Medusa]], which Perseus placed in his leather sack.&lt;ref&gt;Judith McKenzie, A.T. Reyes and A. Schmidt-Colinet, "Faces in the rock at Petra and Medain Saleh," ''Palestine Exploration Quarterly'' '''130''' (1998) 37, 39 with references. Not all decapitation scenes are identifiable as Gilgamesh and Humbaba: in 1928 C. Opfer claimed to find only one (Opfer, "Der Tod des Humbaba," ''Altorientalische Forschungen'' '''5''' (1928:207ff).&lt;/ref&gt; Archaic Greek depictions of the [[gorgoneion]] render it bearded, an anomaly in the female Gorgon. Judith McKenzie detected Humbaba heads in a [[Nabatean]] tomb frieze at [[Petra]].&lt;ref&gt;Judith S. McKenzie, "Keys from Egypt and the East: Observations on Nabataean Culture in the Light of Recent Discoveries" ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', No. 324, Nabataean Petra (November 2001:97&amp;ndash;112) especially p 107f.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IP address management''' (IPAM) is software that can plan, track, and manage the [[IP address]]es used in a [[computer network]]. 

Although IPAM is a way of managing network addressing, it does not typically provide [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) and [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP). Such systems are known as DDI, or DNS, DHCP, IPAM systems. IPAM is often confused with DDI ([[DNS]]/[[DHCP]]/IPAM), of which it's a single component.

Some IPAM applications are provided as part of a DDI system, examples are offerings from [[Cisco Systems]], [[SolarWinds]], [[Men &amp; Mice]] and [[Microsoft]]. Others integrate with other standalone DNS and DHCP services.

Additional functionality, such as controlling reservations in DHCP and other data aggregation and reporting capabilities, is also common. Data tracked by an IPAM system may include information such as IP addresses in use, the devices an IP is assigned to at what time, as well as to which user an IP was assigned. This information can also support troubleshooting and abuse investigations. 

IPAM tools are increasingly important as new [[IPv6]] networks are deployed with larger address pools, different subnetting techniques and more complex 128-bit [[hexadecimal]] numbers, which are not as easily human-readable as [[IPv4]] addresses.&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/ipv6-address-design |title=Jeff Doyle on IP Routing: IPv6 Address Design |first=Jeff |last=Doyle |date=January 28, 2011 |publisher=[[Network World|Network World, Inc]] |location=Framingham, MA |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPv6 networking, mobile computing, and multihoming require more dynamic address management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12859">'''Joseph Pivato''' (born February 1946, in [[Tezze sul Brenta]], Italy) is a Canadian writer and academic who first established the critical recognition of [[Italian-Canadian]] literature and changed perceptions of [[Canadian literature|Canadian writing]].

==Biography==

He was born Giuseppe Pivato in Tezze sul Brenta, a town about 40&amp;nbsp;km north of Venice, Italy. His mother was from [[Udine]] in the Friuli region east of Venice. This Italian origin was to have a profound influence on his whole life and career as a writer, researcher and academic. The family emigrated to [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, in 1952 where the Catholic nuns changed his name to Joseph. He attended [[St. Michael's College School]], an academic high school for boys, where he studied languages and literature. He enrolled at [[York University]] where he studied with modernist scholar, D.E.S. Maxwell, feminist and medievalist, Beryl Rowland, feminist scholar, Johanna H. Stuckey, Canadian writer, [[Irving Layton]], met  French poet Hedi Bouraoui and poet-critic, [[Eli Mandel]]. With D.E.S. Maxwell he enrolled in the first course in African Literature (1969). In the summers he worked with Italian bricklayers to help pay for his university fees. In 1968 he founded and edited the first literary magazine at York, ''Voodoo Poetry'' at Vanier College. In 1970 he earned a B.A. (Combined Honours, English and French) from York and moved to Edmonton to study Comparative Literature at the [[University of Alberta]]. His 1971 M.A. thesis was on [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]].  Writer and academic [[E.D. Blodgett]]  was his advisor for his Ph.D. thesis on hermetic poetry.  He also met Canadian writers [[Henry Kreisel]] and [[Sheila Watson (writer)|Sheila Watson]] and began to work on Canadian authors publishing his first critical essay in ''Canadian Literature'' (1973, editor George Woodcock) while he was still a graduate student. At the end of his doctoral program (1977) he began to work at  [[Athabasca University]], a distance education institution modeled after the British Open University. At Athabasca he helped to develop the first courses in English literature, Canadian Literature, Comparative Literature and theory. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1986.  He was founding president of the [[Association of Italian-Canadian Writers]](1986) which advances the work of these ethnic minority authors through critical publications, biennial conferences, book launches and literary readings across Canada and in Italy. At Athabasca Pivato was Chair of the Centre for Language and Literature on three separate occasions and developed the first courses in creative writing. In 2010 he was founding professor of the new M.A. in Literary Studies which is part of the MA-IS program. He is married to Alberta psychologist, writer, academic and disabilities advocate Dr. Emma Pivato. Their children include Dr. Marcus J. Pivato, Prof. of Economics, University of Cergy-Pontoise (Paris, France), and Juliana Pivato, Artist and Academic in Toronto.  Emma Pivato's novels include ''Blind Sight Solution'' (Chicago: Cozy Cat Press, 2013) ''The Crooked Knife'' (2014) ''Roscoe's Revenge'' (2014) ''Jessie Knows'' (2015) ''Murder on Highway 2'' (2016) and ''Deadly Care'' (2016). Since July, 2015, he has been Professor Emeritus at Athabasca University.

==Scholarly work in Comparative Literature==

Joseph Pivato promotes Italian-Canadian writing by using the theories of [[Comparative Literature]]. As a literature which exists in three languages: English, French and Italian, it lends itself to discussions on translation, influences, ethnic identity, migration and appropriation. His discovery began in 1978 when his poems were included in ''Roman Candles'', the first anthology of Italian-Canadian poets edited by Pier Giorgio DiCicco. This inspired him to present the first paper on Italian-Canadian writers at a national conference at Dalhousie University, Halifax in May, 1981. This paper was rejected by several journals and was eventually published as "The Arrival of Italian-Canadian Writing," in ''Canadian Ethnic Studies'' 14,1 (1982).

In 1984 Pivato was Research Fellow in the Ethnic and Immigration Studies Program at the [[University of Toronto]]. This fellowship was at the invitation of Prof. Robert F. Harney, Academic Director (1976–89) of the Multicultual History Society of Ontario at U.of T.  In Toronto he edited his first book, ''Contrasts: Comparative Essays on Italian-Canadian Writing'' (1985)  which became a seminal volume for the promotion of ethnic minority literature in Canada. He conceived and co-edited the "Italian-Canadian Connections" issue of ''Canadian Literature'' 106 (1985).  Pivato spent the year 1987-88 at York University in the Mariano Elia Chair in Italian-Canadian Studies where he developed and taught the first course on Italian-Canadian writers. The Research Institute for Comparative Literature in Edmonton invited him to edit ''Literatures of Lesser Diffusion'' (1990),  the first collection of studies of writing by 20 different ethnic groups in Canada. In 1991 he was Canadian Visiting Fellow at [[Macquarie University]] in Sydney, Australia. This sojourn resulted in the publication of  ''Echo: Essays on Other Literatures'' (1994), a collection of original critical studies on Comparative Literature and minority writing, translation, oral influences on writing, ethnic women writers, and other topics. The critical foreword is by feminist scholar, Sneja Gunew (Deakin &amp; U.B.C.). He returned to ''Canadian Ethnic Studies'' in 1996 by editing a special issue on "Literary Theory and Ethnic Minority Writing." The major volume Pivato edited was ''The Anthology of Italian-Canadian Writing'' (1998) which included 53 authors working in English, French or Italian and which has been used as a text in many college and university courses. Among the authors included are F.G. Paci, Linda Hutcheon, Nino Ricci, Pasquale Verdicchio, Mary di Michele, Fulvio Caccia and Marco Micone. Pivato's poetry has appeared in ''Poetry Canada Review, ''Seven Persons Repository, ''Manna, ''Canadian Ethnic Studies," and his short fiction in ''Threshold'' (1999) and ''Passages'' (2002).

Pivato was in the forefront of research and advocacy for a multicultural view of Canadian literature. Writer and academic George Elliott Clarke points to his work as an example that other ethnic minority writers should follow in establishing a distinct identity for their publications. Pivato has been a visiting speaker and researcher at the [[University of Udine]] several times and has contributed to conferences and publication at their Centro di Cultura Canadese founded by Prof. Anna Pia De Luca. He focused some of his research on Canadian writers with backgrounds in Friuli.  In 2004 he was visiting fellow at the [[University of Wollongong]], Australia, where he collaborated with Prof. Gaetano Rando. Over the years Pivato has been an invited speaker at the [[University of Calgary]], the [[University of Toronto]], The [[University of Montreal]], [[Laurentian University]],  the [[California State University, Long Beach]],  the [[University of Warwick]], U.K. the [[University of Venice]], the [[University of Melbourne]] and other institutions.

From 2000 to 2011 he was general editor of the Essential Writers Series with [[Antonio D’Alfonso]] at Guernica Editions (Toronto and Montreal). He is now sole editor of this Writers Series. By 2018 the series had reached an impressive 49 volumes, each a monograph on a Canadian author including: [[Sheila Watson (writer)|Sheila Watson]], [[Sharon Pollock]], [[Caterina Edwards]], [[Aritha Van Herk]], [[Gail Scott (writer)|Gail Scott]], [[Robert Kroetsch]], [[David Adams Richards]], [[Nicole Brossard]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Anne Hébert]], [[Gary Geddes]], [[Joy Kogawa]], [[Mary di Michele]], [[Dany Laferriere]], and [[Jack Hodgins]]. Each is edited by a prominent academic such as Lianne Moyes, Anne Nothof, Louise H. Forsyth, Monique Tschofen, [[Christl Verduyn]], Nicole Markotic, Jolene Armstrong and Sheena L. Wilson. In 2008 he first identified the Sherbrooke School of Comparative Canadian Literature as instrumental in the development and study of Canadian writing in English, French and translations, and later published this new proposal in 2011. He edited the critical anthology, ''Africadian Atlantic: Essays on George Elliott Clarke'' (2012), the first book devoted to this important African-Canadian author. He edited, ''Sheila Watson: Essays on Her Works'' (2015), the first book to examine all of Watson's work as a writer, editor and mentor. In 2018 Pivato co-edited with Giulia De Gasperi ''Comparative Literature for the New Century'' the first Canadian text in Comparative Literature. It promotes the field from a pluralistic approach with the study of different languages and literatures. Most of the 20 contributors are bilingual Canadian academics.

At the Athabasca University site for faculty research Pivato has posted 12 of his recently published essays on ethnic minority writing in Canada. Joseph Pivato created and maintains the Canadian Writers site at Athabasca University, the extensive research site on the authors of Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8996">The '''Mesoamerican language area''' is a ''[[sprachbund]]'' containing many of the languages natively spoken in the cultural area of [[Mesoamerica]]. This sprachbund is defined by an array of syntactic, lexical and phonological traits as well as a number of ethnolinguistic traits found in the [[Mesoamerican languages|languages of Mesoamerica]], which belong to a number of language families, such as [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] and [[Mixe–Zoque languages]] as well as some [[language isolate]]s and unclassified languages known to the region.

==History of Mesoamerican areal linguistics==
The similarities noted between many of the languages of Mesoamerica have led linguistic scholars to propose the constitution of a sprachbund, from as early as 1959.&lt;ref&gt;by Juan Hasler in a paper called "Una Lingüistica Meso-americana" Published in the journal "La Palabra y el Hombre" Published by the University of Jalapa, Vera Cruz&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was not consolidated until 1986, however, when [[Lyle Campbell]], [[Terrence Kaufman]] and Thomas Smith-Stark employed a rigid linguistic analysis to demonstrate that the similarities between a number of languages were indeed considerable, with the conclusion that their origins were very likely caused by diffusion rather than inheritance, the standard criteria for defining a sprachbund.

In their 1986 paper "Meso-America as a Linguistic Area"&lt;ref&gt;(Language 62 Vol. 3. 530-558)&lt;/ref&gt; the above authors explored several proposed areal features of which they discarded most as being weakly attested, possibly by chance or inheritance or not confined to the Mesoamerican region. However, five traits in particular were shown to be widely-attested among the languages, with boundaries coinciding with that of the Mesoamerican region and having a probable origin through diffusion. They then compared the five traits with the traits defining other language areas considered to be well-established, like the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] and [[Balkan language area]]. They concluded that by comparison the proposed Mesoamerican language area could indeed be considered a well-founded area: arguably "among the very strongest that are known" (Campbell, Kaufman &amp; Smith-Stark. 1986 p.&amp;nbsp;556).

They also argued that some of the discarded traits might also be taken into consideration as strengthening the proposal, but they were not sufficient by themselves to act as foundation and other well-documented traits of a more [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] character might not be considerable as traits that are linguistic but cultural.

== Traits defining the Mesoamerican language area==

The following is a brief description of the linguistic traits considered by Campbell, Kaufman and Smith-Stark as defining the Mesoamerican language area.

===Nominal possession===
Many of the Mesoamerican languages show a particular kind of construction for possession of nominals. The commonly found construction is ''"his noun1 noun2"'' meaning ''"noun2's noun1"'' ("his" often is a prefix in this construction). For example, in the [[K'iche' language]], a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]], ''u-tzi' le achih'' "the man's dog" literally means "his-dog the man". The similar construction in [[Nahuatl]] would be ''i:-itskʷin in tɬaːkatɬ''.

===Relational nouns===

Another trait shared by nearly all Mesoamerican languages is [[relational noun]]s. Relational nouns are used to express spatial and other relations, much like prepositions in most [[Indo-European languages]] but composed of a noun and possessive affixes.

:For example in [[Pipil language|Pipil]] (Uto-Aztecan):

:''nu-wa:n'' "with me" (''nu''- means "my")
:''mu-wa:n'' "with you" (''mu''- means "yours")
:''i-wa:n''  "with her" (''i''- means "his/her/its")

:Or in [[Mam language|Mam]] (Mayan):
:''n-wits-a'' "on me" (''n''- means "my")
:''t-wits''  "on her" (''t''- means "his/her/its").

===Pied-piping with inversion===

[[Pied-piping with inversion]] is a special word order found in wh-questions.  It appears to be found in all Mesoamerican languages, but is rare outside Mesoamerica.

===Vigesimal numeral system===

All the languages of Mesoamerica have [[vigesimal]], or base twenty numeral systems. This system has also spread to some languages just outside the Mesoamerican cultural area.

===Non-verb-final syntax and absence of switch-reference===
No language with verb-final basic word order is attested in Mesoamerica even though most of the languages bordering on Mesoamerica are verb final ([[subject–object–verb|SOV]]). Also no languages with [[switch reference]] are attested in Mesoamerica, but this is supposed by Campbell, Kaufman and Smith-Stark to be a secondary effect of the Mesoamerican languages not being verb final.

===Widespread semantic calques===

A strong evidence of diffusion throughout Mesoamerica is provided by a number of semantic [[calques]] widely found throughout the area.

For example in many Mesoamerican languages the words for specific objects are constructed by compounding two different stems, and in many cases these two stems are semantically identical although linguistically unrelated.

Among these calques are:
*''leg-head'' meaning "knee"
*''deer-snake'' meaning "boa constrictor"
*''stone-ash'' meaning "limestone"
*''hand-neck'' meaning "wrist"
*''bird-stone'' meaning "egg"
*''blood-road'' meaning "vein"
*''grind-stone'' meaning "molar"
*''mouth'' meaning "edge"
*''god-excrement or sun-excrement'' meaning "precious metal"
*''hand-mother'' meaning "thumb"
*''water-mountain'' meaning "town"

==Other traits==
Other traits found in Mesoamerican languages, but not found by Campbell, Kaufman and Smith-Stark to be prominent enough to be conclusive for the proposal of the language area are:
*[[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] of bodypart nouns into verbs
*derivation of [[locative case]] forms from bodypart nouns&lt;ref&gt;The anthology edited by Lourdes de Leon and Thomas B Haviland deals extensively with the subject of likenesses and differences in spatial description in different [[Mesoamerican languages]]

'''Microsoft Bookshelf''' was a [[Reference work|reference]] collection introduced in 1987 as part of [[Microsoft]]'s extensive work in promoting [[CD-ROM]] technology as a distribution medium for [[electronic publishing]].  The original [[MS-DOS]] version showcased the massive storage capacity of CD-ROM technology, and was accessed while the user was using one of 13 different word processor programs that Bookshelf supported.  Subsequent versions were produced for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and became a commercial success as part of the [[Microsoft Home]] brand.  It was often bundled with [[personal computer]]s as a cheaper alternative to the [[Microsoft Encarta|Encarta Suite]]. The Encarta Deluxe Suite / Reference Library versions also bundled Bookshelf.

==Content==
Microsoft Bookshelf was discontinued in 2000. In later editions of the Encarta suite (Encarta 2000 and onwards), Bookshelf was replaced with a dedicated ''Encarta Dictionary'', a superset of the printed edition. There has been some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in Bookshelf which many found to be a useful reference, such as the dictionary of quotations (replaced with a quotations section in ''Encarta'' that links to relevant articles and people) and the Internet Directory, although the directory is now a [[wikt:moot point|moot point]] since many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist.

The original 1987 edition contained ''[[Roget's Thesaurus|The Original Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases]]'', ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', [[World Almanac]] and Book of Facts, [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]], [[The Chicago Manual of Style]] (13th Edition), the U.S. ZIP Code Directory, Houghton Mifflin Usage Alert, [[Houghton Mifflin]] Spelling Verifier and Corrector, Business Information Sources, and Forms and Letters.&lt;ref name="Bookshelf 87"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computers for Lawyers|work=Chapter 25|first=Paul|last=Bernstein|publisher=ATLA Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-941916-64-2}}|year=1992|isbn=0-941916-64-2|accessdate=2006-04-18|url=http://www.cyberbarassociation.net/cfl/book/chpt25.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504152218/http://www.cyberbarassociation.net/cfl/book/chpt25.htm|archivedate=2006-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titles in non-US versions of Bookshelf were different. For example, the 1997 UK edition included the Chambers Dictionary, Bloomsbury Treasury of Quotations, and Hutchinson Concise Encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/software/722/bookshelf-british-reference-collection Bookshelf British Reference Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019005540/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/software/722/bookshelf-british-reference-collection |date=2009-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Windows release of Bookshelf added a number of new reference titles, including ''The Concise [[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' and an [[Web directory|Internet Directory]]. Other titles were added and some were dropped in subsequent years.  By 1994, the [[English language|English-language]] version also contained the ''[[Columbia Dictionary of Quotations]]''; ''The Concise [[Columbia Encyclopedia]]''; the ''[[Hammond Intermediate World Atlas]]''; and ''[[The People's Chronology]]''.&lt;ref name="Bookshelf 94"&gt;{{cite web

==Technology==

===Bookshelf 1.0 engine===
Bookshelf 1.0 used a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[hypertext]] engine that Microsoft acquired when it bought the company Cytation in 1986.&lt;ref name="Microsoft 1980s"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=A History of the Personal Computer: The People and the Technology 
 |work=Chapter 12 Microsoft in the 1980s
 |first=Roy|last=Allan|publisher=Allan Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|0-9689108-0-7}} |year=2001

 |url=http://www.retrocomputing.net/info/allan/eBook12.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also used for Microsoft Stat Pack and Microsoft Small Business Consultant, it was a [[Terminate and Stay Resident]] (TSR) program that ran alongside a dominant program, unbeknownst to the dominant program. Like Apple's similar [[Hypercard]] reader, Bookshelf engine's files used a single [[compound document]], containing large numbers of subdocuments ("cards" or "articles").  They both differ from current browsers which normally treat each "page" or "article" as a separate file.

Though similar to Apple's [[Hypercard]] reader in many ways, the Bookshelf engine had several key differences. Unlike Hypercard files, Bookshelf files required compilation and complex markup codes. This made the files more difficult to pirate, addressing a key concern of early electronic publishers. Furthermore, Bookshelf's engine was designed to run as fast as possible on slow first-generation [[CD-ROM]] drives, some of which required as much as a half-second to move the drive head. Such hardware constraints made Hypercard impractical for high-capacity CD-ROMs.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Bookshelf also had full text searching capability, which made it easy to find needed information.

===Bookshelf 2.0 engine===
Collaborating with [[DuPont]], the Microsoft CD-ROM division developed a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of its engine for applications as diverse as [[Document management system|document management]], [[online help]], and a CD-ROM [[encyclopedia]]. In a [[skunkworks project]], these developers worked secretly with Multimedia Division developers so that the engine would be usable for more ambitious multimedia applications. Thus they integrated a multimedia [[markup language]], [[full text search]], and extensibility using [[software componentry|software objects]],&lt;ref name="Viewer 2.0"&gt;{{cite book|
  title=Microsoft Multimedia Viewer How-To Cd: Create Exciting Multimedia With Video, Animation, Music, and Speech for Windows/Book and Cd|
  last=Pruitt|first=Stephen|publisher=Waite Group Pr|isbn=1-878739-60-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are commonplace in modern internet browsing.

In 1992, Microsoft started selling the Bookshelf engine to third-party developers, marketing the product as Microsoft Multimedia Viewer. The idea was that such a tool would help a burgeoning growth of CD-ROM titles that would spur demand for Windows. Although the engine had multimedia capabilities that would not be matched by Web browsers until the late 1990s, Microsoft Viewer did not enjoy commercial success as a standalone product. However, Microsoft continued to use the engine for its [[Encarta]] and [[WinHelp]] applications, though the multimedia functions are rarely used in Windows help files.

===Viewer 3.0===
In 1993, the developers who were working on the next generation viewer were moved to the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo systems group]] which was charged with delivering [[Bill Gates]]' 'vision' of 'Information at your fingertips'.  This advanced browser was a fully componentized application using what are now known as [[Component Object Model]] objects, designed for hypermedia browsing across large networks and whose main competitor was thought to be [[Lotus Notes]].  Long before Netscape appeared, this team, known as the WEB (web enhanced browser) team had already shipped a network capable hypertext browser capable of doing everything that HTML browsers would not be able to do until the turn of the century.  Nearly all technologies of Cairo shipped.  The WEB browser was not one of them, though it influenced the design of many other common Microsoft technologies.

==Reception==
''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' in 1989 listed Microsoft Bookshelf as among the "Excellence" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it "is the first substantial application of CD-ROM technology" and "a harbinger of personal library systems to come".&lt;ref name="byte198901"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=January 1989 |title=The BYTE Awards |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1989-01/1989_01_BYTE_14-01_PC_Communications_and_Annual_Awards_and_Digitizing_Tablets#page/n371/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Mataung'''''&lt;ref&gt;1953 (4) SA 35 (O).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African law]], heard and decided in the Orange Free State Provincial Division on 13 August 1953. Brink J wrote the judgment; Van Blerk J concurred.

== Facts ==
The accused had pleaded guilty to and been convicted of [[arson]], in that he had set alight a grass hut.

== Judgment ==
On review, the Orange Free State Provincial Division held that, in the absence of evidence that the hut was of an immovable nature, the conviction and the sentence should be set aside. The court referred to and applied the decision of Innes CJ in ''[[R v Mabula]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1927 AD 161.&lt;/ref&gt; which held that the [[property]] affected had to have been [[immovable property]] for the definition of arson to be met.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] promoted a [[Good Neighbor policy|"good neighbor" policy]] that sought better relations with Mexico.  In 1935, a [[federal judge]] ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law.  Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white.  The [[U.S. State Department|State Department]], the Census Bureau, the [[U.S. Labor Department|Labor Department]], and other [[government agencies]] therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white.  This policy encouraged the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick D. Lukens, ''A Quiet Victory for Latino Rights: FDR and the Controversy over Whiteness'' (University of Arizona Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14041">'''[[Renaissance humanism]]''' (15th and 16th century) saw a resurgence in '''[[hermeticism]]''' and [[Neo-Platonic]] varieties of '''[[ceremonial magic]]'''.

==Artes magicae==
The seven ''artes magicae'' or ''artes prohibitae'', arts prohibited by canon law, as expounded by [[Johannes Hartlieb]] in 1456, their sevenfold partition reflecting that of the [[artes liberales]] and [[artes mechanicae]], were:
#[[nigromancy]] ("[[black magic]]", [[demonology]], derived, by [[folk etymology|popular etymology]], from ''[[necromancy]]'')
#[[geomancy]]
#[[hydromancy]]
#[[aeromancy]]
#[[pyromancy]]
#[[chiromancy]]
#[[scapulimancy]]

The division between the four "elemental" disciplines (viz., geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy,  pyromancy) is somewhat contrived. Chiromancy is the divination from a subject's palms as practiced by the [[Romani people|Romani]] (at the time recently arrived in Europe), and scapulimancy is the divination from animal bones, in particular shoulder blades, as practiced in peasant [[superstition]]. Nigromancy contrasts with this as scholarly "high magic" derived from High Medieval [[grimoire]]s such as the ''[[Picatrix]]'' or the ''[[Liber Rasielis]]''.

===Necromancy===
[[Necromancy]] or demonic magic is a black art usually performed in the night dealing with dark phenomena such as raising the dead. Using necromancy for divination is through a genocide using blood and corpses. Due to these acts, it is forbidden and goes against the Christian faith. The art and practitioners are not received well in philosophy as it destroy religion and taints a person's morals. Since demons enjoy blood, practitioners would experiment with human blood and flesh to obtain a demon's service. Hydromancy can be used alongside necromancy using the purity of children five to seven years old, repeating after their master's incantation over human blood or bones. The product deceives others through illusions such as transforming a person into animals.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorndike|first1=Lynn|title=A History of Magic and Experimental Science|date=1923|publisher=Macmillan|pages=319–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners in the late Middle Ages usually belonged to the educated elites due to the contents being written in Latin onto books. Demonic magic was usually performed in groups surrounding a spiritual leader in possession of necromantic books. One such case in 1444, Inquisitor Gaspare Sighicelli took action against a group active in Bologna.

===Geomancy===
The art of [[geomancy]] was one of the more popular forms of magic that people practiced during the renaissance period. Geomancy was a form of divination where a person would cast sand, stone, or dirt on the ground and read the shapes. The [[Geomantic figures]] would then tell them "anything" based on geomancy charts that were used to read from the shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A history of magic and experimental science|last=Thorndike|first=Lynn|publisher=Macmillan|year=1923|isbn=9780231088008|location=New York|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydromancy===
[[Hydromancy]], a form of divination using water is typically used with [[scrying]]. Water is used as a medium for scrying to allow the practitioner see illusionary pictures within it. Hydromancy originated from Babylonia and was popular during Byzantine times whereas in medieval Europe, it was associated with witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luck|first1=Georg|title=Arcana Mundi : Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|page=312|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aeromancy===
[[Aeromancy]] divination consisted in tossing sand, dirt, or seeds into the air and studying and interpreting the patterns of the dust cloud or the settling of the seeds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luck|first1=Georg|title=Arcana Mundi : Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|page=311|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes divination coming from thunder, comets, falling stars, and the shape of clouds.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"/&gt;

===Pyromancy===
[[Pyromancy]] is the art of divination which consisted of signs and patterns from flames. There are many variations of pyromancy depending on the material thrown into a fire and it is thought to be used for sacrifices to the gods and that the deity is present within the flames with priests interpreting the omens conveyed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Chiromancy===
[[Chiromancy]] is a form of divination based on reading palms and based on intuitions and symbolism with some symbols tying into astrology. A line from a person's hand that resembles a square is considered a bad omen whereas a triangle would be a good omen. This idea comes from the trine and square aspect in the [[Astrological aspect|astrological aspects.]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luck|first1=Georg|title=Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|page=314|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scapulimancy===
[[Scapulimancy]] was a form of divination using an animal's scapula. The scapula would be broken and based on how it was broken, it could be used to read the future. It was generally broken by heating it with hot coals until it broke.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Arcana Mundi : Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts|last1=Luck|first1=Georg|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|edition=2nd|pages=311–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance occultism==
Both bourgeoisie and nobility in the 15th and 16th century showed great fascination with 
these arts, which exerted an exotic charm by their ascription to Arabic, Jewish, Romani, and Egyptian sources. There was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of vain superstition, blasphemous occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual. Intellectual and spiritual tensions erupted in the Early Modern [[witch-hunt|witch craze]], further reinforced by the turmoils of the  [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], especially in [[Germany]], [[England]], and [[Scotland]]. The people during this time found that the existence of magic was something that could answer the questions that they could not explain through science. To them it was suggesting that while science may explain reason, magic could explain "unreason".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawes|first=Gregory|date=|title=The Rationality of Renaissance Magic|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.libproxy.mst.edu/article/537218|journal=Paregon|volume=30|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. S. Lewis]] in his 1954 ''English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, Excluding Drama''  differentiates what he takes to be the change of character in magic as practiced in the Middle Ages as opposed to the Renaissance:
:{{Quotation|Only an obstinate prejudice about this period could blind us to a certain change which comes over the merely literary texts as we pass from the Middle Ages to the sixteenth century. In medieval stories there is, in one sense, plenty of “magic”. Merlin does this or that “by his subtilty”, [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|Bercilak]] resumes his severed head. But all these passages have unmistakably the note of “faerie” about them. But in Spenser, Marlowe, Chapman, and Shakespeare the subject is treated quite differently. “He to his studie goes”; books are opened, terrible words pronounced, souls imperiled. The medieval author seems to write for a public to whom magic, like knight-errantry, is part of the furniture of romance: the Elizabethan, for a public who feel that it might be going on in the next street. [...] Neglect of this point has produced strange readings of ''[[The Tempest]]'', which is in reality [...] Shakespeare’s play on ''[[magic (paranormal)|magia]]'' as ''[[Macbeth]]'' is his play on ''[[goeteia]]''  (p. 8)}}

The Hermetic/Cabalist magic which was created by [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Marsilio Ficino]] was made popular in northern Europe, most notably England, by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s De ''occulta philosophia libra tres''.  Agrippa had revolutionary ideas about magical theory and procedure that were widely  circulated in the Renaissance among those who sought out knowledge of occult philosophy.
"Agrippa himself was famous as a scholar, physician jurist, and astrologer, but throughout his life he was continually persecuted as a heretic. His problems stemmed not only from his reputation as a conjurer, but also from his vehement criticism of the vices of the ruling classes and of the most respected intellectual and religious authorities."
While some scholars and students viewed Agrippa as a source of intellectual inspiration, to many others, his practices were dubious and his beliefs serious. 
The transitive side of magic is explored in Agrippa's ''De occulta philosophia'', and at times it is vulgarized.  Yet in Pico and Ficino we never lose sight of magic's solemn religious purposes: the magician explores the secrets of nature so as to arouse wonder at the works of God and to inspire a more ardent worship and love of the Creator.
"Considerable space is devoted to examples of evil sorcery in De occulta philosophia, and one might easily come away from the treatise with the impression that Agrippa found witchcraft as intriguing as benevolent magic"&lt;ref name="Source"&gt;John S. Mebane, ''Renaissance Magic &amp; the Return of the Golden Age'', Lincoln, University of Nebraska Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroque period==
The study of the occult arts remained widespread in the universities across Europe up until the Disenchantment period of the 17th Century. {{Citation needed|reason=What is the "disenchantment period?"|date=March 2016}} At the peak of the [[witch trials]], there was a certain danger to be associated with [[witchcraft]] or [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], and most learned authors take pains to  clearly renounce the practice of forbidden arts. Thus, Agrippa while admitting that [[natural magic]] is the highest form of natural philosophy unambiguously rejects all forms of [[ceremonial magic]] ([[goetia]] or [[necromancy]]). Indeed, the keen interest taken by intellectual circles in occult topics provided one driving force that enabled the witchhunts to endure beyond the Renaissance and into the 18th century.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a matter of interpretation and needs a reputable source to support it.|date=December 2013}} As the intellectual mainstream in the early 18th century ceased to believe in witchcraft, the witch trials soon subsided.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a broad statement and needs a reputable source with statistical proof to support it.|date=December 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5356">'''Shovavim''' (Hebrew: שובבי"ם ) is a Hebrew [[acronym]] for the Jewish [[weekly Torah portion|parshioth]] ([[Torah]] portions) of "[[Shemot (parsha)|Shemot]]", "[[Va'eira|Va'era]]", "[[Bo (parsha)|Bo]]", "[[Beshalach|B'Shallach]]", "[[Yitro (parsha)|Yitro]]" and "[[Mishpatim]]". The Hebrew word that is formed from the initials of these names means "mischief-makers." This word appears in Jeremiah 3:22, which begins: "Return o' mischief makers" (שׁוּבוּ בָּנִים שׁוֹבָבִים). During a Jewish leap-year this period is extended to an eight-week period called "Shovavim Tat", derived by adding the next two portions, "[[Terumah (parsha)|Terumah]]" and "[[Tetzaveh]]", to the list. The period in which these portions are read typically falls around [[Tevet]]-[[Shevat]] in the [[Hebrew Calendar]] (corresponding to January–February).

Shovavim is a season when the [[Kabballah|Kabbalists]] teach that it is auspicious to repent for sins ("mischief"), especially for sexually-related transgressions. During these weeks, it is customary to be more careful not to violate any of the sexually-related transgressions commanded in the [[Torah]]. Some have the customs of studying laws relating to such transgressions, [[Ta'anit|fasting]] and giving extra ''[[tzedakah]]'' during this time, and of reciting [[Selichot|Selichos]] and other ''tikkunim'' (Kabbalistic prayers or meditations) designed to counteract their harmful effects. On the [[Shabbat]]ot (Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath) when these weekly portions of the Torah are read, some take upon themselves to refrain from speaking, except words of prayer and [[Torah]]. This type of fast is called a ''ta'anit dibbur'' (תענית דבור).

The origin to these customs is based on Jewish [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] teachings and therefore [[Sephardic]] and [[Hassidic]] Jews are more likely to follow them than their [[Ashkenazic]] counterparts.

== Fasting ==
During the Shovavim period, some Jewish individuals have the custom to fast every Monday and Thursday from dawn until dusk. Some fast on Friday (the eve of [[Shabbat]]) until the afternoon.

==Prayer==
There are extra prayers added called "''Tikkun Shovavim''" during these weeks. Some have the custom of praying more prayers and reading extra Psalms during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginsburgh|first1=Rabbi Yitzchak|title=הזמן הפנימי|publisher=Gal Einai Publications|isbn=978-965-7146-90-3|page=148|edition=First|language=Hebrew|quote=במקומות רבים עדיין מציינים היום את ימי השובבים, ונוהגים להרבות בתפלה בימים אלו, ובפרט באמירת מזמורי תהלים (שכחם יפה בכל עת).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Ta'anit Dibbur'' ==
A special type of fast called a ''ta'anit dibbur'' is observed by some during the Shovavim period. This does not involve refraining from eating and drinking, but from speaking. During the entire day (usually Shabbat, when regular fasting is prohibited), between sunrise and dusk, one refrains from superfluous speech. Speaking words of prayer and Torah is permitted. Some Jewish congregations gather on the Shabbat when these speech fasts are held, to read the entire book of Psalms three times (a total of 450 psalms). At an average pace, this reading can take up to ten hours. This is usually accomplished between the Shabbat morning meal and the afternoon prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=shovavim.pdf|url=http://www.koshertorah.com/PDF/shovavim.pdf|website=Kosher Torah|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Lubavitch tradition==
In the [[Lubavitch]] hassidic tradition, no mention is made of shovavim. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson wrote, "there is no mention in the basic books of Chabad hassidism that refer to the fasts of shovavim, the word shovavim does not even appear. Because the main rectification through these fasts was already concluded by the first generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=גינזבורג|first1=יצחק|title=הזמן הפנימי|publisher=Gal Einai Publications|isbn=978-965-7146-90-3|page=148|language=Hebrew|quote=שלא נזכר בספרי יסוד חסידות חב"ד על דבר תעניות שובבי"ם, ואפילו לא העניין, התיבה [המלה] שובבי"ם! כי עיקר התיקון ע"י תעניתים אלו כבר נסתיים בדורות הראשונים}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1788">'''Starting Point Directory''' is a human edited general [[web directory]] that provides [[website]]s organized by topic. 

It was founded in 1995 by an early Internet pioneer Frank Addante as a [[web search engine|search engine]] and a directory. The Starting Point Directory was unusual in 1995 in that sites that were listed in the directory would place voting links on their pages. At the end of each month, the site in each category that received the most votes would receive a hot site award and would be profiled in the directory. The site rose in popularity and in 1997 was the seventh most popular Internet site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Noam |last=Wasserman |first2=Antony |last2=Uy |title=Frank Addante, Serial Entrepreneur |url=http://hbr.org/product/frank-addante-serial-entrepreneur/an/809046-PDF-ENG |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |date=September 10, 2008 |accessdate=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was then sold to a [[CMGI]] company, [[Yesmail]], only to be acquired later by Techlabs, Inc. in 1999. The directory was not a priority while under Techlabs ownership and was not actively edited or maintained.

In 2006, the directory was sold to a new owner and was re-launched as a human edited directory. Starting Point Directory employs paid editors that review each site and apply a set of quality guidelines to each listing.

'''TV Links''' was a [[User-generated content|user contributed]] [[Web directory|online video directory]] for [[television program]]mes, [[film]]s, and [[music video]]s.&lt;ref name="imnocriminal"/&gt; In a similar style to [[BitTorrent tracker]]s such as [[The Pirate Bay]], video content was not hosted by TV Links. Instead, videos were hosted by third-party [[video sharing]] websites. The website was operated as a hobby by David Rock of [[Cheltenham]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="imnocriminal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/29/no_master_criminal/ |title=TV-Links man: 'I'm no master criminal' |publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2007, the website's servers, located in the [[Netherlands]], were raided and shut down by [[Gloucestershire]] police in cooperation with the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (FACT) in response to complaints received from major [[United States|US]] [[film studio]]s about TV Links.&lt;ref name="imnocriminal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds-tvlinksshutdown" /&gt; No official clarification has been made to date as to why the website was shut down. Simultaneously, David Rock was arrested, and later released pending further investigation, without being charged with a crime.&lt;ref name="imnocriminal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Register-TVLinks-trademark-laws"/&gt; Although FACT initially stated that the raid was performed because of allegations of [[copyright infringement]], it later stated that Rock was arrested for [[trademark infringement]].&lt;ref name="Register-TVLinks-trademark-laws"/&gt;

==History==
TV Links launched on October 2006,&lt;ref name="month-old" /&gt; following a surge in services of its kind. At that time, it provided [[hyperlink]]s to videos on video sharing websites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061205100409/www.tv-links.co.uk/24_links.html Example of old hyperlink listing style]&lt;/ref&gt;

On about March 20, 2007, the website was updated to use a [[HTTP stream|streaming]] web-based [[Media player (application software)|video player]], and direct external links were no longer made available.&lt;ref name="imnocriminal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flvs"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5f6tM2cpA Downloading Flvs/direct Urls., About downloading and direct links.], TV Links forum announcements&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="player"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5f2CtMXJl Archived video player page]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shutdown and arrests by UK government ===
On October 18, 2007, owner David Rock was arrested by the [[Gloucestershire Constabulary|Gloucestershire police]] in cooperation with the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (FACT), and the website was shut down.&lt;ref name="fact-tv-links-website-owner-arrested"&gt;[http://www.fact-uk.org.uk/site/latest_news/October2007.htm "TV LINKS WEBSITE OWNER ARRESTED FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT "], ''FACT'', October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shut-down"&gt;[http://blog.p2pvine.com/tv-linkscouk-forced-offline-and-owner-arrested/ tv-links.co.uk forced offline and owner arrested] at www.p2pvine.com (accessed October 2007, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial claims by FACT indicated the arrest was made due to offenses of facilitating [[copyright infringement]]. However, it was later made clear that the arrest was over a matter of possible [[trademark infringement]].&lt;ref name="Register-TVLinks-trademark-laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/23/tv_links_trademark_law/ |title=TV-Links man was arrested under trademark laws |author=Lucy Sherriff |work= [[The Register]] |date= 23 October 2007 |accessdate= 9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fact-tv-links-website-owner-arrested"/&gt;

In a statement issued by FACT following the events, local [[trading standards]] head [[Roger Marles]] implied that the website's update from [[hyperlink]]s to a streaming video player might have affected the shutdown. He stated that the arrest and shutdown were initiated because TV Links allowed users "[to view] any one of a large number of films and television programmes directly via the website. This is illegal under [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom|UK copyright law]]."&lt;ref name="fact-tv-links-website-owner-arrested"/&gt;

Whilst arrested under Section 92 of the [[Trade Marks Act 1994]],&lt;ref name="Register-TVLinks-trademark-laws"/&gt; he has now been released "pending further investigation" with no charges filed against him.&lt;ref name="Register-TVLinks-trademark-laws" /&gt; Section 92 has been used to prosecute illegal copiers of CDs and DVDs, but never in the absence of a physical storage medium. It is unclear whether the operation of TV Links was actually a crime under UK law.&lt;ref name="AndersonWhyArrestedGuardian"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/oct/25/piracy.intellectualproperty |title= Why was someone arrested over the TV Links website? |author= Kevin Anderson |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 25 October 2007 |quote= | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Rock stated that he would have not started the website if he had found anything in the laws of the country stating that what he was doing was illegal.&lt;ref name="imnocriminal"/&gt;

==Operation==
Video content that was used by the website was hosted by third-party [[video sharing]] websites. TV Links used [[hyperlink]]s, and later a streaming web-based video player, in order to link visitors to videos.

The website had a forum community with a membership of around 37,000 members at the time of closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019025841/http://www.tv-links.co.uk/index.html |date=October 19, 2007 |title=Official website }}&lt;/ref&gt; Links to videos were posted daily on the forums by members, and later moved to the website listings by admins.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071017175756/http://www.tv-links.co.uk/faq.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5f74tC4h3 Requests To Become] "''post links continuously''", How To Earn Link Hunter Status forum, TV Links&lt;/ref&gt;

After the video player was introduced, the website's crew enforced a strict policy against saving the provided video content, and viewing it outside the scope of its video player.&lt;ref name="flvs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; This policy was further enforced by a technical implementation, the [[URL]] that [[URL redirection|directed]] the video player to video files contained a randomly generated [[MD5]] encoded string, and was made to expire after several minutes, or after being loaded once.&lt;ref name="player" /&gt;

===Legal efforts===
The website's servers were purposely located in the [[Netherlands]] so that [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom|UK copyright law]] could not apply to them.&lt;ref name="ds-tvlinksshutdown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/broadcasting/a78397/tv-links-oink-shut-in-download-site-raids.html?locale|title=TV Links, OiNK shut in download site raids|last=West|first=Dave|date=October 24, 2007|publisher=DigitalSpy.co.uk|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eva Wiseman of ''[[The Guardian]]'' had described the practices of linking to copyrighted content as "teetering on the edge of illegality" in an article on similar video directory services.&lt;ref name="tvrevolution"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/feb/24/internet.newmedia |title=Eva Wiseman logs on to the sites staging a TV revolution |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2008-08-05 | location=London | date=February 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Please, do not add your non-notable video site here unless it has sourcing in line with relevant policies.

On the other hand, it has been speculated that concerns over the popularity of websites such as TV Links were an influence on the launch of official online [[video on demand]] services from Britain's terrestrial television networks, such as the [[BBC iPlayer]] and [[4od]].&lt;ref name="tvrevolution" /&gt;

'''''The Aesthetics of Resistance''''' ({{lang-de|Die Ästhetik des Widerstands}}, 1975-1981) is a [[three-volume novel]] by the German-born [[playwright]], [[novelist]], [[filmmaker]], and [[Painting|painter]] [[Peter Weiss]].

Spanning from the late 1930s into [[World War II]], this [[historical novel]] dramatizes [[anti-fascist]] resistance and the rise and fall of [[proletariat|proletarian]] political parties in Europe. Living in [[Berlin]] in 1937, the unnamed narrator and his peers, sixteen and seventeen-year-old [[working-class]] students, seek ways to express their hatred for the [[Nazi]] regime. They meet in [[museums]] and galleries, and in their discussions they explore the affinity between political resistance and art, the connection at the heart of Weiss's novel.

Weiss suggests that meaning lies in the refusal to renounce resistance, no matter how intense the oppression, and that it is in art that new models of political action and social understanding are to be found. The novel includes extended meditations on paintings, sculpture, and literature. Moving from the Berlin underground to the front lines of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and on to other parts of Europe, the story teems with characters, almost all of whom are based on historical figures.

The three volumes of the novel were originally published in 1975, 1978 and 1981.

== Plot ==
Weiss's complex multi-layered 1000 page novel has been called a "book of the century [Jahrhundertbuch]."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Fritz Haug and Kaspar Maase, "Vorwort." ''Materialistische Kulturtheorie und Alltagskultur''. Haug/Maase (eds.). Argument Verlag, 1980, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It can no more be usefully summarized than James Joyce's ''Ulysses''. By way of introducing ''The Aesthetics of Resistance'' what follows are the opening paragraphs of an article by Robert Cohen:

"''The Aesthetics of Resistance'' begins with an absence. Missing is [[Heracles]], the great hero of Greek mythology. The space he once occupied in the enormous stone frieze depicting the battle of the Giants against the Gods is empty. Some two thousand years ago the frieze covered the outer walls of the temple of [[Pergamon]] in [[Asia Minor]]. In the last third of the nineteenth century the remnants of the ancient monument were discovered by the German engineer [[Carl Humann]] and sent to Germany. The fragments were reassembled in the specially built [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin, the capital of Wilhelminian Germany, and were to signal from this point forward the late claims to power of German imperialism. The [[Pergamon frieze]] can still be seen in Berlin today. In the fall of 1937 – and here we are at the beginning of Peter Weiss's novel – three young men find themselves before the frieze. Two of them, Coppi and the narrator, whose name is never mentioned, are workers. The third, a sixteen-year-old named Heilmann, is a high school student. Coppi is a member of the illegal Communist Party, Heilmann and the narrator are sympathizers. All three are active in the antifascist resistance. In a lengthy discussion the three friends attempt to interpret the stone figures and events depicted in the frieze in a way which would make them relevant for their own present day struggle. They cannot, however, find Heracles. Other than a fragment of his name and the paw of a lion's skin, nothing remains of the leader of the Gods in the battle against the Giants. The "leader" of 1937, on the other hand, is an omnipresent force, even in the still halls of the Pergamon Museum, where uniformed SS troopers, their Nazi insignia clearly visible, mingle among the museum's visitors. Under the pressure of the present and with their lives in constant danger, the three young antifascists read the empty space in the frieze as an omen, they feel encouraged to fill it with their own representation of the absent half-god. What they envision is an alternative myth in stark contrast to the traditional image of Heracles. From a friend of the Gods, the mighty and the powerful, Heracles is transformed into a champion of the lowest classes, of the exploited, imprisoned, and tortured – a messianic "leader" in the struggle against the terror of the "Führer".&lt;br /&gt;

	The concept of a messianic bearer of hope is by no means unique in Weiss's work. Starting with the coachman in the experimental novel ''The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman'' (1952/1959), messianic figures appear repeatedly in Weiss's literary work. That Weiss would continue to be obsessed with such figures after he turned to Marxism in 1964/1965 may seem surprising. However, the concept now becomes increasingly secularized, as for example in the figure of Empedocles in the play ''Hölderlin'' (1971). In ''The Aesthetics of Resistance'' this process of secularization is brought to its logical conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;

	Before they reach this conclusion, however, readers of Weiss's novel are confronted with nearly a thousand pages of text interrupted only occasionally by a paragraph break – a sea of words which resists any attempt at summarizing. Even to characterize ''The Aesthetics of Resistance'' as an antifascist novel seems to unduly narrow the scope of Weiss's broad project. There is no clearly defined geographical or historical space within which events unfold. There is no unifying plot, and neither is there a chronological structure to the narrative. The novel presents a history of the European Left, from Marx and Engels to the post-war era, in countries as diverse as Germany and Sweden, the Soviet Union, France and Spain. Woven into the historical narratives and political discourses are extensive passages on works of art and literature from many centuries and from many European, and even non-European cultures – from the Pergamon frieze to the temple city of [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia, from [[Dürer]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]] to [[Géricault]] and [[Picasso]], from [[Dante]] to [[Kafka]], and from [[Surrealism]] and [[Dadaism]] to [[Socialist realism]]. The novel takes upon itself the enormous task of reinterpreting the great works of western culture from the perspective of the perennial victims of history and to fuse art and politics into one inseparable revolutionary unity.&lt;br /&gt;

	In its final section the novel contains one of the great passages of world literature – a moment by moment description of the execution, by hanging or beheading, of almost all members of the resistance group "[[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Red Orchestra]]" ("Rote Kapelle") in 1942 in Berlin's [[Plötzensee prison]]. All of the characters whose end Weiss describes here, indeed all of the characters who appear in ''The Aesthetics of Resistance'', and there are hundreds, are actual historical figures. They bear their real names in the text, and everything that happens to them is based on verifiable facts which Weiss researched in many countries and numerous archives.&lt;ref&gt;For biographical information on the figures in ''The Aesthetics of Resistance'', an index of names, a chronology and other information on the novel see Robert Cohen: ''Bio-bibliographisches Handbuch zu Weiss' Ästhetik des Widerstands''. Argument Verlag, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; In its obsession with historical facts, as in other respects, ''The Aesthetics of Resistance'' is a work which transcends all boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;

	The narrator – the only fictional character in the novel (he bears much resemblance to Peter Weiss) – is one of many nameless contributors to the activities of the Communist resistance. From 1937 to 1945 he wanders through much of Europe. His two friends, Heilmann and Coppi, remain in Berlin and eventually become members of the "Red Orchestra." From time to time a letter from Heilmann reaches the narrator. In his letters Heilmann continues his struggle for a reinterpretation of the Heracles myth. Amidst the reality of fascism and in a German capital laid waste by allied bombs, however, the notion of a messianic savior becomes less and less plausible. Coppi abandons it altogether. – Years after the war, long after Heilmann and Coppi had been hanged in Plötzensee – this, too, is historically authentic – the narrator once again finds himself before the Pergamon frieze in rebuilt Berlin. Heracles's place is still empty. There is no leader, no conceivable presence which can replace this absence. There is no hope for a messiah. No one other than the narrator himself and those like him can bring about their liberation. It is with this thought that the novel ends."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cohen: "Nonrational Discourse in a Work of Reason: Peter Weiss's Antifascist Novel Die Ästhetik des Widerstands."

== Reception ==
"[''The Aesthetics of Resistance''] . . . which [Peter Weiss] began when he was well over fifty, making a pilgrimage over the arid slopes of cultural and contemporary history in the company of ''[[pavor nocturnus]]'', the terror of the night, and laden with a monstrous weight of ideological ballast, is a magnum opus which sees itself . . . not only as the expression of an ephemeral wish for redemption, but as an expression of the ''will'' to be on the side of the victims at the end of time."
[[W. G. Sebald]], ''[[On The Natural History of Destruction]]''

Visual artists such as Hubertus Giebe and composers such as [[Kalevi Aho]] or [[Helmut Oehring]] have taken up motives from ''The Aesthetics of Resistance'' in their paintings and compositions. The novel has been adapted for the stage by Thomas Krupa and Tilman Neuffer at [[Grillo-Theater]] Essen in May 2012. The band [[Rome (band)|Rome]] was inspired by the novels when making their album trilogy  Die Æsthetik Der Herrschaftsfreiheit.&lt;ref name="Reclections of Darkness"&gt;{{cite web | title=Interview: Rome - September 2011 | work=Reclections of Darkness | url=http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/-artists-p-t-interviews-88/10146-interview-rome-september-2011.html | accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''El Eternauta''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[comic]] created by [[Argentina|Argentine]] comic strip writer [[Héctor Germán Oesterheld]] with artwork by [[Francisco Solano López (comics)|Francisco Solano López]]. It was first published in ''Hora Cero Semanal'' from 1957 to 1959.

Oesterheld returned to ''El Eternauta'' with a remake and a sequel, published in 1969 and 1975, respectively. Both featured a more political script, as Oesterheld was disturbed by political conditions in the nation after military [[juntas]] had overthrown elected governments. By the time he published the sequel, he and his daughters had joined the [[Montoneros]] leftist [[guerrilla]] group. Oesterheld [[desaparecidos|disappeared]] in 1977, was seen in prisons, and is believed to have been tortured, killed, and "disappeared" in 1979 by the U.S.-backed military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wadi|first1=Ramona|title=Declassified documents reveal US role in Argentina's "Dirty War"|url=https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/declassified-documents-reveal-us-collaboration-in-argentinas-dirty-w-289517|website=TRT World|publisher=TRT World|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the restoration of democracy in 1983, ''El Eternauta'' has been continued in different versions by a variety of writers and artists.

==Publication history==
The ''Eternauta'' was first published in ''Hora Cero Suplemento Semanal'' on September 4, 1957.&lt;ref name="dandare-lopez"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dan Dare|title= Francisco Solano López |url=http://www.dandare.info/artists/lopez.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quickly becoming a success, the serial publication ran until 1959. It was reissued in 1961 in a dedicated magazine, ''Eternauta'', published by Editorial Emilio Ramírez.

In 1969, Oesterheld rewrote ''El Eternauta'', with changes to the story, more political references and more violence. It became an open critique of dictatorial regimes and United States' imperialism. This version featured artwork by [[Alberto Breccia]], who drew the story in an experimental and unique style diverging from the original expression. It was first published on May 29, 1969 in the weekly ''Gente''. The following years the series was also published in several European magazines, such as ''[[Linus (magazine)|Linus]]'', ''El Globo'', ''Alter Alter'', ''Il Mago'', ''[[Charlie Mensuel]]'' and ''[[Metal Hurlant]]''.&lt;ref name="dandare-breccia"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dan Dare|title= Alberto Breccia |url=http://www.dandare.info/artists/abreccia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1975, Ediciones Record began publishing new episodes of ''Eternauta II'' in ''[[Skorpio (magazine)|Skorpio]].'' Oesterheld resumed the story, with artwork by Solano López. Disturbed by the [[Dirty War]] and political repression of the period, Oesterheld criticized the dictatorship. He placed himself as a [[narrator|narrating]] character within the story. Having joined the banned leftist organization [[Montoneros]] with his daughters, Oesterheld wrote the chapters from hidden locations. He disappeared in 1977, believed [[Desaparecidos|abducted]] by government forces.&lt;ref name="dandare-HGO"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dan Dare|title= Héctor Germán Oesterheld |url=http://www.dandare.info/artists/oesterheld.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oesterheld is believed to have died after 1979, when he was last reported alive. His daughters also disappeared, as were their husbands. Only his widow and two grandsons survived, the youngest boy recovered from government custody after being born while his mother was in prison.

Other authors have continued the saga. A third part, ''El Eternauta, Tercera Parte'' (1983), published after the restoration of democracy, met with moderate success. It was criticized for being just another sci-fi comic instead of a continuation of the series' political content. Later chapters, ''El mundo arrepentido'' and ''El Eternauta, El regreso, '' feature artwork by Solano López.

[[Fantagraphics Books]] published the first translation into English, under the name "The Eternaut". It was translated by Erica Mena. It is the first time that the book was published in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/15/the-eternaut-hector-german-oesterheld-francisco-solano-lopez-review The Eternaut review – hero in a homemade diving suit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story begins as a deadly [[snow]]fall covers [[Buenos Aires]] and the surrounding [[Greater Buenos Aires|metropolitan area]], wiping out most life in a few hours. Juan Salvo, along with a couple of friends (Favalli, Lucas and Polski who were playing [[truco]] at his house), his wife and daughter remain safe from the lethal snowflakes thanks to the protection of Juan Salvo's home and the cleverness of Favalli. They organize to survive the ordeal, making special suits to be able to leave the house to gather supplies. During these trips they find Pablo, a twelve-year-old boy, and realize that crazed or needy survivors may be as much of a threat as the deadly snow.
[[File:Eternauta-kol.jpg|thumb|right|140px|One of the alien ''Manos'' (''"Hands"''), Italian translation]]

A few days into the snowfall, they learn that the [[phenomenon]] was caused by an [[Alien invasion|extraterrestrial invasion]] to [[Earth]]. They are recruited into an improvised [[Resistance movement|resistance army]] to fight the invaders. During this time, Salvo meets and befriends a few of his fellow soldiers, namely Franco, a lathe operator, and Mosca, a journalist. As the insurgents march towards the country's capital city, they fight on different occasions against [[Enlargement (in fiction)#Excessive growth|giant insects]] (''cascarudos'', "beetles"); a [[humanoid]] [[species]] with many more fingers than humans, especially on their right hands (''Manos'', "Hands"); giant elephantine beasts capable of knocking buildings down ("Gurbos"); and fellow men who were captured and altered (''hombres-robot'', "robot-men"). All of these beings are pawns, remotely controlled through [[implant (medicine)|implants]] or fear devices by the real invaders, ''los Ellos'' ("Them"), unseen creatures who remain hidden, controlling everything from the distance.

After managing a few victories, the resistance forces are ambushed and reduced to a few men. Juan Salvo decides to return to his wife and daughter to go into hiding with them. A passing [[ICBM]] convinces Favalli and Franco that a larger global war is starting, and that they can't return empty-handed. Salvo reluctantly agrees to join them. After the trio attacks the aliens' HQ in Buenos Aires, taking down the "anti-nukes field", they flee. Buenos Aires is leveled by a [[nuclear warhead]].

Gradually the aliens lure the pockets of survivors throughout the country to "snow-free zones" as part of an elaborate ruse. Salvo's group splits, and he tries to escape with his wife and daughter using one of the alien [[Spacecraft|spaceships]]. He accidentally triggers a [[Time travel|time traveling apparatus]] in the craft. As a result, the three are lost in separate time dimensions known as "[[Space-time continuum|continuum]]s". Juan Salvo begins to travel through time seeking them, eventually being named ''Eternauta'', a voyager of eternity.

==Trivia==
* The Italian comics magazine ''[[L'Eternauta]],'' started in 1982, took its name from the lead character. It initially featured Ongaro's 1983 work on the series.
* The Italian pop-rock band [http://www.myspace.com/eternautimusic Eternauti] took its name from this comic.

==Analysis==
Numerous comic book artists and members of the specialized press have remarked on Oesterheld's amplitude of subtle interpretations, veiled references and double readings. Oesterheld indicated that the protagonists were always a group of people - sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller - something he terms a "group hero" or "hero-in-group." He believed this was a more valuable concept than the traditional individual [[hero]] who appears to triumph without help from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| quote =&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now that I think about it, I believe that perhaps it is because of that lack of a central hero, that ''El Eternauta'' is one of my stories which brings me more pleasure to remember. The true hero of ''El Eternauta'' is a collective hero, a human group. And so it reflects, even if it wasn't my intention, my inner feelings: the only valid hero is the hero "in group", never the individual hero, the lone hero."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have frequently likened the invaders and their methods as veiled references to the various military-led [[coup d'état]]s which occurred at the time in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

It has also been noted that, except for the "Ellos", none of the invaders is truly evil; they are noble beings forced to carry out the orders of others. Critics believe Oesterheld was conceptually attacking the Dirty War&lt;ref&gt;"''Este sensible Mano que dirige ocasionalmente las operaciones de limpieza en un confín de la Tierra y el Universo llamado Barrio de Belgrano, en Buenos Aires, no tiene nada, particularmente, en contra de Juan Salvo o Franco. Y sin embargo trata - y debe hacerlo- de aniquilarlos. No es diferente a cualquier situación de las historias de [[Ernie Pike]]''" - {{citation

==Film adaptation==
Directors such as [[Adolfo Aristarain]], [[Fernando Solanas]] or [[Gustavo Mosquera]] expressed interest in a film adaptation,&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vazquez |first1=Cristian |title=El largo camino de "El Eternauta" para llegar al cine |url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/27/um/m-01408247.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503034939/http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/27/um/m-01408247.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 May 2011 |website=Clarín |date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but could not manage reasonable production costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-3834-2007-05-20.html Página/12 - "Las grandes películas que nunca veremos"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, under supervision by Elsa Oesterheld, the writer's widow, an Italian production company worked on a film adaptation of the original comic. The story would be set in Buenos Aires and the possibility of co-producing the film with [[INCAA]] was discussed.&lt;ref name ="film"/&gt; [[Lucrecia Martel]] was reported as slated to direct the film and said that production was already past the "embryonic stages."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2008/05/13/noticia_0021.html "Lucrecia Martel filmará 'El Eternauta'"], ''Perfil'', 13 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, however, Martel was dropped due to conceptual differences with the producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Makovsky |first1=Pablo |title=Historias de crímenes de clase |url=http://www.lacapital.com.ar/ed_senales/2009/12/edicion_60/contenidos/noticia_5001.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223134802/http://www.lacapital.com.ar/ed_senales/2009/12/edicion_60/contenidos/noticia_5001.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2012 |website=La Capital |date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1480">The '''Thornburgh Memo''' was a [[U.S. Department of Justice]] [[memorandum]] prepared by then [[Attorney General]] [[Richard Thornburgh]], on June 8, 1989. The memo declared that state ethics rules were not binding upon [[federal prosecutor]]s. It asserted that any compliance with state ethical rules by federal prosecutors conducting government investigations was strictly voluntary.

While the memo was not legally binding, it represented a dramatic statement of the then executive branch's understanding of its ethical obligations as lawyers.

When [[Janet Reno]] became [[Attorney General]] in 1993, the Justice Department backed away from the [[Richard Thornburgh|Thornburgh]] position. Instead, they promulgated the "[[Reno Rules]]," detailed in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]. Those rules have since been supplanted by {{usc|28|530B}}, which provides:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An attorney for the Government shall be subject to State laws and rules, and local Federal court rules, governing attorneys in each State where such attorney engages in that attorney's duties, to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that State.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Tri-Star Customs and Forwarding Ltd v Denning''' [1999] 1 NZLR 33 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding unilateral mistakes under the [[Contractual Mistakes Act 1977]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=280 - 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=117-118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Dennings leased a commercial building to Tristar. A condition of the lease agreement, gave Tristar the right to purchase the building for $720,000. An option that Tristar later accepted.

However, whilst the lease agreement clearly stated that the rentals were GST exclusive, the purchase price of $720,000 was silent regarding whether it exclusive or inclusive of GST.

This was unfortunate for the Dennings, as under NZ tax law, it was deemed that it was GST inclusive, although they successfully obtained relief in the High Court.

Tristar appealed.

==Held==
A [[bench of five]] of the Court Appeal ruled that the Contractual Mistakes Act 1977 requires that Tristar had actual knowledge of the mistake at the time, and not merely "ought to of known" of the mistake as was the old common law standard. Henry J stated "It may of course be proper for the Court to infer actual knowledge from proved circumstances, even if the person in question denies having that knowledge".

A '''visiting card''', also known as a '''calling card''', is a small card with one's name printed on it, and often bearing an artistic design. In 18th century Europe, the footmen of [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]s and [[Royal family|royalty]] would deliver these first European visiting cards to the [[servant (domestic)|servant]]s of their prospective hosts solemnly introducing the arrival of their owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.designfloat.com/blog/2012/04/02/history-business-cards/|title=A Brief History of Business Cards|website=DesignFloat Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Visiting cards became an indispensable tool of [[etiquette]], with sophisticated rules governing their use. The essential convention was that a first person would not expect to see a second person in the second's own home (unless invited or introduced) without the first having first left his visiting card at the second's home. Upon leaving the card, the first would not expect to be admitted at first, but instead might receive a card at his own home in response from the second. This would serve as a signal that a personal visit and meeting at home would be welcome. On the other hand, if no card was forthcoming, or if a card was sent in an envelope, a personal visit was thereby discouraged.

As an adoption from [[France]], they were called ''une carte d'adresse'' from 1615 to 1800, and then became ''[[carte de visite]]'' or ''visiteur'' with the advent of photography in the mid 19th century. Visiting cards became common among the aristocracy of Europe, and also in the United States. The whole procedure depended upon there being servants to open the door and receive the cards and it was, therefore, confined to the social classes which employed servants.

If a card was left with a turned corner it indicated that the card had been left in person rather than by a servant.

{{quote|text=Next day Paul found Stubbs' card on his table, the corner turned up. Paul went to Hertford to call on Stubbs, but found him out. He left his card, the corner turned up. |sign=[[Evelyn Waugh]]|source=''[[Decline and Fall]]'', Part III, Chapter 7, "Resurrection"}}

Some visiting cards included refined engraved ornaments, [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] lettering, and fantastic [[coats of arms]]. However, the standard form visiting card in the 19th century in the United Kingdom was a plain card with nothing more than the bearer's name on it. Sometimes the name of a [[gentlemen's club]] might be added, but addresses were not otherwise included. Visiting cards were kept in highly decorated card cases.

The visiting card is no longer the universal feature of upper middle class and upper class life that it once was in Europe and North America. Much more common is the [[business card]], in which contact details, including address and telephone number, are essential. This has led to the inclusion of such details even on modern domestic visiting cards: ''[[Debrett's]] New Etiquette'' in 2007 endorsed the inclusion of private and club addresses (at the bottom left and right respectively) but states the inclusion of a telephone or fax number would be "a solecism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=John|title=Debrett's New Guide to Etiquette &amp; Modern Manners: The Indispensable Handbook|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=1429978287|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to ''Debrett's Handbook'' in 2016, a gentleman's card would traditionally give his title, rank, private or service address (bottom left) and club (bottom right) in addition to his name. Titles of peers are given with no prefix (e.g. simply "Duke of Wellington"), [[courtesy titles]] are similarly given as "Lord John Smith", etc., but "Hon" (for "the Honourable") are not used (Mr, Ms, etc. being used instead). Those without titles of nobility or courtesy titles may use ecclesiastical titles, military ranks, "Professor" or "Dr", or Mr, Ms, etc. For archbishops, bishops, deans and archdeacons, the territorial title is used (e.g. "The Bishop of London"). Men may use their forenames or initials, while a married or widowed woman may either use her husband's name (the traditional usage) or her own. The only [[post-nominal letters]] used are those indicating membership of the armed forces (e.g. "Captain J. Smith, RN"). The ''Social Card'', which is a modern version of the visiting card, features a person's name, mobile phone number, and email address, with an optional residential address rarely included; family social cards include the names of parents and children.&lt;ref name="Debrett's 2016"/&gt;
