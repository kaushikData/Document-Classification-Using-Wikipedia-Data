      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11227">[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]] and [[freedom of information]] (FOI) refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information|title=Freedom of Information|last=|first=|date=|website=unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] but the legal framework is seriously flawed, with no law on access to information in the Southern [[Republic of Cyprus]] of the country and a law that falls below [[Council of Europe]] standards in the [[Northern Cyprus|Northern part of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is ''de facto'' divided.

As to 2011, a research by the [[Open Cyprus Project]] showed that there was a level of 75% of [[administrative silence]] island-wide, in response to information requests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/The-Right-of-Access-to-Information-in-Cyprus.-Report-and-Recommendations|title=The Right of Access to Information in Cyprus. Report and Recommendations|last=|first=|date=November 2011|website=rcmediafreedom.eu|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information is being discussed in the Parliament of the (Southern) Republic of Cyprus. 

'''On 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2017_1_184/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Northern Cyprus ==
The right to access public information is granted by Article No. 24 of the Constitution of Northern Cyprus. Even if the Constitutional article echoes Article No. 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), experts say that the possibilities to restrict the fundamental right of  access to public information are provided in an overbroad manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, Article No. 10 (2) ECHR says that the conditions and restrictions imposed on the right to freedom of expression have to be “necessary in a democratic society”. Instead, even if the Constitution of Northern Cyprus- under Article No. 24- provides for a test of whether a restriction to such a right is necessary, it does not specify the key qualification of being necessary in a democratic society, as required by Article 10 of the ECHR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The relevant laws regulating the right to access public information in the Northern part of Cyprus are: the Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006; the Public Officials Law No. 7 of 1979; the State Procurement Regulation; the Rules and Procedures of the Parliament and the Personal Data Protection Act No. 89 of 2007.

The Right to Access Information Law obliges “public bodies” to process all information requests, regardless of the means by which they are submitted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2011 research recommends that, with regard to the Access to Information Law in the Northern part of the country, the scope of the law should be extended to all classes of information held by public bodies. Also, according to experts, an implementing regulation should be approved, clarifying the administrative procedure to request and receive information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, the Access to Information Assessment Commission foreseen by the law has not been appointed yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/nat/11269|title=Open Cyprus Project: Results|last=|first=|date=February 24, 2011|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic of Cyprus ==
The Cypriot government couldn't sign or ratify the 2009 [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Access to Official Documents]] as it did not have a transparency law that meets the Convention’s minimum standard. Until 2017, Cyprus was the only country in Europe, other than Luxembourg, without a law guaranteeing the right of access to information.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/28182|title=Civil society warn Cyprus’ draft transparency law under threat if excessive exceptions persist|last=|first=|date=March 31, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But as of 2018, the law has been published (Law 184(I)/2017)

The relevant laws with regard to the right to access public information are the following:
* Article No. 19 and 29 of the Constitution;
* the Act regarding Personal Data N. 138 of 2001, which makes clear that this data can be accessed only by the affected person (s);
* the Act on Re-Use of Existing Information Held by Public Sector Bodies, No. 132 of 2006: it ensures that when the authority grants one user permission to make use of a large volume of information, it must grant other users access on the same  terms;
* the Press Law No. 145 o 1985: it grants a general right of access to all information held by public bodies;
* the Environmental Information Law No. 119 of 2004, which clearly grants access to information on a non- discriminatory basis;
* the State Archives Law No. 208 of 1991, for information held in archives. It does not grant a general public access before a thirty-year period;
* the State Secrets Law No. 2016 of 2002;
* the Public Service Law No. 1 of 1990;
* the Public Procurement Law No.1 of 200;
* the Public Aid Law No. 30 of 2001;
* the Administrative Principles Law No. 158 of 1999.
According to experts, these non-specific laws that might grant access to some classes of information, such as environmental information or archives, require amendments to comply with the basic international and European standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since April 2014, the Republic of Cyprus has been holding public consultations aimed at drafting a Freedom of Information Law, which as to 2017 has to be enacted.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2015/10/18/ministry-defends-planned-freedom-of-information-law/|title=Ministry defends planned freedom of information law|last=Psyllides|first=George|date=October 18, 2015|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the Cypriot Justice Minister [[Ionas Nicolaou]] expressed his commitment to adopt a strong access to information (Freedom of Information) law that will be “one of the best in the [[European Union]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/20942|title=Access Info welcomes Cyprus’ commitment to strong FOI law|last=Pavlou|first=Andreas|date=October 21, 2015|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, in February 2017, the association [[Access Info Europe]] has addressed the Cypriot Parliament asking to review such a draft. In particular, Access Info Europe advocated for the removal of  the fees for making information requests and for cutting down the possible 60 days extension for complex requests which has been included in the draft.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/27727|title=Cypriot lawmakers challenged to ensure FOI is free and exceptions are limited|last=|first=|date=March 1, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/02/18/ngo-calls-foi-fees-axed/|title=NGO calls for FOI fees to be axed|last=Andreou|first=Evie|date=February 18, 2017|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to Access Info, also the regime of possible exceptions needs to be reviewed. Currently, the draft includes absolute exceptions, with no [[public interest]] test.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, under the international and European transparency standards, when disclosure of information is denied  requesters must be given clear reasons as to why the exception has been applied.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In March 2017, the recommendations elaborated by Access Info Europe were sent to the Cypriot Parliament Legal Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/Comments_FOIlaw_cyprus_parliamentarycommittee_28feb2016.pdf|title=Σχόλια από Access Info Europe περί το νομοσχέδιο που ρυθμίζει το δικαίωμα πρόσβασης σε ληροφορίες του δημόσιου τομέα (Comments from Access Info Europe on the draft law regulating the right of access to Public Sector Information)|last=|first=|date=February 28, 2016|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|language=Greek|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2015, [[Citizen Service Centres]] have been established all over the island in order to provide multiple services as an alternative channel for dealing with public agencies/organizations. They work through a single 4-digit number (1434) which citizens can call in order to obtain information with respect to approximately 90 services offered by the CSCs, such as eligibility criteria for submitting an application, documents that need to be submitted, fees charged etc. Through this Call Centre, citizens can also submit applications for 18 services relating to the issuing of specific documents/licenses/certificates etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/nrp2016_cyprus_en.pdf|title=EUROPE 2020- Cyprus National Reform Programme 2016|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2607">An '''adaptive algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that changes its behavior at the time it is run, based on information available and on ''a priori'' defined reward mechanism (or criterion). Such information could be the story of recently received data, information on the available computational resources, or other run-time acquired (or ''a priori'' known) information related to the environment in which it operates.

Among the most used adaptive algorithms is the [[Least mean squares filter|Widrow-Hoff’s least mean squares (LMS)]], which represents a class of stochastic gradient-descent algorithms used in adaptive filtering and machine learning. In adaptive filtering the LMS is used to mimic a desired filter by finding the filter coefficients that relate to producing the least mean square  of the error signal (difference between the desired and the actual signal).

For example, [[stable partition]], using no additional memory is ''O''(''n'' lg ''n'') but given ''O''(''n'') memory, it can be ''O''(''n'') in time. As implemented by the [[C++ Standard Library]], [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/stable_partition &lt;code&gt;stable_partition&lt;/code&gt;] is adaptive and so it acquires as much memory as it can get (up to what it would need at most) and applies the algorithm using that available memory.  Another example is [[adaptive sort]], whose behavior changes upon the presortedness of its input.

An example of an adaptive algorithm in [[radar]] systems is the [[constant false alarm rate]] (CFAR) detector.

In [[machine learning]] and [[optimization]], many algorithms are adaptive or have adaptive variants, which usually means that the algorithm parameters are automatically adjusted according to statistics about the optimisation thus far (e.g. the rate of convergence). Examples include [[adaptive simulated annealing]], [[adaptive coordinate descent]], [[AdaBoost]], and [[adaptive quadrature]].

In [[data compression]], [[adaptive coding]] algorithms such as [[Adaptive Huffman coding]] or [[Prediction by partial matching]] can take a stream of data as input, and adapt their compression technique based on the symbols that they have already encountered.

In [[signal processing]], the [[Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding]] (ATRAC) codec used in [[MiniDisc]] recorders is called "adaptive" because the window length (the size of an audio "chunk") can change according to the nature of the sound being compressed, to try to achieve the best-sounding compression strategy.

[[File:"Waiting On Shore" Rosses Point - geograph.org.uk - 242932.jpg|thumb| "Waiting On Shore" [[Rosses Point]], Sligo. The sculpture, by Niall Breton, reflects the anguish of seafaring people who watch for the safe return of loved ones.]]
'''Anguish''' is derived from the Latin word angustiae, meaning extreme pain, distress or anxiety. The feeling of suffering from anguish is typically preceded by a tragedy or event that has a profound meaning to the being in question. Anguish can be felt physically or mentally (often referred to as emotional distress). Anguish is also a term used in [[philosophy]], often as a translation from the Latin word for ''[[angst]]''. It is a paramount feature of [[existentialism | existentialist]] philosophy, in which anguish is often understood as the experience of an utterly free being in a world with zero absolutes (existential despair). In the theology of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], it refers to a being with total [[free will]] who is in a constant state of spiritual fear that his freedom will lead him to fall short of the standards that God has laid out for them.

==Affect Decisions==
A study done at the University of Princeton’s Center for the Study of Brain, Mind, and Behavior suggests that the presence of the emotion influences the decisions made. The study uses a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine to measure the brain waves of a subject when put into a difficult position. In this particular session, the subject was presented with a situation where she had to decide the fate of five people versus one person by the flip of a switch, and then decide the fate of five people versus one person by the physical acting of condemning a man to his death. The results of the fMRI stated that the decision of death by switch was easier than the decision of physically pushing a man to his death. It is theorized that the participant is being subjected to the emotion of anguish when faced with future possibility of physical condemning another person and therefore the brain enforces an “emotional block” to encourage the cessation of this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, H. (2004). Anguish and Ethics. Scientific American Special Edition, 14(1), 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental Health==
Anguish is made up of fear, distress, anxiety and panic. These stressors cause an enormous amount of dissonance, which could then lead to issues of mental health. While taken literally anguish may be defined as a physical event, but it may be extrapolated to an event of one’s psyche. It has been found that the anguish of a significant change in the way a young student lives (i.e. their new responsibilities, being on their own, multiple deadlines etc.) has contributed to significantly increased rates of college students suffering from anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;WILSON, R. (2015, September 4). An Epidemic of Anguish. Chronicle of Higher Education, pp. A38–A42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Music has a particular way of eliciting emotions into its listeners. The notes heard by one person may have a different connotation than another person hearing the same notes. Upon hearing a song, symphony, or sonnet filled with anguish, one might begin to reflect upon their own life and experiences that coincide with the notes, thereby bringing repressed memories beyond subconscious to our salient mind.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D. J. (2005). Musical Understanding, Musical Works, and Emotional Expression: Implications for education. Educational Philosophy &amp; Theory, 37(1), 93–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
*“He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. 'Oh, Jane! my hope - my love - my life!' broke in anguish from his lips.” -Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre
*“What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music.” -Soren Kierkegaard
*“Pain, anguish and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed.” - Alexandre Dumas, The Man in the Iron Mask


==Philosophy==
Kierkegaard views anguish as the same as suffering. Everyone wants to find the "truth" but it takes anguish and suffering to "appropriate" the truth. Kierkegaard put it this way in 1847 and 1850. {{Quotation|text=All the knowledge allied with inquisitiveness, thirst for knowledge, natural talent, the self-seeking passion, all the knowledge the natural man promptly understands to be worth learning is also basically and essentially easy to learn, and aptitude is involved here from first to last. Therefore people are willing enough to learn when it is a matter of ''learning more'', but when it is a matter of ''learning anew'' through sufferings, then learning becomes hard and heavy, then aptitude does not help, but on the other hand no one is excluded even though he is ever so lacking in aptitude. The lowliest, the simplest, the most forsaken human being, someone whom all teachers give up but heaven has by no means given up-he can learn obedience fully as well as anyone else. 
|author=Søren Kierkegaard|title=''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong translation, pp. 252–253}}{{Quotation|text=Is “truth” the sort of thing one might conceivably appropriate without more ado by means of another man? Without more ado-that is without being willing to be developed and tried, to fight and to suffer, just as he did who acquired the truth for himself? Is not that as impossible as to sleep or dream oneself into the truth. Is it not just as impossible to appropriate it thus without more ado however wide awake one might be? Or is one really wide awake, is not this a vain conceit, when one does not understand or will not understand that with respect to the truth there is no shortcut which dispenses with the necessity of acquiring it, and with that respect to acquire it from generation to generation there is no essential shortcut, so that every generation and every individual in the generation must essentially begin again from the start? 
|author=Søren Kierkegaard|title=''Training in Christianity'', 1850, pp. 181–182; Lowrie translation 1941, 2004}}

In the teachings of [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], anguish is seen when an utterly captured being realizes the unpredictability of his or her action. For example, when walking along a cliff, you would feel anguish to know that you have the freedom to throw yourself down to your imminent death.

[[Image:Digon on circle.png|thumb|Antipodal points on a [[circle]] are 180 degrees apart.]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''antipodal point''' of a point on the surface of a sphere is the point which is [[diameter|diametrically]] opposite to it — so situated that a line drawn from the one to the other passes through the center of the sphere and forms a true diameter.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Antipodes|volume=2|pages=133-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term applies to opposite points on a [[circle]] or any [[n-sphere]].

An antipodal point is sometimes called an '''antipode''', a [[back-formation]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[loan word]] ''antipodes'',  which originally meant "opposite the feet".

== Theory ==
In [[mathematics]], the concept of ''antipodal points'' is generalized to [[sphere]]s of any dimension: two points on the sphere are antipodal if they are opposite ''through the centre''; for example, taking the centre as [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], they are points with related [[vector (geometry)|vector]]s '''v''' and &amp;minus;'''v'''. On a [[circle]], such points are also called '''diametrically opposite'''. In other words, each line through the centre intersects the sphere in two points, one for each [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]] out from the centre, and these two points are antipodal.

The [[Borsuk&amp;ndash;Ulam theorem]] is a result from [[algebraic topology]] dealing with such pairs of points. It says that any [[continuous function]] from ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; maps some pair of antipodal points in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to the same point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''n''-dimensional sphere in (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional space (so the "ordinary" sphere is ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a circle is ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

The '''antipodal map''' ''A'' : ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, defined by ''A''(''x'') = &amp;minus;''x'', sends every point on the sphere to its antipodal point. It is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to the [[identity function|identity map]] if ''n'' is odd, and its [[Degree of a continuous mapping|degree]] is (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.

If one wants to consider antipodal points as identified, one passes to [[projective space]] (see also [[projective Hilbert space]], for this idea as applied in [[quantum mechanics]]).

== Antipodal pair of points on a convex polygon ==
An antipodal pair of a convex polygon is a pair of 2 points admitting 2 infinite parallel lines being tangent to both points included in the antipodal without crossing any other line of the convex polygon.

In [[microeconomics]], the '''Bertrand–Edgeworth model''' of price-setting oligopoly looks at what happens when there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where there is a limit to the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.

==History==
[[Joseph Louis François Bertrand]] (1822–1900) developed the model of [[Bertrand competition]] in oligopoly.  This approach was based on the assumption that there are at least two firms producing a homogenous product with constant [[marginal cost]] (this could be constant at some positive value, or with zero marginal cost as in Cournot). Consumers buy from the cheapest seller. The Bertrand–[[Nash equilibrium]] of this model is to have all (or at least two) firms setting the price equal to marginal cost.  The argument is simple: if one firm sets a price above marginal cost then another firm can undercut it by a small amount (often called ''epsilon undercutting'', where epsilon represents an arbitrarily small amount) so that the equilibrium is zero (this is sometimes called the [[Bertrand paradox (economics)|Bertrand paradox]]).

The Bertrand approach assumes that firms are willing and able to supply all demand: there is no limit to the amount that they can produce or sell.  [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] considered the case where there is a limit to what firms can sell (a capacity constraint):  he showed that if there is a fixed limit to what firms can sell, then there may exist no [[Pure strategy|pure-strategy]]  [[Nash equilibrium]] (this is sometimes called the [[Edgeworth paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edgeworth|first=Francis|year=1889|title=The pure theory of monopoly}}, reprinted in {{cite book|title=Collected Papers relating to Political Economy|year=1925|volume=1|publisher=[[Macmillan (publisher)|Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Shubik]] developed the Bertrand–Edgeworth model  to allow for the firm to be willing to supply only up to its profit maximizing output at the price which it set (under [[profit maximization]] this occurs when marginal cost equals price).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shubik |first=M. |year=1959 |title=Strategy and Market Structure: Competition, Oligopoly, and the Theory of Games |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co8rAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He considered the case of strictly convex costs, where marginal cost is increasing in output. [[Martin Shubik|Shubik]] showed that if a Nash equilibrium exists, it must be the [[perfectly competitive]] price (where demand equals supply, and all firms set price equal to marginal cost). However, this can only happen if market demand is infinitely elastic (horizontal) at the competitive price. In general, as in the Edgeworth paradox, no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist. [[Huw Dixon]] showed that in general a [[mixed strategy]] Nash equilibrium will exist when there are [[Convex function|convex]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |last=Dixon |first=H. D. |year=1984 |title=The existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in a price-setting oligopoly with convex costs |journal=[[Economics Letters]] |volume=16 |issue=3–4 |pages=205–12 |doi=10.1016/0165-1765(84)90164-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dixon’s proof used the Existence Theorem of [[Partha Dasgupta]] and [[Eric Maskin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dasgupta |first1=P. |last2=Maskin |first2=E. |year=1986 |title=The Existence of Equilibrium in Discontinuous Economic Games, I: Theory |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=1–26 |jstor=2297588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Dixon's assumption of (weakly) convex costs, marginal cost will be non-decreasing.  This is consistent with a cost function where marginal cost is flat for a range of outputs, marginal cost is smoothly increasing, or indeed where there is a kink in total cost so that marginal cost makes a discontinuous jump upwards.

==Later developments and related models==
There have been several responses to the non-existence of pure-strategy equilibrium identified by [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] and [[Martin Shubik]].  Whilst the existence of mixed-strategy equilibrium was demonstrated by [[Huw Dixon]], it has not proven easy to characterize what the equilibrium actually looks like.  However, Allen and Hellwig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=B.|last2=Hellwig|first2=M.|year=1986|title=Bertrand–Edgeworth oligopoly in large markets|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|issue=53|pages=175–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; were able to show that in a large market with many firms, the average price set would tend to the competitive price.

It has been argued that non-pure strategies are not plausible in the context of the Bertrand–Edgworth model.  Alternative approaches have included:
*Firms choose the quantity they are willing to sell up to at each price.  This is a game in which price and quantity are chosen: as shown by Allen and Hellwig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1818802|title=Price-Setting Firms and the Oligopolistic Foundations of Perfect Competition|first1=Beth|last1=Allen|first2=Martin|last2=Hellwig|publisher=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=76|issue=2|journal=Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association |date=May 1986|pages=387–392.}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a more general case by [[Huw Dixon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://huwdixon.org/publication_archive/articles/ej1992.pdf|first=Huw|last=Dixon|title=The Perfectly competitive outcome as the equilibrium in an Edgeworthian price–quantity game|journal=[[Economic Journal]]|year=1992|issue=102|pages=301–309|accessdate=30 December 2013}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the perfectly competitive price is the unique pure-strategy equilibrium.
*Firms have to meet all demand at the price they set as proposed by Krishnendu Ghosh Dastidar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dastidar|first=Krishnendu Ghosh|date=January 1995|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/joecth/v5y1995i1p19-32.html||accessdate=30 December 2013|title=On the Existence of Pure Strategy Bertrand Equilibrium,|journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]]|publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]]|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–32|doi=10.1007/bf01213642}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pay some cost for turning away customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Huw|date=December 1990|title=Bertrand–Edgeworth Equilibria when Firms Avoid Turning Customers Away|journal=Journal of Industrial Economics|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|volume=39|issue=2|pages=131–46|doi=10.2307/2098489}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 December 2013--&gt;{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this can ensure the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, it comes at the cost of generating multiple equilibria.  However, as shown by [[Huw Dixon]], if the cost of turning customers away is sufficiently small, then any pure-strategy equilibria that exist will be close to the competitive equilibrium.
*Introducing [[product differentiation]], as proposed by Jean-Pascal Benassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benassy|first=Jean-Pascal|date=April 1989|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/restud/v56y1989i2p217-34.html|title=Market Size and Substitutability in Imperfect Competition: A Bertrand–Edgeworth–Chamberlin Model|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|publisher=[[Wiley–Blackwell]]|volume=56|issue=2|pages=217–34|accessdate=30 December 2013|doi=10.2307/2297458}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is more of a synthesis of [[monopolistic competition]] with the Bertrand–Edgeworth model, but Benassy showed that if the [[elasticity of demand]] for the firms output is sufficiently high, then any [[pure strategy]] equilibrium that existed would be close to the competitive outcome.
*"Integer pricing" as explored by [[Huw Dixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Huw David|date=July 1993|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/buecrs/v45y1993i3p257-68.html|title=Integer Pricing and Bertrand–Edgeworth Oligopoly with Strictly Convex Costs: Is It Worth More Than a Penny?|journal=[[Bulletin of Economic Research]]|publisher=[[Wiley–Blackwell]]|volume=45|issue=3|pages=257–68|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8586.1993.tb00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than treat price as a [[continuous variable]], it is treated as a [[discrete variable]].  This means that firms cannot undercut each other by an arbitrarily small amount, one of the necessary ingredients giving rise to the non-existence of a pure strategy equilibrium. This can give rise to multiple pure-strategy equilibria, some of which may be distant from the competitive equilibrium price. More recently, Prabal Roy Chowdhury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chowdhury|first=P. R.|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/indorg/v26y2008i3p746-761.html Bertrand–Edgeworth|title=Equilibrium with a large number of firms|journal=[[International Journal of Industrial Organization]]|volume=26|issue=3|date=May 2008|pages=746–761|accessdate=30 December 2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2007.05.009}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; has combined the notion of discrete pricing with the idea that firms choose prices and the quantities they want to sell at that price as in Allen–Hellwig.
*[[Epsilon equilibrium]] in the pure-strategy game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=H.|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/restud/v54y1987i1p47-62.html|title=Approximate Bertrand Equilibria in a replicated Industry|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|volume=54|year=1987|pages=47–62|accessdate=30 December 2013}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an epsilon equilibrium, each firm is within epsilon of its optimal price.  If the epsilon is small, this might be seen as a plausible equilibrium, due perhaps to [[menu cost]]s or [[bounded rationality]]. For a given epsilon&gt;0, if there are enough firms, then an epsilon-equilibrium exists (this result depends on how one models the residual demand – the demand faced by higher-priced firms given the sales of the lower-priced firms).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">In computer programming, '''bidirectional transformations (bx)''' are programs in which a single piece of code can be run in several ways, such that the same data are sometimes considered as input, and sometimes as output. For example, a bx run in the forward direction might transform input I into output O, while the same bx run backward would take as input versions of I and O and produce a new version of I as its output.

[[Model transformation#Unidirectional versus bidirectional|Bidirectional model transformations]] are an important special case in which a model is input to such a program.

Some bidirectional languages are [[Bijection|''bijective'']]. The bijectivity of a language is a severe restriction of its bidirectionality,&lt;ref name="nate-foster"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://grace.gsdlab.org/images/e/e2/Nate-short.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726133528/http://grace.gsdlab.org/images/e/e2/Nate-short.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because a bijective language is merely relating two different ways to present the very same information.

More general is a lens language, in which there is a distinguished forward direction ("get") that takes a concrete input to an abstract output, discarding some information in the process: the concrete state includes all the information that is in the abstract state, and usually some more. The backward direction ("put") takes a concrete state and an abstract state and computes a new concrete state. Lenses are required to obey certain conditions to ensure sensible behaviour.

The most general case is that of symmetric bidirectional transformations. Here the two states that are related typically share some information, but each also includes some information that is not included in the other.

== Usage ==

Bidirectional transformations can be used to:

* Maintain the consistency of several sources of information&lt;ref name="grace-report"&gt;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/grace-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provide an 'abstract view' to easily manipulate data and write them back to their source

== Vocabulary ==

A bidirectional program which obeys certain round-trip laws is called a '''''lens'''''.

== Examples of implementations ==

* [[Boomerang (programming language)|Boomerang]] is a programming language which allows writing lenses to process text data formats bidirectionally
* [[Augeas (software)|Augeas]] is a configuration management library whose lens language is inspired by the Boomerang project
* ''biXid'' is a programming language for processing XML data bidirectionally&lt;ref name="bixid"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arbre.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hahosoya/papers/bixid.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702195028/http://arbre.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hahosoya/papers/bixid.pdf |archive-date=2007-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cebuana Lhuillier Angeles.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Cebuana Lhuillier branch in [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles City]].]]

'''Cebuana Lhuillier Pawnshop''', commonly known as '''Cebuana''', is a Philippine-based pawnshop, and the flagship brand of PJ Lhuillier Group of Companies. [[Jean Henri Lhuillier]] is the current President of CEO of Cebuana.
Cebuana Lhuillier is a non-banking financial institution provides pawn-brokering, money remittance, insurance, bills payment, remit-to-account, corporate payout, collections, and e-loading services.

==History==
Cebuana Lhuillier Pawnshop began with four pawnshop outlets in [[Metro Manila]] in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cebuanalhuillier.com/about-us-history|website=www.cebuanalhuillier.com|publisher=Cebuana Lhuillier|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Henry Lhuillier's son, Philippe Jones Lhuillier went forth and opened the first Lhuillier pawnshop at Libertad Street in Pasay under the trade name Agencia Cebuana.

It traces its roots in Cebu, where then French Consul to the Philippines, Henry Lhuillier established his first chain of Agencias in 1935. Throughout the 70’s and 80’s, Philippe Jones Lhuillier opened more agencias in Metro Manila.

The company pursued further nationwide expansion in 1987 and adopted the trade name, “Cebuana Lhuillier,” which it still carries to this day.
In 1998, Philippe Jones Lhuillier was appointed the Philippine Ambassador to Italy. Philippe Jones Lhuillier’s son, Jean Henri Lhuillier, took the helm and became Cebuana Lhuillier Pawnshop’s President and Chief Executive Officer in the same year.

Jean Henri Lhuillier introduced in Cebuana Lhuillier Pawnshop’s auxiliary services remittance, insurance, bills payment, money changer, e-load, remit-to-account, corporate payput, and collections service.

It also became the first pawnshop and money remittance company to offer a membership rewards program for its loyal clients through the 24k card loyalty program in 2010. On the following year, Cebuana Lhuillier branches hit the 1,500 mark. The 24k loyalty card also had its 2,500,000th member in 2012, and just recently reached five million members in 2014. In the same year, Cebuana Lhuillier started to reach out to potential customers to areas with limited access through its Cebuana Lhuillier On Wheels.

==Social Involvements==

Cebuana Lhuillier Pawnshop, through its President and CEO Jean Henri Lhuillier, is involved in sports development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sports Advocacy|url=http://pjlhuillier.com/sportsadvocacy/default.aspx|publisher=Cebuana Lhuillier|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly basketball, softball, and tennis. Cebuana Lhuillier Pawnshop owns a team in the PBA D-League, the Cebuana Lhuillier Gems. CL is also organized tennis tournaments such as Cebuana Lhuillier Age Group Tennis.

Jean Henri Lhuillier is the manager of the Philippine Davis Cup Team, Chairman of the Board of the Philippine Tennis Association (PhilTA), and is the president of Amateur Softball Association of the Philippines (governed by the International Softball Federation).

Cebuana Lhuillier also has its own foundation, the Cebuana Lhuillier Foundation Inc., which conducts medical missions, relief operations for disaster-stricken areas, and feedings programs. It also has a nationwide scholarship program and Alternative Learning System Community Learning Centers.

[[File:Collapsus Submarine Channel Best Practice Poster.jpg|thumb|promotion poster]]

'''Collapsus''' is a project that combines [[animation]], interactive fiction, and [[documentary film]].&lt;ref name=Filmthreat&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Mark|title=CHECK OUT FILMMAKER TOMMY PALLOTTA’S NEW TRANSMEDIA PROJECT "COLLAPSUS"|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/news/26619/|website=Filmthreat|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story follows how the impending [[energy crisis]] affects ten young people, while international powers battle with political dissension and a fearful population during transition from [[Fossil fuel]] to alternative fuels.&lt;ref name=Filmthreat /&gt; Set in the near future, Collapsus was initialized to raise awareness of the [[global issue]] of [[peak oil]].

== Content ==

The project combines [[Video blogging]], interactive maps, fictional newscasts, live action footage, and animation to immerse the player in the narrative, an example of [[Transmedia storytelling]]. The project requires the player to access and assess additional information and make decisions about the world's energy production at both a national and global scale.

== Production ==

Collapsus was developed by Submarine Channel, with the Dutch public broadcaster [[VPRO]], who produced the associated Energy Transition documentary the project is based on. Collapsus is directed by [[Tommy Pallotta]], who produced  [[A Scanner Darkly (film)]] and [[Waking Life]].&lt;ref name=Peakoil&gt;{{cite web|title=Collapsus, Transmedia, The Energy Risk Conspiracy|url=http://peakoil.com/generalideas/collapsus-transmedia-the-energy-risk-conspiracy|website=Peakoil|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collapsus blends live action and the [[rotoscoping]] animation technique, co-developed by Pallotta, and used in [[Waking Life]]  and [[A Scanner Darkly (film)]].

'''Communalism''' is a term used in [[South Asia]] to denote attempts to construct religious or ethnic identity, incite strife between people identified as different communities, and to stimulate [[communal violence]] between those groups.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Horowitz (1985), Ethnic Groups in Conflict, {{ISBN|978-0520053854}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from history, differences in beliefs, and tensions between the communities.&lt;ref name=Pandey&gt;{{cite book |last=Pandey | first = Gyanendra | title = The Construction of Communalism in Colonial North India | publisher = Oxford India  | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term communalism was constructed by the British colonial authorities as it wrestled to manage violence between religious, ethnic and disparate groups in its colonies, particularly Africa and South Asia, in early 20th century.&lt;ref name=gvk&gt;Gerry van Klinken, [http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20Communal%20violence%20democratization%20in%20Indonesia%20%20small%20town%20wars.pdf Communal Violence and Democratization in Indonesia - Small Town Wars], {{ISBN|978-0-415-41713-6}}, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arafaat A.

Communalism is a significant social issue in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Pandey/&gt;

==History==

The term came into use in early 20th century during the British colonial rule, where the rulers saw India divided into several communities and attempted to placate separate "communal" interests. The [[Hindu]] Mahasabh and the [[All-India Muslim League]] represented such communal interests, whereas [[Indian National Congress]] represented an overarching "nationalist" vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nehru, The Making of India|last = Akbar|first = M. J.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1989|isbn = 9780140100839|location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run up to independence in 1947, communalism and nationalism came to be competing ideologies and led to the division of British India into the Republics of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. The bloody [[Partition of India|Partition violence]] gave a clear sense to every one what communalism leads to, and it has since been frowned upon in India.

Communal conflicts between religious communities, especially [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]], have been a recurring occurrence in independent India, occasionally leading to serious inter-communal violence.

Examples of communalist violence, with strong motivations based on religious identity  include:
*the 1809–1811 Hindu-Muslim [[Lat Bhairo]] riots
*the 1921 [[Moplah Rebellion]]

'''Consciousness''' is the state or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] of [[awareness]] or of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.&lt;ref name="consciousness"&gt;{{cite web|title=consciousness|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=|accessdate=June 4, 2012|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van_Gulick2004"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert van Gulick |year=2004 |title=Consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined variously in terms of [[sentience]], awareness, [[qualia]], [[subjectivity]], the ability to [[experience]] or to  [[feeling|feel]], [[wakefulness]], having a sense of [[self]]hood or [[soul]], the fact that there is something "that it is like" to "have" or "be" it,  and the executive control system of the [[mind]].&lt;ref name=Farthing1992Psychology&gt;{{cite book| title=The Psychology of Consciousness |author=Farthing G |year=1992 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-728668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Searle]] |year=2005 |editor=Honderich T |title=The Oxford companion to philosophy |chapter=Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Max Velmans]] and Susan Schneider wrote in ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness'': "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Susan Schneider and [[Max Velmans]] |year=2008 |chapter=Introduction |editors=Max Velmans, Susan Schneider |title=The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-75145-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy#Western philosophy|Western philosophers]], since the time of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], have struggled to comprehend the nature of consciousness and identify its essential properties.  Issues of concern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether the concept is fundamentally coherent; whether consciousness can ever be explained [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistically]]; whether [[non-human]] consciousness exists and if so how it can be recognized; how consciousness relates to [[language]]; whether consciousness can be understood in a way that does not require a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] distinction between mental and physical states or properties; and whether it may ever be possible for computing machines like [[computer]]s or [[robot]]s to be conscious, a topic studied in the field of [[artificial intelligence]].

Thanks to developments in technology over the past few decades, consciousness has become a significant topic of interdisciplinary research in [[cognitive science]], with significant contributions from fields such as [[psychology]], anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?hl=cs&amp;lr=&amp;id=PKCHAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Consciousness+in+anthropology&amp;ots=jlAk1G7WkX&amp;sig=B_xQWrB72d-SPL3CXojvKgF_3KM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Questions of Consciousness|last=Cohen A.P., Rapport N.|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308792484_Quantum_Anthropology_Man_Cultures_and_Groups_in_a_Quantum_Perspective|title=section on consciousness on pp.33-42 in Quantum anthropology: Man, cultures, and groups in a quantum perspective|last=Trnka R., Lorencova R.|first=|publisher=Charles University Karolinum Press|year=2016|isbn=978-80-246-3470-8|location=Prague|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. The primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for [[information]] to be present in consciousness—that is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness.  The majority of experimental studies assess consciousness in humans by asking subjects for a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., "tell me if you notice anything when I do this").  Issues of interest include phenomena such as [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal perception]], [[blindsight]], [[anosognosia|denial of impairment]], and [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] produced by alcohol and other drugs, or spiritual or meditative techniques.

In [[medicine]], consciousness is assessed by observing a patient's arousal and responsiveness, and can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through disorientation, delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Güven Güzeldere |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical debates |year=1997 |editors=Ned Block, Owen Flanagan, Güven Güzeldere |pages=1–67 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues of practical concern include how the presence of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people, and how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Late recovery from the minimally conscious state: ethical and policy implications |authors=J.

==Etymology==
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|right|150px|[[John Locke]], British philosopher active in the 17th century]]
The origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', published in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Chapter XXVII)|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=University of Adelaide|location=Australia|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/locke/john/l81u/B2.27.html|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Locke defined consciousness as "the perception of what passes in a man's own mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133274/consciousness|title=Science &amp; Technology: consciousness|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His essay influenced the 18th-century view of consciousness, and his definition appeared in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s celebrated ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of the English Language |authors=[[Samuel Johnson]] |publisher=Knapton |year=1756 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcVEAAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Consciousness" (French: ''conscience'') is also defined in the 1753 volume of Diderot and d'Alembert's [[Encyclopédie]], as "the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have from what we do." &lt;ref&gt;Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de. "Consciousness." The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project. Translated by Scott St. Louis. Ann Arbor: Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library, 2014. http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0002.986. Originally published as "Conscience," Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, 3:902 (Paris, 1753).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest English language uses of "conscious" and "consciousness" date back, however, to the 1500s.  The English word "conscious" originally derived from the Latin ''conscius'' (''con-'' "together" and [[wikt:scio|''scio'']] "to know"), but the Latin word did not have the same meaning as our word—it meant "knowing with", in other words "having joint or common [[knowledge]] with another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in words |author =[[C. S. Lewis]]|year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Ch. 8: Conscience and conscious |isbn=978-0-521-39831-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase ''conscius sibi'', which translates literally as "knowing with oneself", or in other words "sharing knowledge with oneself about something".  This phrase had the figurative meaning of "knowing that one knows", as the modern English word "conscious" does.  In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word "conscious" retained the meaning of the Latin ''conscius''.  For example, [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' wrote: "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leviathan: or, The Matter, Forme &amp; Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civill |author=[[Thomas Hobbes]] |publisher=University Press |year=1904 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oc6AAAAMAAJ |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin phrase ''conscius sibi'', whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as "conscious to oneself" or "conscious unto oneself".  For example, [[Archbishop Ussher]] wrote in 1613 of "being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The whole works, Volume 2 |author=[[James Ussher]], [[Charles Richard Elrington]] |page=417 |year=1613 |publisher=Hodges and Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.

A related word was ''[[:la:conscientia|conscientia]]'', which primarily means [[morality|moral]] [[conscience]]. In the literal sense, "conscientia" means knowledge-with, that is, shared knowledge. The word first appears in Latin juridical texts by writers such as [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Dictionary of Untranslatables. A Philosophical Lexicon| authors=Barbara Cassin |publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn=978-0-691-13870-1| year=2014|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''conscientia'' is the knowledge that a witness has of the deed of someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=G. Molenaar|title=Seneca's Use of the Term Conscientia|journal=Mnemosyne| volume=22|year=1969|pages=170–180|doi=10.1163/156852569x00670}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use ''conscientia'' in a way that does not fit this traditional meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Boris Hennig |title=Cartesian Conscientia|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy |year=2007 |volume=15 |pages=455–484 |doi=10.1080/09608780701444915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes used ''conscientia'' the way modern speakers would use "conscience".  In ''Search after Truth'' (''{{lang|la|Regulæ ad directionem ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale}}'', Amsterdam 1701) he says "conscience or internal testimony" (''conscientiâ, vel interno testimonio'').&lt;ref&gt;Charles Adam, [[Paul Tannery]] (eds.), ''Oeuvres de Descartes'' X, [https://archive.org/stream/oeuvresdedescar10desc#page/524/mode/2up 524] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=205–206 |title=Consciousness: from perception to reflection in the history of philosophy |isbn=978-1-4020-6081-6 |publisher=Springer |author=Sara Heinämaa, Vili Lähteenmäki, Pauliina Remes (eds.) |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictionary definitions==
The dictionary meanings of the word ''consciousness'' extend through several centuries and several associated related meanings. These have ranged from formal definitions to definitions attempting to capture the less easily captured and more debated meanings and usage of the word.

One formal definition indicating the range of these related meanings is given in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' stating that ''consciousness'' is:
#* ''awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact: intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one's inner self''
#* ''inward awareness of an external object, state, or fact''
#* ''concerned awareness: INTEREST, CONCERN—often used with an attributive noun. ''
# ''the state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought: mind in the broadest possible sense: something in nature that is distinguished from the physical. ''
# ''the totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span—compare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS."''

The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines consciousness as "''the state of understanding and realizing something.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/consciousness&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Oxford Living Dictionary]] defines consciousness as "''The state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings.''", "''A person's awareness or perception of something.''" and "''The fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/consciousness&lt;/ref&gt;

Most definitions include awareness, but some include a more general state of being.

==Philosophy of mind==
The [[philosophy of mind]] has given rise to many stances regarding consciousness. The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' in 1998 defines consciousness as follows:
{{quote|'''Consciousness'''—Philosophers have used the term 'consciousness' for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and phenomenal experience... Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Edward Craig]] |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Consciousness |year=1998 |isbn=0415-18707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a more skeptical definition of ''consciousness'', [[Stuart Sutherland]] has exemplified some of the difficulties in fully ascertaining all of its cognate meanings in his entry for the 1989 version of the ''Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology'':
{{quote|'''Consciousness'''—The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means.  Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousness—to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Stuart Sutherland]] |title=Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology |publisher=Macmillan |chapter=Consciousness |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-333-38829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Most writers on the philosophy of consciousness have been concerned with defending a particular point of view, and have organized their material accordingly.  For surveys, the most common approach is to follow a historical path by associating stances with the philosophers who are most strongly associated with them, for example Descartes, Locke, Kant, etc. An alternative is to organize philosophical stances according to basic issues.

===The coherence of the concept===
Philosophers and non-philosophers differ in their intuitions about what consciousness is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Justin Sytsma and Edouard Machery |title=Two conceptions of subjective experience |journal=Philosophical Studies |year=2010 |volume=151 |pages=299–327 |doi=10.1007/s11098-009-9439-x|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004888/01/Two_Conceptions_of_Subjective_Experience.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,&lt;ref name=Antony2001&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael V. Antony |title=Is ''consciousness'' ambiguous? |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=8 |year=2001 |pages=19–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions.  [[Gilbert Ryle]], for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualist]] outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of "consciousness" we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.&lt;ref name=RyleConsciousness&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Concept of Mind]] |author=[[Gilbert Ryle]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1949 |pages=156–163|isbn=978-0-226-73296-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.&lt;ref name=Sutherland/&gt;

===Types of consciousness===
Many philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively by the majority of people in spite of the difficulty in defining it.&lt;ref name="Antony2001"/&gt;  Others, though, have argued that the level of disagreement about the meaning of the word indicates that it either means different things to different people (for instance, the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] versus [[Subjectivism|subjective]] aspects of consciousness), or else is an [[umbrella term]] encompassing a variety of distinct meanings with no simple element in common.&lt;ref name=Velmans2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Max Velmans]] |title=How to define consciousness—and how not to define consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2009 |volume=16 |pages=139–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ned Block]] proposed a distinction between two types of consciousness that he called ''phenomenal'' (P-consciousness) and ''access'' (A-consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editors=N. Block, O. Flanagan, G. Guzeldere |chapter=On a confusion about a function of consciousness |author=[[Ned Block]] |pages=375–415 |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-262-52210-6 |publisher=MIT Press |url=http://cogprints.org/231/1/199712004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  P-consciousness, according to Block, is simply raw experience:  it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies' and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called [[qualia]].  A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we [[perception|perceive]], information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we [[introspection|introspect]], information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we [[memory|remember]], information about the past is access conscious, and so on.  Although some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]], have disputed the validity of this distinction,&lt;ref name="D375"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Daniel Dennett]] |year=2004 |title=[[Consciousness Explained]] |page=375 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-7139-9037-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have broadly accepted it.  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging:  he calls this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=ChalmersHardProblem&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |author=[[David Chalmers]] |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |year=1995 |pages=200–219 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308163649/http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |archivedate=2005-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story.  [[William Lycan]], for example, argued in his book ''Consciousness and Experience'' that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness ''of''; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)—and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[William Lycan]] |title=Consciousness and Experience |pages=1–4 |year=1996 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-12197-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also debate over whether or not a-consciousness and p-consciousness always co-exist or if they can exist separately.  Although p-consciousness without a-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block for instance suggests the case of a “zombie” that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding "I don’t know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Block N | year = 1995 | title = How many concepts of consciousness? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 272–84 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind–body problem===
{{main|Mind–body problem}}
[[Image:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of dualism by [[René Descartes]]. Inputs are passed by the sensory organs to the [[pineal gland]] and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
Mental processes (such as consciousness) and physical processes (such as brain events) seem to be correlated: but what is the basis of this connection and correlation between what seem to be two very different kinds of processes?

The first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was [[René Descartes|Descartes]], and the answer he gave is known as [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]].  Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called [[mental substance|res cogitans]] (the realm of thought), in contrast to the domain of material things, which he called [[res extensa]] (the realm of extension).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Man: selected readings|last=Dy, Jr.|first=Manuel B.|publisher=Goodwill Trading Co.|year=2001|isbn=971-12-0245-X|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain, perhaps in a small midline structure called the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref name="Stanford_pineal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland|publisher=Stanford University|date=November 5, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pineal-gland/|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is widely accepted that Descartes explained the problem cogently, few later philosophers have been happy with his solution, and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the pineal gland |author=Gert-Jan Lokhorst |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no alternative solution has gained general acceptance.  Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories:  [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] solutions that maintain Descartes' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and [[monism|monist]] solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects.  Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants.  The two main types of dualism are [[substance dualism]] (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics) and [[property dualism]] (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind).  The three main types of monism are [[physicalism]] (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), [[idealism]] (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and [[neutral monism]] (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them).  There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Jaworski |title=Philosophy of Mind: A Comprehensive Introduction |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4443-3367-1 |pages=5–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms. The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]], in his book ''[[Man a Machine]]'' (''L'homme machine'').  His arguments, however, were very abstract.&lt;ref name=LaMettrie&gt;{{cite book| editor=Ann Thomson |author=[[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] |title=Machine man and other writings |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-47849-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as [[Gerald Edelman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind |author=[[Gerald Edelman]] |publisher=Basic Books |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-465-00764-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[António Damásio|Antonio Damasio]],&lt;ref name=DamasioFeeling&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Antonio Damasio]] |year=1999 |title=The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Press |isbn=978-0-15-601075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Daniel Dennett]] |year=1991 |title=Consciousness Explained |location=Boston |publisher=Little &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-316-18066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain. Many other neuroscientists, such as [[Christof Koch]],&lt;ref name=KochQuest&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Christof Koch]] |year=2004 |title=The Quest for Consciousness |location=Englewood CO |publisher=Roberts &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-9747077-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories. At the same time, computer scientists working in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can [[Artificial consciousness|simulate or embody consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Ron Sun and Stan Franklin, Computational models of consciousness: A taxonomy and some examples.   In:  P. D. Zelazo, M. Moscovitch, and E. Thompson (eds.), The Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness, pp.151-174. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] may provide [[quantum mind|the missing ingredients]]. Several theorists have therefore proposed [[quantum mind]] (QM) theories of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Stanford_qm_cos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum Approaches to Consciousness|publisher=Stanford University|date=December 25, 2011|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable theories falling into this category include the [[holonomic brain theory]] of [[Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram]] and [[David Bohm]], and the [[Orch-OR|Orch-OR theory]] formulated by [[Stuart Hameroff]] and [[Roger Penrose]]. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel&lt;ref name="Cai2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.82.021921 |last1=Cai |first1=J. |last2=Popescu |first2=S. |last3=Briegel |first3=H. |title=Persistent dynamic entanglement from classical motion: How bio-molecular machines can generate non-trivial quantum states |journal=Physical Review E |volume=82 |pages=021921 |arxiv=0809.4906 |bibcode=2010PhRvE..82b1921C }}&lt;/ref&gt; could falsify proposals such as those of Hameroff, which rely on [[quantum entanglement]] in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[John Searle]] |year=1997 |title=The Mystery of Consciousness |publisher=The New York Review of Books |pages=53–88 |isbn=978-0-940322-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the general question of the [[Hard problem of consciousness|"hard problem" of consciousness]], roughly speaking, the question of how mental experience arises from a physical basis,&lt;ref name=Gennaro&gt;

For a discussion see {{cite book |title=The Consciousness Paradox: Consciousness, Concepts, and Higher-Order Thoughts |author= Rocco J. Gennaro |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-XgKMgzwk4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75 |page=75 |chapter=§4.4 The hard problem of consciousness |isbn=0-262-01660-5 |year=2011 |publisher=MIT Press}}

&lt;/ref&gt; a more specialized question is how to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions (at least in some small measure) with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events. The topic of [[free will]] is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.

===Problem of other minds===
{{main|Problem of other minds}}

Many philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively.  But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do the vast majority of people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knobe J |year=2008 |title=Can a Robot, an Insect or God Be Aware? |journal=Scientific American: Mind |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-a-robot-an-insect-or |doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind1208-68 |volume=19 |pages=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called the [[problem of other minds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alec Hyslop |title=Other Minds |year=1995 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-7923-3245-9 |pages=5–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert Kirk |title=Zombies |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/zombies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name="Ridley Scott pp. 133-144"&gt;''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', Greg Littmann, pp. 133-144, Lexington Books (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying [[artificial intelligence]] in androids.&lt;ref name="Machine Morals 2010"&gt;''Moral Machines'', Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen, 288 pages, Oxford University Press, USA (June 3, 2010), {{ISBN|0199737975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences of the sort that we do.&lt;ref name=HyslopAnalogy/&gt;  There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation.  For one thing, it seems to violate the [[Occam's razor|principle of parsimony]], by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe.&lt;ref name=HyslopAnalogy&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alec Hyslop |chapter=The analogical inference to other minds |title=Other Minds |year=1995 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-7923-3245-9 |pages=41–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] in an essay titled ''The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies'', argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Daniel Dennett]] |title=The unimagined preposterousness of zombies |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |year=1995 |pages=322–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior.  A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can ''do'', including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Stevan Harnad]] |title=Why and how we are not zombies |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=1995 |volume=1 |pages=164–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal consciousness===
{{see also|Animal consciousness}}

The topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties.  It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form, because non-human animals, lacking the ability to express human language, cannot tell us about their experiences.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite web |author=Colin Allen |title=Animal consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/consciousness-animal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong.  Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals due to the fact that he believed only humans have a non-physical mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] |title=Sympathy and subjectivity |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=77 |pages=465–482 |doi=10.1080/00048409912349231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most people have a strong intuition that some animals, such as cats and dogs, are conscious, while others, such as insects, are not; but the sources of this intuition are not obvious, and are often based on personal interactions with pets and other animals they have observed.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

Philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. [[Thomas Nagel]] spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled ''[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]''.  He said that an organism is conscious "if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism — something it is like ''for'' the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself.&lt;ref name=NagelBat&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Thomas Nagel]] |title=Mortal Questions |chapter=Ch. 12 What is it like to be a bat? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-521-40676-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other thinkers, such as [[Douglas Hofstadter]], dismiss this argument as incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Douglas Hofstadter]] |chapter=Reflections on ''What Is It Like to Be a Bat?'' |pages=403–414 |title=[[The Mind's I]] |editors=[[Douglas Hofstadter]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] |publisher=Basic Books |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-7108-0352-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive — [[Donald Griffin]]'s 2001 book ''Animal Minds'' reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.&lt;ref name=Griffin2001&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal Minds: Beyond Cognition to Consciousness |author=[[Donald Griffin]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-226-30865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2012, eminent scientists from different branches of neuroscience gathered at the [[University of Cambridge]] to celebrate the Francis Crick Memorial Conference, which deals with consciousness in humans and pre-linguistic consciousness in nonhuman animals. After the conference, they signed in the presence of [[Stephen Hawking]], the 'Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness', which summarizes the most important findings of the survey:

"We decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to the public that is not scientific. It's obvious to everyone in this room that animals have consciousness, but it is not obvious to the rest of the world. It is not obvious to the rest of the Western world or the Far East. It is not obvious to the society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSbom5MsfNM|title=Animal Consciousness Officially Recognized by Leading Panel of Neuroscientists|date=3 September 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an [[wikt:artifact|artifact]] made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology, appearing for example in the Greek myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], who carved a statue that was magically brought to life, and in medieval Jewish stories of the [[Golem]], a magically animated homunculus built of clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Moshe Idel |title=Golem: Jewish Magical and Mystical Traditions on the Artificial Anthropoid |year=1990 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-0160-6}} Note: In many stories the Golem was mindless, but some gave it emotions or thoughts.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by [[Ada Lovelace]], in a set of notes written in 1842 about the [[Analytical Engine]] invented by [[Charles Babbage]], a precursor (never built) to modern electronic computers.  Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could think in a humanlike way.  She wrote:

{{quote|It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine.&amp;nbsp;... The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do whatever we ''know how to order it'' to perform. It can ''follow'' analysis; but it has no power of ''anticipating'' any analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making ''available'' what we are already acquainted with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Ada Lovelace]] |title=Sketch of The Analytical Engine, Note G |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the most influential contributions to this question was an essay written in 1950 by pioneering computer scientist [[Alan Turing]], titled ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]''.  Turing disavowed any interest in terminology, saying that even "Can machines think?" is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test, which has become known as the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name="tu"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Stuart Shieber |title=The Turing Test : Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-262-69293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To pass the test, a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators. In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections, and presented a counterargument to each of them.  The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of [[artificial intelligence]] as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness; it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate. For example, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious,&lt;ref name=MindsI&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] |year=1985 |title=The Mind's I |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-553-34584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[David Chalmers]] argues that a [[philosophical zombie]] could pass the test, yet fail to be conscious.&lt;ref name=Chalmers&gt;{{cite book| authors=[[David Chalmers]] |year=1997 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once machines begin to display any substantial signs of human-like behavior then the dichotomy (of human consciousness compared to human-like consciousness) becomes passé and issues of machine autonomy begin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology.&lt;ref name="Ridley Scott pp. 133-144"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Machine Morals 2010"/&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] argues that consciousness is simply the result of compression.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber2009"&gt;{{cite book| authors=[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]|year=2009|title="Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes"}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an agent sees representation of itself recurring in the environment, the compression of this representation can be called consciousness.

In a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as "the [[Chinese room]] argument", [[John Searle]] sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls "strong artificial intelligence (AI)" that a computer program can be conscious, though he does agree with advocates of "weak AI" that computer programs can be formatted to "simulate" conscious states.  His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are.  To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols.  In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program.  Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean.  If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve.  Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English.  Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.&lt;ref name=Searle1990&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[John R. Searle]]|title=Is the brain's mind a computer program |journal=Scientific American |year=1990 |volume= 262|pages=26–31 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos116/Is_The_Brains_Mind_A_Computer_Program.pdf |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0190-26 |pmid=2294583|bibcode=1990SciAm.262a..26S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SearleSEP&gt;{{cite web| title=The Chinese Room Argument| url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been second only to Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated.&lt;ref name=Searle1980&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[John Searle]]|title=Minds, brains, and programs |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |year=1980 |volume=3 |pages=417–457 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00005756|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients it would take to make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was "causal powers" of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the [[Robotics|robotic]] version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Graham Oppy |author2=David Dowe |year=2011 |title=The Turing test |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/turing-test |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires [[Symbol grounding|grounding]] the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to [[Categorization|categorize]] and interact with the things in the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on [[embodied cognition]] and [[situated cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Margaret Wilson |title=Six views of embodied cognition |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=9 |year=2002 |pages=625–636 |url=http://philosophy.wisc.edu/shapiro/PHIL951/951articles/wilson.htm |doi=10.3758/BF03196322 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927020804/http://philosophy.wisc.edu/shapiro/PHIL951/951articles/wilson.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Victor Argonov has suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 | pages=51–70 | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produces judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures’ consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be
caused by lack of the machine’s intellect, not by absence of consciousness.

==Scientific study==
For many decades, consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the majority of mainstream scientists, because of a general feeling that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied using objective experimental methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Horst Hendriks-Jansen |title=Catching ourselves in the act: situated activity, interactive emergence, evolution, and human thought |year=1996 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |page=114 |isbn=0-262-08246-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975 [[George Mandler]] published an influential psychological study which distinguished between slow, serial, and limited conscious processes and fast, parallel and extensive unconscious ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G. Consciousness: Respectable, useful, and probably necessary. In R.Solso (Ed.)Information processing and cognition: NJ: LEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1980s, an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called ''Consciousness Studies'', giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books,&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G.  Consciousness recovered: Psychological functions and origins of thought. Philadelphia: John Benjamins. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; journals such as ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', ''[http://www.frontiersin.org/Consciousness_Research Frontiers in Consciousness Research]'', ''[[Psyche (consciousness journal)|Psyche]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'', along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the [[Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Toward a Science of Consciousness III: The Third Tucson Discussions and Debates |authors=[[Stuart Hameroff]], Alfred Kaszniak, [[David Chalmers]] |chapter=Preface |isbn=978-0-262-58181-3 |publisher=MIT Press |year=1999 |pages=xix–xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are based on psychological experiments (including, for example, the investigation of [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] effects using [[subliminal stimuli]]), and on [[case studies]] of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma, illness, or drugs.  Broadly viewed, scientific approaches are based on two core concepts.  The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired.  In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it.&lt;ref name=KochQuest/&gt;

===Measurement===
[[File:Necker cube.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Necker cube]], an ambiguous image]]
Experimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties, due to the lack of a universally accepted [[operational definition]]. In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness, the subjects are human, and the criterion used is verbal report:  in other words, subjects are asked to describe their experiences, and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Bernard Baars]] |title=A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42743-2| pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, subjects who stare continuously at a [[Necker cube]] usually report that they experience it "flipping" between two 3D configurations, even though the stimulus itself remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Perception: Theory, Development, and Organization |authors=Paul Rooks and Jane Wilson |year=2000 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-19094-7 |pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of stimuli (as indicated by verbal report) and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior. In several paradigms, such as the technique of [[response priming]], the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness, and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification (double dissociation).&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Thomas Schmidt and Dirk Vorberg |title=Criteria for unconscious cognition: Three types of dissociation |journal=Perception and Psychophysics |volume=68 |year=2006 |pages=489–504 |doi=10.3758/bf03193692 |pmid=16900839 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbal report is widely considered to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues.&lt;ref name=Destrebecqz/&gt;  For one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult to make sense of the idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Quining qualia |authors=[[Daniel Dennett]] |title=Consciousness in Modern Science |editors=A. Marcel and E. Bisiach |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |url=http://cogprints.org/254/ |accessdate=2011-10-31 |isbn=978-0-19-852237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Daniel Dennett]] has argued for an approach he calls [[heterophenomenology]], which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Daniel Dennett]] |year=2003 |title=Who's on first? Heterophenomenology explained |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |pages=19–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language:  this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language.  As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the [[Turing test]] may feel that it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely:  a [[philosophical zombie]] may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[David Chalmers]] |title=The Conscious Mind |year=1996 |chapter=Ch. 3: Can consciousness be reductively explained? |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although verbal report is in practice the "gold standard" for ascribing consciousness, it is not the only possible criterion.&lt;ref name=Destrebecqz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Boundaries of Consciousness: Neurobiology and Neuropathology |chapter=Methods for studying unconscious learning |authors=Arnaud Destrebecqz and Philippe Peigneux |editor=Steven Laureys |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-52876-6 |pages=69–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In medicine, consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior, arousal, brain activity and purposeful movement.  The last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent.&lt;ref name=Giacino/&gt;  The scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive.  Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed, however, due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;  Studies of the [[neuroscience of free will]] have also shown that the experiences that people report when they behave purposefully sometimes do not correspond to their actual behaviors or to the patterns of electrical activity recorded from their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Human volition: towards a neuroscience of will |authors=Patrick Haggard |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |year=2008 |volume=9 |pages=934–946 |pmid=19020512 |doi=10.1038/nrn2497 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach applies specifically to the study of [[self-awareness]], that is, the ability to distinguish oneself from others.  In the 1970s [[Gordon G. Gallup|Gordon Gallup]] developed an operational test for self-awareness, known as the [[mirror test]].  The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals. The classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot, thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Gordon G. Gallup|Gordon Gallup]] |title=Chimpanzees: Self recognition |journal=Science |volume=167 |pages=86–87 |year=1970 |doi=10.1126/science.167.3914.86 |pmid=4982211 |issue=3914|bibcode=1970Sci...167...86G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans (older than 18 months) and other [[Hominidae|great apes]], [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s, [[Columbidae|pigeons]], [[Eurasian magpie|European magpies]] and [[elephants]] have all been observed to pass this test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Animal consciousness: a synthetic approach |authors=David Edelman and Anil Seth |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |year=2009 |volume=32 |pages=476–484 |pmid=19716185 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2009.05.008 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural correlates===
[[File:Neural Correlates Of Consciousness.jpg|thumb|right|550px|{{center|Schema of the neural processes underlying consciousness, from [[Christof Koch]]}}]]

A major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains—that is, studies of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]].  The hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness.  Several brain imaging techniques, such as [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]], have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors=[[Christof Koch]] |year=2004 |title=The Quest for Consciousness |location=Englewood CO |publisher=Roberts &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-9747077-0-9 |pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that consciousness is associated with high-frequency (gamma band) [[neural oscillations|oscillations in brain activity]].  This idea arose from proposals in the 1980s, by Christof von der Malsburg and Wolf Singer, that gamma oscillations could solve the so-called [[binding problem]], by linking information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Binding by synchrony |author=Wolf Singer |publisher=[[Scholarpedia]] |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Binding_by_synchrony |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rodolfo Llinás]], for example, proposed that consciousness results from [[recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance]] where the specific thalamocortical systems (content) and the non-specific (centromedial thalamus) thalamocortical systems (context) interact in the [[gamma wave|gamma]] band frequency via synchronous oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Rodolfo Llinás]] |year=2002 |title=I of the Vortex. From Neurons to Self |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-62163-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness:  it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the [[primary visual cortex]] show clear electrical responses to a stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', pp. 105–116&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher brain areas are seen as more promising, especially the [[prefrontal cortex]], which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as [[executive functions]].  There is substantial evidence that a "top-down" flow of neural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a "bottom-up" flow of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A framework for consciousness |authors=[[Francis Crick]] and [[Christof Koch]] |year=2003 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=6 |pages=119–126 |pmid=12555104 |url=http://papers.klab.caltech.edu/29/1/438.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1038/nn0203-119 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522054447/http://papers.klab.caltech.edu/29/1/438.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however:  studies by [[Nikos Logothetis]] and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the [[temporal lobe]] reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry).&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', pp. 269–286&lt;/ref&gt;

Modulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In contrast to the raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an important aspect of consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić it has been shown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Biederlack J. |author2=Castelo-Branco M. |author3=Neuenschwander S. |author4=Wheeler D.W. |author5=Singer W. |author6=Nikolić D. | year = 2006 | title = Brightness induction: Rate enhancement and neuronal synchronization as complementary codes | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 1073–1083 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.012 | pmid=17178409}}&lt;/ref&gt; An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Williams Adrian L. |author2=Singh Krishna D. |author3=Smith Andrew T. | year = 2003 | title = Surround modulation measured with functional MRI in the human visual cortex | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 89 | issue = 1| pages = 525–533 | doi=10.1152/jn.00048.2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.

In 2011, [[Michael Graziano|Graziano]] and Kastner&lt;ref name="Graziano&amp;Kastner2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Graziano, M.S.A.  |author2=Kastner, S | year=2011 | title=Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis | journal=Cog.

In that theory, specific cortical areas, notably in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporo-parietal junction, are used to build the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people. The same cortical machinery is also used to attribute awareness to oneself. Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as [[hemispatial neglect]]. In the [[attention]] schema theory, the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person's attentional processing. [[Attention]] is a style of [[information processing]] in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals. Awareness, in this theory, is a useful, simplified schema that represents attentional states. To be aware of X is explained by constructing a model of one's attentional focus on X.

In the 2013, the perturbational complexity index (PCI) was proposed, a measure of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]]. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Adenauer G.

Assuming that not only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious, a number of evolutionary approaches to the problem of neural correlates of consciousness open up. For example, assuming that birds are conscious — a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds — there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal, currently competing, mammalian consciousness–brain theories. The rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain. So how similar are they? What homologues can be identified? The general conclusion from the study by Butler, et al.,&lt;ref name=Butler2005&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ann B. Butler |author2=Paul R.

The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains. Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch,&lt;ref name="Crick1995"/&gt; Edelman and Tononi,&lt;ref name="Edelman2000"/&gt; and Cotterill &lt;ref name="Cotterill2001"/&gt; seem  to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious. Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness (which is a trait shared by humans and non-human animals) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity.&lt;ref name="Edelman2000"/&gt; Certain aspects of the three theories, however, seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness. For instance, the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role, seems difficult to apply to the avian brain, since the avian homologues have a different morphology. Likewise, the theory of Eccles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| year=1982 |author=[[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|J.C.

The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus. The reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains, meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists.

[[Joaquin Fuster]] of UCLA has advocated the position of the importance of the prefrontal cortex in humans, along with the areas of Wernicke and Broca, as being of particular importance to the development of human language capacities neuro-anatomically necessary for the emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Fuster, ''The Prefrontal Cortex'', Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological function and evolution===
Opinions are divided as to where in biological [[evolution]] consciousness emerged and about whether or not consciousness has any survival value. Some argue that consciousness is a byproduct of evolution. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Peter Århem, B.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] defends in an essay titled ''On the Hypothesis that Animals are [[Automaton|Automata]], and its History'' an [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalist]] theory of consciousness according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity — “as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[T. H. Huxley]] |title=On the hypothesis that animals are automata, and its history |journal=The Fortnightly Review |volume=16 |pages=555–580|year=1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this [[William James]] objects in his essay ''Are We Automata?'' by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of [[natural selection]], it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[William James|W.

Popper]], [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John C. Eccles]]|publisher=Springer International |year=1977|isbn=0-387-08307-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the primary function of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing that would otherwise be independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Bernard Baars]] |title=The conscious access hypothesis: Origins and recent evidence |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=6 |pages=47–52 |pmid=11849615 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01819-2 |issue=1 |date=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been called the ''integration consensus''. Another example has been proposed by [[Gerald Edelman]] called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on [[reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrant]] connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seth|first=Anil|author2=Eugene Izhikevich |author3=George Reeke |author4=Gerald Edelman |title=Theories and measures of consciousness: An extended framework|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2006|volume=103|issue=28|doi=10.1073/pnas.0604347103 |pages=10799–10804 |pmid=16818879 |pmc=1487169|bibcode=2006PNAS..10310799S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see ''[[#Neural correlates|Neural correlates]]'' section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ezequiel Morsella |year=2005 |title=The function of phenomenal states: Supramodular Interaction Theory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=112 |pages=1000–1021 |pmid=16262477 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.4.1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As noted earlier, even among writers who consider consciousness to be a well-defined thing, there is [[Animal consciousness|widespread dispute]] about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it.&lt;ref name = "ingvww"&gt;{{cite book |author=S. Budiansky |title=If a Lion Could Talk: Animal Intelligence and the Evolution of Consciousness |year=1998 |publisher=The Free Press |isbn=978-0-684-83710-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non-human animals (see previous paragraph). Thus, any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties.  Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of  [[evolutionary biology]] as an [[adaptation]] in the sense of a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] that increases [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=S.

Other philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=[[Owen Flanagan]] and T.

===States of consciousness===
[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Buddhist monk meditating]]
There are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent, including dreamless sleep, coma, and death.  There are also a variety of circumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the world in less drastic ways, producing what are known as [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]].  Some altered states occur naturally; others can be produced by drugs or brain damage.&lt;ref name=Vaitl&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dieter Vaitl |title=Psychobiology of altered states of consciousness |year=2005 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=131 |pages=98–127 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.98 |pmid=15631555 |issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altered states can be accompanied by changes in thinking, disturbances in the sense of time, feelings of loss of control, changes in emotional expression, alternations in body image and changes in meaning or significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schacter|first1=Daniel|last2=Gilbert|first2=Daniel|last3=Wegner|first3=Daniel|title=Psychology 2nd Ed.|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=41 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010|page=190|isbn=1-4292-3719-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most widely accepted altered states are [[sleep]] and [[dream]]ing.  Although dream sleep and non-dream sleep appear very similar to an outside observer, each is associated with a distinct pattern of brain activity, metabolic activity, and eye movement;  each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition.  During ordinary non-dream sleep, people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy thoughts, and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous narrative.  During dream sleep, in contrast, people who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous progression, which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Anton Coenen |title=Subconscious Stimulus Recognition and Processing During Sleep | url = http://journalpsyche.org/archive/volume-16-no-2-2010/ |year=2010 |journal=Psyche |volume=16-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thought processes during the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality.  Both dream and non-dream states are associated with severe disruption of memory:  it usually disappears in seconds during the non-dream state, and in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[J. Allan Hobson]], Edward F. Pace-Schott, and [[Robert Stickgold]] |chapter=Dreaming and the brain: Toward a cognitive neuroscience of conscious states |title=Sleep and Dreaming: Scientific Advances and Reconsiderations |editors=Edward F.

Research conducted on the effects of partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, M., Valli, K., Revonsuo, A., &amp; Wedlund, J., 2008.

Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.

A variety of [[psychoactive drug]]s, including [[Ethanol|alcohol]], have notable effects on consciousness.&lt;ref name="DSMIV"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W-BGAAAAMAAJ | date = 31 July 1994 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from a simple dulling of awareness produced by [[sedative]]s, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by [[stimulant]]s, [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]].&lt;ref name=Vaitl/&gt; [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[mescaline]], [[psilocybin]], [[Dimethyltryptamine]], and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of [[Ethanol|alcohol]],&lt;ref name="DSMIV"/&gt; but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] play an essential role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Lyvers |title=The neurochemistry of psychedelic experiences |year=2003 |publisher=ePublications@bond |url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/hss_pubs/10 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and people who practise various techniques of meditation.  Some research with brain waves during meditation has reported differences between those corresponding to ordinary relaxation and those corresponding to meditation.  It has been disputed, however, whether there is enough evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of consciousness.&lt;ref name=MurphyMeditation&gt;{{cite book |authors=M. Murphy, S. Donovan, and E.

The most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist [[Charles Tart]] in the 1960s and 1970s.  Tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of component processes, including exteroception (sensing the external world); interoception (sensing the body); input-processing (seeing meaning); emotions; memory; time sense; sense of identity; evaluation and cognitive processing; motor output; and interaction with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Charles Tart]] |title=States of Consciousness |chapter=Ch. 2: The components of consciousness |year=2001 |publisher=IUniverse.com |isbn=978-0-595-15196-7 |url=http://www.psychedelic-library.org/soc2.htm |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these, in his view, could be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations.  The components that Tart identified have not, however, been validated by empirical studies.  Research in this area has not yet reached firm conclusions, but a recent questionnaire-based study identified eleven significant factors contributing to drug-induced states of consciousness:  experience of unity; spiritual experience; blissful state; insightfulness; disembodiment; impaired control and cognition; anxiety; complex imagery; elementary imagery; audio-visual [[synesthesia]]; and changed meaning of percepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Psychometric evaluation of the altered states of consciousness rating scale (OAV)| authors=E.

===Phenomenology===
Phenomenology is a method of inquiry that attempts to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. This approach was first proposed by the philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]], and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Sokolowski |title=Introduction to Phenomenology |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=211–227 |isbn=978-0-521-66792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. [[phenomenology (philosophy)|In philosophy]], phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of [[intentionality]] (''"aboutness"''). [[phenomenology (psychology)|In psychology]], phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of [[introspection]], which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute in the early twentieth century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trusting the Subject?: The Use of Introspective Evidence in Cognitive Science, Volume 1 |editors=Anthony Jack, Andreas Roepstorff |publisher=Imprint Academic |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-907845-56-0 |chapter=Valid and non-reactive verbalization of thoughts during performance of tasks: towards a solution to the central problems of introspection as a source of scientific evidence |author=[[K.

Introspectively, the world of conscious experience seems to have considerable structure.  [[Immanuel Kant]] asserted that the world as we perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental "intuitions", which include 'object' (we perceive the world as a set of distinct things); 'shape'; 'quality' (color, warmth, etc.); 'space' (distance, direction, and location); and 'time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kant's view of the mind and consciousness of self |author=Andrew Brook |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/#3.2.1}}  Note: translating Kant's terminology into English is often difficult.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these constructs, such as space and time, correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics; for others the correspondence is not as clear. Understanding the physical basis of qualities, such as redness or pain, has been particularly challenging. David Chalmers has called this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=ChalmersHardProblem /&gt; Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable, because qualities ("[[qualia]]") are [[ineffability|ineffable]]; that is, they are "raw feels", incapable of being analyzed into component processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=On leaving out what it's like |author=[[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]] |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editors=N. Block, O. Flanagan, G. Guzeldere |year=1998 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-52210-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other psychologists and neuroscientists reject these arguments. For example, research on [[ideasthesia]] shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network. Nevertheless, it is clear that the relationship between a physical entity such as light and a perceptual quality such as color is extraordinarily complex and indirect, as demonstrated by a variety of [[optical illusion]]s such as [[neon color spreading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Science of Color |editor=Steven K. Shevell |chapter=Color appearance |author=Steven K. Shevell |pages=149–190 |year=2003 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-51251-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In neuroscience, a great deal of effort has gone into investigating how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the [[thalamus]] and then to the [[primary visual cortex]]; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion.&lt;ref name=BennettHacker&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience |authors=M. R. Bennett and Peter Michael Stephan Hacker |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 |pages=121–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, [[working memory]] allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—[[Gerald Edelman]] expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness ''The Remembered Present''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Gerald Edelman]] |title=The Remembered Present: A Biological Theory of Consciousness |publisher=Basic Books |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-465-06910-1 |pages=109–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In computational neuroscience, [[Bayesian approaches to brain function]] have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Knill DC | year = 2007 | title = Learning Bayesian priors for depth perception | url = http://journalofvision.org//7/8/13/ | journal = Journal of Vision | volume = 7 | issue = 8| pages = 1–20 | doi = 10.1167/7.8.13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Battaglia PW, Jacobs RA, Aslin RN | year = 2003 | title = Bayesian integration of visual and auditory signals for spatial localization | url = http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josaa-20-7-1391 | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 1391–7 | doi=10.1364/josaa.20.001391| bibcode = 2003JOSAA..20.1391B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=Daniel|author2=Tong, Jonathan|title=Prediction, Postdiction, and Perceptual Length Contraction: A Bayesian Low-Speed Prior Captures the Cutaneous Rabbit and Related Illusions|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=10 May 2013|volume=4|issue=221|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00221|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/consciousness_research/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00221/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large amount of information available, many important aspects of perception remain mysterious. A great deal is known about low-level signal processing in sensory systems. However, how sensory systems, action systems, and language systems interact are poorly understood. At a deeper level, there are still basic conceptual issues that remain unresolved.&lt;ref name=BennettHacker/&gt;  Many scientists have found it difficult to reconcile the fact that information is distributed across multiple brain areas with the apparent unity of consciousness: this is one aspect of the so-called [[binding problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', pp. 167–170&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some scientists who have expressed grave reservations about the idea that the brain forms representations of the outside world at all: influential members of this group include psychologist [[James J. Gibson|J. J. Gibson]] and roboticist [[Rodney Brooks]], who both argued in favor of "intelligence without representation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Rodney Brooks]] |title=Intelligence without representation |year=1991 |journal=Artificial Intelligence |volume=47 |pages=139–159 |doi=10.1016/0004-3702(91)90053-M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical aspects==
The medical approach to consciousness is practically oriented.   It derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease, brain damage, toxins, or drugs.  In medicine, conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments.   Whereas the philosophical approach to consciousness focuses on its fundamental nature and its contents, the medical approach focuses on the amount of consciousness a person has:  in medicine, consciousness is assessed as a "level" ranging from coma and brain death at the low end, to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld&gt;{{cite book |title=The Neurology of Consciousness: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropathology |editors=Steven Laureys, Giulio Tononi |chapter=The neurological examination of consciousness |author=Hal Blumenfeld |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-374168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consciousness is of concern to patients and physicians, especially [[neurology|neurologists]] and [[anesthesia|anesthesiologists]]. Patients may suffer from disorders of consciousness, or may need to be anesthetized for a surgical procedure.  Physicians may perform consciousness-related interventions such as instructing the patient to sleep, administering [[general anesthesia]], or inducing [[induced coma|medical coma]].&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld/&gt; Also, [[bioethics|bioethicists]] may be concerned with the ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients such as the [[Karen Ann Quinlan case]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kinney HC, Korein J, Panigrahy A, Dikkes P, Goode R |date=26 May 1994|issue=21|journal=N Engl J Med|pages=1469–1475|pmid=8164698|title=Neuropathological findings in the brain of Karen Ann Quinlan -- the role of the thalamus in the persistent vegetative state|volume=330|doi=10.1056/NEJM199405263302101}}&lt;/ref&gt; while neuroscientists may study patients with impaired consciousness in hopes of gaining information about how the brain works.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', pp. 216–226&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
In medicine, consciousness is examined using a set of procedures known as [[neuropsychological assessment]].&lt;ref name=Giacino&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. T. Giacino |author2=C. M. Smart |year=2007 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e3282f189ef |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |pages=614–619 |pmid=17992078 |title=Recent advances in behavioral assessment of individuals with disorders of consciousness |volume=20 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise.  The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli.  If so, the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands.  If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time.  A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be "alert and oriented times four" (sometimes denoted "A&amp;Ox4" on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Abnormal Psychology |authors=V. Mark Durand and David H. Barlow |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-495-59982-1 |pages=74–75}}  Note: A patient who can additionally describe the current situation may be referred to as "oriented times four".&lt;/ref&gt;

The more complex procedure is known as a [[neurological examination]], and is usually carried out by a [[neurology|neurologist]] in a hospital setting.  A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests, beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes, and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language.  The outcome may be summarized using the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], which yields a number in the range 3—15, with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma, and 15 indicating full consciousness.  The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales, measuring the best motor response (ranging from "no motor response" to "obeys commands"), the best eye response (ranging from "no eye opening" to "eyes opening spontaneously") and the best verbal response (ranging from "no verbal response" to "fully oriented").  There is also a simpler [[Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale|pediatric]] version of the scale, for children too young to be able to use language.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld/&gt;

In 2013, an experimental procedure was developed to measure degrees of consciousness, the procedure involving stimulating the brain with a magnetic pulse, measuring resulting waves of electrical activity, and developing a consciousness score based on the complexity of the brain activity.&lt;ref name=NBCnews20130814&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/new-tool-peeks-brain-measure-consciousness-6C10919906 |title=New tool peeks into brain to measure consciousness |last=Neergaard |first=Lauren |date=August 14, 2013 |publisher=Associated Press through NBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IsYP826u?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/new-tool-peeks-brain-measure-consciousness-6C10919906 |archivedate=August 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorders of consciousness===
Medical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered [[disorders of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="chronic"/&gt; This category generally includes [[minimally conscious state]] and [[persistent vegetative state]], but sometimes also includes the less severe [[locked-in syndrome]] and more severe [[coma|chronic coma]].&lt;ref name="chronic"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181–1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}

===Anosognosia===
{{main|Anosognosia}}
One of the most striking disorders of consciousness goes by the name [[anosognosia]], a Greek-derived term meaning 'unawareness of disease'.  This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly as a result of a [[stroke]], but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=George Prigatano, [[Daniel Schacter]]|title=Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |chapter=Introduction |authors=George P. Prigatano and [[Daniel Schacter]]|pages=3–16 |isbn=0-19-505941-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the [[parietal lobe]] in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as [[hemispatial neglect]], characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies.  Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move.  When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense.  Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies:  one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him.  An even more striking type of anosognosia is [[Anton–Babinski syndrome]], a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=George Prigatano, [[Daniel Schacter]]|title=Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |chapter=Anosognosia: possible neuropsychological mechanisms |authors=Kenneth M. Heilman|pages=53–62 |isbn=0-19-505941-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stream of consciousness==
{{Main|Stream of consciousness (psychology)}}

[[William James]] is usually credited with popularizing the idea that human consciousness flows like a stream, in his ''Principles of Psychology'' of 1890.  According to James, the "stream of thought" is governed by five characteristics:  "(1) Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness. (2) Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing. (3) Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous. (4) It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself. (5) It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[William James]] |title=The Principles of Psychology, Volume 1 |year=1890 |publisher=H. Holt |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar concept appears in Buddhist philosophy, expressed by the Sanskrit term ''Citta-saṃtāna'', which is usually translated as [[mindstream]] or "mental continuum". Buddhist teachings describe that consciousness manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; These triggers are input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations), or a thought (relating to the past, present or the future) that happen to arise in the mind. The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are: feelings, perceptions and intentions/behaviour.  The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time. It even happens in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The purpose of the Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Losing the Clouds, Gaining the Sky: Buddhism and the Natural Mind |chapter=Taming the mindstream |author=Dzogchen Rinpoche |editor=Doris Wolter |year=2007 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=978-0-86171-359-2 |pages=81–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative form ===

In the west, the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science:  [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness as a narrative mode]] means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences of a character.  This technique perhaps had its beginnings in the monologues of Shakespeare's plays, and reached its fullest development in the novels of [[James Joyce]] and [[Virginia Woolf]], although it has also been used by many other noted writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Robert Humphrey |title=Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel |year=1954 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-00585-3 |pages=23–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here for example is a passage from Joyce's [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]] about the thoughts of Molly Bloom:

{{quote|Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors=[[James Joyce]] |title=Ulysses |year=1990 |publisher=BompaCrazy.com |page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Role in quantum mechanics==
Consciousness may have a determinative role in [[quantum mechanics]].  Since consciousness is the primary aspect of an observer, and observation is sometimes viewed as a primary reason for apparent [[wave function collapse]],&lt;ref&gt;Aharonov, Y., Anandan, J., &amp; Vaidman, L. (1993). Meaning of the wave function. Physical Review A, 47(6), 4616.&lt;/ref&gt; consciousness may account for aspects of the  [[measurement problem]] exemplified by the [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox. This area has been an area of lively debate for decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-88026-1_2|chapter = Quantum Mechanics without "The Observer"|title = Quantum Theory and Reality| volume=2| pages=7–44|series = Studies in the Foundations Methodology and Philosophy of Science|year = 1967|last1 = Popper|first1 = Karl R.| isbn=978-3-642-88028-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with recent efforts to substitute randomly caused [[decoherence]] as the source of apparent wave function collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0512078|last1 = Zeh|first1 = H. D.|title = Roots and Fruits of Decoherence|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adler, S. L. (2003). Why decoherence has not solved the measurement problem: a response to PW Anderson. Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 34(1), 135-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]] provided a useful survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0101077|last1 = Zeh|first1 = H. D.|title = 100 Years of the Quantum|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; of some of the issues.

==Spiritual approaches==
{{Further|Level of consciousness (esotericism)|Higher consciousness}}
To most philosophers, the word "consciousness" connotes the relationship between the mind and the world. To writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and God, or the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world.  [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna consciousness]], for example, is a term used to mean an intimate linkage between the mind of a worshipper and the god Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynne Gibson |title=Modern World Religions: Hinduism |publisher=Heinemann Educational Publishers |year=2002 |isbn=0-435-33619-3|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mystical psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke]] distinguished between three types of consciousness:  'Simple Consciousness', awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; 'Self Consciousness', awareness of being aware, possessed only by humans; and 'Cosmic Consciousness', awareness of the life and order of the universe, possessed only by humans who are enlightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Richard Maurice Bucke]]|title=Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind |publisher=Innes &amp; Sons |year=1905 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxRWAAAAMAAJ |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many more examples could be given, such as the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by [[Prem Saran Satsangi]] and [[Stuart Hameroff]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Prem Saran Satsangi|Satsangi, Prem Saran]] and [[Stuart Hameroff|Hameroff, Stuart]] (2016) [https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Integrating-Eastern-Western-Perspectives/dp/8178224933 ''Consciousness: Integrating Eastern and Western Perspectives''] New Age Books. {{ISBN|978-8178224930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be [[Ken Wilber]]'s book ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'', a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind. Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Ken Wilber]] |title=The Spectrum of Consciousness |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=2002 |isbn=978-81-208-1848-4|pages=3–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}
'''Custom''' in [[law]] is the established pattern of behavior that can be objectively verified within a particular social setting. A claim can be carried out in defense of "what has always been done and accepted by law." Related is the idea of '''prescription'''; a right enjoyed through long custom rather than positive law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/prescription "Prescription"], The Free Dictionary by Farlex. Accessed: June 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Customary law''' (also, '''consuetudinary''' or '''unofficial law''') exists where:  
#a certain legal practice is observed and
#the relevant actors consider it to be law (''[[opinio juris]]'').

Most customary laws deal with ''standards of community'' that have been long-established in a given locale. However the term can also apply to areas of [[international law]] where certain standards have been nearly [[Universal jurisdiction|universal]] in their acceptance as correct bases of action &amp;ndash; in example, laws against [[piracy]] or [[slavery]] (see ''[[hostis humani generis]]''). In many, though not all instances, customary laws will have supportive court rulings and case law that has evolved over time to give additional weight to their rule as law and also to demonstrate the trajectory of evolution (if any) in the interpretation of such law by relevant courts.

==Nature, definition and sources of customary law==
A central issue regarding the recognition of custom is determining the appropriate methodology to know what practices and norms actually constitutes customary law. It is not immediately clear that classic Western theories of jurisprudence can be reconciled in any useful way with conceptual analyses of customary law, and thus some scholars (like John Comaroff and Simon Roberts)&lt;ref name=cr&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts.&lt;/ref&gt; have characterised customary law norms in their own terms.  Yet, there clearly remains some disagreement, which is seen in John Hund's critique of Comaroff and Roberts' theory, and preference for the contributions of [[H. L. A. Hart]]. Hund argues that Hart's [[H. L. A. Hart#The Concept of Law|''The Concept of Law'']] solves the conceptual problem with which scholars who have attempted to articulate how customary law principles may be identified, defined and how they operate in regulating social behaviour and resolving disputes.&lt;ref name=hund&gt;Hund.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customary law as an indefinite repertoire of norms ===
Comaroff and Roberts' famous work, "Rules and Processes",&lt;ref name=cr/&gt; attempted to detail the body of norms that constitute [[Tswana people|Tswana]] law in a way that was less legalistic (or rule-oriented) than had Isaac Schapera. They defined "mekgwa le melao ya Setswana" in terms of Casalis and Ellenberger definition: ''melao'' therefore being rules pronounced by a chief and ''mekgwa'' as norms that become customary law through traditional usage.&lt;ref name=cr70&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 70&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, however, they noted that the Tswana seldom attempt to classify the vast array of existing norms into categories&lt;ref name=cr70/&gt; and they thus termed this the 'undifferentiated nature of the normative repertoire'. Moreover, they observe the co-existence of overtly incompatible norms that may breed conflict, either due to circumstances in a particular situation, or inherently due to their incongruous content.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 73&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of rule classification and failure to eradicate internal inconsistencies between potentially conflicting norms allows for much flexibility in dispute settlement and is also viewed as a 'strategic resource' for disputants who seek to advance their own success in a case. The latter incongruities (especially of inconsistencies of norm content) are typically solved by elevating one of the norms (tacitly) from 'the literal to the symbolic'.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 75&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the accommodation of both as they now theoretically exist in different realms of reality. This is highly contextual, which further illustrates that norms cannot be viewed in isolation and are open to negotiation. Thus, although there are a small number of so-called non-negotiable norms, the vast majority are viewed and given substance contextually, which is seen as fundamental to the Tswana.

Comaroff and Roberts describe how outcomes of specific cases have the ability to change the normative repertoire, as the repertoire of norms is seen to be both in a state of formation and transformation at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 79&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are justified on the grounds that they are merely giving recognition to de facto observations of transformation [219]. Furthermore, the legitimacy of a chief is a direct determinant of the legitimacy of his decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 81&lt;/ref&gt; In the formulation of legislative pronouncements, as opposed to decisions made in dispute resolution,&lt;ref name=cr82&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 82&lt;/ref&gt; the chief first speaks of the proposed norm with his advisors, then council of headmen, then the public assembly debate the proposed law and may accept or reject it. A chief can proclaim the law even if the public assembly rejects it, but this is not often done; and, if the chief proclaims the legislation against the will of the public assembly, the legislation will become melao, however it is unlikely that it will be executed because its effectiveness depends on the chief's legitimacy and the norm's consistency with the practices (and changes in social relations) and will of the people under that chief.&lt;ref name=cr82/&gt;

Regarding the invocation of norms in disputes, Comaroff and Roberts used the term, "paradigm of argument", to refer to the linguistic and conceptual frame used by a disputant, whereby 'a coherent picture of relevant events and actions in terms of one or more implicit or explicit normative referents' is created.&lt;ref name=cr85&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 85&lt;/ref&gt; In their explanation, the complainant (who always speaks first) thus establishes a paradigm the defendant can either accept and therefore argue within that specific paradigm or reject and therefore introduce his or her own paradigm (usually, the facts are not contested here). If the defendant means to change the paradigm, they will refer to norms as such, where actually norms are not ordinarily explicitly referenced in Tswana dispute resolution as the audience would typically already know them and just the way one presents one's case and constructs the facts will establish one's paradigm. The headman or chief adjudicating may also do same: accept the normative basis implied by the parties (or one of them), and thus not refer to norms using explicit language but rather isolate a factual issue in the dispute and then make a decision on it without expressly referring to any norms, or impose a new or different paradigm onto the parties.&lt;ref name=cr85/&gt;

=== Law as necessarily rule-governed ===
Hund finds Comaroff and Roberts' flexibility thesis of a 'repertoire of norms' from which litigants and adjudicator choose in the process of negotiating solutions between them uncompelling.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt; He is therefore concerned with disproving what he calls [[Scepticism in law|"rule scepticism"]] on their part. He notes that the concept of custom generally denotes convergent behaviour, but not all customs have the force of law. Hund therefore draws from Hart's analysis distinguishing social rules, which have internal and external aspects, from habits, which have only external aspects. Internal aspects are the reflective attitude on the part of adherents toward certain behaviours perceived to be obligatory, according to a common standard. External aspects manifest in regular, observable behaviour, but is not obligatory. In Hart's analysis, then, social rules amount to custom that has legal force.

Hart identifies three further differences between habits and binding social rules.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt; First, a social rule exists where society frowns on deviation from the habit and attempts to prevent departures by criticising such behaviour. Second, when this criticism is seen socially as a good reason for adhering to the habit, and it is welcomed. And, third, when members of a group behave in a common way not only out of habit or because everyone else is doing it, but because it is seen to be a common standard that should be followed, at least by some members. Hund, however, acknowledges the difficulty of an outsider knowing the dimensions of these criteria that depend on an internal point of view.

For Hund, the first form of rule scepticism concerns the widely held opinion that, because the content of customary law derives from practice, there are actually no objective rules, since it is only behaviour that informs their construction. On this view, it is impossible to distinguish between behaviour that is rule bound and behaviour that is not—i.e., which behaviour is motivated by adherence to law (or at least done in recognition of the law) and is merely a response to other factors. Hund sees this as problematic because it makes quantifying the law almost impossible, since behaviour is obviously inconsistent. Hund argues that this is a misconception based on a failure to acknowledge the importance of the ''internal element''. In his view, by using the criteria described above, there is not this problem in deciphering what constitutes "law" in a particular community.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt;

According to Hund, the second form of rule scepticism says that, though a community may have rules, those rules are not arrived at [[Deductive reasoning|'deductively']], i.e. they are not created through legal/moral reasoning only but are instead driven by the personal/political motives of those who create them. The scope for such influence is created by the loose and undefined nature of customary law, which, Hund argues, grants customary-lawmakers (often through traditional 'judicial processes') a wide discretion in its application. Yet, Hund contends that the fact that rules might sometimes be arrived at in the more ad hoc way, does not mean that this defines the system. If one requires a perfect system, where laws are created only deductively, then one is left with a system with no rules. For Hund, this cannot be so and an explanation for these kinds of law-making processes is found in Hart's conception of "secondary rules" (rules in terms of which the main body of norms are recognised). Hund therefore says that for some cultures, for instance in some sections of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] society, the secondary rules have developed only to the point where laws are determined with reference to politics and personal preference. This does not mean that they are not "rules". Hund argues that if we acknowledge a developmental pattern in societies' constructions of these secondary rules then we can understand how this society constructs its laws and how it differs from societies that have come to rely on an objective, stand-alone body of rules.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt;

==Customary law and codification==
{{main|Codification (law)}}
The modern [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] developed from the tradition of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[custumal]]s, collections of local customary law that developed in a specific manorial or borough jurisdiction, and which were slowly pieced together mainly from [[case law]] and later written down by local [[jurist]]s. Custumals acquired the force of law when they became the undisputed rule by which certain [[rights]], entitlements, and [[obligation]]s were regulated between members of a community.&lt;ref&gt;In ''R. v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'', [1982] 2 All E.R. 118, [[Lord Denning]] said "These customary laws are not written down. They are handed down by tradition from one generation to another. Yet beyond doubt they are well established and have the force of law within the community."&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]]'s ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' for England, the ''[[Coutume de Paris]]'' for the city of Paris, the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'' for northern Germany, and the many ''[[fuero]]s'' of Spain.

==International law==
{{Main|Customary international law}}

In [[international law]], ''customary law'' refers to the ''Law of Nations'' or the legal norms that have developed through the customary exchanges between [[Sovereign state|states]] over time, whether based on [[diplomacy]] or aggression.  Essentially, legal obligations are believed to arise between states to carry out their affairs consistently with past accepted conduct.  These customs can also change based on the acceptance or rejection by states of particular acts.  Some principles of customary law have achieved the force of [[peremptory norm]]s, which cannot be violated or altered except by a norm of comparable strength.  These norms are said to gain their strength from universal acceptance, such as the prohibitions against [[genocide]] and [[slavery]]. Customary international law can be distinguished from [[treaty]] law, which consists of explicit agreements between nations to assume obligations.  However, many treaties are attempts to codify pre-existing customary law.

==Customary law within contemporary legal systems==

Customary law is a recognized source of law within jurisdictions of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition, where it may be subordinate to both [[statutes]] and [[regulations]]. In addressing custom as a source of law within the civil law tradition, [[John Henry Merryman]] notes that, though the attention it is given in scholarly works is great, its importance is "slight and decreasing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America|first=John Henry|last=Merryman|edition=3rd|year=2007|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|page=24|isbn=978-0-8047-5569-6|lccn=2007003956|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OJf9CbgKTkC&amp;pg=PA24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in many countries around the world, one or more types of customary law continue to exist side by side with official law, a condition referred to as '''[[legal pluralism]]''' (see [[List of national legal systems]]).

In the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[custom (canon law)|custom]] is a source of law. [[Canonical jurisprudence]], however, differs from Civil law jurisprudence in requiring the express or implied consent of the legislator for a custom to obtain the force of law.

In the Common Law of [[England]], "Long usage" must be established.

It is a broad principle of property law that, if something has gone on for a long time without objection, whether it be using a right of way or occupying land to which one has no title, the law will eventually recognise the fact and give the person doing it the legal right to continue.

It is known in case law as
Customary Rights 
"Customary rights". Something which has been practised since time immemorial by reference to a particular locality may acquire the legal status of a custom, which is a form of local law.The legal criteria defining a custom are precise.  The most common claim in recent times, is for customary rights to moor a vessel.

The mooring must have been in continuous use for "Time Immemorial" which is  defined by legal precedent as 12 years (or 20 years for Crown Land) for the same purpose by people using them for that purpose.

To give two examples:- A custom of mooring which might have been established in past times for over two hundred years by the fishing fleet of local inhabitants of a coastal community will not simply transfer so as to benefit present day recreational boat owners who may hail from much further afield.

Whereas a group of houseboats on a mooring that has been in continuous use for the last 25 years 
with a mixture of owner occupiers and rented houseboats, may clearly continue to be used by houseboats, where the owners live in the same town or city.

Both the purpose of the moorings and the class of persons benefited by the custom must have been clear and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayb.ltd.uk/customary-mooring-rights/|title=Customary Mooring Rights|author=|work=|publisher=[[Associated Yacht Brokers]]|accessdate=19 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413152848/http://ayb.ltd.uk/customary-mooring-rights/|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], customary aboriginal law has a constitutional foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html |title=Constitution Act, 1982, s. 35(1) |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320212057/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Const/annex_e.html |archivedate=20 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason has increasing influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Generic and Specific Aboriginal Rights|last=Slattery|first=Brian|authorlink=|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=6|pages=|url=http://www.law.uvic.ca/calder/Papers/Brian%20Slattery.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2008}} and {{cite book |title=Let Right Be Done: Aboriginal title, the Calder Case, and the Future of Indigenous Rights |last=Foster |first=Hamar |authorlink= |author2=Heather Raven and Jeremy Webber (eds.) |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn= |volume=18 No. 7 (July, 2008) |page= |pages=574–578 |url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/foster0708.htm |accessdate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830063039/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/foster0708.htm |archivedate=30 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Scandinavia]]n countries customary law continues to exist and has great influence. 

Customary law is also used in some [[Third World]] countries, such as those in [[Africa]], usually used alongside common or civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droitcivil.uottawa.ca/world-legal-systems/eng-tableau.php#g |title=JuryGlobe |author= |work= |publisher=[[University of Ottawa]] |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Ethiopia]], despite the adoption of legal codes based on [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in the 1950s according to Dolores Donovan and Getachew Assefa there are more than 60 systems of customary law currently in force, "some of them operating quite independently of the formal state legal system." They offer two reasons for the relative autonomy of these customary law systems: one is that the Ethiopian government lacks sufficient resources to enforce its legal system to every corner of Ethiopia; the other is that the Ethiopian government has made a commitment to preserve these customary systems within its boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Dolores A. Donovan and Getachew Assefa, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3649118 "Homicide in Ethiopia: Human Rights, Federalism, and Legal Pluralism," ''American Journal of Comparative Law''], '''51''' (2003), p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[President of Kyrgyzstan]] [[Askar Akaev]] announced a decree to revitalize the ''[[aqsaqal]]'' courts of village elders. The courts would have jurisdiction over property, torts and family law.&lt;ref name="Beyer"&gt;Judith Beyer, Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts: Pluralistic Accounts of History, 53 J. OF L. PLURALISM 144 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''aqsaqal'' courts were eventually included under Article 92 of the Kyrgyz constitution. As of 2006, there were approximately 1,000 ''aqsaqal'' courts throughout Kyrgyzstan, including in the capital of [[Bishkek]].&lt;ref name="Beyer" /&gt; Akaev linked the development of these courts to the rekindling of Kyrgyz national identity. In a 2005 speech, he connected the courts back to the country's nomadic past and extolled how the courts expressed the Kyrgyz ability of self-governance.&lt;ref&gt;Former President Akaev, quoted in Beyer, ''Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts''&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ''aqsaqal'' courts exist, with varying levels of legal formality, in other countries of [[Central Asia]].

The [[Somali people]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] follow a customary law system referred to as [[Xeer]]. It survives to a significant degree everywhere in Somalia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/story/2701 |title=The Rule of Law without the State |author=Spencer Heath MacCallum |date=12 September 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Somali communities in the [[Ogaden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chfhq.org/files/3707_file_Somali_Region_Assessment_8.4.06.pdf |title=Grassroots Conflict Assessment Of the Somali Region, Ethiopia |author= |date=August 2006 |work= |publisher=CHF International |accessdate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726084227/http://www.chfhq.org/files/3707_file_Somali_Region_Assessment_8.4.06.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Peter Leeson attributes the increase in economic activity since the fall of the [[Siad Barre]] administration to the security in life, liberty and property provided by Xeer in large parts of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterleeson.com/Better_Off_Stateless.pdf |title=Better off stateless |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch attorney Michael van Notten also draws upon his experience as a legal expert in his comprehensive study on Xeer, ''The Law of the Somalis: A Stable Foundation for Economic Development in the Horn of Africa'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Van Notten, Michael. 2005. ''The Law of the Somalis: A Stable Foundation for Economic and Social Development in the Horn of Africa'', Trenton NJ: Red Sea Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India many customs are accepted by law. For example, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] marriage ceremonies are recognized by the [[Hindu Marriage Act]].

In Indonesia, customary [[adat]] laws of the country's various indigenous ethnicities are recognized, and customary dispute resolution is recognized in [[Papua (province)|Papua]]. Indonesian adat law are mainly divided into 19 circles, namely [[Aceh]], [[Gayo Lues Regency|Gayo]], [[Alas people|Alas]], and [[Batak]], [[Minangkabau Highlands|Minangkabau]], [[South Sumatra]], the [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]] regions, [[Bangka Island|Bangka]] and [[Belitung]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Minahasa]], [[Gorontalo]], [[Toraja]], [[South Sulawesi]], [[Ternate]], the [[Molluccas]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]], [[Timor]], [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]], Central and East [[Java]] including the island of [[Madura]], [[Sunda Islands|Sunda]], and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] monarchies, including the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], [[Surakarta Sunanate]], and the [[Pakualaman]] and [[Mangkunegaran]] princely states.

==Custom in torts==
{{Confusing|section|date=November 2008}}

Custom is used in [[tort]] law to help determine [[negligence]].  Following or disregarding a custom is not determinative of negligence, but instead is an indication of possible best practices or alternatives to a particular action.

'''David Stephen Forbes''' (born November 16, 1948) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] retired professional [[ice hockey]] player.

Signed as a free agent in 1973 by the [[Boston Bruins]], Forbes made an impact as a defensive-minded forward as he helped guide the Bruins to the finals in 1974 during his rookie season, and to the finals in 1977. Forbes played four seasons with Boston until he was claimed by the [[Washington Capitals]] in the Waiver Draft prior to the 1977–78 season. After playing one season with the Capitals, he was released after only playing two games during the 1978–79 season and signed to play for the [[Cincinnati Stingers]] of the [[World Hockey Association]].

==Criminal charges==
Forbes was charged with [[aggravated assault]] in Minneapolis in 1975 after butt-ending [[Henry Boucha]]'s eye socket in a game against the Minnesota North Stars. The trial received much publicity as it was highly unusual for an athlete to face criminal charges for assault during a game. The trial ended with a hung jury; the charges were not refiled.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kennedy, "A nondecision begs the question," Sports Illustrated, July 28, 1975.  https://www.si.com/vault/1975/07/28/606678/a-nondecision-begs-the-question&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dead hedge''' is a barrier constructed from cut branches, [[sapling]]s, and [[foliage]]. The material can be from pruning, clearing, or forestry activities. Their succession is a [[beetle bank]] or [[hedge]]. 

==Restoration ecology and biological pest control== 
Dead hedges or wind-rows, as they are known in the coppice trade, are useful keeping the compartments of the coppice tidy, keeping the public from certain areas, being an excellent habitat and corridor for wildlife [[habitat conservation]] and [[restoration ecology]], as they offer shelter for small animals, especially birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://handbooks.btcv.org.uk/handbooks/content/chapter/65 |title=Hedging |work=BTCV handbook |author=[[BTCV]] |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be part of a beneficial "biological pest agents" [[habitat]] in [[biological pest control]] programs for [[natural landscape]]s and [[organic gardening]].

==Agriculture==
Dead hedges usually provide an enclosure for the storage of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwichcommunitywoodlands.org.uk/events-hedgelaying.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-20 |work=Northwich Community Woodlands |title=Hedge-laying - alive and well in the Northwich Community Woodlands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110021455/http://www.northwichcommunitywoodlands.org.uk/events-hedgelaying.shtml |archivedate=November 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The above biological pest control dead hedges use is also part of [[organic farming]] and [[sustainable agriculture]].

Dead hedges also recycle-reuse [[biomass]] without energy use to transport to landfills, or by burning, reducing a [[carbon footprint]] impact.

'''Deportation''' is the expulsion of a person or group of people from a place or [[country]]. The term ''expulsion'' is often used as a [[synonym]] for deportation, though expulsion is more often used in the context of [[international law]], while deportation is more used in [[municipal law|national (municipal) law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Marie Henckaerts]] in his book 'Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'' wrote: "As far as deportation is concerned, there is no general feature that clearly sets it apart from expulsion. Both term basically indicate the same phenomenon. [...] The only difference seems to be one of preferential use, expulsion being more an international term while deportation is more used in municipal law. [...] One study [discusses this distinction] but immediately adds that in modern practice both terms have become interchangeable." See {{cite book|author=Jean-Marie Henckaerts|title=Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3kaTLyAKo0C&amp;pg=PA5|date=6 July 1995|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Pblishers|isbn=90-411-0072-5|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Definitions of deportation apply equally to nationals and foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Henckaerts, ''Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'', 1995, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the common usage the expulsion of foreign nationals is usually called deportation, whereas the expulsion of nationals is called [[extradition]], banishment, [[exile]], or [[penal transportation]]. For example, in the [[United States]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Strictly speaking, transportation, extradition, and deportation, although each has the effect of removing a person from the country, are different things, and have different purposes. Transportation is by way of punishment of one convicted of an offense against the laws of the country. Extradition is the surrender to another country of one accused of an offense against its laws, there to be tried, and, if found guilty, punished. Deportation is the removal of an alien out of the country, simply because his presence is deemed inconsistent with the public welfare and without any punishment being imposed or contemplated either under the laws of the country out of which he is sent or of those of the country to which he is taken."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fong Yue Ting v. United States]]'', 149 U.S. 697, at 709 (1893).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Expulsion is an act by a public authority to remove a person or persons against his or her will from the territory of that state. A successful expulsion of a person by a country is called a deportation.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=27}}

According to the European Court of Human Rights, collective expulsion is any measure compelling non-nationals, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual non-national of the group. Mass expulsion may also occur when members of an ethnic group are sent out of a state regardless of nationality. Collective expulsion, or expulsion en masse, is prohibited by several instruments of international law.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=35}}

==History==

Deportations widely occurred in ancient history.

===In Achaemenid Empire===
Deportation was practiced as a policy toward rebellious people in [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The precise legal status of the deportees is unclear; but ill-treatment is not recorded. Instances include:&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/deportations|title=DEPORTATIONS – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Parthian Empire===

Unlike in the Achaemenid and Sassanian periods, records of deportation are rare during the [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid Parthian]] period. One notable example was the deportaion of the [[Mards]] in [[Charax Spasinu|Charax]], near [[Rey, Iran|Rhages]] (Ray) by [[Phraates I]]. The 10,000 Roman prisonors of war after the [[Battle of Carrhae]] appear to have been deported to [[Alexandria Margiana]] (Merv) near the eastern border in 53 BC, who are said to married to local people. It is hypothesized that some of them founded the Chinese city of [[Li-Jien]] after becoming soldiers for the [[Hsiung-nu]], but this is doubted.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

[[Hyrcanus II]], the Jewish king of Judea, was settled among the Jews of [[Babylon]] in [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] after being taken as captive by the [[Pompeian–Parthian invasion of 40 BC|Parthian-Jewish forces in 40 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kooten |first1=George H. van |last2=Barthel |first2=Peter |title=The Star of Bethlehem and the Magi: Interdisciplinary Perspectives from Experts on the Ancient Near East, the Greco-Roman World, and Modern Astronomy |date=2015 |publisher=BRILL |location=540 |isbn=9789004308473 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnbsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA540 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman POWs in the [[Antony's Parthian War]] may have suffered deportation.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

===In Sassanid Empire===

Deportation was widely used by the Sasanians, especially during the [[Roman-Persian wars|wars with the Romans]].

During [[Shapur I]]'s reign, the Romans (including [[Publius Licinius Valerianus|Valerian]]) who were defeated at the [[Battle of Edessa]] were deported to [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Persis]]. Other destinations were [[Parthia]], [[History of Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], and [[Asorestan]]. There were cities which were founded and were populated by Romans prisoners of war, including Shadh-Shapur ([[Dayr Mikhraq]]) in [[Meshan]], [[Bishapur]] in Persis, Wuzurg-Shapur ([['Uqbara]]; Marw-Ḥābūr), and [[Gundeshapur]]. Agricultural land were also given to the deportees. These deportations initiated the spread [[Christianity in Iran|Christianity in the Sassanian empire]]. In Rēw-Ardashīr ([[Rishahr]]; Yarānshahr), Persis, there was a church for the Romans and another one for [[Carmanians]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; In the mid-3rd century, Greek-speaking deportees from north-western Syria were settled in [[Kashkar]], Mesopotamia.

After the Arab incursion into Persia during [[Shapur II]]'s reign, he scattered the [[Shapur II's Arab campaign|defeated Arab tribes]] by deporting them to other regions. Some where deported to [[Bahrain]] and [[Carmania (satrapy)|Kirman]], possibly to both populate these unattractive regions (due to their climate) and bringing the tribes under control.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

In 395 AD, 18,000 Roman populations of [[Sophene]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], and [[Cappadocia]] were captured and deported by the "[[Huns]]". the prisoners were freed by the Persians as they reached Persia, and were settled in Slōk ([[Veh-Ardashir|Wēh Ardashīr]]) and Kōkbā (Kōkhē). The author of the text ''Liber Calipharum'' has praised the king [[Yazdegerd I]] (399–420) for his treatment of the deportees, who also allowed some to return.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

Major deportations occurred during the [[Anastasian War]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

Major deportations occurred during the campaigns of [[Khosrau I]] from the Roman cities of [[Sura]], [[Aleppo|Beroea]], [[Antioch]], [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apamea]], [[Raqqa|Callinicum]], and [[Batnai]] in [[Osrhoene]], to [[Wēh-Antiyōk-Khosrow]] (also known as Rūmagān; in Arabic: al-Rūmiyya). The city was founded near [[Ctesiphon]] especially for them, and Khosrow reportedly "did everything in his power to make the residents want to stay".&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; The number of the deportees is recorded to be 292,000 in another source.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, ''The Decline of Iranshahr: Irrigation and Environments in the History of the Middle East, 500 B.C. to A.D. 1500'', 1993. {{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All countries reserve the right to deport persons without [[right of abode]] even those who are longtime [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] or possess [[permanent residency]]. In general, foreigners who have committed serious crimes, entered the country illegally, overstayed or broken the conditions of their [[Visa (document)|visa]], or otherwise lost their legal status to remain in the country may be administratively removed or deported.&lt;ref&gt;Henckaerts, ''Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'', 1995, p. 5; Forsythe and Lawson, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights'', 1996, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, even citizens can be deported; Saudi Arabia and the UAE for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21710679-many-are-left-stateless-result-silence-dissidents-gulf-states-are|title=To silence dissidents, Gulf states are revoking their citizenship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some western countries also have the ability to deport citizens, if they have another nationality or if they acquire citizenship through fraud.

In many cases, deportation is done by the [[government]]'s [[executive (government)|executive]] apparatus, and as such is often subject to a simpler legal process (or none), with reduced or no right to trial, legal representation or [[appeal]] due to the subject's lack of citizenship. For example, in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, more stringent enforcement of immigration laws were ordered by the executive branch of the U.S. government, which led to [[Mexican Repatriation|the expulsion]] of up to 2 million Mexican nationals from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, "The Federal Deportation Campaign in Texas: Mexican Deportation from the Lower Rio Grande Valley During the Great Depression", ''Borderlands Journal'', Fall 1981; Balderrama and Rodriguez, ''Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s'', 1995; Valenciana, "Unconstitutional Deportation of Mexican Americans During the 1930s: A Family History and Oral History", ''Multicultural Education'', Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the executive branch of the U.S. government implemented [[Operation Wetback]], a program created in response to public hysteria about immigration and immigrants from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;See Albert G.

The ICE website publishes removal statistics annually on its website. According to recent numbers ICE removed a total of 240,255 aliens in FY 2016, a two percent increase over FY 2015, but a 24 percent decrease from FY 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics/2016|title=FY 2016 ICE Immigration Removals|website=www.ice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in [[natural law]] of the 18th century, philosophers agreed that expulsion of a nation from the territory that it historically inhabits is not allowable.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Emerich de Vattel]], ''The Law of Nations - Principles of the Law of Nature, Applied to the Conduct and Affairs of Nations and Sovereigns'' (translated from French), Philadelphia 1856 (Dublin 1792), Book II, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pBwMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168 § 90.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, the [[United Nations]] drafted a code related to [[crimes against humanity]]; Article 18 of the ''Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind'' declares "large scale" arbitrary or forcible deportation to be a [[crime against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;International Law Commission, ''Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1996: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its 48th Session'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deportation often requires a specific process that must be validated by a court or senior government official. It should not be confused with [[administrative removal]], which is the process of a country denying entry to individuals at a port of entry and expelling them.&lt;ref&gt;Fragomen and Bell, ''Immigration Fundamentals: A Guide to Law and Practice''. New York: Practising Law Institute, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/deportations-removals-and-voluntary-departures-from-the-uk/|title=Deportations, Removals and Voluntary Departures from the UK - Migration Observatory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal deportation==
[[Image:Bisbee deportation lowell.jpg|thumb|Striking miners and others being deported at gunpoint from [[Lowell, Arizona]], on July 12, 1917, during the [[Bisbee Deportation]].]]

Deportation can also happen within a state, when (for example) an individual or a group of people is forcibly resettled to a different part of the country. If ethnic groups are affected by this, it may also be referred to as [[population transfer]]. The rationale is often that these groups might assist the enemy in war or insurrection. For example, the American state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] deported 400 female mill workers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] on the suspicion they were Northern sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;Dillman, ''The Roswell Mills and A Civil War Tragedy: Excerpts from Days Gone by in Alpharetta and Roswell, Georgia'', 1996; Hitt, ''Charged with Treason: The Ordeal of 400 Mill Workers During Military Operations in Roswell, Georgia, 1864–1865'', 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Joseph Stalin]] (see [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]) ordered the deportation of [[Volga German]]s, [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ukrainians]] and others to areas away from the front, including central and western Soviet Union. Some historians have estimated the number of deaths from the deportation to be as high as 1 in 3 among some populations.&lt;ref&gt;In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and Chechen people (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia''. Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-87113-906-5}}. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00994-0}}. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929–1953''. Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7190-6377-9}}. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would halve the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C. ''Stalin and German Communism: A Study in the Origins of the State Party''. Edison, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|0-87855-822-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert. ''The Nation Killers''. New York: Macmillan, 1970. {{ISBN|0-333-10575-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2004 the [[European Parliament]] characterized deportations of the Chechens as an act of [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massviolence.org/The-Massive-Deportation-of-the-Chechen-People-How-and-why?artpage=8#outil_sommaire_5 Campana, Aurélie.

The Soviet Union also used deportation, as well as instituting the Russian language as the only working language and other such tactics, to achieve [[Russification]] of its occupied territories (such as the [[Baltic nations]] and [[Bessarabia]]). In this way, it removed the historical ethnic populations and repopulated the areas with Russian nationals. The deported people were sent to remote, scarcely populated areas or to GULAG labour camps. It has been estimated that, in their entirety, internal forced migrations affected some 6 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Pavel Polian]]| title=[[Against Their Will (book)|Against Their Will]]: The History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR| publisher=[[Central European University Press]], 2004 |isbn=978-963-9241-68-8| page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ktrYux1gTMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=internal+forced+migrations+6+million+people#v=onepage&amp;q=internal%20forced%20migrations%206%20million%20people&amp;f=false 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosefielde83"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Red Holocaust (2009 book)|Red Holocaust]] |last= Rosefielde |first= Steven |authorlink= Steven Rosefielde |coauthors= |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Routledge]] |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-77757-5 |pages=83 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, some 1 to 1.5 million perished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Naimark|Naimark, Norman M.]] ''Stalin's Genocides (Human Rights and Crimes against Humanity)''.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, deportation of union members and [[trade union|labor]] leaders was not uncommon in the United States during [[strike action|strikes]] or labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Deportation is the term commonly used to depict ejecting an individual from a political or legal jurisdiction. It has been used by the press, legal community, historians and sociologists. See, variously, "Lewis Attacks Deportation of Leaders by West Virginia Authorities", ''The New York Times'', July 17, 1921; "The Law of Necessity As Applied in the Bisbee Deportation Case", ''Arizona Law Review'', 1961; Martin, ''The Corpse On Boomerang Road: Telluride's War on Labor, 1899–1908'', 2004; Silverberg, "Citizens' Committees: Their Role in Industrial Conflict", ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', March 1941; Suggs, ''Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners'', 1991; Lindquist and Fraser, "A Sociological Interpretation of the Bisbee Deportation", ''Pacific Historical Review'', November 1968. Deportation has also been used to describe these events by Presidential commissions; see President's Mediation Commission, ''Report on the Bisbee Deportations'', 1918. The U.S. Supreme Court has also referred to forced internal removal as deportation; see ''[[United States v. Guest]]'', 383 U.S. 745, (1966), Harlan, concurring in part and dissenting in part, at 766.&lt;/ref&gt; For an example, see the [[Bisbee Deportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bisbee Deportation 1917 |publisher=University of Arizona |url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/bisbee/ |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deporting individuals to a colony is a special case that is neither completely internal nor external. Such deportation has occurred in history. For example, after 1717, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|Britain]] deported around 40,000&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=David |title=1788 the brutal truth of the first fleet |publisher=Random House Australia |isbn=978-1741668001 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} religious objectors and criminals to America before the practice ceased in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, ''Coming to America: A History of Immigration and Ethnicity in American Life'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The criminals were sold by jailers to shipping contractors, who then sold them to plantation owners. The criminal was forced to work for the plantation owner for the duration of their sentence.&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;{{rp|5}} The loss of America as a colony, Australia became the destination for criminals deported to British colonies. More than 160,000&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;{{rp|1}} criminals were transported to Australia between 1787 and 1855.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffray and Melancon, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the policy officially known as the "[[Final Solution]]". The historical term "deportation", occurring frequently instead of the religious term [[Holocaust]] in various locations, thus means in effect "sent to their deaths" — as distinct from deportations in other times and places.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Holocaust Glossary |publisher=Scholastic |url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/frank/gloss.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 120,000 [[Serbs]] were deported from the [[Independent State of Croatia]] to [[German-occupied Serbia]], and 300,000 fled by 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|location=New York|isbn=0-253-34656-8|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy deportees==
[[Alexander Berkman]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[C.L.R. James]], [[Claudia Jones]], [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]], [[Lucky Luciano]], and [[Anna Sage]] were all deported from the United States by being arrested and brought to the federal immigration control station on [[Ellis Island]] in New York Harbor and, from there, forcibly removed from the United States.

==Popular culture==
In literature, deportation appears as an overriding theme in the 1935 novel, ''Strange Passage'' by Theodore D. Irwin.
Films depicting or dealing with fictional cases of deportation are many and varied. Among them are ''[[Ellis Island (1936 film)|Ellis Island]]'' (1936), ''[[Exile Express]]'' (1939), ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (1939), ''[[Deported (film)|Deported]]'' (1950), and ''[[Gambling House (film)|Gambling House]]'' (1951). More recently, [[wikipedia:Shottas|''Shottas'']] (2002) treated the issue of U.S. deportation to the Caribbean post-1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14793">A '''discrete-event simulation''' ('''DES''') models the operation of a [[system]] as a [[discrete time|discrete]] [[sequence of events]] in time. Each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of [[State (computer science)|state]] in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Simulation – The practice of model development and use''|author=Stewart Robinson|publisher=Wiley|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between consecutive events, no change in the system is assumed to occur; thus the [[simulation]] can directly jump in time from one event to the next.

This contrasts with [[continuous simulation]] in which the simulation continuously tracks the system dynamics over time. Instead of being [[Event-driven programming|event-based]], this is called an activity-based simulation; time is broken up into small time slices and the system state is updated according to the set of activities happening in the time slice.&lt;ref name="matloff"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matloff|first=Norm|title=Introduction to Discrete-Event Simulation and the SimPy Language|url=http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/156/PLN/DESimIntro.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because discrete-event simulations do not have to simulate every time slice, they can typically run much faster than the corresponding continuous simulation.

A more recent method is the three-phased approach to discrete event simulation (Pidd, 1998). In this approach, the first phase is to jump to the next chronological event. The second phase is to execute all events that unconditionally occur at that time (these are called B-events). The third phase is to execute all events that conditionally occur at that time (these are called C-events). The three phase approach is a refinement of the event-based approach in which simultaneous events are ordered so as to make the most efficient use of computer resources.  The three-phase approach is used by a number of commercial simulation software packages, but from the user's point of view, the specifics of the underlying simulation method are generally hidden.

== Example ==
A common exercise in learning how to build discrete-event simulations is to model a [[Queueing theory|queue]], such as customers arriving at a bank to be served by a teller.  In this example, the system entities are '''Customer-queue''' and '''Tellers'''.  The system events are '''Customer-Arrival''' and '''Customer-Departure'''.  (The event of '''Teller-Begins-Service''' can be part of the logic of the arrival and departure events.) The system states, which are changed by these events, are '''Number-of-Customers-in-the-Queue''' (an integer from 0 to n) and '''Teller-Status''' (busy or idle).   The [[random variable]]s that need to be characterized to model this system [[stochastic]]ally are '''Customer-Interarrival-Time''' and '''Teller-Service-Time'''. An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator is another example for a discrete event simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 | doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |volume=1 |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
In addition to the logic of what happens when system events occur, discrete event simulations include the following:

===State===

A system state is a set of variables that captures the salient properties of the system to be studied. The state trajectory over time S(t) can be mathematically represented by a [[step function]] whose value can change whenever an event occurs.

===Clock===

The simulation must keep track of the current simulation time, in whatever measurement units are suitable for the system being modeled. In discrete-event simulations, as opposed to continuous simulations, time 'hops' because events are instantaneous – the clock skips to the next event start time as the simulation proceeds.

===Events list===

The simulation maintains at least one list of simulation events.  This is sometimes called the ''pending event set''
because it lists events that are pending as a result of previously simulated event but have yet to be simulated themselves.
An event is described by the time at which it occurs and a type, indicating the
code that will be used to simulate that event.  It is common for the event code to be parametrized, in which case, the event description also contains parameters to the event code.

When events are instantaneous, activities that extend over time are modeled as sequences of events.  Some simulation frameworks allow the time of an event to be specified as an interval, giving the start time and the end time of each event.

[[Single-threaded]] simulation engines based on instantaneous events have just one current event.  In contrast, [[Thread (computing)|multi-threaded]] simulation engines and simulation engines supporting an interval-based event model may have multiple current events.  In both cases, there are significant problems with synchronization between current events.

The pending event set is typically organized as a [[priority queue]], [[Sorting|sorted]] by event time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas W. Jones]], ed.  [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=318242.318467 Implementations of Time], Proceedings of the 18th Winter Simulation Conference, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, regardless of the order in which events are added to the event set, they are removed in strictly chronological order.  Various priority queue implementations have been studied in the context of discrete event simulation&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas W. Jones]], [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/5684.5686 Empirical Comparison of Priority Queue and Event Set Implementations], ''Communications of the ACM, 29,'' April 1986, pages 300–311.&lt;/ref&gt;; alternatives studied have included [[splay tree]]s, [[skip list]]s, [[calendar queue]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Kah Leong Tan and Li-Jin Thng, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=510378.510453 SNOOPy Calendar Queue], Proceedings of the 32nd Winter Simulation Conference, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and ladder queues.
&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dickman, Sounak Gupta and Philip A. Wilsey, [https://doi.org/10.1145/2486092.2486106 Event pool structures for PDES on many-core Beowulf clusters], Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSIM conference on Principles of advanced discrete simulation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Furfaro and Ludovica Sacco, [https://doi.org/10.1145/3200921.3200925 Adaptive Ladder Queue: Achieving O(1) Amortized Access Time in Practice], Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSIM conference on Principles of advanced discrete simulation&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, events are scheduled dynamically as the simulation proceeds. For example, in the bank example noted above, the event CUSTOMER-ARRIVAL at time t would, if the CUSTOMER_QUEUE was empty and TELLER was idle, include the creation of the subsequent event CUSTOMER-DEPARTURE to occur at time t+s, where s is a number generated from the SERVICE-TIME distribution.

===Random-number generators===

The simulation needs to generate [[random variables]] of various kinds, depending on the system model. This is accomplished by one or more [[Pseudorandom number generator]]s. The use of pseudo-random numbers as opposed to true random numbers is a benefit should a simulation need a rerun with exactly the same behavior.

One of the problems with the random number distributions used in discrete-event simulation is that the steady-state distributions of event times may not be known in advance.  As a result, the initial set of events placed into the pending event set will not have arrival times representative of the steady-state distribution.  This problem is typically solved by bootstrapping the simulation model.  Only a limited effort is made to assign realistic times to the initial set of pending events.  These events, however, schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its steady state.  This is called ''bootstrapping'' the simulation model.  In gathering statistics from the running model, it is important to either disregard events that occur before the steady state is reached or to run the simulation for long enough that the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior.  (This use of the term ''bootstrapping'' can be contrasted with its use in both [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|statistics]] and [[Bootstrapping (computing)|computing]]).

===Statistics===

The simulation typically keeps track of the system's [[statistic]]s, which quantify the aspects of interest. In the bank example, it is of interest to track the mean waiting times. In a simulation model, performance metrics are not analytically derived from [[probability distributions]], but rather as averages over [[replication (statistics)|replication]]s, that is different runs of the model. [[Confidence interval]]s are usually constructed to help assess the quality of the output.

===Ending condition===

Because events are bootstrapped, theoretically a discrete-event simulation could run forever. So the simulation designer must decide when the simulation will end.  Typical choices are "at time t" or "after processing n number of events" or, more generally, "when statistical measure X reaches the value x".

==Simulation engine logic==

The main loop of a discrete-event simulation is something like this:

===Start===
* Initialize Ending Condition to FALSE.
* Initialize system state variables.
* Initialize Clock (usually starts at simulation time zero).
* Schedule an initial event (i.e., put some initial event into the Events List).

=== “Do loop” or “while loop”===
While (Ending Condition is FALSE) then do the following:
* Set clock to next event time.
* Do next event and remove from the Events List.
* Update statistics.

===End===
* Generate statistical report.

== Common uses ==

===Diagnosing process issues===
Simulation approaches are particularly well equipped to help users diagnose issues in complex environments.  [[The Goal]] ([[Theory of Constraints]]) illustrates the importance of understanding bottlenecks in a system.  Only process ‘improvements’ at the bottlenecks will actually improve the overall system.  In many organizations bottlenecks become hidden by excess inventory, [[overproduction]], variability in processes and variability in routing or sequencing.  By accurately documenting the system inside a simulation model it is possible to gain a bird’s eye view of the entire system.

A working model of a system allows management to understand performance drivers.  A simulation can be built to include any number of [[performance indicator]]s such as worker utilization, on-time delivery rate, scrap rate, cash cycles, and so on.

===Hospital applications===
An operating theater is generally shared between several surgical disciplines.  Through better understanding the nature of these procedures it may be possible to increase the patient throughput.
Example:  If a heart surgery takes on average four hours, changing an operating room schedule from eight available hours to nine will not increase patient throughput.  On the other hand, if a hernia procedure takes on average twenty minutes providing an extra hour may also not yield any increased throughput if the capacity and average time spent in the recovery room is not considered.

===Lab test performance improvement ideas===
Many systems improvement ideas are built on sound principles, proven methodologies ([[Lean manufacturing|Lean]], [[Six Sigma]], [[Total quality management|TQM]], etc.) yet fail to improve the overall system.  A simulation model allows the user to understand and test a performance improvement idea in the context of the overall system.

===Evaluating capital investment decisions===
:''See also: [[Monte Carlo methods in finance]]; [[Corporate finance#Capital investment decisions|Corporate finance #Capital investment decisions]] and [[Corporate finance#Quantifying uncertainty|#Quantifying uncertainty]].''

Simulation modeling is commonly used to model potential investments.  Through modeling investments decision-makers can make informed decisions and evaluate potential alternatives.

===Network simulators===

In [[computing]], an '''effect system''' is a [[formal system]] which describes the computational effects of computer programs, such as [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s. An effect system can be used to provide a compile-time check of the possible effects of the program.

The effect system extends the notion of type to have an "effect" component, which comprises an '''effect kind''' and a '''region'''. The effect kind describes ''what'' is being done, and the region describes ''with what'' it is being done.

An effect system is typically an extension of a [[type system]]. The term "type and effect system" is sometimes used in this case. Often, a type of a value is denoted together with its effect as ''type ! effect'', where both the type component and the effect component mention certain regions (for example, a type of a mutable memory cell is parameterized by the label of the memory region in which the cell resides).

Some examples of the behaviors that can be described by effect systems include:
* Reading, writing or allocating memory: the effect kind is ''read'', ''write'', ''allocate'' or ''free'', and the region is the point of the program where allocation was performed (i.e., each program point where allocation is performed is assigned a unique label, and region information is statically propagated along the dataflow). Most functions working with memory will actually be polymorphic in the region variable: for example, a function that swaps two locations in memory will have type {{code|forall r1 r2, unit ! {{mset|read r1, read r2, write r1, write r2}}}}.
* Working with resources, such as files: for example, the effect kind may be ''open'', ''read'' and ''close'', and again, the region is the point of the program where the resource is opened.
* Control transfers with continuations and long jumps: the effect kind may be ''[[goto]]'' (i.e. the piece of code may perform a jump) and ''[[comefrom]]'' (i.e. the piece of code may be the target of a jump), and the region denotes the point of the program from which or to which the jump may be performed.
* Java's [[checked exception]]s are an example of an effect system: the effect kind is ''throws'' and the region is the type of the exception being thrown.

Effect systems may be used to prove the external purity of certain internally impure definitions: for example, if a function internally allocates and modifies a region of memory, but the function's type does not mention the region, then the corresponding effect may be erased from the function's effect.

'''Ekāgratā''' ([[Sanskrit]]: एकाग्रता, "one-pointedness") is intent pursuit of one object, close and undisturbed  attention. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+ekagrata&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]] emphasises regular practice (''[[Abhyasa]]'') [[meditation]] and self-imposed discipline to acquire ekagrata.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

==Overview==

The faculty called Ekāgratā may be increased by integrating the psycho-mental flux (''sarvārthatā'' or variously-directed, discontinuous, and diffuse attention) so that one gains genuine will&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Medicine Men to Muhammad|author=Mercia Eliade|publisher=Harper and Row|page=73|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sY0uH75vwW8C&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tcT5UvCwIo-ThQfksIGQDw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBzgU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a happiness different from the experience of pleasure from sense-objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sivananda companion to Meditation|publisher= Sivananda Yoga Center|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ImI9p7msCQC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is harder to achieve if the body is in a tiring or uncomfortable posture or if the breathing is improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suggestopedia and Language|author=W.Jane Boncroft|publisher=Routledge|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXiNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT136&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hsP5UuXDEYishQensoDABw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austerity (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'') is allied to this conception of ''ekagrata''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=146|url=  http://www.worldcat.org/title/illumination-of-knowledge-a-brief-reflection-on-the-role-of-agni-the-vedic-god-of-fire/oclc/470877223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Badarayana]]'s [[Brahma Sutras]] (chapter 3) uses the term to mean [[dharana|concentration]]: it is held to be a quality resulting from practices discussed in the previous chapter,which are briefly mentioned in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] and [[Chandogya Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=812-833|url=  http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-shankaracharya-IDJ504/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]] the seeker after Truth should meditate with his mind fixed on the Lord (''machchittāh'') and absorbed in Him (''matparāh''). This is ''ekagrata''. The term ''nityayuktāh'' refers to devotees who keep their mind fixed on God uninterruptedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadagita Tattvavivecani|author= Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|page=400|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]] highlights the importance of continuous practice of prescribed methods to gain ekagrata, the state of the meditative mind free of diverted attention etc.; and thereafter explains that:-

:ततः पुनःशान्तोदितौ तुल्यप्रत्ययौ चित्तस्यैकाग्रतापरिणामः | - Yoga Sutra III.12

intentness on a single point (ekagrata) of the thinking principle (''[[citta]]'') gives rise to equilibrium of placid states (previously accumulated impressions) and aroused states (present eagerness to gain more knowledge), which are modifications (of the mind). These two states of mind remain unchanged and are brought to the state of stillness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: A Scientific Exposition |author=Vinod Verma|publisher=Clarion Books|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lax-nToYgt8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ekagrata'' and ''[[Dhāraṇā|dharana]]'' do not differ from each other, or else ''dharana'' is achieving and maintaining ''ekagrata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Classical Yoga|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=Inner Traditions|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWI9M9WC6MC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dharana'' converges on a particular concept or object.

Ekagrata assists in keeping one’s own mind bound and still.

In [[telecommunication]]s, '''extinction ratio''' (''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[ratio]] of two optical [[Power (physics)|power]] levels of a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] generated by an [[optical source]], e.g., a [[laser diode]]. The extinction ratio may be expressed as a fraction, in [[decibel|dB]], or as a [[percentage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timbercon.com/Extinction-Ratio.html|title=Extinction Ratio|publisher=Timbercon|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be given by
:&lt;math&gt;r_e = \frac{P_1}{P_0},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the optical power level generated when the light source is on, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the power level generated when the light source is off.

The '''polarization extinction ratio''' ('''PER''') is the ratio of optical powers of perpendicular polarizations, usually called TE (transverse electrical) and TM (transverse magnetic). In [[telecommunication]]s, the PER is used to characterize the degree of polarization in a polarization-maintaining device or fiber. For coherent transmitter and receiver, the PER is a key parameter, since X&amp;nbsp;polarization and Y&amp;nbsp;polarization are coded with different signals.

In [[systems design]], a '''fail-fast''' system is one which immediately reports at its interface any condition that is likely to indicate a failure. Fail-fast systems are usually designed to stop normal operation rather than attempt to continue a possibly flawed process. Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, so any failures can be detected early.  The responsibility of a fail-fast module is detecting errors, then letting the next-highest level of the system handle them.

== Hardware and software ==
Fail-fast systems or modules are desirable in several circumstances:

* When building a [[fault-tolerant system]] by means of redundant components, the individual components should be fail-fast to give the system enough information to successfully tolerate a failure.
* Fail-fast components are often used in situations where failure in one component might not be visible until it leads to failure in another component.
* Finding the cause of a failure is easier in a fail-fast system, because the system reports the failure with as much information as possible as close to the time of failure as possible.  In a [[fault-tolerant]] system, the failure might go undetected, whereas in a system that is neither [[fault-tolerant]] nor fail-fast the failure might be temporarily hidden until it causes some seemingly unrelated problem later.
* A fail-fast system that is designed to halt as well as report the error on failure is less likely to erroneously perform an irreversible or costly operation.

Developers also refer to fail-fast code to a code that tries to fail as soon as possible at variable or object initialization. In OOP, a fail-fast designed object initializes the internal state of the object in the constructor, launching an exception if something is wrong (vs allowing non-initialized or partially initialized objects that will fail later due to a wrong "setter"). The object can then be made [[Immutable object|immutable]] if no more changes to the internal state are expected. In functions, fail-fast code will check input parameters in the [[precondition]]. In client-server architectures, fail-fast will check the client request just upon arrival, before processing or redirecting it to other internal components, returning an error if the request fails (incorrect parameters, ...). Fail-fast designed code decreases the  internal [[software entropy]], and reduces debugging effort.

=== Examples ===
From the field of [[software engineering]], a '''Fail Fast Iterator''' is an [[iterator]] that attempts to raise an error if the sequence of elements processed by the iterator is changed during [[iteration]].

== Business ==
The term has been widely employed as a metaphor in business, dating back to at least 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khanna|first=Rajat|last2=Guler|first2=Isin|last3=Nerkar|first3=Atul|date=2016-04-01|title=Fail Often, Fail Big, and Fail Fast?

It became adopted as a kind of "mantra" within [[Startup company|startup]] culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/epic-fails-of-the-startup-world|title=Epic Fails of the Startup World|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Fair Trade coffee''' is [[coffee]] that is certified as having been produced to [[fair trade]] standards.

[[Fair trade]] organizations create trading partnerships that are based on dialogue, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[respect]], that seeks greater equity in [[international trade]]. These partnerships contribute to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to [[coffee bean]] farmers.

Fair trade organizations are engaged actively in supporting producers and sustainable environmental farming practices. Fair trade practices prohibit child or forced labor.

==History==
[[File:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|Fair trade [[coffee bean]]s being sorted]]
Prior to fair trade, prices were regulated by the [[International Coffee Organization]] according to the regulations set forth by the [[International Coffee Agreement]] of 1962. The agreement, which was negotiated at the [[United Nations]] by the Coffee Study Group, set limits on the amount of coffee traded between countries so there would be no excess supply and consequent drop in price. The ICA existed for five years, and then was renewed in 1968.

The agreement was renegotiated in 1976 due to increasing coffee prices, largely a result of a severe frost in [[Brazil]]. The new agreement allowed for the suspension of price quotas if the supply of coffee could not meet the demand, and enabling them if prices dropped too low.

In 1984, the agreement was again redrawn, this time creating a database on coffee trade, and implementing stricter import and export regulations.

[[Fair trade certification]] was then introduced in 1988 following a coffee crisis in which the supply of coffee was greater than the demand; since no price quotas had been reimplemented by the International Coffee Act, the market was flooded. Launched in the [[Netherlands]], fair trade certification aimed to artificially raise coffee prices in order to ensure growers sufficient wages to turn a profit. The original name of the organization was "[[Max Havelaar]]", after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee farmers by Dutch colonialists in the East Indies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW DID IT ACTUALLY START?|url=http://www.maxhavelaar.nl/faq/how-did-it-start?destination=english&amp;backtitle=FAQ%27s|work=FairTrade Max Havelaar Netherlands|publisher=Max Havelaar Foundation|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=Max Havelaar Foundation|language=Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization created a label for products that met certain wage standards.

Quotas remained a part of the agreement until 1989, when the organization was unable to negotiate a new agreement in time for the next year. It was decided that the 1983 agreement would be extended, but without the quotas because they had not yet been determined. A new agreement could not be negotiated until 1992.

From 1990 to 1992, without the quotas in place, coffee prices reached an all-time low because coffee price quotas could not be decided.

The agreements of 2001 and 2007 aimed to stabilize the coffee economy by promoting coffee consumption, raising the standard of living of growers by providing economic counselling, expanding research to include [[niche markets]] and quality relating to geographic area, and conducting studies of [[sustainability]], principles similar to fair trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The International Coffee Organization|url=http://www.ico.org/icohistory_e.asp|publisher=International Coffee Organization|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web |title=CERTIFICATION &amp; YOUR BUSINESS|url=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/certification|work=Fair Trade USA|publisher=Fair Trade USA|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=Fair Trade USA|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the inception of fair trade certification, the "Transfair" label was later launched in Germany, and within ten years three other labeling organizations commenced: The [[Fairtrade Foundation]], [[TransFair USA]], and [[Rättvisemärkt]]. In 1997, these four organizations jointly created Fairtrade International (formerly called FLO, or [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]]), which continues to set Fairtrade standards, inspecting and certifying growers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Fair trade organizations==

The fair trade labeling organizations having most of the market share and who sell through supermarkets refer to a definition developed by [[FINE]], an association of four international fair trade networks ([[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European World shops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA)). The standards developed by Fairtrade Labelling Organization are the most widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade Standard|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/standards.html|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification scheme ==

The certification scheme is run by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International (FLO)]].

Coffee packers pay Fairtrade a fee for the right to use the Fairtrade logo, which gives consumers an assurance that the coffee meets Fairtrade criteria. The coffee with this certification mark must be produced by farmers and cooperatives that meet these criteria.&lt;ref name="fairtrade.net"&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. (2011) “Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard,” p11  {{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}  accessed 15/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coffee retailers ==
Coffee retailers are not restricted by Fairtrade to sell Fairtrade coffee as a premium product and charge as much as they like for the coffee.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections"&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importers==

Importers of Fairtrade coffee have to be registered with Fairtrade and pay a fee. Under the Fairtrade International standards they are obliged to pay a minimum price to the exporting organization, currently $1.40c/lb New York  Board of Trade “C” contract, F.O.B. origin for Arabica, and $1.05 for Robusta London “EURONEXT LIFFE” contract, F.O.B origin with 30c/lb extra for organic.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO), “Fairtrade Minimum Price and Fairtrade Premium Table” 18.12.2012, accessed 8.1.2013; Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When the world price is above this level, they are obliged to pay 20c/lb above the world price.

==Exporters==

Certified Fairtrade coffee is normally exported by secondary or tertiary cooperatives, marketing this coffee on behalf of the cooperatives the farmers belong to&lt;ref name="Fairtrade International 2011 p 16"&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

(2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry: The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not enough demand to take all the certified coffee produced, so most has to be sold as uncertified. In 2001 only 13.6% could be sold as certified&lt;ref&gt;Muradian, R., and W. Pelupessy. 2005. “Governing the Coffee Chain: The Role of Voluntary Regulatory Systems” World Development 33(12): 2029-2044., cited in de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry: The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html.&lt;/ref&gt; so limits were placed on new cooperatives joining the scheme. This plus an increased demand put up sales of certified to around 50% in 2003&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Margaret, and April Linton. 2003. “Fair Trade: A Cup at a Time?” Politics and Society 31(3): 407-32. cited in de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry: The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html.&lt;/ref&gt; with a figure of 37% commonly cited in recent years. Some exporting cooperatives do not manage to sell any of their output as certified,&lt;ref name="Weber, J. 2006"&gt;Weber, J. (2006), ‘Rationing in the Fair Trade coffee market: who enters and how?’, Paper presented at the ‘Second International Colloquium: Fair Trade and Sustainable Development’, University of Quebec, Montreal, 19–21 June&lt;/ref&gt; and others sell as little as  8%.&lt;ref&gt;Riedel, C. P., F. M. Lopez, A. Widdows, A. Manji and M. Schneider (2005), ‘Impacts of Fair Trade: trade and market linkages’, Proceedings of the 18th International Farming Symposium, 31 October–3 November, Rome: Food and Agricultural Organisation, http://www.fao.org/ farmingsystems&lt;/ref&gt;

The exporting cooperatives incur costs including certification and inspection fees, additional marketing costs, costs of conforming to standards, and additional costs of cooperative operation,  costs which are incurred on all coffee production, even if little or none is marketed as certified, with a higher price, so the cooperatives may make a loss on Fairtrade membership. Weber&lt;ref name="Weber, J. 2006"/&gt; reports cooperatives not able to cover the extra costs of a marketing team for Fairtrade, with one covering only 70% of these costs after six years of Fairtrade membership.

Any deficit after paying these costs means a lower price for farmers, while any surplus will normally go on “social projects” for “common goals” organized by the exporting cooperative rather than as extra payment for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International: http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html.&lt;/ref&gt; These may include the building of classrooms, baseball fields, or the establishment of women's groups, for instance.

== Enforcement of standards ==

FLO-CERT, a for-profit business owned by Fairtrade International, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with farmers, cooperatives, importers and packers.

== The marketing system==

The marketing system for Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a virtual company, paying the normal importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand rather than doing it themselves, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fair trade organizations remain that adhere to a greater or smaller degree to the original objectives of fair trade than the mainstream of Fairtrade International and its associate. These market products through alternative channels where possible, and market through specialist fair trade shops, but they have a small proportion of the total market.&lt;ref&gt;Ballet, Jerome and Aurelie Carimentrand ‘Fair trade and the Depersonalization of Ethics’ Journal of Business Ethics (2010) 92:317–330 _ Springer 2010 DOI 10.1007/s10551-010-0576-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms ==

Criticisms of fair trade have been made as a result of independent research, and these are summarized in the [[fair trade debate]].

There are also some criticisms of fair trade specific to coffee. Colleen Haight of the Stanford Innovation Review argues that fair trade coffee is merely a way to market the idea of [[ethical consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee|title=The Problem with Fair Trade Coffee (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality and transparency concerns regarding coffee are increasingly common amongst some consumers and coffee companies, as seen through the rise of the [[Third wave of coffee|third wave coffee]] movement. Maintaining a balance between ethical and higher-quality coffee may be difficult with fair trade coffee due to what some coffee roasters deem as insufficient quality incentive within many fair-trade certified coffee farms. Deborah Sick’s research, involving interviews with coffee farmers in Costa Rica, finds that many farmers often produce more fair trade coffee than they can sell, so will often end up selling to independent buyers that will often pay more than fair trade buyers can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sick|first=Deborah|date=2008-08-20|title=Coffee, Farming Families, and Fair Trade in Costa Rica: New Markets, Same Old Problems?|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/245424|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=43|issue=3|pages=193–208|doi=10.1353/lar.0.0042|issn=1542-4278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars are concerned of the artificial stimulation of coffee production, especially since worldwide demand for coffee is relatively inelastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8380592|title=Voting with your trolley|date=2006-12-07|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many who believe fair trade coffee is insufficient utilize the [[direct trade]] model, which allows for more control over quality concerns, farmer empowerment, and sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcoffee.net/direct.html|title=What is Direct Trade coffee?|website=www.ethicalcoffee.net|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is valuable in harboring closer farmer to roaster business relationships, which can ultimately increase quality of life and profits for coffee growers and buyers alike. However, direct trade is a new concept that is only utilized by for profit businesses like Counter Culture Coffee and Intelligentsia Coffee and therefore has no third party certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://counterculturecoffee.com/sustainability|title=Sustainability {{!}} Counter Culture Coffee|date=2016-08-11|work=Counter Culture Coffee|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/learn-do/community/intelligentsia-direct-trade|title=Learn &amp; Do {{!}} Community {{!}} Direct Trade {{!}} Intelligentsia Coffee|website=www.intelligentsiacoffee.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom}}
[[South Africa]] is a [[secular state]], with [[freedom of religion]] enshrined in the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]].

==Legislation==

===Constitution===
The [[preamble]] to [[post-apartheid South Africa]]'s [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution of 1996]] contains [[constitutional references to God|references to God]] in the form of a multilingual [[evocation]] asking for God's protection and blessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution-republic-south-africa-1996-preamble|title=Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 – Preamble|publisher=Government of South Africa|quote=May God protect our people. Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. Morena boloka setjhaba sa heso. God seën Suid-Afrika. God bless South Africa.|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch theologian Johannes van der Ven describes this text as a "rhetorical petition prayer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Johannes A.|last=van der Ven|editor1-last=Osmer|editor1-first=Richard R.|editor2-last=Schweitzer|editor2-first=Friedrich L.|title=Developing a public faith: new directions in practical theology: essays in honor of James W. Fowler|publisher=Chalice Press|location=St. Louis, Missouri|chapter=Religious Freedom and the Public Church|pages=189–202|year=2003|isbn=9780827206311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution nevertheless enshrines the right to freedom of religion.

[[Chapter 2 of the Constitution of South Africa]], the Bill of Rights, contains a number of provisions dealing with religious freedom. [[Section 9 of the Constitution of South Africa|Section 9]], the equality clause, prohibits unfair discrimination on various grounds including religion and requires national legislation to be enacted to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination. Section 15 states that everyone has the right to freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion. This section also allows religious observances in state and state-aided institutions, provided they follow public authority rules, they are conducted on an equitable basis and attendance is free and voluntary; and provides for the recognition of religious legal systems and marriages that are not inconsistent with the Constitution. Section 31 protects the right of persons belonging to a religious community to practise their religion together with other members of that community, and to form, join and maintain voluntary religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other provisions of the Constitution relate to religion and religious freedom. Sections 185 and 186 provide for a commission for the promotion and protection of the rights of cultural, religious and linguistic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Chapter 9: State institutions supporting constitutional democracy, Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution-republic-south-africa-1996-chapter-9-state-institutions-supporting|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, human rights such as the right to human dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights: Section 10: Human dignity|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights#10|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the right to freedom of expression&lt;ref name=Section16&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights: Section 16: Freedom of expression|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights#16|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to freedom of association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights: Section 18: Freedom of association|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights#18|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; relate indirectly to the protection of religious freedom. The right to freedom of expression does not extend to [[hate speech]] based on various grounds including religion.&lt;ref name=Section16 /&gt;

The constitutional right to freedom of religion is not absolute. In his keynote speech at the public endorsement ceremony of the ''[[South African Charter of Religious Rights and Freedoms]]'' in [[Johannesburg]] on 21 October 2010 [[Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa|Deputy Chief Justice]] [[Dikgang Moseneke]] stated:

&lt;poem&gt;{{blockquote|Most of the provisions of the charter may appear uncontroversial, and yet as a sitting justice of the Constitutional Court moments may present themselves when I may be duty-bound to proffer judicial opinion on the remit or impact of one or more of its provisions, if they were to be formally enacted, or if a justiciable dispute about its enactment should arise. I am thus honour-bound to keep an open mind on the constitutional appropriateness of its provisions.
...
Every right guaranteed in the Bill of Rights may be limited by a law of general application. Thus the right to religious freedom is not absolute. Its scope may be limited by other rights or by a law in pursuit of a legitimate government purpose.
...
We have opted for a secular state which is enjoined to observe strict neutrality among religious tendencies. This duty indeed extends to the right not to believe or hold or observe any religion.
Where religious rights are at odds with other constitutional guarantees or a legitimate government purpose, the conflict must be weighed carefully, keeping in mind that in our constitutional democracy the constitution is supreme and there is no hierarchy of rights. All rank equally. We all have the right to be different.|Dikgang Moseneke|{{cite web|title=The right to differ religiously|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-240224117.html|date=24 October 2010|publisher=The Sunday Independent {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=18 March 2014}}}}&lt;/poem&gt;

===Equality Act===
Pursuant to [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|Section 9 of the Constitution]], the [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000|Equality Act of 2000]] prohibits unfair discrimination on various grounds including religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2000-004.pdf|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Briefing Document: Equality Act and equality courts|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/EQCact/eqc_briefingdoc.html|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Equality Act does not apply to unfair discrimination in the workplace, which is covered by the Employment Equity Act.&lt;ref name=LodgingComplaint/&gt;

===South African Human Rights Commission===
The [[South African Human Rights Commission]] (SAHRC) is a [[chapter nine institution]] inaugurated in 1995 to support [[Liberal democracy|constitutional democracy]]. The SAHRC investigates complaints about unfair discrimination and assists members of the public with cases heard in Equality Courts.&lt;ref name=LodgingComplaint&gt;{{cite web|title=Lodging a complaint in the Equality Court: Equality/Discrimination|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/services/discrimination.html|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the SAHRC|url=http://www.sahrc.org.za/home/index.php?ipkContentID=1&amp;ipkMenuID=28|publisher=SAHRC|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307012102/http://www.sahrc.org.za///home/index.php?ipkContentID=1&amp;ipkMenuID=28|archivedate=7 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality for all!

===CRL Rights Commission===
The [[Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities]] (CRL Rights Commission) is a [[chapter nine institution]] established in 2004 to support constitutional democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation and Conflict Resolution (ICR)|url=http://www.crlcommission.org.za/icr.php|publisher=crlcommission.org.za|accessdate=18 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131225505/http://www.crlcommission.org.za/icr.php|archivedate=31 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion in schools==
National legislation and policies governing religion in schools relate to [[Religious education in primary and secondary education|Religion Education]], religious observances in schools and school dress codes:
*The National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the [[State school|public school]] curriculum.&lt;ref name=REPolicy&gt;{{cite web|title=National Policy on Religion and Education|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/national-policy-religion-and-education|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion Education is covered in the Life Orientation subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Curriculum Statement Grades 10-12 (General) Life Orientation|url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xY8RaCOWqTY%3D&amp;..|year=2003|publisher=Department of Education|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In accordance with Section 15 of the Constitution, religious observances are permitted in public schools provided they are conducted on an equitable basis which acknowledges religious diversity and attendance is free and voluntary.&lt;ref name=Section15&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights: Section 15: Freedom of Religion, Belief &amp; Opinion|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights#15|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South African Schools Act No. 84 of 1996 |url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=808cFmkP8U4= |publisher=Department of Basic Education |accessdate=5 September 2014 |quote=7.

===OGOD court case===
In August 2014 the ''Organisasie vir Godsdienste-Onderrig en Demokrasie'' ("Organisation for Religion Education and Democracy") (OGOD) filed an application in the [[Gauteng Division|South Gauteng High Court]] to stop several public schools from describing themselves as Christian or promoting a Christian ethos in contravention of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Press Release 20/8/2014 |date=20 August 2014 |url=http://www.ogod.org.za/press-releases/ogod-litigation-press-release-aug2014.pdf |publisher=OGOD |accessdate=5 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SMMvhqdG?url=http://www.ogod.org.za/press-releases/ogod-litigation-press-release-aug2014.pdf |archivedate=5 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Heksejag op Christenskap' |url=http://www.dieburger.com/nuus/2014-09-03-heksejag-op-christenskap |language=Afrikaans |trans-title='Witch hunt on Christianity' |accessdate=4 September 2014 |work=Die Burger |date=3 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SL9HB7GN?url=http://www.dieburger.com/nuus/2014-09-03-heksejag-op-christenskap |archivedate=4 September 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carstens |first1=Sonja |title=Kind hoor: 'Jy sal in hel brand' |url=http://www.beeld.com/nuus/2014-09-03-kind-hoor-jy-sal-in-hel-brand |language=Afrikaans |trans-title=Child hears: 'You will burn in hell' |accessdate=4 September 2014 |work=Beeld |date=3 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SL9y1udC?url=http://www.beeld.com/nuus/2014-09-03-kind-hoor-jy-sal-in-hel-brand |archivedate=4 September 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thamm&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thamm |first1=Marianne |title=Religion in schools: Watershed case to ensure teaching and not preaching |url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-09-03-religion-in-schools-watershed-case-to-ensure-teaching-and-not-preaching/#.VAgtwMWSyyh |accessdate=4 September 2014 |work=[[Daily Maverick]] |date=3 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SKlNtDB1?url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-09-03-religion-in-schools-watershed-case-to-ensure-teaching-and-not-preaching/ |archivedate=4 September 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; All six schools named in the application were [[Afrikaans]]-[[Medium of instruction|medium]] public schools and their school governing bodies were members of the [[Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools]] (FEDSAS).

==Legislative reforms==
The new Constitution did not result in immediate reform of discriminatory legislation infringing on the right to religious freedom. Various legislative reforms have taken place or have been initiated since 1994 as a result of lobbying by disenfranchised groups.

The [[Civil Union Act, 2006|Civil Union Act]], which came into effect on 30 November 2006, legalised [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|same-sex marriage]] and also allowed for the legal designation of religious marriage officers without any religious restriction in accordance with the Constitution. Previously, religious marriage officers could only be legally designated as such "for the purpose of solemnizing marriages according to Christian, Jewish or Mohammedan rites or the rites of any Indian religion" in accordance with the [[Marriage Act, 1961 (South Africa)|Marriage Act]].

The [[Witchcraft Suppression Act, 1957|Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957]] based on colonial witchcraft legislation criminalises claiming a knowledge of witchcraft, conducting specified practices associated with witchcraft including the use of charms and divination, and accusing others of practising witchcraft.&lt;ref name=WSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1957-003.pdf|title=Witchcraft Suppression Act 3 of 1957|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the [[South African Law Reform Commission]] received submissions from the South African Pagan Rights Alliance and the Traditional Healers Organization requesting the investigation of the constitutionality of the act and on 23 March 2010 the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development approved a South African Law Reform Commission project to review witchcraft legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sapra Appeal for legislative reform|publisher=vuya.net|date=10 July 2007|url=http://www.vuya.net/node/2677|accessdate=18 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121220043355/http://www.vuya.net/node/2677|archivedate=20 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|title=Current Investigations: Progress Report; Project 135: Review of witchcraft legislation|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/salrc/progress.htm|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''functional block diagram''' in [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]] is a [[block diagram]]. It describes the functions and interrelationships of a [[system]]. 

The functional block diagram can picture:&lt;ref&gt;James Perozzo (1994) ''The complete guide to electronics troubleshooting''. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
* Functions of a system pictured by blocks  
* input and output elements of a block pictured with lines 
* the relationships between the functions, and 
* the functional sequences and paths for matter and or signals&lt;ref&gt;William H. Von Alven (1964) ''Reliability engineering'' explains: "Functional block diagrams show functional sequences and signal paths, and items which are wired in parallel are drawn in parallel" (p. 286)&lt;/ref&gt;
The block diagram can use additional schematic symbols to show particular properties. 

Functional block diagrams have been used in a wide range applications, from [[systems engineering]] to [[software engineering]], since the late 1950s. They became a necessity in complex systems design to "understand thoroughly from exterior design the operation of the present system and the relationship of each of the parts to the whole."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry H. Goode]], [[Robert Engel Machol]] (1957) System engineering: an introduction to the design of large-scale systems. p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many specific types of functional block diagrams have emerged. For example, the [[functional flow block diagram]] is a combination of the functional block diagram and the [[flow chart]]. Many software development methodologies are built with specific functional block diagram techniques. An example from the field of industrial computing is the [[Function Block Diagram]] (FBD), a graphical language for the design of [[programmable logic controller]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">'''Functional divergence''' is the process by which genes, after [[gene duplication]], shift in function from an ancestral function. Functional divergence can result in either [[subfunctionalization]], where a paralog specializes one of several ancestral functions, or [[neofunctionalization]], where a totally new functional capability evolves. It is thought that this process of gene duplication and functional divergence is a major originator of molecular novelty and has produced the many large [[protein families]] that exist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = X | date = Jul 2003 | title = Functional divergence in protein (family) sequence evolution | url = | journal = Genetica | volume = 118 | issue = 2–3| pages = 133–41 | doi=10.1007/978-94-010-0229-5_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fay | first1 = JC | last2 = Wu | first2 = CI | year = 2003 | title = Sequence divergence, functional constraint, and selection in protein evolution | url = | journal = Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 213–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional divergence is just one possible outcome of [[gene duplication]] events. Other fates include [[nonfunctionalization]] where one of the [[paralogs]] acquires [[deleterious]] [[mutations]] and becomes a [[pseudogene]] and [[superfunctionalization]] (reinforcement),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dvornyk | first1 = V | last2 = Vinogradova | first2 = ON | last3 = Nevo | first3 = E | year = 2002 | title = Long-term microclimatic stress causes rapid adaptive radiation of kaiABC clock gene family in a cyanobacterium, Nostoc linckia, from "Evolution Canyons" I and II, Israel | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 2082–2087 | doi=10.1073/pnas.261699498 | pmid=11842226 | pmc=123721| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.2082D }}&lt;/ref&gt; where both paralogs maintain original function. While gene, chromosome, or whole genome duplication events are considered the canonical sources of functional divergence of [[paralogs]], [[orthologs]] (genes descended from speciation events) can also undergo functional divergence &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Studer | first1 = RA | last2 = Robinson-Rechavi | first2 = M | year = 2009 | title = How confident can we be that orthologs are similar, but paralogs differ? | url = | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 210–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2009.03.004 | pmid=19368988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Studer | first1 =  | last2 = Robinson-Rechavi | first2 = M | year = 2010 | title = Large-scale analysis of orthologs and paralogs under covarion-like and constant-but-different models of amino acid evolution | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 2618–2627 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msq149 | pmid=20551039 | pmc=2955734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gharib | first1 = WH | last2 = Robinson-Rechavi | first2 = M | year = 2011 | title = When orthologs diverge between human and mouse | url = | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 436–441 | doi = 10.1093/bib/bbr031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nehrt | first1 = NL | last2 = Clark | first2 = WT | last3 = Radivojac | first3 = P | last4 = Hahn | first4 = MW | year = 2011 | title = Testing the ortholog conjecture with comparative functional genomic data from mammals | url = | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = e1002073 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002073 | pmid=21695233 | pmc=3111532| bibcode = 2011PLSCB...7E2073N }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[horizontal gene transfer]] can also result in multiple copies of a gene in a genome, providing the opportunity for functional divergence.

Many well known protein families are the result of this process, such as the ancient gene duplication event that led to the divergence of [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]], the more recent duplication events that led to the various subunit expansions (alpha and beta) of vertebrate [[hemoglobin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Storz | first1 = Jay F. | last2 = Hoffmann | first2 = Federico G. | last3 = Opazo | first3 = Juan C. | last4 = Moriyama | first4 = Hideaki | date = March 2008 | title = Adaptive Functional Divergence Among Triplicated α-Globin Genes in Rodents | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 178 | issue = 3| pages = 1623–1638 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.107.080903 | pmc = 2278084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the expansion of  G-protein alpha subunits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zheng | first1 = Y | last2 = Xu | first2 = D | last3 = Gu | first3 = X | year = 2007 | title = Functional divergence after gene duplication and sequence-structure relationship: a case study of G-protein alpha subunits | url = | journal = J Exp Zool B Mol Dev Evol. | volume = 308 | issue = 1| pages = 85–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FMtreew.gif|thumb|Function means tree]]

In [[engineering design]], a '''function–means tree''' (a.k.a. '''function/means tree''' or '''F/M tree''') is a method for [[functional decomposition]] and concept generation. At the top level, main functions are identified. Under each function, a [[instrumental value|means]] (or solution element) is attached. Alternative [[solution]] elements can also be attached. Each means is in turn decomposed into functions with means attached to each of them. A well-elaborated function means tree span, a design space where all [[concept]]s under consideration are represented. Requirements can be attached to functions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In addition to product level requirements, there might be requirements on sub functions that may be a consequence of means at a higher level. The function means tree is a tool that can aid in the [[creativity|creative]] part of the design process. It can also be a tool for mapping requirements to parts in a design. This requires that there be also a mapping between means and parts in the product [[architecture]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[File:Cicero.PNG|thumb|upright|The Roman politician [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] coined the phrase ''ipse dixit'', which translates from the Latin as, "he said it himself"]]

'''''Ipse dixit''''' ([[Latin]] for "he said it himself") is an assertion without proof; or a [[dogma]]tic expression of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=73tEAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3179&amp;dq= "''Ipse dixit''"], ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia,'' pp. 379–380; Westbrook, Robert B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0I-9gJN9rbwC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq= "John Dewey and American Democracy", p. 359].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[fallacy]] of defending a proposition by baldly asserting that it is "just how it is" distorts the argument by opting out of it entirely: the claimant declares an issue to be intrinsic, and not changeable.&lt;ref name="comp"&gt;VanderMey, Randall ''et al.'' (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=l7I-ykFAC3cC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=bare+assertion+fallacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mHHGULnmLIS60AHGuICACA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=bare%20assertion%20fallacy&amp;f=false ''Comp'', p. 183]; excerpt: "Bare assertion. The most basic way to distort an issue is to deny that it exists. This fallacy claims, 'That's just how it is.' "&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Latin form of the expression comes from the Roman orator and philosopher [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106–43 BC) in his theological studies ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (''On the Nature of the Gods'') and is his translation of the Greek expression (with the identical meaning) αὐτὸς ἔφα (''autòs épha''), an [[argument from authority]] made by the [[Pythagoreans|disciples of Pythagoras]] when appealing to the pronouncements of the master rather than to reason or evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Poliziano, Angelo. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=AAR2oNDiQkwC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=De+Natura+Deorum+ipse+dixit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9DPHUKC_KbK30gGvyIDoDw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20Natura%20Deorum%20ipse%20dixit&amp;f=false  ''Angelo Poliziano's Lamia: Text, Translation, and Introductory Studies,'' p. 26]; excerpt, "In Cicero's ''De natura deorum,'' as well as in other sources, the phrase “Ipse dixit” pointed to the notion that Pythagoras's disciples would use that short phrase as justification for adopting a position: if the master had said it, it was enough for them and there was no need to argue further."&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the early 17th century, [[Scholasticism|scholars]] applied the ''ipse dixit'' term to justify their subject-matter arguments if the arguments previously had been used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Burton, George Ward. (1909). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pA8wAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA27&amp;dq= ''Burton's book on California and its sunlit skies of glory,'' p. 27]; excerpt, "But by the time of [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], students had fallen into the habit of accepting Aristotle as an infallible guide, and when a dispute arose the appeal was not to fact, but to Aristotle's theory, and the phrase, ''Ipse dixit,'' ended all dispute."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ipse-dixitism ===
In the late 18th century, [[Jeremy Bentham]] adapted the term ''ipse dixit'' into the word ''ipse-dixitism.''&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uPLufahzlaUC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq= ''Deontology; or, The science of morality,'' Vol. 1, p. 323]; excerpt, "ipsedixitism ... comes down to us from an antique and high authority, —-it is the principle recognised (so Cicero informs us) by the disciples of Pythagoras. ''Ipse'' {he, the master, Pythagoras), ''ipse dixit'', — he has said it; the master has said that it is so; therefore, say the disciples of the illustrious sage, therefore so it is."&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham coined the term to apply to all non-[[utilitarian]] political arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1838). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DHhYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq= ''Works of Jeremy Bentham,'' p. 192]; excerpt, "...&amp;nbsp;it is not a mere ''ipse dixit'' that will warrant us to give credit for utility to institutions, in which not the least trace of utility is discernible."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal usage===
In modern legal and administrative decisions, the term ''ipse dixit'' has generally been used as a criticism of arguments based solely upon the authority of an individual or organization.  For example, in ''National Tire Dealers &amp; Retreaders Association, Inc. v. Brinegar,'' 491 F.2d 31, 40 (D.C. Cir. 1974), Circuit Judge [[Malcolm Richard Wilkey|Wilkey]] considered that the Secretary of Transportation's "statement of the reasons for his conclusion that the requirements are practicable is not so inherently plausible that the court can accept it on the agency's mere ''ipse dixit''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1974522491F2d31_1516.xml/NATIONAL%20TIRE%20DEALERS%20&amp;%20RETREAD.%20ASS'N,%20INC.%20v.%20BRINEGAR|title=National Tire Dealers &amp; Retread. Ass'n Inc. vs. Brinegar|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the problem of "opinion evidence which is connected to existing data only by the ''ipse dixit'' of an expert".&lt;ref&gt;Filan, citing [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-188.ZS.html  ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner,''] 522 U.S. 136, 137; 118 S.Ct. 512; 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has held "a claim will not stand or fall on the mere ''ipse dixit'' of a credentialed witness".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2125793418825711243&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr "Burrow v. Arce,"] 997 S.W.2d 229, 235 (Tex. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1858, Abraham Lincoln said in his speech at Freeport, Illinois, at the second joint debate with Douglas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I pass one or two points I have because my time will very soon expire, but I must be allowed to say that Judge Douglas recurs again, as he did upon one or two other occasions, to the enormity of Lincoln,—an insignificant individual like Lincoln,— upon his ''ipse dixit'' charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of Congress, the Supreme Court, and two Presidents, to nationalize slavery. I want to say that, in the first place, I have made no charge of any sort upon my ''ipse dixit''. I have only arrayed the evidence tending to prove it, and presented it to the understanding of others, saying what I think it proves,  but giving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not. This is precisely what I have done. I have not placed it upon my ''ipse dixit'' at all.&lt;ref&gt;From [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln3?view=toc ''The complete works of Abraham Lincoln'', Vol. III], pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8764">'''Kan extensions''' are [[Universal property|universal constructs]] in [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]]. They are closely related to [[Adjoint functors|adjoints]], but are also related to [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[End (category theory)|ends]]. They are named after [[Daniel Kan|Daniel M. Kan]], who constructed certain (Kan) extensions using [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] in 1960.

An early use of (what is now known as) a Kan extension from 1956 was in [[homological algebra]] to compute [[derived functor]]s.

In ''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]'' [[Saunders Mac Lane]] titled a section "All Concepts Are Kan Extensions", and went on to write that

:The notion of Kan extensions subsumes all the other fundamental concepts of category theory.

Kan extensions generalize the notion of extending a function defined on a subset to a function defined on the whole set.  The definition, not surprisingly, is at a high level of abstraction. When specialised to [[poset]]s, it becomes a relatively familiar type of question on [[constrained optimization]].

==Definition==

A Kan extension proceeds from the data of three categories 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;

and two [[functor]]s

:&lt;math&gt;X \colon \mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{C}, F \colon \mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;,

and comes in two varieties: the "left" Kan extension and the "right" Kan extension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

It amounts to finding the dashed arrow and the 2-cell &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; in the following diagram:

:&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;[[File:Right Kan Extension.png|Right Kan Extension]]&lt;/div&gt;

(The natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; in the above depiction of the right Kan extension points to the functor &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from the functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. However, it should be interpreted as an arrow to the functor &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from the composed functor &lt;math&gt;RF \colon \mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;.)

Formally, the ''right Kan extension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;'' consists of a functor &lt;math&gt;R \colon \mathbf{B} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\eta \colon RF \to X&lt;/math&gt; which is couniversal with respect to the specification, in the sense that for any functor &lt;math&gt;M \colon \mathbf{B} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\mu \colon MF \to X&lt;/math&gt;, a unique natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\delta \colon M \to R&lt;/math&gt; is defined and fits into a commutative diagram

:&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;[[Image:Right Kan extension universal property diagram.PNG]]&lt;/div&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\delta_F&lt;/math&gt; is the natural transformation with &lt;math&gt;\delta_F(a) = \delta(Fa) \colon MF(a) \to RF(a)&lt;/math&gt; for any object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;).

The functor ''R'' is often written &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ran}_FX&lt;/math&gt;.

As with the other [[Universal property|universal constructs]] in [[category theory]], the "left" version of the Kan extension is [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to the "right" one and is obtained by replacing all categories by their [[opposite category|opposite]]s.  The effect of this on the description above is merely to reverse the direction of the natural transformations (recall that a [[natural transformation]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; between the functors &lt;math&gt;F,G \colon \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the data of an arrow &lt;math&gt;T(a) \colon F(a) \to G(a)&lt;/math&gt; for every object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying a "naturality" property.  When we pass to the opposite categories, the source and target of &lt;math&gt;T(a)&lt;/math&gt; are swapped, causing &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to act in the opposite direction).

This gives rise to the alternate description: the ''left Kan extension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;'' consists of a functor &lt;math&gt;L \colon \mathbf{B} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \colon X \to L F&lt;/math&gt; which are universal with respect to this specification, in the sense that for any other functor &lt;math&gt;M \colon \mathbf{B} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\alpha \colon X \to M F&lt;/math&gt;, a unique natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\sigma \colon L \to M&lt;/math&gt; exists and fits into a commutative diagram:

:&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;[[Image:Kan extension universal property diagram.png]]&lt;/div&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; is the natural transformation with &lt;math&gt;\sigma_F(a) = \sigma(Fa) \colon LF(a) \to MF(a)&lt;/math&gt; for any object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;).

The functor ''L'' is often written &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Lan}_FX&lt;/math&gt;.

The use of the word "the" (as in "the left Kan extension") is justified by the fact that, as with all universal constructions, if the object defined exists, then it is unique up to unique isomorphism.  In this case, that means that (for left Kan extensions) if &lt;math&gt;L, M&lt;/math&gt; are two left Kan extensions of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon, \alpha&lt;/math&gt; are the corresponding transformations, then there exists a unique ''isomorphism'' of functors &lt;math&gt;\sigma \colon L \to M&lt;/math&gt; such that the second diagram above commutes.  Likewise for right Kan extensions.

==Properties==
===Kan extensions as [[limit (category theory)|(co)limits]]===
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;X:\mathbf{A}\to\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F:\mathbf{A}\to\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are two functors. If '''A''' is small and '''C''' is cocomplete, then there exists a left Kan extension &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Lan}_FX&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, defined at each object ''b'' of '''B''' by

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Lan}_F X)(b) = \varinjlim_{f:Fa \to b} X(a)&lt;/math&gt;

where the colimit is taken over the [[comma category]] &lt;math&gt;(F \downarrow b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Dually, if '''A''' is small and '''C''' is complete, then right Kan extensions along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exist, and can be computed as limits.

===Kan extensions as [[coend (category theory)|(co)ends]]===
Suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;K:\mathbf{M}\to\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T:\mathbf{M}\to\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

are two functors such that for all objects ''m'' and ''m''' of '''M'''  and all objects ''c'' of '''C''', the [[copower (category theory)|copowers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(Km',c)\cdot Tm&lt;/math&gt; exist in '''A'''. Then the functor ''T'' has a left Kan extension ''L'' along ''K'', which is such that, for every object ''c'' of '''C''',

:&lt;math&gt;Lc=(\mathrm{Lan}_KT)c=\int^m\mathbf{C}(Km,c)\cdot Tm&lt;/math&gt;

when the above [[coend (category theory)|coend]] exists for every object ''c'' of '''C'''.

Dually, right Kan extensions can be computed by the [[end (category theory)|end]] formula


:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Ran}_KT)c=\int_mTm^{\mathbf{C}(c,Km)}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Limits as Kan extensions===
The [[Limit (category theory)|limit]] of a functor &lt;math&gt;F:C\to D&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a Kan extension by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lim}F=\mathrm{Ran}_E F&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the unique functor from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; to [[Subdivided interval categories| &amp;#120793;]] (the category with one object and one arrow, a terminal object in &lt;math&gt;Cat&lt;/math&gt;). The colimit of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed similarly by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{colim}F=\mathrm{Lan}_E F&lt;/math&gt;.

===Adjoints as Kan extensions===
A functor &lt;math&gt;F : C \to D&lt;/math&gt; possesses a [[left adjoint]] if and only if the right Kan extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Id} : C \to C&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists and is preserved by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, a left adjoint is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ran}_F \mathrm{Id}&lt;/math&gt; and this Kan extension is even preserved by any functor &lt;math&gt;C \to E&lt;/math&gt; whatsoever, i.e. is an ''absolute'' Kan extension.

Dually, a right adjoint exists if and only if the left Kan extension of the identity along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists and is preserved by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4168">The '''matheme''' (from {{lang-el|μάθημα}} "lesson") is a concept introduced in the work of the 20th century [[France|French]] [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]]. The term matheme 'occurred for the first time in the lecture Lacan delivered on November 4, 1971...Between 1972 and 1973 he gave several definitions of it, passing from the use of the singular to the use of the plural and back again'.&lt;ref&gt;Ėlisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1997) p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

'Lacan saw his "matheme" as something that would ensure the integral transmission of his teachings...proof against the "noise" or interference inherent in any process of communication'.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

They are [[formula]]e, designed as [[symbol]]ic [[knowledge representation|representations]] of his [[idea]]s and analyses. They were intended to introduce some degree of technical rigour in philosophical and psychological writing, replacing the often hard-to-understand verbal descriptions with formulae resembling those used in the [[hard science]]s, and as an easy way to hold, remember, and rehearse some of the core ideas of both [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and Lacan. For example: "$&lt;&gt;a" is the matheme for fantasy in the Lacanian sense, in which "$"  refers to the subject as split into conscious and unconscious (hence the matheme is a barred S), "[[Objet petit a|a]]" stands for the object-cause of desire, and "&lt;&gt;" stands for the relationship between the two.

A more complex set of mathemes are Lacan's 'formulae of sexuation,' which he popularized in the March 13, 1973 session of his ''[[Seminars of Jacques Lacan|Seminar XX]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: On Feminine Sexuality, The Limits of Love and Knowledge, Book XX, Encore, 1972–1973|last = Lacan|first = Jacques|publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year = 1998|isbn = 978-0393319163|location = New York|pages = 78–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of two pairs of propositions written in a unique logico-mathematical shorthand inspired by [[Gottlob Frege]], one pair was dubbed 'masculine' and the other 'feminine.' These formulae Lacan originally constructed from [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]] over the course of an entire year of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.swingtradesystems.com/lacan/lacan-and-aristotle.html|title = The Aristotelian Roots of Lacan's Formulas of Sexuation|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Matheme", for Lacan, was not simply the imitation of science by philosophy, but the ideal of a perfect means for the integral transmission of knowledge.  Natural language, with its constant "metonymic slide", fails here, where mathematics succeeds.  Contemporary philosopher [[Alain Badiou]] identifies "matheme" with the scientific procedure.

==Criticism==

Though sometimes disparaged as a case of "[[physics envy]]" or accused of introducing false rigor into a discipline that is more literary theory than hard science, there is also something of a sense of humor in Lacan's formulas: of one 'sigla which I have introduced in the form of an algorithm', Lacan himself has declared that 'it is created to allow for a hundred and one different readings, a multiplicity that is admissible as long as the spoken remains caught in its algebra'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits:  A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serge Leclaire]], who is one of the most respected and distinguished of all French analysts, remarked in 1975, for example, that whilst the mathemes might have a certain pedagogic utility, they were basically no more than "graffiti"'.&lt;ref&gt;Macey, p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the modern synthesis, including [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance.&lt;ref name="Gould216"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] and supplanted a variety of [[alternatives to Darwinism|non-Darwinian theories of evolution]].]]
{{Evolutionary biology}}

The '''modern synthesis'''{{efn|Also known variously as the '''new synthesis''', the '''modern evolutionary synthesis''', the '''evolutionary synthesis''', and the '''neo-Darwinian synthesis'''. These alternative terms are ambiguous as they could possibly include later syntheses, so this article uses [[Julian Huxley]]'s 1942 "modern synthesis"{{sfn|Huxley|2010}} throughout.}} was the early 20th-century synthesis reconciling [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s ideas on heredity in a joint mathematical framework. [[Julian Huxley]] coined the term in his 1942 book, ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''.

The 19th century ideas of [[natural selection]] and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] were put together with [[population genetics]], early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed the relationship between the broad-scale changes of [[macroevolution]] seen by [[paleontology|palaeontologists]] and the small-scale [[microevolution]] of local [[population]]s of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1959, [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] in 1966 and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included [[E. B. Ford]], [[Bernhard Rensch]], [[Ivan Schmalhausen]], and [[George Gaylord Simpson]]. An early event in the modern synthesis was [[R. A. Fisher]]'s 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but [[William Bateson]], and separately [[Udny Yule]], were already starting to show how Mendelian genetics could work in evolution in 1902.

Different syntheses followed, accompanying the gradual breakup of the early 20th century synthesis, including with [[social behaviour]] in [[E. O. Wilson]]'s [[sociobiology]] in 1975, [[evolutionary developmental biology]]'s integration of [[embryology]] with genetics and evolution, starting in 1977, and [[Massimo Pigliucci]]'s proposed [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] of 2007. In the view of the evolutionary biologist [[Eugene Koonin]] in 2009, the modern synthesis will be replaced by a 'post-modern' synthesis that will include revolutionary changes in [[molecular biology]], the study of [[prokaryote]]s and the resulting [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]], and [[genomics]].&lt;ref name=Koonin2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink=Eugene Koonin |title=The Origin at 150: is a new evolutionary synthesis in sight? |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=November 2009 |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=473–475 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.09.007 |pmid=19836100 |pmc=2784144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin's evolution by natural selection, 1859===
{{main|Evolution|Natural selection}}

[[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was successful in convincing most biologists that [[evolution]] had occurred, but was less successful in convincing them that [[natural selection]] was its primary mechanism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, variations of [[Lamarckism]] (inheritance of acquired characteristics), [[orthogenesis]] (progressive evolution), [[saltationism]] (evolution by jumps) and [[mutationism]] (evolution driven by mutations) were discussed as alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=236–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] advocated a selectionist version of evolution, and unlike Darwin completely rejected Lamarckism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kutschera |first=Ulrich |authorlink=Ulrich Kutschera |date=December 2003 |title=A comparative analysis of the Darwin-Wallace papers and the development of the concept of natural selection |journal=Theory in Biosciences |location=Jena; Berlin &amp; Heidelberg |publisher=Urban &amp; Fischer; [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=343–359 |doi=10.1007/s12064-003-0063-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, Wallace's view was labelled [[neo-Darwinism]] by Samuel Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Samuel |authorlink1=Samuel Butler (novelist)|title=Unconscious Memory |date=1880 |publisher=David Bogue |page=280 |url=https://archive.org/details/unconsciousmemo00hartgoog |quote=I may predict with some certainty that before long we shall find the original Darwinism of Dr. [[Erasmus Darwin]] … generally accepted instead of the neo-Darwinism of to-day, and that the variations whose accumulation results in species will be recognised as due to the wants and endeavours of the living forms in which they appear, instead of being ascribed to chance, or, in other words, to unknown causes, as by Mr. Charles Darwin's system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wallacefund.info/terms-darwinism-and-neo-darwinism |title=On the Terms "Darwinism" and "Neo-Darwinism" |last=Beccaloni |first=George |date=2013 |website=A.

===The eclipse of Darwinism, 1880s onwards===
{{main|The eclipse of Darwinism}}

From the 1880s onwards, there was a widespread belief among biologists that Darwinian evolution was in deep trouble. This [[eclipse of Darwinism]] (in [[Julian Huxley]]'s phrase) grew out of the weaknesses in Darwin's account, written with an incorrect view of inheritance. Darwin himself believed in [[blending inheritance]], which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] correctly noted in 1868.&lt;ref name="Bowler196-250"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson105-129"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn meant that small variations would not survive long enough to be selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics entirely possible, and Darwin's 1868 theory of [[pangenesis]], with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing from all parts of the body, actually implied Lamarckism as well as blending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gayon, Jean |date=1998 |title=Darwinism's Struggle for Survival: Heredity and the Hypothesis of Natural Selection |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=2–3 |isbn=978-0-521-56250-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Darwin68"&gt;{{cite book | last=Darwin | first=Charles | authorlink=Charles Darwin | year=1868 | title=The variation of animals and plants under domestication | publisher=John Murray | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F880.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 | isbn=1-4191-8660-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weismann's germ plasm, 1892===
{{main|Germ plasm}}

[[August Weismann]]'s idea, set out in his 1892 book ''Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung'' (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weismann, August |date=1892 |title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung |trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A theory of inheritance |publisher=Fischer |location=Jena |url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/weismann_keimplasma_1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that the hereditary material, which he called the [[germ plasm]], and the rest of the body (the [[Somatic (biology)|soma]]) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong, and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails, demonstrated that inheritance was 'hard'.{{efn|Peter Gauthier has however argued that [[Weismann's experiment]] showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm. It did not test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=Peter |date=March–May 1990 |title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis? |journal=BIOS |volume=61 |number=1/2 |pages=6–8 |jstor=4608123}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He argued strongly and dogmatically{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=248}} for Darwinism and against Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=247–253, 257}}

==Disputed beginnings==

===Genetics, mutationism and biometrics, 1900–1918===
{{main|Mutationism|Biostatistics}}
[[File:William Bateson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William Bateson]] championed [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelism]].]]

While carrying out breeding experiments to clarify the mechanism of inheritance in 1900, [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Carl Correns]] independently rediscovered [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work. News of this reached [[William Bateson]] in [[England]], who reported on the paper during a presentation to the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in May 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jic.ac.uk/germplas/PISUM/ZGS4F.HTM |title=Mendel's Peas |last=Ambrose |first=Mike |publisher=Germplasm Resources Unit, [[John Innes Centre]]|location=Norwich, UK |accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mendelian inheritance]], the contributions of each parent retain their integrity rather than blending with the contribution of the other parent. In the case of a cross between two true-breeding varieties such as Mendel's round and wrinkled peas, the first-generation offspring are all alike, in this case all round. Allowing these to cross, the original characteristics reappear (segregation): about 3/4 of their offspring are round, 1/4 wrinkled. There is a discontinuity between the appearance of the offspring; de Vries coined the term [[allele]] for a variant form of an [[gene|inherited characteristic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reviewing Mendel's Laws |url=http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/inheritance/laws.html |publisher=Pearson |accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforced a major division of thought, already present in the 1890s, between gradualists who followed Darwin, and saltationists such as Bateson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bateson|1894}}: Mutations (as 'sports') and polymorphisms were well known long before the Mendelian recovery.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two schools were the Mendelians, such as Bateson and de Vries, who favoured mutationism&lt;!--cd overlink this--&gt;, evolution driven by mutation, based on genes whose alleles [[Particulate inheritance|segregated discretely]] like Mendel's peas;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=157–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1989|pp=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Biostatistics|biometric school]], led by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter Weldon]]. The biometricians argued vigorously against mutationism, saying that empirical evidence indicated that variation was continuous in most organisms, not discrete as Mendelism seemed to predict; they wrongly believed that Mendelism inevitably implied evolution in discontinuous jumps.&lt;ref name="grafen 69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Provine|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Pearson, 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Pearson]] led the [[Biostatistics|biometric school]].]]

A traditional view is that the biometricians and the Mendelians rejected natural selection and argued for their separate theories for 20 years, the debate only resolved by the development of population genetics.&lt;ref name="grafen 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Grafen|Ridley|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olby |first1=Robert |title=The Dimensions of Scientific Controversy: The Biometric-Mendelian Debate |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=September 1989 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=299–320 |jstor=4026898 |doi=10.1017/s0007087400026170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more recent view is that Bateson, de Vries, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and [[Reginald Punnett]] had by 1918 formed a synthesis of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the [[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]], the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and the probability that a new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gayon, J. | title=Darwinism's Struggle for Survival: Heredity and the Hypothesis of Natural Selection |year=1988 | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoltzfus"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Arlin |last2=Cable |first2=Kele |title=Mendelian-Mutationism: The Forgotten Evolutionary Synthesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2014 |volume=47 |pages=501–546 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9383-2 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10739-014-9383-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that "If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various homo- and hetero-zygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected".&lt;ref name="BatesonSaunders1902"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bateson |first1=William |author1link=William Bateson |last2=Saunders |first2=E.

Yule criticised Bateson's approach as confrontational,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yule | first1=G. Udny |authorlink=Udny Yule | title=Mendel's Laws and their probable relations to inter-racial heredity |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1902.tb06590.x/pdf |journal=New Phytologist |volume=1 |pages=226–227 |date=1902 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1902.tb07336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=81–82}}

===Castle's hooded rats, 1911===

Starting in 1906, [[William Ernest Castle|William Castle]] carried out a long study of the effect of selection on coat colour in [[rat]]s. The [[piebald]] or hooded pattern was [[recessive]] to the grey wild type. He crossed hooded rats with the black-backed Irish type, and then back-crossed the offspring with pure hooded rats. The dark stripe on the back was bigger. He then tried selecting different groups for bigger or smaller stripes for 5 generations, and found that it was possible to change the characteristics way beyond the initial range of variation. This effectively refuted de Vries's claim that continuous variation was caused by the environment and could not be inherited. By 1911 Castle noted that the results could be explained by Darwinian selection on heritable variation of a sufficient number of Mendelian genes.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=109–114}}

===Morgan's fruit flies, 1912===
{{main|Thomas Hunt Morgan}}

Thomas Hunt Morgan began his career in genetics as a saltationist, and started out trying to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''{{efn|Morgan's work with fruit flies helped establish the link between Mendelian genetics and the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] theory of inheritance, that the hereditary material was embodied in these bodies within the cell nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the supply of genetic variation in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=120–121}}

==An obstruction: Woodger's positivism, 1929==

{{further|Joseph Henry Woodger}}

The [[theoretical biology|theoretical biologist]] and [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] led the introduction of [[logical positivism|positivism]] into biology with his 1929 book ''Biological Principles''. He saw a mature [[science]] as being characterised by a framework of [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that could be verified by facts established by [[experiment]]s. He criticised the traditional [[natural history]] style of [[biology]], including the study of [[evolution]], as immature science, since it relied on [[narrative]].&lt;ref name=Smocovitis100&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodger set out to play for biology the role of [[Robert Boyle]]'s 1661 ''[[Sceptical Chymist]]'', intending to convert the subject into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the [[Vienna Circle]] of logical positivists like [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[reductionism|to reduce]] biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and by influencing thinkers such as Huxley, helped to bring about the modern synthesis.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis100/&gt; The positivist climate made natural history unfashionable, and in America, research and university-level teaching on evolution declined almost to nothing by the late 1930s. The Harvard physiologist [[William John Crozier]] told his students that evolution was not even a science: "You can't experiment with two million years!"&lt;ref name=Smocovitis114&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tide of opinion turned with the adoption of [[mathematical model]]ling and [[controlled experiment]]ation in population genetics, combining genetics, ecology and evolution in a framework acceptable to positivism.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis119&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events in the synthesis==
===Fisher and Haldane's mathematical population genetics, 1918–1930===
{{main|A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection}}

In 1918, R. A. Fisher wrote the paper "[[The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Ronald A. |authorlink=Ronald Fisher |date=January 1919 |title=XV.—The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |location=London |publisher=Robert Grant &amp; Son; [[Williams and Norgate|Williams &amp; Norgate]] |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=399–433 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800012163 |oclc=4981124}} "Paper read by J. Arthur Thomson on July 8, 1918 to the Royal Society of Edinburgh."&lt;/ref&gt; which showed mathematically how continuous variation could result from a number of discrete [[locus (genetics)|genetic loci]]. In this and subsequent papers culminating in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher showed how Mendelian genetics was consistent with the idea of evolution driven by natural selection.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=221–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Fisher also analysed [[sexual selection]] in his book, but his work was largely ignored, and Darwin's case for such selection misunderstood&lt;!--e.g. by Huxley--&gt;, so it formed no substantial part of the modern synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosken |first1=David J. |last2=House |first2=Clarissa M. |title=Sexual Selection |journal=Current Biology |date=25 January 2011 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=R62–R65 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.053}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1920s, [[A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection|a series of papers]] by [[J. B. S.

Natural selection, once considered hopelessly unverifiable speculation about history, was becoming predictable, measurable, and testable.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis122&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=122–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Beer's embryology, 1930===

The traditional view is that [[developmental biology]] played little part in the modern synthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in his 1930 book ''[[Embryos and Ancestors]]'', the evolutionary embryologist [[Gavin de Beer]] anticipated [[evolutionary developmental biology]]&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |authorlink=Lewis I.

The population geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] focused on combinations of genes that interacted as complexes, and the effects of [[inbreeding]] on small relatively isolated populations, which could be subject to [[genetic drift]]. In a 1932 paper, he introduced the concept of an [[Fitness landscape|adaptive landscape]] in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which would in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1932|pp=[http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf 356–366]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's model would appeal to field naturalists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr who were becoming aware of the importance of geographical isolation in real world populations.&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt; The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright helped to found the discipline of theoretical population genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Michael R. |authorlink1=Michael R.

===Dobzhansky's evolutionary genetics, 1937===
{{further|Genetics and the Origin of Species}}
[[File:Drosophila pseudoobscura-Male.png|thumb|left|''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]'', the fruit fly which served as [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]'s [[model organism]]]]

[[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], an emigrant from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States]], who had been a postdoctoral worker in Morgan's fruit fly lab, was one of the first to apply genetics to natural populations. He worked mostly with ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]''. He says pointedly: "Russia has a variety of climates from the Arctic to sub-tropical... Exclusively laboratory workers who neither possess nor wish to have any knowledge of living beings in nature were and are in a minority."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|Provine|1998|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, there were other [[Russia]]n geneticists with similar ideas, though for some time their work was known to only a few in the [[Western world|West]]. His 1937 work ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a key step in bridging the gap between population geneticists and field naturalists. It presented the conclusions reached by Fisher, Haldane, and especially Wright in their highly mathematical papers in a form that was easily accessible to others.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"/&gt; Further, Dobzhansky asserted that evolution was based on material genes, arranged in a string on physical hereditary structures, the [[chromosome]]s, and [[genetic linkage|linked]] more or less strongly to each other according to their physical distances from each other on the chromosomes. As with Haldane and Fisher, Dobzhansky's "evolutionary genetics"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a genuine science, now unifying cell biology, genetics, and both micro- and macroevolution.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis122/&gt; His work emphasized that real world populations had far more genetic variability than the early population geneticists had assumed in their models, and that genetically distinct sub-populations were important. Dobzhansky argued that natural selection worked to maintain genetic diversity as well as driving change. He was influenced by his exposure in the 1920s to the work of [[Sergei Chetverikov]], who had looked at the role of recessive genes in maintaining a reservoir of genetic variability in a population before his work was shut down by the rise of [[Lysenkoism]] in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"/&gt; By 1937, Dobzhansky was able to argue  that mutations were the main source of evolutionary changes and variability, along with chromosome rearrangements, effects of genes on their neighbours during development, and polyploidy. Next, genetic drift (he used the term in 1941), selection, migration, and geographical isolation could change gene frequencies. Thirdly, mechanisms like ecological or sexual isolation and hybrid sterility could fix the results of the earlier processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eldredge |first=Niles |title=Unfinished Synthesis: Biological Hierarchies and Modern Evolutionary Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEYdRMjhPC4C&amp;pg=PR9 |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536513-9 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schmalhausen's stabilizing selection, 1941===
{{further|Stabilizing selection}}

[[Ivan Schmalhausen]] developed the theory of [[stabilizing selection]], the idea that selection can preserve a trait at some value, publishing a paper in Russian titled "Stabilizing selection and its place among factors of evolution" in 1941 and a monograph ''Factors of Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmalhausen|first1=Ivan I.|last2=Dordick|first2=Isadore (trans.)|authorlink1=Ivan Schmalhausen|editor1-last=Dobzhansky|editor1-first=Theodosius|editor1-link=Theodosius Dobzhansky|title=Factors of Evolution.

Baldwin's 1902 concept that changes induced by the environment will ultimately be replaced by hereditary changes (including the [[Baldwin effect]] on behaviour), following that theory's implications to their Darwinian conclusion, and bringing him into conflict with Lysenkoism. Schmalhausen observed that stabilizing selection would remove most variations from the norm, most mutations being harmful.&lt;ref name=Levit2006&gt;{{cite journal | last=Levit | first=Georgy S. |author2=Hossfeld, Uwe |author3=Olsson, Lennart | title=From the 'Modern Synthesis' to Cybernetics: Ivan Ivanovich Schmalhausen (1884–1963) and his Research Program for a Synthesis of Evolutionary and Developmental Biology | journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology | volume=306B | issue=2006 | pages=89–106 | publisher=Wiley-Liss | year=2006 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.b.21087/abstract | pmid=16419076 | doi=10.1002/jez.b.21087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams1988&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adams, M.

===Huxley's popularising synthesis, 1942===
{{main|Evolution: The Modern Synthesis}}
[[File:Julian Huxley 1964.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julian Huxley]] presented a serious but popularising version of the theory in his 1942 book ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''.]]

In 1942, [[Julian Huxley]]'s serious but popularising&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamm&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lamm |first1=Ehud |title=Review of: Julian Huxley, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis – The Definitive Edition, with a new forward by Massimo Pigliucci and Gerd B. Müller. MIT Press |url=http://www.ehudlamm.com/huxley.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''{{sfn|Huxley|2010}} introduced a name for the synthesis and intentionally set out to promote a "synthetic point of view" on the evolutionary process. He imagined a wide synthesis of many sciences: genetics, developmental physiology, ecology, systematics, palaeontology, cytology, and mathematical analysis of biology, and assumed that evolution would proceed differently in different groups of organisms according to how their genetic material was organised and their strategies for reproduction, leading to progressive but varying evolutionary trends.&lt;ref name=Lamm/&gt; His vision was of an "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt; with a system of ethics and a meaningful place for "Man" in the world grounded in a unified theory of evolution which would demonstrate progress leading to man at its summit. Natural selection was in his view a "fact of nature capable of verification by observation and experiment", while the "period of synthesis" of the 1920s and 1930s had formed a "more unified science",&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt; rivalling physics and enabling the "rebirth of Darwinism".&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=138–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the book was not the research text that it appeared to be. In the view of the philosopher of science [[Michael Ruse]], and in Huxley's own opinion, Huxley was "a generalist, a synthesizer of ideas, rather than a specialist".&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{harvnb|Ruse|1996|pp=328–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse observes that Huxley wrote as if he were adding empirical evidence to the mathematical framework established by Fisher and the population geneticists, but that this was not so. Huxley avoided mathematics, for instance not even mentioning [[Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection]]. Instead, Huxley used a mass of examples to demonstrate that natural selection is powerful, and that it works on Mendelian genes. The book was successful in its goal of persuading readers of the reality of evolution, effectively illustrating topics such as [[island biogeography]], [[speciation]], and competition. Huxley further showed that the appearance of long-term [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic trends]] – predictable directions for evolution – in the fossil record were readily explained as [[allometry|allometric growth]] (since parts are interconnected). All the same, Huxley did not reject orthogenesis out of hand, but maintained a belief in progress all his life, with ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as the end point, and he had since 1912 been influenced by the [[vitalism|vitalist]] philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], though in public he maintained an atheistic position on evolution.&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt; Huxley's belief in progress within evolution and evolutionary humanism was shared in various forms by Dobzhansky, Mayr, Simpson and Stebbins, all of them writing about "the future of Mankind". Both Huxley and Dobzhansky admired the palaeontologist priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], Huxley writing the introduction to Teilhard's 1955 book on orthogenesis, ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]''. This vision required evolution to be seen as the central and guiding principle of biology.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt;

===Mayr's allopatric speciation, 1942===
{{main|Systematics and the Origin of Species|Allopatric speciation}}
[[File:Ernst Mayr PLoS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ernst Mayr]] argued that [[allopatric speciation|geographic isolation]] was needed to provide sufficient [[reproductive isolation]] for [[speciation|new species to form]].]]

[[Ernst Mayr]]'s key contribution to the synthesis was ''[[Systematics and the Origin of Species]]'', published in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It asserted the importance of and set out to explain population variation in evolutionary processes including speciation. He analysed in particular the effects of [[Taxon|polytypic]] species, geographic variation, and isolation by geographic and other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hey, Jody|author2=Fitch, Walter M.|author3=Ayala, Francisco J. |title=Systematics and the origin of species: An introduction |journal=PNAS |date=2005 |volume=102 |issue=supplement 1 |pages=6515–6519 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0501939102 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl_1/6515.full|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.6515H |pmc=1131868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr emphasized the importance of [[allopatric speciation]], where geographically isolated sub-populations diverge so far that [[reproductive isolation]] occurs. He was skeptical of the reality of [[sympatric speciation]] believing that geographical isolation was a prerequisite for building up intrinsic (reproductive) isolating mechanisms. Mayr also introduced the [[Species problem#Biological species concept|biological species concept]] that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|Provine|1998|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mayr|1982}} Before he left [[Germany]] for the United States in 1930, Mayr had been influenced by the work of the German biologist [[Bernhard Rensch]], who in the 1920s had analyzed the geographic distribution of polytypic species, paying particular attention to how variations between populations correlated with factors such as differences in climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rensch|1947}}; {{harvnb|Rensch|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/RENS1900.htm |title=Rensch, Bernhard (Carl Emmanuel) (Germany 1900-1990) |last=Smith |first=Charles H. |authorlink=Charles H.

[[File:Equine evolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[George Gaylord Simpson]] argued against the naive view that [[evolution of the horse|evolution such as of the horse]] took place in a "straight-line". He noted that any chosen line is one path in a complex branching tree, [[natural selection]] having no [[orthogenesis|imposed direction]].]]

===Simpson's palaeontology, 1944===

[[George Gaylord Simpson]] was responsible for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with palaeontology in his 1944 book ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. Simpson's work was crucial because so many palaeontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, with the idea that natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of linear progression (in for example the [[evolution of the horse]]) that earlier palaeontologists had used as support for [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] and orthogenesis did not hold up under careful examination. Instead the [[fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] was consistent with the irregular, branching, and non-directional pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt;

===The Society for the Study of Evolution, 1946===

During the [[World War II|war]], Mayr edited a series of bulletins of the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology, and Systematics, formed in 1943, reporting on discussions of a "synthetic attack" on the interdisciplinary problems of evolution. In 1946, the committee became the Society for the Study of Evolution, with Mayr, Dobzhansky and Sewall Wright the first of the signatories. Mayr became the editor of its journal, ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. From Mayr and Dobzhansky's point of view, suggests the historian of science Betty Smocovitis, Darwinism was reborn, evolutionary biology was legitimised, and genetics and evolution were synthesised into a newly unified science. Everything fitted in to the new framework, except "heretics" like [[Richard Goldschmidt]] who annoyed Mayr and Dobzhansky by insisting on the possibility of [[mutationism|speciation by macromutation]], creating "hopeful monsters". The result was "bitter controversy".&lt;ref name=Smocovitis153&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=153–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stebbins's botany, 1950===

The botanist [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] extended the synthesis to encompass [[botany]]. He described the important effects on [[speciation]] of [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] and [[polyploidy]] in plants in his 1950 book ''[[Variation and Evolution in Plants]]''. These permitted evolution to proceed rapidly at times, polyploidy in particular evidently being able to create new species effectively instantaneously.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smocovitis2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smocovitis | first1=V.

In 1964, [[W. D. Hamilton]] published two papers on "The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour". These defined [[inclusive fitness]] as the number of offspring equivalents an individual rears, rescues or otherwise supports through its behaviour. This was contrasted with personal reproductive fitness, the number of offspring that the individual directly begets. Hamilton, and others such as [[John Maynard Smith]], argued that a gene's success consisted in maximising the number of copies of itself, either by begetting them or by indirectly encouraging begetting by related individuals who shared the gene, the theory of [[kin selection]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maynard Smith |first=John |authorlink=John Maynard Smith |year=1964 |title=Group Selection and Kin Selection |journal=Nature |volume=201 |issue=4924 |pages=1145–1147 |doi=10.1038/2011145a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis]] discovered [[homeotic]] genes, showed that many so-called [[toolkit gene]]s act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed that some of the regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the ''[[Pax6]]'' gene is involved in forming the [[eye]]s of mice and of fruit flies. Such [[deep homology]] provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=S. F. |title=A New Evolutionary Synthesis |work=Developmental Biology |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10128/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later syntheses==

In 1982, a historical note on a series of evolutionary biology books{{efn|In a reissue of Dobzhansky's ''Genetics and the Origin of Species''.}} could state without qualification that evolution is the central organizing principle of biology. Smocovitis commented on this that "What the architects of the synthesis had worked to construct had by 1982 become a matter of fact", adding in a footnote that "the centrality of evolution had thus been rendered [[tacit knowledge]], part of the [[received wisdom]] of the profession".{{sfn|Smocovitis|1996|pp=186–187}}

By the late 20th century, however, the modern synthesis was showing its age, and fresh syntheses to remedy its defects and fill in its gaps were proposed from different directions. These have included such diverse fields as the [[sociology|study of society]],&lt;ref name=YudellDesalle2000/&gt; developmental biology,&lt;ref name=Gilbert1991/&gt; epigenetics,&lt;ref name=pigliucci/&gt; [[molecular biology]], [[microbiology]], [[genomics]],&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; [[symbiogenesis]], and [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name=Noble2011/&gt; The physiologist [[Denis Noble]] argues that these additions render neo-Darwinism in the sense of the early 20th century's modern synthesis "at the least, incomplete as a theory of evolution",&lt;ref name=Noble2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noble |first1=Denis |title=Neo-Darwinism, the Modern Synthesis and selfish genes: are they of use in physiology? |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=589 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=1007–1015 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201384|pmc=3060581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one that has been falsified by later biological research.&lt;ref name=Noble2011/&gt;

Michael Rose and Todd Oakley note that evolutionary biology, formerly divided and "[[Balkanization|Balkanized]]", has been brought together by genomics. It has in their view discarded at least five common assumptions from the modern synthesis, namely that the genome is always a well-organised set of genes; that each gene has a single function; that species are well adapted biochemically to their ecological niches; that species are the durable units of evolution, and  all levels from organism to organ, cell and molecule within the species are characteristic of it; and that the design of every organism and cell is efficient. They argue that the "new biology" integrates genomics, [[bioinformatics]], and evolutionary genetics into a general-purpose toolkit for a "Postmodern Synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Michael R. |authorlink1=Michael R.

===Pigliucci's extended evolutionary synthesis, 2007===
{{main|Extended evolutionary synthesis}}

In 2007, more than half a century after the modern synthesis, [[Massimo Pigliucci]] called for an [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] to incorporate aspects of biology that had not been included or had not existed in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wade | first1=Michael J. | year=2011 | title=The Neo-Modern Synthesis: The Confluence of New Data and Explanatory Concepts | url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/5/407.full | journal=BioScience | volume=61 | issue=5| pages=407–408 | doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smee 2015"&gt;John Odling-Smee ''et al''.

===Koonin's 'post-modern' evolutionary synthesis, 2009===
[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|A 21st century [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] showing [[horizontal gene transfer]]s among [[prokaryote]]s and the saltational [[endosymbiosis]] events that created the [[eukaryote]]s, neither fitting into the 20th century's modern synthesis]]

In 2009, Darwin's 200th anniversary, the ''Origin of Species''{{'}} 150th, and the 200th of Lamarck's "early evolutionary synthesis",&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'', the evolutionary biologist [[Eugene Koonin]] stated that while "the edifice of the [early 20th century] Modern Synthesis has crumbled, apparently, beyond repair",&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; a new 21st century synthesis could be glimpsed. Three interlocking revolutions had, he argued, taken place in evolutionary biology: molecular, microbiological, and genomic. The [[molecular biology|molecular revolution]] included the neutral theory, that most mutations are neutral and that purifying selection happens more often than the positive form, and that all current life evolved from [[Last Universal Common Ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. In microbiology, the synthesis has expanded to cover the [[prokaryote]]s, using [[ribosomal RNA]] to form a [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. Finally, [[genomics]] brought together the molecular and microbiological syntheses, noting that a molecular view shows that the tree of life is problematic.  In particular, [[horizontal gene transfer]] between [[bacteria]] means that prokaryotes freely share genes, challenging Mayr's foundational definition of [[species]]. Further, horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and "momentous events" like [[endosymbiosis]] enable evolution to proceed in sudden jumps, ending the old gradualist-saltationist debate by showing that on this point Darwin's gradualism was wrong. The idea of [[progressionism|progress in biology]], too, is seen to be wrong, along with the modern synthesis belief in [[pan-adaptationism]], that everything is optimally adapted: genomes plainly are not.&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; Many of these points had already been made by other researchers such as Ulrich Kutschera and [[Karl J. Niklas]].&lt;ref name="Kutschera"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich |authorlink1=Ulrich Kutschera |last2=Niklas |first2=Karl J. |authorlink2=Karl J. Niklas |date=June 2004 |title=The modern theory of biological evolution: an expanded synthesis |journal=[[Naturwissenschaften]] |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=255–276 |bibcode=2004NW.....91..255K |doi=10.1007/s00114-004-0515-y |pmid=15241603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towards a replacement synthesis===
[[File:Modern Synthesis Limits.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|Inputs to the modern synthesis, with other topics (inverted colours) such as developmental biology that were not joined with evolutionary biology until the turn of the 21st century]]

Biologists, alongside scholars of the history and philosophy of biology, have continued to debate the need for, and possible nature of, a replacement synthesis. For example, in 2017 Philippe Huneman and Denis M. Walsh stated in their book ''Challenging the Modern Synthesis'' that numerous theorists had pointed out that the disciplines of embryological developmental theory, morphology, and ecology had been omitted. They noted that all such arguments amounted to a continuing desire to replace the modern synthesis with one that united "all biological fields of research related to evolution, adaptation, and diversity in a single theoretical frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huneman |first1=Philippe |last2=Walsh |first2=Denis M. |title=Challenging the Modern Synthesis: Adaptation, Development, and Inheritance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72EwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76 |year=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-068145-6 |pages=76 (Chapter 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observed further that there are two groups of challenges to the way the modern synthesis viewed inheritance. The first is that other modes such as [[epigenetic inheritance]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], the [[Baldwin effect]], and the [[maternal effect]] allow new characteristics to arise and be passed on, and for the genes to catch up with the new adaptations later. The second is that all such mechanisms are part, not of an inheritance system, but a [[Developmental systems theory|developmental system]]: the fundamental unit is not a discrete selfishly competing gene, but a collaborating system that works at all levels from genes and cells to organisms and cultures to guide evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huneman |first1=Philippe |last2=Walsh |first2=Denis M. |title=Challenging the Modern Synthesis: Adaptation, Development, and Inheritance  |year=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-068145-6 |pages=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==

Looking back at the conflicting accounts of the modern synthesis, the historian Betty Smocovitis notes in her 1996 book ''Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology'' that both historians and philosophers of biology have attempted to grasp its scientific meaning, but have found it "a moving target";&lt;ref name=Smocovitis187&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only thing they agreed on was that it was a historical event.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis187/&gt; In her words "by the late 1980s the notoriety of the evolutionary synthesis was recognized . . . So notorious did 'the synthesis' become, that few serious historically minded analysts would touch the subject, let alone know where to begin to sort through the interpretive mess left behind by the numerous critics and commentators".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[experimental physics]], researchers have proposed '''Non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamic theory''' to describe phenomena observed in the [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]].  This theory investigates a [[Fireball concept|fireball]] for [[high-energy particle]] collisions, while using [[Tsallis entropy|Tsallis non-extensive thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; Fireballs lead to the bootstrap idea, or [[self-consistency principle]], just as in the [[Boltzmann statistics]] used by [[Rolf Hagedorn]].&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; Assuming the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] gets variations, due to possible symmetrical change, [[Abdel Nasser Tawfik]] applied the non-extensive concepts of high-energy particle production.&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt;&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt;

The motivation to use the non-extensive statistics from Tsallis&lt;ref&gt;C. Tsallis, J Stat Phys 52, 479-487, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the results obtained by Bediaga et al&lt;ref&gt;I. Bediaga, E.M.F. Curado and J.M. de Miranda, Physica A 286 (2000) 156.&lt;/ref&gt;. They showed that with the substitution of the Boltzmann factor in Hagedorn's theory by the q-exponential function, it was possible to recover good agreement between calculation and experiment, even at energies as high as those achieved at the [[LHC]], with q&gt;1.

==Non-extensive entropy for ideal quantum gas==
The starting point of the theory is [[entropy]] for a non-extensive quantum gas of [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], as proposed by Conroy, Miller and Plastino,&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; which is given by &lt;math&gt;S_q=S_q^{FD}+S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_q^{FD}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Fermi–Dirac entropy and &lt;math&gt;S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Bose–Einstein entropy.

That group&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; and also Clemens and Worku,&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt; the entropy just defined leads to occupation number formulas that reduce to Bediaga's. C. Beck,&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt; shows the power-like tails present in the distributions found in [[high energy physics]] experiments.

== Non-extensive partition function for ideal quantum gas ==
Using the entropy defined above, the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] results are
:&lt;math&gt; \ln[1+Z_q(V_o,T)]=\frac{V_o}{2\pi^2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\int_0^{\infty}dm \int_0^{\infty}dp \, p^2 \rho(n;m)[1+(q-1)\beta \sqrt{p^2+m^2}]^{-\frac{nq}{(q-1)}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since experiments have shown that &lt;math&gt;q&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, this restriction is adopted.

Another way to write the non-extensive partition function for a fireball is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T)=\int_0^{\infty}\sigma(E)[1+(q-1)\beta E]^{-\frac{q}{(q-1)}} dE\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the density of states of the fireballs.

==Self-consistency principle==
Self-consistency implies that both forms of partition functions must be asymptotically equivalent and that the [[mass spectrum]] and the [[density of states]] must be related to each other by
:&lt;math&gt; log[\rho(m)]= log[\sigma(E)] &lt;/math&gt;,
in the limit of &lt;math&gt;m,E&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large.

The self-consistency can be asymptotically achieved by choosing&lt;ref name=depp1&gt;A. Deppman, Physica A 391 (2012) 6380.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m^{3/2} \rho(m)=\frac{\gamma}{m}\big[1+(q_o-1) \beta _o m\big]^{\frac{1}{q_o -1}}=\frac{\gamma}{m}[1+(q'_o-1)  m]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)=bE^a\big[1+(q'_o-1)E\big]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;q'_o-1=\beta _o (q_o-1)&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;a,b,\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants. For &lt;math&gt;q' \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; the two expressions above approach the corresponding expressions in Hagedorn's theory.

==Main results==
With the mass spectrum and density of states given above, the asymptotic form of the partition function is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T) \rightarrow \bigg(\frac{1}{\beta - \beta _o }\bigg)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; a+1=\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One immediate consequence of the expression for the partition function is the existence of a limiting temperature &lt;math&gt;T_o=1/\beta _o&lt;/math&gt;. This result is equivalent to Hagedorn's result.&lt;ref  name=hage&gt;R. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147.&lt;/ref&gt; With these results, it is expected that at sufficiently high energy, the fireball presents a constant temperature and constant entropic factor.

{{Precedence}}
'''Order of precedence''' is a sequential hierarchy of nominal importance of persons. Most often it is used in the context of people by many organizations and governments, for very formal and state occasions, especially where [[diplomat]]s are present. It can also be used in the context of decorations, medals and awards. Historically, the order of precedence had a more widespread use, especially in [[Royal court|court]] and aristocratic life.

A person's position in an order of [[:wikt:precedence|precedence]] is not necessarily an indication of functional importance, but rather an indication of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or historical relevance; for instance, it may dictate where dignitaries are seated at formal dinners.  The term is occasionally used to mean the [[order of succession]]—to determine who replaces the [[head of state]] in the event he or she is removed from office or incapacitated—as they are often identical, at least near the top.

What follows are the general orders of precedence for different countries for state purposes, such as diplomatic dinners, and are made under the assumption that such functions are held in the capital. When they are held in another city or region, local officials such as governors would be much higher up the order.  There may also be more specific and local orders of precedence, for particular occasions or within particular institutions.  [[University|Universities]] and the [[Profession|professions]] often have their own rules of precedence applying locally, based (for example) on university or professional rank, each rank then being ordered within itself on the basis of seniority (i.e. date of attaining that rank). Within an institution the officials of that institution are likely to rank much higher in the order than in a general order of precedence—the chancellor or president of a university may well precede anyone except a head of state for example. The same might be true for a mayor in his or her own city.

[[File:Overton Window diagram.svg |thumb|right|An illustration of the Overton Window, along with Treviño's degrees of acceptance]]
The '''Overton window''', also known as the '''window of discourse''', describes the range of ideas tolerated in [[public sphere|public discourse]]. The term is derived from its originator, [[Joseph P. Overton]], a former vice president of the [[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]], who, in his description of his window, claimed that an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within the window, rather than on politicians' individual preferences.&lt;ref name="mackinac2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/bio.aspx?ID=12 |title=Joseph Overton biography and article index |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mackinac1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/12887 |title=A Brief Explanation of the Overton Window |last=Lehman |first=Joseph  |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Overton's description, his window includes a range of policies considered politically acceptable in the current climate of [[public opinion]], which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme to gain or keep public office.

==Summary==
Overton described a spectrum from "more free" to "less free" with regard to government intervention, oriented vertically on an axis, to avoid comparison with the left-right political spectrum.&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/11398 |title=Glenn Beck Highlights Mackinac Center's "Overton Window" |last=Lehman |first=Joseph G. |date=November 23, 2009 |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the spectrum moves or expands, an idea at a given location may become more or less politically acceptable. Political commentator [[Joshua Treviño]] postulated that the degrees of acceptance of public ideas are roughly:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/5/9/205251/2950 |title=Why the Right-Wing Gets It--and Why Dems Don't [UPDATED] |last=thereisnospoon |date=May 10, 2006 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unthinkable
* Radical
* Acceptable
* Sensible
* Popular
* Policy

The Overton window is an approach to identifying which ideas define the domain of acceptability within a democracy's possible governmental policies. Proponents of policies outside the window seek to convince or persuade the public in order to move and/or expand the window. Proponents of current policies, or similar ones, within the window seek to convince people that policies outside it should be deemed unacceptable.

After Overton's death, others have examined the concept of adjusting the window by the deliberate promotion of ideas outside of it, or "outer fringe" ideas, with the intention of making less fringe ideas acceptable by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2009/11/5/800804/-Morning-Feature:-Crazy-Like-a-Fox |title=Morning Feature: Crazy Like a Fox? |last=NCrissieB |date=November 5, 2009 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[door-in-the-face technique|"door-in-the-face" technique]] of persuasion is similar.

==Historical precedents==
{{original research|section|date=March 2017}}
The idea echoes several earlier expressions, the most recent and similarly academic being [[Hallin's spheres]]. In his 1986 book ''The Uncensored War'',&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Uncensored War: The Media and Vietnam.|last=Hallin|first=Daniel|publisher=Oxford University press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-19-503814-9|location=New York|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; communication scholar Daniel C. Hallin posits three areas of media coverage into which a topic may fall. The areas are diagrammed as concentric circles called spheres. From innermost to outermost they are the sphere of consensus, the sphere of legitimate controversy, and the sphere of deviance. Proposals and positions can be placed at varying degrees of distance from the metaphorical center, and political actors can fight over and help change these positions.

Hallin's theory is developed and applied primarily as a theory that explains varying levels of objectivity in media coverage, but it also accounts for the ongoing contest among media and other political actors about what counts as legitimate disagreement, potentially leading to changes in the boundaries between spheres. As one study that applies Hallin's theory explains, "the borders between the three spheres are dynamic, depending on the political climate and on the editorial line of the various media outlets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Figenschou |first=Tine Ustad |last2=Beyer |first2=Audun |date=October 2014 |title=The Limits of the Debate How the Oslo Terror Shook the Norwegian Immigration Debate |url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/19/4/430.short |journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics |volume=19 |issue=4 |page=435 |doi=10.1177/1940161214542954}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the idea also captures the tug-of-war over the boundaries between normal and deviant political discourse.

An idea similar to the Overton window was expressed by [[Anthony Trollope]] in 1868 in his novel ''[[Phineas Finn]]'':

{{quote|"Many who before regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical, will now fancy that it is only dangerous, or perhaps not more than difficult. And so in time it will come to be looked on as among the things possible, then among the things probable;—and so at last it will be ranged in the list of those few measures which the country requires as being absolutely needed. That is the way in which public opinion is made."

"It is no loss of time," said Phineas, "to have taken the first great step in making it."

"The first great step was taken long ago," said Mr. Monk,—"taken by men who were looked upon as revolutionary demagogues, almost as traitors, because they took it. But it is a great thing to take any step that leads us onwards."}}

In his "West India Emancipation" speech at Canandaigua, New York, in 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/1857-frederick-douglass-if-there-no-struggle-there-no-progress |title=(1857) Frederick Douglass, "If There Is No Struggle, There Is No Progress" |website=The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |language=en |access-date=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] leader [[Frederick Douglass]] described how public opinion limits the ability of those in power to act with impunity:

{{quote|Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.}}

{{Hazara people}}
The '''persecution of Hazara people''' refers to the discrimination of the [[Hazaras]], who are primarily from the central highland region of [[Hazarajat]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Significant populations of the Hazara people are also found in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Mashad]], [[Iran]] as part of the [[Hazara diaspora|Hazara]] and [[Afghan diaspora]]s. The [[persecution]] of Hazara people dates back to the 16th century, with [[Babur]] from [[Kabulistan]].&lt;ref name="Leyden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&amp;ct=92 |title=Events Of The Year 910 (1525) |page=5 |editor=John Leyden |editor2=William Erskine |work=[[Baburnama|Memoirs of Babur]] |publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]] |year=1921 |authorlink=Babur |accessdate=2012-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114042010/http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&amp;ct=92# |archive-date=November 14, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massacre and displacement of Hazaras in 1888 to 93|It is reported that]] during the reign of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Emir Abdur Rahman]] (1880–1901), thousands of Hazaras were killed, expelled and enslaved.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-2|title=HAZĀRA ii.

The Hazara people have also been the victims of massacres committed by the [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]]. {{as of|2014|df=US}}, conditions have not improved for the Hazaras in Afghanistan and thousands continue to be persecuted in neighboring Pakistan by [[Sunni]] extremist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thacker|first1=Purvi|title=Pakistan's Hazara: 'It's like living in jail'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/humanrights/2014/12/pakistan-hazara-it-like-living-jail-2014123114655754509.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=Al Jazeera|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afghanistan==
{{see also|1888-1893 Uprisings of Hazaras|Kuchi–Hazara conflict}}
Hazaras are historically the most restrained ethnic minority group in the state and have witnessed slight improvements in the circumstances even with the setup of modern Afghanistan. The discrimination against this ethnic group has continued for centuries, instigated by Pashtuns and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Hazara_People|title=Hazara People|publisher=National Geographic - GeoPedia|year=2008|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], a contemporary Hazara writer, estimates that more than half of the entire population of Hazarajat was driven out of their villages, including many who were massacred. "It is difficult to verify such an estimate, but the memory of the conquest of the Hazārajāt by ʿAbd-al-Raḥmān Khan certainly remains vivid among the Hazāras themselves, and has heavily influenced their relations with the Afghan state throughout the 20th century."&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; 
The British from neighboring British India, who were heavily involved in Afghanistan, did not document such a large figure. Others claim that Hazaras began leaving their hometown of Hazarajat due to poverty and in search of employment mostly in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="hazara-1"&gt;{{cite web |work=Arash Khazeni, Alessandro Monsutti, Charles M. Kieffer |publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica |title=HAZĀRA |url=http://iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-1 |date=December 15, 2003 |location=United States |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these Hazaras immigrated to neighbouring [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], where they were provided permanent settlement by the government of British India.&lt;ref name="Who are the Hazara"/&gt; Others settled in and around [[Mashad]], in the [[Khorasan Province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="hazara-1"/&gt;

The Hazaras of Afghanistan faced severe political, social and economic tyranny and denial of basic civil rights.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In the late 19th century, the Hazaras along with their Shia counterpart [[Qizilbash]] sided with the invading [[British Raj|British-led Indians]] against the Sunni [[Ethnic groups of Afghanistan]]. In 1933, [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq Hazara]], a Hazara student assassinated Afghan King [[Mohammed Nadir Shah|Nadir Khan]].

=== Persecution and marginalization ===

Notably, after the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], Shah Abdur conducted a campaign of repression in Hazarajat, but it was met with fierce opposition by Hazara tribal leaders. The first uprising was conducted in correlation with Shah Adbur's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq who sought to overthrow the Shah. This revolt of Hazara nationalists and anti-Shah partisans was brief, because Shah Adbur astutely used sectarian strife to divide the Hazara Shias and the Sunni partisans, thus allowing him to easily defeat his foes.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dtsjournal.com/2016/04/01/the-mongol-hazaras-in-afghanistan/ |title=The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan |publisher= University of Toronto Journal of Diaspora and Transnationalism |date= April 1, 2016|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Hazaras in their first revolt allowed Shah Adbur to impose taxes on Hazarajat for the first time, and they severely impeded the autonomy of Hazarajat, because numerous Pashtun soldiers and government officials were garrisoned in Hazarajat in order to ensure its compliance with the Pashtun-run state. Subsequently, the Pashtuns garrisoned in Hazarajat, treated the local Hazaras inferiorly and often committed arbitrary acts of cruelty and brutality against them. This caused great unrest and a deepening hatred between the Hazaras and their Pashtun rulers, causing the Hazaras to reach their tipping point in 1892. When a local Pashtun garrison searched the home of a Hazara chieftain for arms, but the pretext was false, the garrison subsequently tied the chieftain up and made him watch while they raped his wife.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt;

The outrage that followed allowed the Hazaras to unite once again in order to overthrow most of the local Pashtun garrisons in Hazarajat. This newfound zealous fever fermented fierce resistance against Shah Adbur and his forces. Witnessing the rising tide, Shah Adbur felt he had no choice but to wage a [[jihad]] against the Shia Hazaras, and under this [[casus belli]] Shah Adbur was able to muster around 150,000 troops.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; The resulting conflict was brutal and led to a great loss of life on both sides. The Hazaras fought with vigour but the attrition they faced due to lack of rations, led to their demise at the uprising's epicenter of Oruzgan.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; The aftermath of the uprising was a genocide at the hands of Shah Adbur, who wiped out more than half of the entire Hazara population, and caused a myriad of people to be driven out of their villages.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; Prior to the genocide, Hazaras made up more than half of Afghanistan's total population. Although once the largest ethnicity, they were now a minority, constituting roughly 9% of Afghanistan's total population.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; Accordingly, in order to stifle Hazara influence Shah Adbur fragmented Hazarajat and demarcated it so that it would encompass numerous other provinces, where the Hazara are now a minority.

=== Afshar ===
{{main|Afshar Operation}}

In February 1993, a two-day military operation was conducted by the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] government and the Saudi-backed Sunni [[Wahhabi]] [[Ittihad-i Islami]] militia led by [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]. At that time Ittihad-i Islami was allied with the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. The military operation was conducted in order to seize control of the Afshar district in west Kabul where the Shia [[Hezb-e Wahdat]] militia (which was allied to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s Sunni [[Hezb-i Islami]] and backed by Pakistan) was based and from where it was shelling civilian areas in northern Kabul. The operation also intended to capture Wahdat leader Abdul Ali Mazari. The Afshar district, situated on the slopes of Mount Afshar west of Kabul, is a densely populated district. The area is predominantly inhabited by Shia [[Hazara people]]. The Afshar military operation escalated into what became known as the Afshar massacre when the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] backed [[Wahhabi]] militia of [[Ittehad-al-Islami|Ittihad-e-Islami]] went on a rampage through Afshar, killing, raping, looting and burning houses. Two out of nine Islamic State sub-commanders, Anwar Dangar (later joined the [[Taliban]]) and Mullah Izzat, were also reported as leading troops that carried out abuses. The Islamic State government in collaboration with the then enemy militia of Hezb-e Wahdat as well as in cooperation with Afshar civilians established a commission to investigate the crimes that had taken place in Afshar. The commission found that around 70 people died during the street fighting and between 700 and 750 people were abducted and never returned by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's men. These abducted victims were most likely killed or died in captivity.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = http://hrw.org/reports/2005/afghanistan0605/5.htm#_Toc105552365|title = Ittihad |publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate = 2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_2001"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 2, 2001 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/1682466.stm|title = A personal account|publisher = BBC News | last= Phil Rees | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of women were abducted during the operation as well.&lt;ref name="Book_Anderson"&gt;{{cite book | last = John Lee Anderson | authorlink = | title = The Lion's Grave |year=2002|page= 224 | publisher = Atlantic Books| isbn= 1-84354-118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mazar-i-Sharif ===

Following the 1997 massacre of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1615824.stm#pahlawan |title=Afghan powerbrokers: Who's who |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date= November 19, 2001|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; thousands of Hazara men and boys were massacred by other Taliban members in the same city in August 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human rights]] organizations reported that the dead were lying on the streets for weeks before the Taliban allowed their burial due to stench and fear of epidemics.

=== Robatak Pass ===

The pass connecting the settlements of [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Tashkurgan]] and [[Puli Khumri|Pule Khumri]] is known as Robatak Pass. A mass murder was carried out there by Taliban in May 2000 in which 31 people were reported dead. Twenty-six of the victims were [[Ismaïlia|Ismaili]] Hazara from Baghalan province. Their remains were found to the northeast of the pass, in a neighborhood known as Hazara Mazari, on the border between Baghlan and Samngan provinces. The victims were detained four months before their execution by Taliban troops between January 5 and January 14, 2000.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch Robatak Pass"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/afghan101-04.htm#P176_25561|title = Massacre at Robatak Pass, May 2000|publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]| accessdate = 2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington File"/&gt;

=== Yakawlang ===

In January 2001 the Taliban committed a mass execution of Hazara people in [[Yakawlang District]] of [[Bamyan province]], Afghanistan. This started on January 8 and lasted for four days; it took the lives of 170 men. Taliban apprehended about 300 people, including employees of local humanitarian organizations. They were grouped to various assemblage points where they were shot dead in public view. Around 73 women, children and elderly were taking shelter in a local mosque when Taliban fired rockets at the mosque.&lt;ref name="Washington File"&gt;{{cite web |year=2001 |url = http://usinfo.org/wf-archive/2001/011017/epf312.htm|title = Fact Sheet: The Taliban's Betrayal of the Afghan People|publisher = Office of International Information Programs| accessdate = 2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch Yakawlang"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/afghan101-03.htm#P126_15001|title = Massacre in yakaolang|publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]| accessdate = 2012-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Khas Urozgan ===

In June 2010, at least nine Hazara men were killed in an ambush in [[Khas Urozgan District]]. The Taliban took responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Alissa J.

=== Zabul ===

In November 2015, Afghan militants claiming loyalty to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] beheaded seven ethnic Hazara civilians who had been abducted in the southern Afghan province of [[Zabul]]. Their throats were cut with metal wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Afghan Fighters Loyal to ISIS Beheaded 7 Hostages, Officials Say |author=Mujib Mashal |author2=Taimoor Shahnov |date=November 10, 2015 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/world/asia/afghan-fighters-loyal-to-isis-beheaded-7-hostages-officials-say.html |page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims were four men, two women, and a 9-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The beheading of a 9-year-old girl prompted huge protests in Afghanistan |author=Ishaan Tharoor |date=November 12, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/12/the-beheading-of-a-9-year-old-girl-prompted-huge-protests-in-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dehmazang bombings===
{{main|July 2016 Kabul bombing}}

On July 23, 2016 two [[ISIL|Islamic State]] suicide bombers blow themselves during the peaceful protest 'Junbish Roshnaye' in [[Kabul]] killing 160 and wounded over 200 people.&lt;ref name="bbckabul"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36874570 | title=Kabul explosion: Islamic State 'admits attack on Hazara protest' | publisher=BBC Asia | date=23 July 2016 | accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers were reportedly from the local affiliate of the so-called Islamic State, known as the "Khurasan Province" (IS-Khurasan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rafiq|first1=Arif|title=The Persecution of Afghanistan's Hazaras Has Less to Do with Religion Than You Think|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-persecution-afghanistans-hazaras-has-less-do-religion-17174|website=nationalinterest.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashura attacks===
18 people were killed and 54 were injured in July 2016 at Kabul's landmark Sakhi Shrine by a gunman wearing an Afghan National Security Forces uniform. The attack took place on the eve of Ashura, the Shia mourning day. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Islamic State, or ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shuja|first1=Ahmad|title=Afghanistan's Shia Hazara Suffer Latest Atrocity|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/13/afghanistans-shia-hazara-suffer-latest-atrocity|website=hrw.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The next morning, an improvised electronic device(IED) killed at least 15 Hazara people in the Balkh province of northern Afghanistan. ISIS claimed responsibility for this attack as well. These attacks show the growing threat of the IS to the Hazara people.

===Post-Taliban era===
There has been a significant improvement in the status and treatment of Hazaras in Afghanistan. The new Afghan constitution now recognizes them as one of the country's ethnic minorities, and they now have the full right to Afghan citizenship. In Afghanistan's recent parliamentary election, Hazaras won around 25 per cent of the seats.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan Hazaras"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghanistan Hazaras|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/hazaras/|website=minorityrights.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazara have also pursued higher education, enrolled in the army, and many have top government positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sappenfield|first1=Mark|title=Afghanistan's success story: The liberated Hazara minority|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0806/p06s02-wosc.html?page=2|website=csmonitor.com|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara from the Hizb-i-Wahdat party, ran in the 2004 presidential election in Afghanistan, and Karim Khalili became the Vice President of Afghanistan. Since ousting the Taliban in late 2001, billions of dollars have been poured into Afghanistan for several large-scale reconstruction projects that took place from August 2012. For example, there have been more than 5000 kilometers of road pavement completed across Afghanistan, of which little was done in central Afghanistan Hazarajat. On the other hand, the Band-e Amir in the Bamyan Province became the first national park of Afghanistan. The road from Kabul to Bamyan was also built, along with new police stations, government institutions, hospitals, and schools in the Bamyan Province, Daykundi Province, and others. The first ski resort of Afghanistan was also established in the Bamyan Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levinson|first1=Charles|title=Since Skiing Came to Afghanistan, It Has Been Pretty Much All Downhill|url=wsj.com|website=wsj.com|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still a large degree of discrimination against Hazaras, however. A new danger in the form of ISIS has become especially prominent in recent years, and they have carried out abductions, extortions and violent killings against Hazaras.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hucal|first1=Sarah|title=Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/afghanistan-hazaras-160623093601127.html|website=aljazeera.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising power of warlords, who the Hazara people perceive as a direct threat, has also been a matter of concern. There have been ethnic tensions and violent clashes with nomadic Kuchis over land access issues.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan Hazaras"/&gt; Taliban fighters continue to abduct and execute Hazaras travelling in vehicles. Furthermore, anti-Hazara sentiments became stronger when the former director of the National Directorate of Security, Amrullah Saleh, accused Iran of interfering in Afghan affairs through Shias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali Seerat|first1=Rustam|title=Peril and Persecution in Afghanistan|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/27/peril-and-persecution-in-afghanistan/|website=foreignpolicy.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazara activists still believe that the government does not serve their people's security needs sufficiently. Parts of central Afghanistan, like the unofficial Hazara capital Bamiyan, are among the country's poorest and often lack even basic necessities like water and electricity.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras"/&gt; Hazara people held a protest in March 2016 against the government's decision to move a proposed power line project out of Bamiyan, seeing it as another form of ethnic discrimination.

==Pakistan==
The history of Hazara people in Pakistan dates back to the 1840s, when Hazara tribesmen from [[Hazarajat]] began migration to colonial India because of persecution by Pashtuns and Tajiks. Many Hazaras were enlisted in the British Indian Army during the first Anglo-Afghan War (1838-1840). The mass-migration and permanent settlements started in the 1890s when Emir Abdul Rahman Khan started persecuting the Hazaras of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://minoritysupportpakistan.com/The_Hazara_Shia_of_PakistanvApril_16_edited.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Hazara are [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] Muslims with a sizable [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] minority. Pakistan is home to an estimated 20% Shia Muslim population. Sectarian violence in Pakistan started in 1980s.

===Quetta===
{{further|Persecution of Hazaras in Quetta}}
In 2011 the persecution of Hazaras in Quetta has left at least 1300 dead and more than 1500 wounded. The victims include high-profile community members, laborers, women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=37032&amp;CID=1 |title=International commission demanded to probe Hazara killings |publisher=Samaa Tv |date=2011-10-01 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029183755/http://samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=37032&amp;CID=1 |archivedate=October 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One third of the victims are children.

As a consequence of the attacks there has been a recent exodus of Hazaras trying to flee the violence.

==In fiction==
The main character in [[Khaled Hosseini]]'s novel ''[[The Kite Runner]]'' is Amir, a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] boy who has a Hazara friend, Hassan, in 1970s Afghanistan. They are bullied by an older Pashtun who expresses scorn for the Hazara people and rapes Hassan.

In the book ''In The Sea There Are Crocodiles'', Eniatollah Akbari, a Hazara boy, details his journey to escape persecution in Afghanistan.

'''Pragña''' or Pragya ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रज्ञ) as प्रज्ञा, प्राज्ञ and प्राज्ञा is used to refer to the highest and purest form of wisdom, intelligence and understanding. Pragya is the state of wisdom which is higher than the knowledge obtained by reasoning and inference.

==Meaning==

The Sanskrit word प्रज्ञ (''Pragña'') is the combination of "प्र (''pra-'')" which prefix means – before, forward, fulfiller, and used as the intensifier but rarely as a separate word &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary 1899 Ed.|author=Monier-Williams|publisher=Sanskrit-Lexicon|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0652-paulastya.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "ज्ञ (''jna'')" which means - knowing or familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary 1899 Ed.|author=Monier-Williams|publisher=Sanskrit-Lexicon|url= http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0425-jehila.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; प्रज्ञ (''Prajña''), meaning - wise, prudent, knowing, conversant with, is the root of  प्राज्ञ (''Prājña'') meaning – wise, learned man, intellectual, clever, intelligence dependent on individuality; प्रज्ञा (''Prajñā'') meaning – intelligence, judgement, mental attitude, particular ''shakti'' or energy, insight, mental disposition, true or transcendental wisdom, awareness, mentality, understanding, discrimination, knowledge; and प्राज्ञा (''Prājñā'') meaning – understanding, intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+prajna&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of deep sleep, the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], limited by [[Prana]], the vital breath, is called ''Prājña''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Principal Upanishads|author=Swami Nikhilananda|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=225|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BQxXk7pAx0cC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=Prajna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zCkdU4KNFoetrAeF34DQBg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Prajna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dayananda Saraswati]], translating and commenting on the [[Rig Veda]], draws attention to a sage of the [[Rig Veda]] who tells us –

:पिशङ्गरूपः सुभरो वयोधाः श्रुष्टीवीरो आयते देवकामः |
:प्रजां त्वष्टा वि ष्यतु नाभिमस्मे अथा देवानाम प्येतु पाथः  ||२.३.९ ||

And, to [[Vishwamitra]] who tells us -

:यदद्य त्वा प्रयति यज्ञे अस्मिन् होतिश्च्कितवोऽवृणीमहीह |
:ध्रुवमया ध्रुवमुताशमिष्ठाः प्रजानन् विद्वान् उप याहि सोमम् ||३.२९.१६ ||

==Upanishadic reference==

The third chapter of the [[Aitareya Upanishad]] teaches  – तत्प्रज्ञानेत्रम् प्रज्ञाने प्रतिष्ठितं प्रज्ञानेत्रो लोकः प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म (III.i.3) that all that exist, all phenomena cosmic and psychical, are rooted in ''Prajñā'' i.e. Consciousness, and Consciousness is Brahman, in which regard [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his commentary states that Brahman gets the respective names and forms as conditioned by the divergent bodies; it is the same entity that has become diversified under all the conditions and is known in every way and is thought of multifariously by all creatures as well as logicians. And, in the [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]] III.iii.4, [[Indra]] describes 'Death' as complete absorption in [[Prana]] when ''Prānā'' and ''Prajñā'' ('consciousness' or 'self'), which together live in the body and together depart, become one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mystical Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=S.C.Sen|publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=28,313|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnhNZQJ07DYC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Prajna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RSwdU6mgFMqlrQf1sICQAw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Prajna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main theme of [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]] is that without ''Prajñā'' the senses do not work, which is knowledge, for by knowledge one sees clearly; ''Prajñā'' is [[Brahman]] and all things are rooted in Brahman. ''Prānā'' is ''Prajñā'', self-consciousness. It is ''Prajñā'' that takes possession of Speech, and by speech one obtains words; takes possession of the nose, and one obtains odours; takes possession of the eye, and one obtains all forms; takes possession of the ear, and one obtains all sounds; takes possession of the tongue, and one obtains all tastes of food; takes possession of the hands, and one obtains all actions; takes possession of the body, and one obtains pleasure and pain; takes possession of the organ, one obtains happiness, joy and offspring; takes possession of the feet, one obtains all movements and takes possession of mind, and one obtains all thoughts, without ''Prajñā'', no thoughts succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Golden Book of Upanishads|author=Mahendra Kulasreshta|publisher=Lotus Press|pages=104, 107, 117, 119, 120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoMCFSqGnAQC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Prajna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zCkdU4KNFoetrAeF34DQBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Prajna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)|Vedantasara]] tells us that Brahman is to be thought of as being [[Nirguna Brahman|Nirguna]], without attributes; Brahman is the sole reality, everything else is [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]], non-existence and non-knowledge. [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Ignorance]] is two-fold; Brahman in relation of totality of ignorance as [[Ishvara]] has all the attributes of the creator and the ruler of the world but in relation to special ignorance is the individual soul, the defective intelligence, ''Prājña'' (प्राज्ञ) – अस्य प्राज्ञात्वमस्पष्टोपाधितयानतिप्रकाशकत्वात् ||४४||.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bibliotheca Indica Vol.XV|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal 1858 Ed.|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ff0IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=Prajna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zCkdU4KNFoetrAeF34DQBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Prajna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence in its invisible form refers to Brahman – आनन्दभुक् चेतोमुखः प्राज्ञः ("Prājña, the enjoyer of bliss, with Consciousness for its aid" ([[Mandukya Upanishad]] 5)), the all-knowing reality, in its visible form it is the parviscient [[Jiva]] which is able to differentiate itself from Ishvara – सता सोम्य तदा सम्पन्नो भवति ("Then (in dreamless sleep), my dear, he (Jiva) becomes one with Existence (Ishvara) " ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VI.viii.1)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Metaphysics of the Upanishads|publisher=Gensis Publishing|pages=65,|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Eu9uf3qP98C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=Prajna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zCkdU4KNFoetrAeF34DQBg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Prajna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaudapada]], in his Karika on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], refers to the three states of consciousness, to the one Atman perceived threefold in the same body and the threefold satisfaction; he refers to [[Vaisvanara]] – जागरितस्थानो बहिष्प्रज्ञः whose sphere of action is the waking state, to [[Taijasa]] – स्वप्नास्थानोऽन्तःप्रज्ञः whose sphere is the dream state, and to ''Prājna'' (प्राज्ञ), whose sphere in the form of cause only is deep sleep bereft of dreams, as a mass of consciousness, as the [[Akasha]] in the heart and as the blissful one. He states that 'Dream' is the wrong apprehension of reality, 'Sleep' is the state in which one does not know what reality is; when the false experience in these two states disappears [[Turiya]] is realized (Gaudapada Karika I.vii.15). And, [[Yajnavalkya]] in [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] advises that the intelligent seeker of Brahman, learning about the Self alone, should practice wisdom (''prajñā'') and not think of too many words, for that is exhausting to the organ of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|publisher=Islamic Books|pages=67–70,172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LxQb_fszEC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Prajna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hSsdU_OyHsmXrAe5lYHoDg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Prajna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swami Gambhirananda]] explains that the state where the sleeper does not desire any enjoyable thing and does not see any dream is deep sleep, and Prājna is the doorway to the experience of the dream and waking states. ''Prājña'' is the Self as the universal person in deep sleep. Yajnavlkya tells Janaka that ''Chidaksha'', the Self of the nature of Consciousness, is consciousness behind intelligent sound and the source of [[Shabda Brahman]] whose primary form is [[Om|Aum]] which word is to be meditated upon as ''Prajñā'' ('Knowledge'), the inmost consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=151,153,207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FNzTC6Nmy6gC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=Prajna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0isdU_bXLpDJrQeX5oHwCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Prajna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] cover the intellectual plane from the average level of awareness to the enlarged dimension of super consciousness. According to [[Patanjali]], [[Samadhi]] is the last aspect of the eight-fold path which leads to realisation of [[Yoga]] which unites the mortal with the immortal and ''Prajñā'' is the state of perfection, the one, total indivisible entity. The perfect ''[[yogi]]'' on attaining this Supreme state becomes a total non-entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prajna Yoga|author=Hareesh Raja|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nSaWO-LwswC&amp;pg=RA7-PA68-IA1&amp;dq=Prajna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fy0dU6CwC4GJrAfr84HACQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Prajna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali states – तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः that the word which express Him is Om but mere repletion of Om is insufficient, for one should also meditate upon its meaning for gaining knowledge of the Atman and destruction of the obstacles to that knowledge on road to reaching ''Nirvichara Samadhi'' when the mind becomes pure and  – ऋतम्भरा तत्र प्रज्ञा in that ''Samadhi'', knowledge is said to be filled with truth which knowledge goes beyond inference and scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga-sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=32, 54|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/patanjali-yoga-sutras/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Predestination''', in theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by [[God]], usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/predestination "Predestination", '' The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005. 13 Jun 2011 at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations of predestination often seek to address the "[[Argument from free will|paradox of free will]]", whereby God's [[omniscience]] seems incompatible with human [[Free will in theology|free will]]. In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious [[determinism]]; and usually [[predeterminism]].

==Christianity==

===History===

====New Testament period====
There is some disagreement among scholars regarding the views on predestination of [[Second Temple period|first-century AD Judaism]], out of which Christianity came. [[Josephus]] wrote during the first century that the three main Jewish sects differed on this question. He argued that the [[Essenes]] and [[Pharisees]] argued that God's providence orders all human events, but the Pharisees still maintained that people are able to choose between right and wrong. He wrote that the [[Sadducees]] did not have a doctrine of providence.
 
The biblical scholar [[N. T. Wright]] argues that Josephus's portrayal of these groups is incorrect, and that the Jewish debates referenced by Josephus should be seen as having to do with God's work to liberate Israel rather than philosophical questions about predestination. Wright asserts that Essenes were content to wait for God to liberate Israel while Pharisees believed Jews needed to act in cooperation with God.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=15}} [[John Barclay (theologian)|John Barclay]] responded that Josephus's description was an over-simplification and there were likely to be complex differences between these groups which may have been similar to those described by Josephus.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=16}} [[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]] has also argued on the basis of [[4 Ezra]], a document dated to the first century AD, that Jewish beliefs in predestination are primarily concerned with God's choice to save some individual Jews.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=17}}

In the [[New Testament]], [[Letter to the Romans|Romans]] 8–11 presents a statement on predestination. In [[Romans 8]]:28–30, Paul writes, {{quote|We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=25}}}}
Biblical scholars have interpreted this passage in several ways. Many say this only has to do with service, and is not about salvation. The Catholic biblical commentator Brendan Byrne wrote that the predestination mentioned in this passage should be interpreted as applied to the Christian community corporately rather than individuals.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=29}} Another Catholic commentator, [[Joseph Fitzmyer]], wrote that this passage teaches that God has predestined the [[universal salvation|salvation of all humans]].{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=31}} [[Douglas Moo]], a Protestant biblical interpreter, reads the passage as teaching that God has predestined a certain set of people to salvation.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=32}} Similarly, Wright's interpretation is that in this passage Paul teaches that God will save those whom he has chosen, but Wright also emphasizes that Paul does not intend to suggest that God has eliminated human free will or responsibility. Instead, Wright asserts, Paul is saying that God's will works through that of humans to accomplish salvation.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=33}}

====Patristic period====
[[Origen]], writing in the third century, taught that God's providence extends to every individual.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=38}} He believed God's predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of every individual's merits, whether in their current life or a [[pre-existence|previous life]].{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=39–40}}

Later in the fourth and fifth centuries, [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) also taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=44}} Prior to 396, Augustine believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe, that God's grace was "a reward for human assent".{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=48-49}} Later, in response to [[Pelagius]], Augustine said that the sin of [[pride]] consists in assuming that "we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us", and argued that it is God's grace that causes the individual act of faith.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=47–48}} Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies [[double predestination]], or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars affirm that Augustine did believe in double predestination.{{sfn|James|1998|p=102}}

Augustine's position raised objections. [[Julian of Eclanum]] expressed the view that Augustine was bringing [[Manichean]] thoughts into the church.{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|p=232}} For [[Vincent of Lérins]], this was a disturbing innovation.{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|p=233}} This new tension eventually became obvious with the confrontation between Augustine and [[Pelagius]] culminating in condemnation of [[Pelagianism]] (as interpreted by Augustine) at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. Pelagius denied Augustine's view of predestination in order to affirm that salvation is achieved by an act of free will.

The [[Council of Arles (475)|Council of Arles]] in the late fifth century condemned the position "that some have been condemned to death, others have been predestined to life", though this may seem to follow from Augustine's teaching. The [[Second Council of Orange]] in 529 also condemned the position that "some have been truly predestined to evil by divine power".{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=37}}

In the eighth century, [[John of Damascus]] emphasized the freedom of the human will in his doctrine of predestination, and argued that acts arising from peoples' wills are not part of God's providence at all. Damascene teaches that people's good actions are done in cooperation with God, but are not caused by him.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=60}}

====Middle Ages====
[[Gottschalk of Orbais]], a ninth-century [[Saxon]] monk, argued that God predestines some people to hell as well as predestining some to heaven, a view known as double predestination. He was condemned by several synods, but his views remained popular. Irish theologian [[John Scottus Eriugena]] wrote a refutation of Gottschalk.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=70}} Eriugena abandoned Augustine's teaching on predestination.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=69}} He wrote that God's predestination should be equated with his foreknowledge of people's choices.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=74}}

In the twelfth century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that God predestines certain people to the [[beatific vision]] based solely on his own goodness rather than that of creatures.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=80}} Aquinas also believed that people are free in their choices, fully cause their own sin, and are solely responsible for it.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=78}} According to Aquinas, there are several ways in which God wills actions. He directly wills the good, indirectly wills evil consequences of good things, and only permits evil. Aquinas held that in permitting evil, God does not will it to be done or not to be done.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=78–79}}

In the thirteenth century, [[William of Ockham]] taught that God does not cause human choices and equated predestination with divine foreknowledge.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=88}} Though Ockham taught that God predestines based on people's foreseen works, he maintained that God's will was not constrained to do this.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=89}}

====Reformation====
[[John Calvin]] rejected the idea that God permits rather than actively decrees the damnation of sinners, as well as other evil.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=102}} Calvin did not believe God to be guilty of sin, but he considered it an unfathomable mystery that God seems to simultaneously will sin and to also not will sin.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=104}} Though he maintained God's predestination applies to damnation as well as salvation, he taught that the damnation of the damned is caused by their sin, but that the salvation of the saved is solely caused by God.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=105–106}} Other [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Huldrych Zwingli]], also held double predestinarian views.{{sfnm|James|1998|1p=30|Trueman|1994|2p=69}}

===Views of Christian branches===

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The [[Eastern Orthodox]] view was summarized by Bishop [[Theophan the Recluse]] in response to the question, "What is the relationship between the Divine provision and our free will?"
{{quote|Answer: The fact that the Kingdom of God is "taken by force" presupposes personal effort. When the Apostle Paul says, "it is not of him that willeth," this means that one's efforts do not produce what is sought. It is necessary to combine them: to strive ''and'' to expect all things from grace. It is not one's own efforts that will lead to the goal, because without grace, efforts produce little; nor does grace without effort bring what is sought, because grace acts in us and for us ''through'' our efforts. Both combine in a person to bring progress and carry him to the goal. (God's) foreknowledge is unfathomable. It is enough for us with our whole heart to believe that it never opposes God's grace and truth, and that it does not infringe man's freedom. Usually this resolves as follows: God foresees how a man will freely act and makes dispositions accordingly. Divine determination depends on the life of a man, and not his life upon the determination.&lt;ref&gt;St. Theophan the Recluse, ''An Explanation of Certain Texts of Holy Scripture'', as quoted in Johanna Manley's ''The Bible and the Holy Fathers for Orthodox: Daily Scripture Readings and Commentary for Orthodox Christians'', pg. 609.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Catholicism====

Catholicism teaches the doctrine of predestination, while rejecting the classical Calvinist view known as "double predestination". This means that while it is held that those whom God has elected to eternal life will infallibly attain it, and are therefore said to be predestined to salvation by God, those who perish are not predestined to damnation. According to the Catholic Church, God predestines no one to go to hell, for this, a willful turning away from God (a mortal sin) is necessary, and persistence in it until the end."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1037&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism has been generally discouraging to human attempts to guess or predict the Divine Will. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' entry on predestination says:&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] entry on [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12378a.htm entry on Predestination]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|God, owing to His infallible prescience of the future, has appointed and ordained from eternity all events occurring in time, especially those that directly proceed from, or at least are influenced by, man's free will.}} The heretical seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sect within Roman Catholicism known as [[Jansenism]] preached the doctrine of double predestination, although Jansenism claimed that even members of the saved elect could lose their salvation by doing sinful, un-repented deeds, as implied in Ezekiel 18:21–28 in the Old Testament of the Bible.

[[Pope John Paul II]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;the [[encyclical]] ''[[Redemptoris Missio]]'', chapter 1, section 10&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The universality of salvation means that it is granted not only to those who explicitly believe in Christ and have entered the Church. Since salvation is offered to all, it must be made concretely available to all.

Grace comes from Christ; it is the result of his Sacrifice and is communicated by the Holy Spirit. It enables each person to attain salvation through his or her free cooperation.}}

The [[Catholic Catechism]] says, "To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 600&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catholics do not believe that any hints or evidence of the predestined status of individuals is available to humans, and predestination generally plays little or no part in Catholic teaching to the faithful, being a topic addressed in a professional theological context only.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] laid the foundation for much of the later Catholic teaching on predestination. His teachings on grace and free will were largely adopted by the Second Council of Orange (529), whose decrees were directed against the Semipelagians. Augustine wrote, 
{{quote|[God] promised not from the power of our will but from His own predestination. For He promised what He Himself would do, not what men would do. Because, although men do those good things which pertain to God’s worship, He Himself makes them to do what He has commanded; it is not they that cause Him to do what He has promised. Otherwise the fulfilment of God’s promises would not be in the power of God, but in that of men"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Augustine of Hippo|title=In What Respects Predestination and Grace Differ.|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf105.xxi.ii.xix.html|work=Anti Pelagian Writings|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Augustine also teaches that people have free will. For example, in "On Grace and Free Will", (see especially chapters II–IV) Augustine states that "He [God] has revealed to us, through His Holy Scriptures, that there is in man a free choice of will," and that "God's precepts themselves would be of no use to a man unless he had free choice of will, so that by performing them he might obtain the promised rewards." (chap. II)

[[Thomas Aquinas]]' views concerning predestination are largely in agreement with Augustine and can be summarized by many of his writings in his ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]'':
{{quote|God does reprobate some. For it was said above (A[1]) that predestination is a part of providence. To providence, however, it belongs to permit certain defects in those things which are subject to providence, as was said above (Q[22], A[2]). Thus, as men are ordained to eternal life through the providence of God, it likewise is part of that providence to permit some to fall away from that end; this is called reprobation. Thus, as predestination is a part of providence, in regard to those ordained to eternal salvation, so reprobation is a part of providence in regard to those who turn aside from that end. Hence reprobation implies not only foreknowledge, but also something more, as does providence, as was said above (Q[22], A[1]). Therefore, as predestination includes the will to confer grace and glory; so also reprobation includes the will to permit a person to fall into sin, and to impose the punishment of damnation on account of that sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Whether God Reprobates any Man|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q23_A3.html|work=Summa Theologica|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Lutheranism=====
[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] historically hold to unconditional election unto salvation. However, some do not believe that there are certain people that are predestined to salvation, but salvation is predestined for those who seek God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:48;&amp;version=9; Acts 13:48], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph.%201:4-11;&amp;version=47; Eph. 1:4–11], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

"The Election of Grace", paragraph 176.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe Christians should be assured that they are among the predestined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thessalonians%202:13;&amp;version=50; 2 Thess. 2:13], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;.

St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 127–8, Part XXXI. "The Election of Grace", paragraph 180.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, they disagree with those who make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection. Unlike some [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim.%202:4;&amp;version=31; 1 Tim. 2:4], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet.%203:9;&amp;version=31; 2 Pet. 3:9], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

The Election of Grace, pp. 124–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2013:9;&amp;version=9; Hos. 13:9], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;.

"Eternal Death", paragraph 196.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]]'s attitude towards predestination is set out in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]]'', published in 1525. This publication by Luther was in response to the published treatise by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] in 1524 known as ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio|On Free Will]]''. Luther based his views on [[Ephesians 2]]:8–10, which says:
{{quote|For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.}}

=====Calvinism=====
{{main|Predestination in Calvinism}}
The [[Belgic Confession]] of 1561 affirmed that God "delivers and preserves" from perdition "all whom he, in his eternal and unchangeable council, of mere goodness hath elected in Christ Jesus our Lord, without respect to their works" (Article XVI).
Calvinists believe that [[Christianity|God]] picked those who he will save and bring with him to [[Heaven]] before the world was created. They also believe that those people God does not save will go to [[Hell]]. John Calvin thought people who were saved could never lose their salvation and the "[[Election (Christianity)|elect]]" (those God saved) would know they were saved because of their actions.

In this common, loose sense of the term, to affirm or to deny predestination has particular reference to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine of [[unconditional election]]. In the Calvinist interpretation of the Bible, this doctrine normally has only pastoral value related to the assurance of salvation and the absolution of salvation by grace alone. However, the philosophical implications of the doctrine of election and predestination are sometimes discussed beyond these systematic bounds. Under the topic of the doctrine of God (theology proper), the predestinating decision of God cannot be contingent upon anything outside of himself, because all other things are dependent upon him for existence and meaning. Under the topic of the doctrines of salvation (soteriology), the predestinating decision of God is made from God's knowledge of his own will (Romans 9:15), and is therefore not contingent upon human decisions (rather, free human decisions are outworkings of the decision of God, which sets the total reality within which those decisions are made in exhaustive detail: that is, nothing left to chance). Calvinists do not pretend to understand how this works; but they are insistent that the Scriptures teach both the [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|sovereign control]] of God and the responsibility and freedom of human decisions.

Calvinist groups use the term [[Hyper-Calvinism]] to describe Calvinistic systems that assert without qualification that God's intention to destroy some is equal to his intention to save others. Some forms of Hyper-Calvinism have racial implications, as when Dutch Calvinist theologian [[Franciscus Gomarus]] however argued that Jews, because of their refusal to worship Jesus Christ, were members of the non-elect, as also argued by [[John Calvin]] himself, based on I John 2:22–23 in The New Testament of the Bible. Some Dutch settlers in South Africa argued that black people were sons of Ham, whom Noah had [[Curse of Ham|cursed to be slaves]], according to Genesis 9:18–19, or drew analogies between them and the Canaanites, suggesting a "chosen people" ideology similar to that espoused by proponents of the [[Jews as the chosen people|Jewish nation]]. This justified racial hierarchy on earth, as well as racial segregation of congregations, but did not exclude blacks from being part of the elect. Other Calvinists vigorously objected to these arguments (see [[Afrikaner Calvinism]]). 

Expressed sympathetically, the [[Calvinist]] doctrine is that God has mercy or withholds it, with particular consciousness of who are to be the recipients of mercy in Christ. Therefore, the particular persons are chosen, out of the total number of human beings, who will be rescued from enslavement to sin and the fear of death, and from punishment due to sin, to dwell forever in his presence. Those who are being saved are assured through the gifts of faith, the sacraments, and communion with God through prayer and increase of good works, that their reconciliation with him through Christ is settled by the sovereign determination of God's will. God also has particular consciousness of those who are passed over by his selection, who are without excuse for their rebellion against him, and will be judged for their sins.

Calvinists typically divide on the issue of predestination into [[infralapsarianism|infralapsarians]] (sometimes called 'sublapsarians') and [[supralapsarianism|supralapsarians]]. Infralapsarians interpret the biblical election of God to highlight his love (1 John 4:8; Ephesians 1:4b–5a) and chose his elect considering the situation after the Fall, while supralapsarians interpret biblical election to highlight God's sovereignty (Romans 9:16) and that the Fall was ordained by God's decree of election. In infralapsarianism, election is God's response to the Fall, while in supralapsarianism the Fall is part of God's plan for election. In spite of the division, many Calvinist theologians would consider the debate surrounding the infra- and supralapsarian positions one in which scant Scriptural evidence can be mustered in either direction, and that, at any rate, has little effect on the overall doctrine.

Some Calvinists decline to describe the eternal decree of God in terms of a sequence of events or thoughts, and many caution against the simplifications involved in describing any action of God in speculative terms. Most make distinctions between the positive manner in which God chooses some to be recipients of grace, and the manner in which grace is consciously withheld so that some are destined for everlasting punishments.

Debate concerning predestination according to the common usage concerns the destiny of the damned: whether God is just if that destiny is settled prior to the existence of any actual volition of the individual, and whether the individual is in any meaningful sense responsible for his destiny if it is settled by the eternal action of God.

=====Arminianism=====
{{Main|Corporate election}}
[[Arminianism|Arminians]] hold that God does not predetermine, but instead infallibly knows who will believe and perseveringly be saved. This view is known as [[conditional election]], because it states that election is conditional on the one who wills to have faith in God for salvation. Although God knows from the beginning of the world who will go where, the choice is still with the individual. The Dutch Calvinist theologian Franciscus Gomarus strongly opposed the views of Jacobus Arminius with his doctrine of supralapsarian predestination.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) rejects the doctrine of predestination, but does believe in [[foreordination]]. Foreordination, an important [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|doctrine]] of the LDS Church,&lt;ref name="GT: Foreordination"&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/topics/foreordination?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics: Foreordination |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141207153038/https://www.lds.org/topics/foreordination?lang=eng |archive-date= 2014-12-07 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McConkie May 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/05/god-foreordains-his-prophets-and-his-people?lang=eng |title= God Foreordains His Prophets and His People |first= Bruce R. |last= McConkie |authorlink= Bruce R.

For example, [[prophets]] were foreordained to be the Lord's servants (see Jeremiah 1:5), all who receive the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] were foreordained to that calling, and Jesus was foreordained to enact the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].

The LDS Church teaches the doctrine of moral [[Agency (LDS Church)|agency]], the ability to choose and act for ourselves, and decide whether to accept Christ's atonement.&lt;ref name="lds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/agency?lang=eng|title=Agency|publisher=lds.org|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of predestination===

====Conditional election====
[[Conditional election]] is the belief that [[God in Christianity|God]] chooses for eternal [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] those whom he foresees will have [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in [[Christ]]. This belief emphasizes the importance of a person's [[free will]]. The counter-view is known as [[unconditional election]], and is the belief that God chooses whomever he will, based solely on his purposes and apart from an individual's free will. It has long been an issue in [[History of the Calvinist–Arminian debate|Calvinist–Arminian debate]]. An alternative viewpoint is [[Corporate election]], which distinguishes God's election and predestination for corporate entities such as the community "in Christ," and individuals who can benefit from that community's election and predestination so long as they continue belonging to that community.

====Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism====
[[Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism|Infralapsarianism]] (also called sublapsarianism) holds that predestination logically coincides with the preordination of Man's fall into sin. That is, God predestined sinful men for salvation. Therefore, according to this view, God is the [[proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate cause]], but not the proximate source or "author" of sin. Infralapsarians often emphasize a difference between God's decree (which is inviolable and inscrutable), and his revealed will (against which man is disobedient). Proponents also typically emphasize the grace and mercy of God toward all men, although teaching also that only some are predestined for salvation.

In common English parlance, the doctrine of predestination often has particular reference to the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. The version of predestination espoused by [[John Calvin]], after whom Calvinism is named, is sometimes referred to as "double predestination" because in it God predestines some people for salvation (i.e. [[unconditional election]]) and some for condemnation (i.e. [[Reprobation]]) which results by allowing the individual's own sins to condemn them. Calvin himself defines predestination as "the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. Not all are created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestined to life or to death."&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iii.xxii.html |title=Calvin, John. ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', (Henry Beveridge, trans.), III.21.5 |access-date=21 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829234225/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iii.xxii.html |archive-date=29 August 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the spectrum of beliefs concerning predestination, Calvinism is the strongest form among Christians. It teaches that God's predestining decision is based on the knowledge of his own will rather than foreknowledge, concerning every particular person and event; and, God continually acts with entire freedom, in order to bring about his will in completeness, but in such a way that the freedom of the creature is not violated, "but rather, established".&lt;ref name="WCF3"&gt;[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER III. Of God's Eternal Decree.|Westminster Confession of faith, Ch 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvinists who hold the infralapsarian view of predestination usually prefer that term to "sublapsarianism," perhaps with the intent of blocking the inference that they believe predestination is on the basis of foreknowledge (''sublapsarian'' meaning, assuming the fall into sin).&lt;ref&gt;Here, sub- is opposed to super- or supra- in a sense related to volition and/or necessity. Cf., for relapse of same origin, http://freedictionary.org/index.php?Query=relapse&amp;database=%2A&amp;strategy=exact : L. relapsus, p. p. of relabi to slip back, to relapse.&lt;/ref&gt; The different terminology has the benefit of distinguishing the Calvinist double predestination version of infralapsarianism from Lutheranism's view that predestination is a mystery, which forbids the unprofitable intrusion of prying minds since God only reveals partial knowledge to the human race.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism|Supralapsarianism]] is the doctrine that God's decree of predestination for salvation and reprobation logically precedes his preordination of the human race's fall into sin. That is, God decided to save, and to damn; he then determined the means by which that would be made possible. It is a matter of controversy whether or not Calvin himself held this view, but most scholars link him with the infralapsarian position. It is known, however, that Calvin's successor in Geneva, [[Theodore Beza]], held to the supralapsarian view.

====Double predestination====
Double predestination, or the double decree, is the doctrine that God actively [[reprobates]], or decrees damnation of some, as well as salvation for those whom he has elected. Augustine made statements that on their own seem to teach such a doctrine, but in the context of his other writings it is not clear whether he held it. Augustine's doctrine of predestination does seem to imply a double predestinarian view.{{sfn|James|1998|p=102}} Gottschalk of Orbais taught it more explicitly in the ninth century,{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=70}} and [[Gregory of Rimini]] in the fourteenth.{{sfn|James|1998|p=147}} During the Protestant Reformation John Calvin also held double predestinarian views.{{sfn|James|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Trueman|1994|p=69}} John Calvin states: "By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that '''he has been predestinated to life or to death'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calvin|first1=John|title=Institutes of Christian Religion|location=Book Three, Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open theism====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
[[Open theism]] advocates the non-traditional Arminian view of election that predestination is corporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brian Abasciano |title=The FACTS of Salvation: A Summary of Arminian Theology/the Biblical Doctrines of Grace |date=25 October 2013 |url=http://evangelicalarminians.org/the-facts-of-salvation-a-summary-of-arminian-theologythe-biblical-doctrines-of-grace/ |publisher=Society of Evengelical Arminians|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[corporate election]], God does not choose which individuals he will save prior to creation, but rather God chooses the church as a whole. Or put differently, God chooses what type of individuals he will save. Another way the New Testament puts this is to say that God chose the church in Christ (Eph. 1:4). In other words, God chose from all eternity to save all those who would be found in Christ, by faith in God. This choosing is not primarily about salvation from eternal destruction either but is about God's chosen agency in the world. Thus individuals have full freedom in terms of whether they become members of the church or not. Corporate election is thus consistent with the open view's position on God's omniscience, which states that God's foreknowledge does not determine the outcomes of individual free will.

====Middle Knowledge====
[[Middle knowledge|Middle Knowledge]] is a concept that was developed by [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Luis de Molina]], and exists under a doctrine called [[Molinism]]. It attempts to deal with the topic of predestination by reconciling Gods sovereign providence with the notion of [[libertarian free will]]. The concept of Middle Knowledge holds that God has a knowledge of true pre-volitional [[counterfactuals]] for all free creatures. That is, what any individual creature with a free will (e.g. a human) would do under any given circumstance. Gods knowledge of counterfactuals is reasoned to occur logically prior to his divine creative decree (that is, prior to creation), and after his knowledge of [[Logical truth|necessary truths]]. Thus, Middle Knowledge holds that before the world was created, God knew what every existing creature capable of libertarian freedom (e.g. every individual human) would freely choose to do in all possible circumstances. It then holds that based on this information, God elected from a number of these [[Possible world|possible worlds]], the world most consistent with his ultimate will, which is the actual world that we live in.

For example:

* if Free Creature A was to be placed in Circumstance B, God via his Middle Knowledge would know that Free Creature A will freely choose option Y over option Z.
* if Free Creature A was to be placed in Circumstance C, God via his Middle Knowledge would know that Free Creature A will freely choose option Z over option Y. 

Based on this Middle Knowledge, God has the ability to actualise the world in which A is placed in a circumstance that he freely chooses to do what is consistent with Gods ultimate will. If God determined that the world most suited to his purposes is a world in which A would freely choose Y instead of Z, God can actualise a world in which Free Creature A finds himself in Circumstance B.

In this way, Middle Knowledge is thought of by its proponents to be consistent with any theological doctrines that assert God as having divine providence and man having a libertarian freedom (e.g. Calvinism, Catholicism, Lutheranism), and to offer a potential solution to the concerns that Gods providence somehow nullifies man from having true liberty in his choices.

In Islam, "predestination" is the usual English language rendering of a belief that Muslims call ''al-qada wa al-qadar'' in Arabic. The phrase means "the divine decree and the predestination". In Islam, God has predetermined, known, ordained, and is constantly creating every event that takes place in the world. This is entailed by his being omnipotent and omniscient. Sunni scholars hold that there is no contradiction in people's deeds (and naturally their choices) being created and predetermined by the creator, since they define free will to be the antonym of compulsion and coercion. People – in the Sunni perspective – do acknowledge that they are free, since they do not see anybody or anything forcing them to do whatever they chose to do. This, however, does not contradict that everything they do, including the choices they make, are predestined and predetermined by God. Consequently, people are already predestined to either heaven or hell at birth, as Sunnis believe; however, they will have no argument on the day of judgment since they never knew in advance what their fate would be, and they do acknowledge that they have choice; which is what moral responsibility comes with.&lt;ref name="eltwhed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltwhed.com/vb/showthread.php?28233-%C7%E1%CC%E6%C7%C8-%DD%ED-%E3%D3%C3%E1%C9-%C7%E1%DE%CF%D1-%E6%D4%C8%E5%C9-%C7%E1%CC%C8%D1-%E6%C7%E1%C7%CE%CA%ED%C7%D1|title=الجواب في مسألة القدر وشبهة الجبر والاختيار.|publisher=eltwhed.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of human will being predetermined by God's will is stated clearly in the Quran:
"Verily this (The Holy Quran) is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds; (With profit) to whoever among you wills to go straight, ''but ye shall not will except as God wills;'' the Cherisher of the Worlds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=221&amp;BookID=15&amp;SuraNum=81&amp;AyaNum=29 The Koran; Section 81, Verses 27-29]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="islam-qa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam-qa.com/index.php?ref=96978&amp;ln=eng|title=موقع الإسلام سؤال وجواب - عربي - islamqa.info|publisher=islam-qa.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predestination is rejected in Shiaism.&lt;ref&gt;Need of Religion, by Sayyid Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{See also|Free will in theology#In Jewish thought}}
In [[Rabbinic literature]], there is much discussion as to the apparent [[contradiction]] between God's omniscience and free will. The representative view is that "Everything is foreseen; yet free will is given" ([[Rabbi Akiva]], ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830203834/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm 3:15]). Based on this understanding, the problem is formally described as a [[paradox]], perhaps beyond our understanding.

[[Hasdai Crescas]] resolved this dialectical tension by taking the position that free will doesn't exist. All of a person's actions are predetermined by the moment of their birth, and thus their judgment in the eyes of God (so to speak) is effectively preordained. In this scheme this is not a result of God's predetermining one's fate, but rather that the universe is deterministic. Crescas's views on this topic were rejected by Judaism at large. In later centuries this idea independently developed among some in the [[Chabad]] (Lubavitch) movement of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. Many individuals within Chabad take this view seriously, and hence effectively deny the existence of free will.&lt;ref name="Apologetics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasciano|first1=Brian|title=The FACTS of Salvation: A Summary of Arminian Theology/the Biblical Doctrines of Grace|journal=Society of Evangelical Arminians|issue=The Facts of Salvation|url=http://evangelicalarminians.org/the-facts-of-salvation-a-summary-of-arminian-theologythe-biblical-doctrines-of-grace/|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many Chabad (Lubavitch) Jews attempt to hold both views. They affirm as infallible their [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|rebbe]]'s teachings that God knows and controls the fate of all, yet at the same time affirm the classical Jewish belief in free will. The inherent contradiction between the two results in their belief that such contradictions are only "apparent", due to man's inherent lack of ability to understand greater truths and due to the fact that Creator and Created exist in different realities. The same idea is strongly repeated by [[Rambam]] ([[Mishneh Torah]], Laws of Repentance, Chapter 5).

Many other Jews (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and secular) affirm that since free will exists, then by definition one's fate is not preordained. It is held as a tenet of faith that whether God is omniscient or not, nothing interferes with mankind's free will. Some Jewish theologians, both during the medieval era and today, have attempted to formulate a philosophy in which free will is preserved, while also affirming that God has knowledge of what decisions people will make in the future. Whether or not these two ideas are mutually compatible, or whether there is a contradiction between the two, is still a matter of great study and interest in [[philosophy]] today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38677">{{sexual orientation}}
The hormonal theory of sexuality holds that, just as exposure to certain hormones plays a role in fetal [[sex differentiation]], such exposure also influences the [[sexual orientation]] that emerges later in the adult. '''Prenatal hormones''' may be seen as the primary determinant of adult sexual orientation, or a co-factor with genes, [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological factors]] and/or environmental and social conditions.

==Sex-typed behavior==

The hormonal theory of sexuality and gender identity holds that, just as exposure to certain [[hormones]] plays a role in fetal sex differentiation, such exposure also influences the sexual orientation and or gender identity that emerges later in the adult. Differences in brain structure that come about from chemical messengers and genes interacting on developing brain cells are believed to be the basis of sex differences in countless behaviors, including sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia-Falgueras A, Swaab DF. Sexual hormones and the brain: an essential alliance for sexual identity and sexual orientation.  Endocr Dev. 2010;17:22-35. {{DOI|10.1159/000262525}} {{PMID|19955753}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}    Prenatal factors that affect or interfere with the interaction of these hormones on the developing brain can influence later [[Childhood gender nonconformity|sex-typed behavior]] in children.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}} This hypothesis is originated from countless experimental studies in non-human mammals, yet the argument that similar effects can be seen in human neurobehavioral development is a much debated topic among scholars.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt; Recent studies, however, have provided evidence in support of prenatal androgen exposure influencing childhood sex-typed behavior.&lt;ref name="Hines Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|title=Sex-related variation in human behavior and the brain.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=October 2010|volume=14|issue=10|pages=448–456|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.005|pmid=20724210|pmc=2951011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetal hormones may be seen as either the primary influence upon adult sexual orientation or as a co-factor interacting with genes and/or environmental and social conditions.&lt;ref name=BornGay&gt;Wilson, G., &amp; Q. Rahman, ''Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Human Sex Orientation'', Peter Owen Publishers; 2nd edition (May 1, 2008) {{ISBN|9780720613094}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} However, Garcia-Falgueras and [[Dick Swaab]] disagree that social conditions influence sexual orientation to a large degree. As seen in young children as well as in vervet and rhesus monkeys, sexually differentiated behavior in toy preference is differing in males versus females, where females prefer dolls and males prefer toy balls and cars; these preferences can be seen as early as 3–8 months in humans.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  It is impossible to completely rule out the social environment or the child's cognitive understanding of gender when discussing sex typed play in androgen-exposed girls.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  Conversely, children tend towards objects which have been labelled for their own sex, or toys that they have seen members of their sex playing with previously.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;

An endocrinology study by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab postulated that "In humans, the main mechanism responsible of {{sic}} sexual identity and orientation involves a direct effect of testosterone on the developing brain."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|25}} Further, their study puts forward that intrauterine exposure to hormones is largely determinative. Sketching the argument briefly here, the authors say that sexual organs are differentiated first, and then the brain is sexually differentiated "under the influence, mainly, of sex hormones such as testosterone, estrogen and progesterone on the developing brain cells and under the presence of different genes as well ... . The changes brought about in this stage are permanent. ... [S]exual differentiation of the brain is not caused by hormones alone, even though they are very important for gender identity and sexual orientation."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

===Organizational aspects===

Fetal gonads develop primarily based on the presence or absence of [[androgen]] hormones, mainly [[testosterone]], [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) and [[androstenedione]]; production of testosterone and conversion into dihydrotestosterone during weeks 6 to 12 of pregnancy are key factors in the production of a male fetus's penis, scrotum and prostate.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;  In a female, on the other hand, absence of these levels of androgens results in development of typically female genitals.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Following this, sexual differentiation of the brain occurs; sex hormones exert organizational effects on the brain that will be activated in puberty.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bao|first=Ai-Min|author2=Dick F. Swaab|title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: Relation to gender identity, sexual orientation and neuropsychiatric disorders|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|date=18 February 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=214–226|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.007|pmid=21334362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of these two processes occurring separately, the degree of genital masculinization does not necessarily relate to the masculinization of the brain.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Sex differences in the brain have been found in many structures, most notably the [[hypothalamus]] and the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  However, few of these have been related to behavioral sex differences, and scientists are still working to establish firm links between early hormones, brain development and behavior.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt; The study of the organizational theory of prenatal hormones can be difficult, as ethically researchers cannot alter hormones in a developing fetus; instead, scholars must rely on naturally occurring abnormalities of development to provide answers.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berenbaum|first=Sheri A.|author2=Adriene M. Beltz|title=Sexual differentiation of human behavior: Effects of prenatal and pubertal organizational hormones|journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology|date=April 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=183–200|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.03.001|pmid=21397624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most extensively studied in organizational effects of hormones is [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH).&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hines |first=Melissa |year=2011 |title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=170–182 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006 |pmid=21333673|pmc=3296090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CAH is a genetic disease that results in exposure to high levels of [[androgens]] beginning early in gestation.  Girls with CAH are born with masculinized genitalia, which is corrected surgically as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum/&gt;&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011/&gt;  CAH provides the opportunity for [[natural experiments]], as people with CAH can be compared to people without it.  However, "CAH is not a perfect experiment", since, "social responses to masculinized genitalia or factors related to the disease itself" can [[confound]] results.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum/&gt;   Nonetheless several studies have shown that CAH has a clear but not determining influence on sexual orientation; women with CAH are less likely to be exclusively heterosexual than are other women.&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011/&gt;
  
Since hormones alone do not determine sexual orientation and differentiation of the brain, the search for other factors that act upon sexual orientation have led genes such as the [[SRY]] and ZFY to be implicated.&lt;ref name="Ngun et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngun|first=Tuck C. |author2=Negar Ghahramani |author3=Francisco J. Sanchez |author4=Sven Bocklandt |author5=Eric Vilain|title=The genetics of sex differences in brain and behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|date=October 2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=227–246|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2010.10.001|pmid=20951723|pmc=3030621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prenatal maternal stress===

As of 2006 results from studies in humans had found conflicting evidence regarding the effect of prenatal exposure to hormones and psychosexual outcomes; Gooren noted in 2006 that studies in subprimate mammals are invalid measures of human sexual differentiation, as sex hormones follow a more "on-off" role in sex-typed behavior than is found in primates.&lt;ref name=Gooren&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gooren|first=Louis|title=The biology of human psychosexual differentiation|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=November 2006|volume=50|issue=4|pages=589–601|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.011|pmid=16870186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies do suggest that prenatal stress significantly increases the likelihood of [[homosexuality]] or [[bisexuality]], although varying evidence exists for which trimester is most important.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}  Studies of endocrinology have found implications for amphetamines and thyroid-gland hormones to increase homosexuality in female offspring as well, although it has not been examined in conjunction with prenatal stress levels.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Some have postulated that postnatal (e.g., social and environmental factors) development can play a role in the sexual orientation of an individual, yet solid evidence of this has yet to be discovered. Children born through artificial insemination with donor sperm and consequently raised by lesbian couples have typically been heterosexually oriented.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Summed up by Bao and Swaab, "The apparent impossibility of getting someone to change their sexual orientation ... is a major argument against the importance of the social environment in the emergence of homosexuality, as well as against the idea that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;

===Male homosexuality as hypermasculine===
{{main|Hypermasculinity}}

There is evidence of a correlation between sexual orientation and traits that are determined [[in utero]].&lt;ref name=BornGay/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}   A study by McFadden in 1998 found that auditory systems in the [[brain]], another physical trait influenced by prenatal hormones is different in those of differing orientations; likewise the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] was found by Swaab and Hofman to be larger in homosexual men than in heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panzica|first1=GC|last2=Aste|first2=N|last3=Viglietti-Panzica|first3=C|last4=Ottinger|first4=MA|title=Structural sex differences in the brain: influence of gonadal steroids and behavioral correlates.|journal=[[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]]|date=March 1995|volume=18|issue=3|pages=232–52|doi=10.1007/BF03347808|pmid=7615911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suprachiasmatic nucleus is also known to be larger in men than in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0165-3806(94)90129-5 |vauthors=Swaab DF, Zhou JN, Ehlhart T, Hofman MA |title=Development of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons in the human suprachiasmatic nucleus in relation to birth and sex |journal=Brain Res.

====Fraternal birth order====
According to some studies, gay men have more older [[brother]]s on average, a phenomenon known as the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]].  It has been suggested that the greater the number of older male siblings the higher the level of [[androgen]] fetuses are exposed to&lt;!--I think this is a reference to Williams et al. Nature paper, but I don't think it says quite says what this last sentence says--&gt;. No evidence of birth order effects have been observed in women. The theory holds that the fraternal birth order effect is a result of a maternal immune response that is produced towards a factor of male development over several male pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  Bogaert's hypothesis argues that "the target of the immune response may be malespecific molecules on the surface of male fetal brain cells (e.g., including those in the anterior hypothalamus). Antimale antibodies might bind to these molecules and thus interfere with their role in normal sexual differentiation, leading some later born males to being attracted to men as opposed to women."&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state that  "The ... fraternal birth order effect ... is putatively explained by an immunological response by the mother to a product of the Y chromosome of her sons. The chance of such an immune response to male factors would increase with every pregnancy resulting in the birth of a son."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

While direct support has not been found for these hypotheses, evidence that favours this theory exists.&lt;ref name="Blanchard/Lippa cite"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Ray|author2=Richard Lippa|title=Birth Order, Sibling Sex Ratio, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation of Male and Female Participants in a BBC Internet Research Project|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=April 2007|volume=36|issue=2|pages=163–176|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9159-7|pmid=17345165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, while percentages of the likelihood of homosexuality have been estimated to be increased by 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Birth Order, Sibling Sex Ratio, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation of Male and Female Participants in a BBC Internet Research Project|author1=Ray Blanchard|author2=Richard Lippa|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2007|volume=36|issue=2|pages=163–76|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9159-7|pmid=17345165}}&lt;/ref&gt;–48% per older brother, these odds really account for only a few percent of the population; thus, this hypothesis cannot be universally applied to the majority of homosexual men.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt; Not all studies have been able to reproduce the fraternal birth order effect.

In conjunction with fraternal birth order, [[Handedness and sexual orientation|handedness]] provides further evidence of prenatal effects on sexual orientation, because handedness is regarded by many as a marker of early neurodevelopment. Other correlates to handedness (e.g., cerebral laterality, prenatal hormonal profiles, spatial ability) have been linked to sexual orientation, either empirically and/or theoretically.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  In right-handed individuals, the number of older brothers increased the odds of homosexual orientation, but this effect was not seen in left-handed individuals.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt; As with other purported marks indicating higher incidence of homosexuality, however, the link with handedness remains ambiguous and several studies have been unable to replicate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=====Implicated genes in fraternal birth order=====

A gene of the ''Rh'' system has been discussed as a possible candidate for affecting fraternal birth order, as it has been linked to both handedness and immune system functioning.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaert|first=Anthony|author2=Ray Blanchard |author3=Lesley Crothswait |title=Interaction of Birth Order, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation in the Kinsey Interview Data|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|date=October 2007|volume=121|issue=5|pages=845–853|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.121.5.845|pmid=17907817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gene variants in the ''Rh'' system are implicated in a maternal response to what is known as [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]]. ''Rh'' is a factor in blood, and in cases where the mother is absent of this (''Rh-'') while carrying an ''Rh+'' fetus, an immune response may develop with deleterious effects. The ''Rh'' gene hypothesis is a strong candidate because not only does it involve the maternal immune response, but it has been implicated in handedness as well.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;

Variants of the androgen receptor (''AR'') gene have also been discussed, in that non-right-handedness in men has been linked with greater CAG repeats in the ''AR'' gene, which in turn is associated with lower testosterone. A theory that high prenatal testosterone leads to neuronal and axonal loss in the corpus callosum is supported by this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Witelson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witelson|first=Sandra|author2=R. S. Nowakowski|title=Left out axons make men right: A hypothesis for the origin of handedness and functional asymmetry|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1991|volume=29|issue=4|pages=327–333|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(91)90046-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male homosexuality as hypomasculine===
{{main|Hypomasculinity}}

In a 1991 study, [[Simon LeVay]] demonstrated that a tiny clump &lt;!--name that 'clump' (&amp; call it a nucleus) --&gt; of neurons of the anterior [[hypothalamus]]—which is believed to control sexual behavior and linked to prenatal hormones—known as the interstitial nuclei of the anterior was, on average, more than twice the size in heterosexual men when contrasted to homosexual men. Due to this area also being nearly twice the size in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women, the implication is that the sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus in homosexuals is in a female direction.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  In 2003 scientists at [[Oregon State University]] announced that they had replicated his findings in sheep. Later studies in humans, however, have yet to confirm this finding.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt; &lt;!-- I believe this has also been replicated in human subjects: Byne, W., S. Tobet, ''et al.'' (2001). "The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and hiv status." Horm Behav 40(2): 86–92. Dr. Simon LeVay, in his study of the hypothalamic differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men, offered the following criticisms of his own research, "It's important to stress what I didn't find. I did not prove that homosexuality is genetic, or find a genetic cause for being gay. I didn't show that gay men are born that way, the most common mistake people make in interpreting my work. Nor did I locate a gay center in the brain."--&gt;

===Female homosexuality===

Most empirical or theoretical research into women's sexual orientation has, historically, been guided by the idea of lesbians as essentially masculine and heterosexual women as essentially feminine.&lt;ref name=Peplau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peplau|first=Letitia|author2=Mark Huppin|title=Masculinity, Femininity and the Development of Sexual Orientation in Women|journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health|date=October 2008|volume=12|issue=1–2|pages=145–165|doi=10.1300/J529v12n01_09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, this belief is traced to the early "inversion theory" of sex researchers who state that homosexuality is a result of biological abnormalities that "invert" sexual attraction and personality.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;  Handedness research has provided implications; because more men than women present a preference for their left hand, the higher proportion of non-right handedness that has been discovered among lesbians when compared to heterosexual women demonstrates a possible link of prenatal masculinization and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt; Backing this up are reports that lesbians display more masculinized 2D;4D digit ratios than heterosexual women, based on data gathered from at least six different laboratories.&lt;ref name="2d4d twins" /&gt;  This effect has not yet been observed between homosexual and heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="2d4d twins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobrogge|first=Kyle L|author2=S. Marc Breedlove |author3=Kelly L. Klump |title=Genetic and Environmental Influences on 2D;4D Finger Length Ratios: A Study of Monozygotic and Dizygotic Male and Female Twins|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=February 2008|volume=37|issue=1|pages=112–118|doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9272-2|pmid=18074216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the validity of this measure of digit ratios remains controversial as a predictor of prenatal androgen, as many other prenatal factors may play roles in bone growth in prenatal stages of development.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  While many studies have found results confirming this hypothesis, others have failed to replicate 
these findings,&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  leaving the validity of this measure unconfirmed.

[[Diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), a drug that has been in the past prescribed to prevent miscarriages, has also been studied in relation to women's sexual orientation. It has been observed to exert a masculinizing/defeminizing  effect on the developing brain of the fetus.&lt;ref name=Peplau /&gt; When compared to controls, higher percentages of DES-exposed women (17% vs 0%) reported that they had engaged in same-sex relations; however, the great majority of DES women stated an exclusively heterosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;

Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (an autosomal recessive condition which results in high androgen levels during fetal development) have more masculinized sex role identities and are more likely to have a homosexual sexual orientation as adults than controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dittmann|first=V|author2=Dilling H.  |date=June 1990|title=Chapter V (F) of ICD-10: mental, behavioural and developmental disorders—introduction and overview.|journal=Pharmacopsychiatry|volume=23|issue=suppl 4|pages=137–41|pmid=2197637|doi=10.1055/s-2007-1014552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dittmann V, von Cranach M, Eckermann G |title=Abnormalities of adult personality and behaviour (section F 6)--results of the ICD-10 field trial |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=23 Suppl 4 |issue= |pages=170–2 |year=1990 |pmid=2197643 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1014559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dittmann|first=V|date=1992-08-01|title=[ICD-10 in psychiatric diagnosis.

However, the degree to which the girls' genitals are masculinized does not correlate with their sexual orientation, suggesting that prenatal hormones are a stronger causal factor, not parental influence.

Together with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, DES studies have provided little support of the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation; they do, however, provide the framework for possible pathways to a homosexual orientation for a small number of women.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;

===Gender dysphoria===
{{main|Gender dysphoria}}

In individuals with [[gender dysphoria]], previously known as gender identity disorder (GID), prenatal exposure to testosterone has been hypothesized to have an effect on gender identity differentiation. The 2D;4D finger ratio, or relative lengths of the 2nd "index" and 4th "ring" fingers, has become a popular measure of prenatal androgen because of accumulated evidence suggesting the 2D;4D ratios are related to prenatal exposure to testosterone.&lt;ref name="2d4d wallien"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallien|first=Madeleine|author2=Kenneth J. Zucker |author3=Thomas D. Steensma |author4=Peggy T. Cohen-Kettenis |title=2D:4D finger-length ratios in children and adults with gender identity disorder|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=August 2008|volume=54|issue=3|pages=450–454|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.05.002|pmid=18585715}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many children with GID differentiate a homosexual orientation during adolescence, but not all of them; adults with "early onset", or a childhood history of cross-gender behavior, often have a homosexual orientation. Adults with "late onset", or those without a childhood history of said behavior, are more likely to have a non-homosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="2d4d wallien"/&gt;

Prenatal androgen exposure has  been associated with an increased chance of patient-initiated [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment]] to male after being initially raised as female in early childhood or infancy.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer-Bahlburg 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer-Bahlburg|first=Heino|title=gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile albation|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=28 August 2005|volume=34|issue=4|pages=423–438|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gooren found that organizational effects of prenatal androgens are more prevalent in gender role behavior than in gender identity, and that there are preliminary findings that suggest evidence of a male gender identity being more frequent in patients with fully male-typical prenatal androgenization.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Individuals with complete [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] are almost always brought up as females, and the differentiation of gender identity/role is feminine.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;   This example is important in demonstrating that chromosomes and gonads alone do not dictate gender identity and role.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

====Transsexualism====
{{main|Transsexualism}}

Because organ differentiation and brain differentiation occur at different times, in rare cases transsexualism can result.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}} Only 23% of childhood gender problems will result in transsexuality in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;  
 
Drawing on some transsexualism cases, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state that "[f]rom these examples it appears that the direct action of testosterone on the developing brain in boys and the lack of such action on the developing brain in girls are crucial factors in the development of male and female gender identity and sexual orientation ... ."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|26}} Countless studies have been run on peripheral levels of sex steroids in male and female homosexuals, a considerable number of which claimed to find "less 'male hormone' and/or more 'female hormone' in male homosexuals and vice versa in female homosexuals".&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  However, these findings have been reviewed and have subsequently been dismissed by scholars as suffering from faulty design and interpretation.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Factors implicated in the development of transsexuality include chromosomal abnormalities, polymorphisms of certain genes, and variations in [[aromatase]] (cytochrome P450 CYP19) and [[CYP17]].&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia show an increase in probability of transsexuality later in life; however, this risk is still only 1–3% in CAH.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  Although historically abnormal sexual differentiation has pointed to androgens as a causal factor, there are codeterminants of gender identity and sexual orientation with overriding effects of androgens on the brain, in male transsexuals or homosexuals, or making androgen effects on the brain redundant, as in female transsexuals or homosexuals.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  These factors are currently unknown, and thus no clear cut answer for the cause of transsexualism and homosexuality exists.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Due to relatively small population sizes, generalizability of studies on transsexuality cannot be assumed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20122">'''Primary consciousness''' is a term the American biologist [[Gerald Edelman]] coined to describe the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an [[awareness]] of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of [[consciousness]] is also sometimes called "sensory consciousness". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various [[subjectivity|subjective]] sensory contents of consciousness such as [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s, [[perception]]s, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to  being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky&gt;Edelman, G. (2004). ''Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness'': Yale Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[secondary consciousness|higher order consciousness]] can be described as being "conscious of being conscious"; it includes reflective thought, a concept of the past, and speculation about the future.

Primary consciousness can be subdivided into two forms, focal [[awareness]] and peripheral awareness. Focal awareness encompasses the center of [[attention]], whereas peripheral awareness consists of things outside the center of attention, which a person or animal is only dimly aware of.&lt;ref name = Johanson&gt;Johanson, M., Revonsuo, A., Chaplin, J., &amp; Wedlund, J.-E. (2003). Level and contents of consciousness in connection with partial epileptic seizures. ''Epilepsy &amp; Behavior'', 4(3), 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
One prominent [[theory]] for the [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] basis of primary consciousness was proposed by Gerald Edelman. This theory of consciousness is premised upon three major assumptions:
# The laws of [[physics]] apply to [[consciousness]], which rules out concepts such as spirits and a soul and allows for a purely [[physiology|physiological]] model of consciousness.
# Consciousness is an evolved characteristic, which means it is a helpful characteristic from a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] perspective.
# There is no such thing as a "[[qualia]]-free" observer. Qualia are collections of personal or subjective experiences, feelings, and sensations that inevitably come with human awareness.&lt;ref name = Edelmantheory/&gt;

Edelman's theory focuses on two [[nervous system]] organizations: the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]]s on one side and the [[thalamus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during [[evolution]] helped animals learn [[adaptive behavior]]s.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt; This connection allows past signals related to values set by the limbic-brain stem system and categorized signals from the outside world to be correlated, resulting in memory in conceptual areas. This memory is then linked to the organism's ''current'' perception, which results in an awareness of the present, or primary consciousness. In other words, Edelman posits that primary consciousness arises from the correlation of ''conceptual'' memory to a set of ''ongoing'' perceptual categorizations—a "remembered present".&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt;

Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from [[sensory neuron|sensors]] and [[sensory receptors|receptors]], both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Merker&gt;Merker, B. (2007). Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 30(01), 63–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.

==Neurophysiological basis==
Physiologically, three fundamental facts stand out about primary consciousness:&lt;ref name = SethND&gt;Seth, A. K., &amp; Baars, B. J. (2005). Neural Darwinism and consciousness. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 14(1), 140–168.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Waking consciousness is associated with low [[amplitude]], irregular [[EEG]] activity in the 20–70&amp;nbsp;Hz range.
#* Conversely, unconscious states like deep sleep, [[coma]], [[general anesthesia]], and [[epilepsy|epileptic states]] of absence show a predominance of low [[frequency]], high-[[amplitude]] and more regular [[voltage]]s at less than 4Hz.
#Consciousness seems to be intrinsically associated with the thalamus and cortex, even if the extent to which this true is argued among scientists.
#* Damage to the [[brainstem]] or thalamus can abolish consciousness, while damage to the sensory cortex appears to delete specific conscious features such as [[color vision]], visual motion, conscious experiences of objects and faces, and the like.
#Consciousness is distinctively associated with widespread brain activation related to the conscious content.
#*Perhaps two dozen experiments show that sensory input supporting consciousness spreads from the [[sensory cortex]] to [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]], and [[temporal lobe|medial-temporal]] cortex, while closely matched input that does not reach consciousness activates mainly local sensory regions. Further, the widespread activity appears to involve more globally coordinated activity.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

==Measurement==
To be fully comprehensive, measures of consciousness must not only define and distinguish between [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] states, but must also provide a guide by which the conscious level, or extent of consciousness, can be determined.&lt;ref name = Morin&gt;Morin, A. (2006). Levels of consciousness and self-awareness: A comparison and integration of various neurocognitive views. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 15(2), 358–371.&lt;/ref&gt; Measures of consciousness are each associated with particular theories.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures&gt;Seth, A. K. (2008). Theories and measures of consciousness develop together. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 17(3), 986–988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain defining theories are included below:

'''Worldly discrimination theory''' asserts that any mental state that is manifested in [[behavior]] is conscious; thus, an organism is consciously aware of something in the world if it can discriminate it with choice behavior.
'''Signal detection theory''' quantifies discriminability of a stimulus among a set of different stimuli.
'''Integration theories''' focus on finding a divide between conscious and unconscious processes. According to integration theories, conscious contents are widely available to many [[cognitive]] and/or neural processes.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2&gt;Seth, A. K., Dienes, Z., Cleeremans, A., Overgaard, M., &amp; Pessoa, L. (2008). Measuring consciousness: relating behavioural and neurophysiological approaches. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 12(8), 314–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are then accompanied with measures of the level of consciousness, which are subdivided into [[behavioral]] measures and [[physiological]] measures.&lt;ref name = Morin/&gt;

===Behavioral measures===

Behavioral measures of primary consciousness can be either objective or subjective. Regarding objective measures, knowledge is unconscious if it expresses itself in an indirect test. For example, the ability to pick which item might come next in a series can indicate unconscious knowledge of regularities in sequences.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2 /&gt; "Strategic control measures" use a person's ability to deliberately use or not use knowledge according to instructions. If they use information despite intentions not to use it, it indicates unconscious knowledge.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt; Post-decision wagering can also be used. In this method, subjects make a first-order discrimination (i.e. a choice) and then place a wager regarding the outcome of the discrimination. Some scientists view this as a direct and objective measure of consciousness, and it can be used with children and animals. However, this method has been argued to be subjective and indirect.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;

===Physiological measures===

[[event-related potential|Event-related cortical potentials (ERPs)]] have been used to assess whether a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is consciously perceived or not. These [[EEG]] measures either float free of theory, gaining credibility through reliable correlation, or assume a version of integration theory in which the appearance of a particular ERP indicates global availability or locally recurrent processing.&lt;ref name = Sethcomputation&gt;Seth, A. (2009). Explanatory Correlates of Consciousness: Theoretical and Computational Challenges. ''Cognitive Computation'', 1(1), 50–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abundant evidence indicates that consciously perceived inputs elicit widespread brain activation, as compared with inputs that do not reach consciousness.

The '''dynamic core hypothesis (DCH)''' proposes that consciousness arises from neural dynamics in the thalamocortical system, as measured by the quantity '''neural complexity (CN).''' ''CN'' is an information-theoretic measure; the ''CN'' value is high if each subset of a neural system can take on many different states, and if these states make a difference to the rest of the system.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;
The '''information integration theory of consciousness (IITC)''' shares with the DCH the idea that conscious experiences provide informative discriminations among a vast repertoire of possible experiences. In the IITC, the quantity ''phi'' is defined as the information that is integrated across the informational "weakest link" of a system. Importantly, ''phi'' is a measure of the capacity of a neural system to integrate information, whereas ''CN'' is a measure of the actual dynamics of the system. A third measure, '''causal density ''(CD)''''', measures the fraction of causal interactions among elements of a system that are statistically significant.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

===Challenges in measuring===

It is important to note that subjective measures are always indirect and can be vulnerable to many biases (e.g., reluctance to report uncertain experiences). An|metacognitive]] conscious content assumes primary consciousness but not vice versa, subjective measures risk missing or rejecting the presence of sensory consciousness simply because metacognition isn't observed.&lt;ref name= Morin/&gt;

Furthermore, there is the problem of post-decision wagering, which has been criticized because there is a possibility that advantageous wagering could be learned unconsciously; as a result, post-decision wagering would not in fact be considered a conscious behavior. For example, individual differences in [[risk aversion]] may lead to variations in wagering performance even with the same underlying conscious phenomenology.&lt;ref name= Sethmeasures2/&gt;

Thus, although behavioral measures are mostly used for assessing which contents are conscious, some brain-based measures seem better suited for measuring conscious level. Objective measures also have their challenges, however. First, objective measures still require a response criterion, for example the decision of whether or not to push a button. Second, they may not even measure consciousness at all because many behavioral proxies, such as forced-choice decision accuracy, are capable of being learned unconsciously.&lt;ref name= Edelmansky/&gt;&lt;ref name = Edelman&gt;Edelman, G. (2001). Consciousness: the remembered present. ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 929, 111–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous studies==

===In lucid dreams===

Hobson asserts that the existence of [[lucid dreaming]] means that the human brain can simultaneously occupy two states: waking and dreaming. The dreaming portion has experiences and therefore has primary consciousness, while the waking self recognizes the dreaming and can be seen as having a sort of [[secondary consciousness]] in the sense that there is an awareness of mental state. Studies have been able to show that lucid dreaming is associated with EEG power and coherence profiles that are significantly different from both non-lucid dreaming and waking.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt; Lucid dreaming situates itself between those two states. Lucid dreaming is characterized by more 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power than non-lucid dreaming, especially in frontal regions. Since it is 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power that has been correlated with waking consciousness in previous studies, it can be suggested that enough 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power has been added to the non-lucid dreaming brain to support the increase in subjective [[awareness]] that permits lucidity but not enough to cause full awakening.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

Dreaming is thus a [[virtual reality]] experience with a remarkably predictive simulation of external reality. Lucid dreamers may experience primary consciousness (the dream) and secondary consciousness (the waking) separately but simultaneously. Moreover, primary consciousness has recently been proposed by us to be characteristic of dreaming. It remains to be seen whether the enactment of dream behaviors uses the same brain processes as those that mediate those very behaviors in waking, and whether conscious within a dream is governed by the same processes.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

===In epileptic seizures===

Studies show that it is possible to retain primary consciousness and even [[secondary consciousness]] during [[complex partial seizure|complex partial epileptic seizures]]. One study analyzed 40 patients with complex partial seizures to determine their level of consciousness during seizures. The data acquired was based on patients' subjective descriptions of their experience and descriptions from family members who witnessed the seizures.&lt;ref name = Johanson/&gt; This study found there was a complete absence of consciousness in only 65% of people during the core period of the seizures. Meanwhile, 35% of seizures included some form of primary consciousness. Five seizure descriptions even reported some form of secondary consciousness, albeit short and intermittent. The level and contents of consciousness during epileptic seizures show considerable variability.&lt;ref name= Johanson/&gt;

===In thirst===

In one study, 10 adult males underwent [[positron emission tomography]] scans in three different scenarios:&lt;ref name=Denton&gt;Denton, D., Shade, R., Zamarippa, F., Egan, G., Blair-West, J., McKinley, M., et al. (1999). Neuroimaging of genesis and satiation of thirst and an interoceptor-driven theory of origins of primary consciousness. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', 96(9), 5304.&lt;/ref&gt;
# During generation of moderate thirst by infusion of [[intravenous]] [[hypertonic]] saline 0.51 M
# After wetting of the mouth with water to remove the sensation of dryness
# 3, 14, 45, and 60 minutes after drinking water to fully quench thirst

The data suggest that the anterior and posterior [[cingulate cortex]] as well as the anterior wall of the third [[ventricular system|ventricle]], are major elements of a circuit including [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites that are needed for the generation of consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Denton/&gt;
This study shows that consciousness of some key sensations like thirst is governed by the oldest regions of the brain, which raises the question of whether it is really then possible to say when primary consciousness developed.&lt;ref name= Denton/&gt;

=== In meditation ===

In some types of meditation/yoga it is possible to have the experience known as Samadhi, where there is inner alertness but no object of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.&lt;/ref&gt; This mental state corresponds with specific physiological parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, F. &amp; Pearsoon. C. (2000) Pure Consciousness: Distinct phenomenological and physiological correlates of "consciousness itself", ''International Journal of Neuroscience'', 100 pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''psychology of reasoning''' is the study of how people [[reason]], often broadly defined as the process of drawing conclusions to inform how people solve problems and make decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Leighton, J. P. (2004).  [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=o1Tn_nkUhYkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22Defining+and+describing+reason%22&amp;ots=2IMoo4LPgx&amp;sig=e-nUVBv3U4MkVoymC71IZBU7dRo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Defining%20and%20describing%20reason%22&amp;f=false Defining and describing reason], in ''The Nature of Reasoning'' (eds Leighton, J. P. and Sternberg, R. J.) Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It overlaps with [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[logic]], and [[probability theory]].

Psychological experiments on how humans and other animals reason have been carried out for over 100 years. An enduring question is whether or not people have the capacity to be rational. What does it mean to be [[rationality|rational]]? Current research in this area addresses various questions about reasoning, rationality, judgments, [[intelligence]], relationships between [[emotion]] and reasoning, and development.

==Everyday reasoning==
How do people reason about sentences in natural language?  Most experimentation on deduction has been carried out on hypothetical thought, in particular, examining how people reason about [[Material conditional|conditional]]s, e.g., ''If A then B''.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, J.St.B.T., Newstead, S. and Byrne, R.M.J. (1993). Human Reasoning: ''The Psychology of Deduction''.  Hove, UK, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;   Participants in experiments make the [[modus ponens]] inference, given the [[indicative conditional]] ''If A then B'', and given the premise ''A'', they conclude ''B''. However, given the indicative conditional and the minor premise for the [[modus tollens]] inference,  ''not-B'', about half of the participants in experiments conclude ''not-A'' and the remainder concludes that nothing follows.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;

The ease with which people make conditional inferences is affected by content, as demonstrated in the well-known  [[Wason selection task|selection task]] developed by [[Peter Wason]]. Participants are better able to test a conditional that contains sensible content, e.g., ''if the envelope is sealed then it must have a 50 cent stamp on it'' compared to one that contains symbolic content, e.g.,'' if the letter is a vowel then the number is even''.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt; Background knowledge can also lead to the suppression of even the simple modus ponens inference &lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (1989). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027789900188 Suppressing valid inferences with conditionals]. ''Cognition'', 31,61-83&lt;/ref&gt; Participants given the conditional ''if Lisa has an essay to write then she studies late in the library'' and the premise ''Lisa has an essay to write '' make the [[modus ponens]] inference 'she studies late in the library',  but the inference is suppressed when they are also given a second conditional ''if the library stays open then she studies late in the library''. Interpretations of the suppression effect are controversial &lt;ref&gt;Bonnefon, J-F. &amp; Hilton, D. (2002). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546780143000134 The suppression of modus ponens as a case of pragmatic preconditional reasoning]. ''Thinking and Reasoning'', 8, 21-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J., Espino, O. &amp; Santamaria, C.  (1999). Counterexamples and the suppression of  inferences." Journal of Memory &amp; Language", 40, 347-373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other investigations of propositional inference examine how people think about disjunctive alternatives, e.g., ''A or else B'', and how they reason about negation, e.g., ''It is not the case that A and B''. Many experiments have been carried out to examine how people make relational inferences, including comparisons, e.g., ''A is better than B''. Such investigations also concern spatial inferences, e.g. ''A is in front of B'' and temporal inferences, e.g. ''A occurs before B''.&lt;ref name="johnson-laird byrne deduction"&gt;[[Philip Johnson-Laird|Johnson-Laird, P.N.]] and Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). Deduction. Hillsdale: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Other common tasks include [[categorical syllogisms]], used to examine how people reason about quantifiers such as ''All'' or ''Some'', e.g., ''Some of the A are not B''.&lt;ref name="how we reason"&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2006). "How we reason". Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of reasoning ==
There are several alternative theories of the cognitive processes that human reasoning is based on.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. and Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2009).'If' and the problems of conditional reasoning. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 13, 282-287&lt;/ref&gt; One view is that people rely on a mental logic consisting of formal (abstract or syntactic) inference rules similar to those developed by logicians in the [[propositional calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, D. (2009). Human reasoning requires a mental logic. ''Behav. Brain Sci.'' 32, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that people rely on domain-specific or content-sensitive rules of inference.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L. et al. (2005) Detecting cheaters. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences''. 9,505–506&lt;/ref&gt; A third view is that people rely on [[mental models]], that is, mental representations that correspond to imagined possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. and Byrne, R.M.J. (2002) Conditionals: a theory of meaning, inference, and pragmatics. ''Psychol. Rev.'' 109, 646–678&lt;/ref&gt; The mental model theory is the subject of the [http://mentalmodelsblog.wordpress.com ''mental models website'']. A fourth view is that people compute probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Oaksford, M. and Chater, N. (2007) ''Bayesian Rationality''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

One controversial theoretical issue is the identification of an appropriate competence model, or a standard against which to compare human reasoning.   Initially [[classical logic]] was chosen as a competence model.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Peter Wason|Wason]], P. C. (1966). "Reasoning", in Foss, B. M.: New horizons in psychology. Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, some researchers opted for [[non-monotonic logic]]&lt;ref&gt;Da Silva Neves, R., Bonnefon, J. F., &amp; Raufaste, É. (2002). An empirical test for patterns of nonmonotonic inference. ''Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence'', 34, 107-130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Stenning|Stenning]], K. &amp; van Lambalgen, M. (2005). Semantic Interpretation as Computation in Nonmonotonic Logic: The Real Meaning of the Suppression Task.

(2001) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661300016995 The probabilistic approach to human reasoning]. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 5, 349-357&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[mental models and reasoning]] has led to the suggestion that people are rational in principle but err in practice.&lt;ref name="johnson-laird byrne deduction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="how we reason" /&gt;  Connectionist approaches towards reasoning have also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Sun|Sun]], R.

==Development of reasoning==
How does reasoning develop? [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]]&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K. F. M. van Lieshout (Eds.), Life-span developmental psychology (pp. 179-269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; describes a sequence of stages in the development of reasoning from infancy to adulthood. According to the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], changes in reasoning with development come from increasing [[working memory]] capacity, increasing [[speed of processing]], and enhanced [[executive functions]] and control. Increasing [[self-awareness]] is also an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., &amp; Spanoudis, G. (2010). The development of mental processing. Nesselroade, J. R. (2010). Methods in the study of life-span human development: Issues and answers. In W. F. Overton (Ed.), Biology, cognition and methods across the life-span. Volume 1 of the Handbook of life-span development (pp. 36-55), Editor-in-chief: R. M. Lerner. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different sorts of reasoning==
[[Inductive reasoning]] makes broad generalizations from specific cases or observations.  In this process of reasoning, general assertions are made based on past specific pieces of evidence.  This kind of reasoning allows the conclusion to be false even if the original statement is true.&lt;ref name=reisberg&gt;Reisberg, Daniel. (2013). Cognition: Exploring the Science of the Mind. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if one observes a college athlete, one makes predictions and assumptions about other college athletes based on that one observation. Scientists use inductive reasoning to create theories and hypotheses.&lt;ref name=livescience&gt;LiveScience Staff. (2012). Deductive Reasoning vs. Inductive Reasoning. Retrieved from http://www.livescience.com/21569-deduction-vs-induction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition, [[deductive reasoning]] is a basic form of valid reasoning.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt;  In this reasoning process a person starts with a known claim or a general belief and from there asks what follows from these foundations or how will these premises influence other beliefs.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt;  In other words, deduction starts with a hypothesis and examines the possibilities to reach a conclusion.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt;  Deduction helps people understand why their predictions are wrong and indicates that their prior knowledge or beliefs are off track.   An example of deduction can be seen in the scientific method when testing hypotheses and theories.  Although the conclusion usually corresponds and therefore proves the hypothesis, there are some cases where the conclusion is logical, but the generalization is not.  For example, the argument, “All young girls wear skirts.  Julie is a young girl.  Therefore, Julie wears skirts,” is valid logically, but is not sound because the first premise isn't true.

The [[syllogism]] is a form of deductive reasoning in which two statements reach a logical conclusion.  With this reasoning, one statement could be “Every A is B” and another could be “This C is A”.  Those two statements could then lead to the conclusion that “This C is B”.  These types of syllogisms are used to test deductive reasoning to ensure there is a valid hypothesis.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt;  A Syllogistic Reasoning Task was created from a study performed by Morsanyi, Kinga, Handley, and Simon that examined the intuitive contributions to reasoning.  They used this test to assess why “syllogistic reasoning performance is based on an interplay between a conscious and effortful evaluation of logicality and an intuitive appreciation of the believability of the conclusions”.&lt;ref&gt;Morsanyi, Kinga; Handley, Simon J. (2011). Syllogistic Reasoning Task. doi:10.1037/t09520-000&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of reasoning is called [[abductive reasoning]].  This type is based on creating and testing hypotheses using the best information available.  Abductive reasoning produces the kind of daily decision-making that works best with the information present, which often is incomplete.  This could involve making educated guesses from observed unexplainable phenomena.  This type of reasoning can be seen in the world when doctors make decisions about diagnoses from a set of results or when jurors use the relevant evidence to make decisions about a case.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt;

==Judgment and reasoning==
Judgment and reasoning involve thinking through the options, making a judgment or conclusion and finally making a decision. Making judgments involves heuristics, or efficient strategies that usually lead you to the right answers.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt; The most common heuristics used are attribute substitution, the [[availability heuristic]], the [[representativeness heuristic]] and the [[anchoring]] heuristic – these all aid in quick reasoning and work in most situations. Heuristics allow for errors, a price paid to gain efficiency.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt;
 
Other errors in judgment, therefore affecting reasoning, include errors in judgment about covariation – a relationship between two variables such that the presence and magnitude of one can predict the presence and magnitude of the other.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt; One cause of covariation is [[confirmation bias]], or the tendency to be more responsive to evidence that confirms your beliefs. But assessing covariation can be pulled off track by neglecting base-rate information – how frequently something occurs in general.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt; However people often ignore base rates and tend to use other information presented.
 
There are more sophisticated judgment strategies that result in fewer errors. People often reason based on availability but sometimes they look for other, more accurate, information to make judgments.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, D.M. (2004). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.7365&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Spontaneous discounting of availability in frequency judgment tasks]. Psychological Science, 15, 100-105.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests there are two ways of thinking, known as the [[Dual process theory|Dual-Process Model]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J. S. B. T. (2012a). Dual-process theories of deductive reasoning: Facts and fallacies. In Holyoak, K. J., &amp; Morrison, R. G. (Eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNdBAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dual-process%22&amp;f=false The Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning] (pp. 115-133). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The first, System I, is fast, automatic and uses heuristics – more of intuition. The second, System II, is slower, effortful and more likely to be correct – more reasoning.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt;

==Pragmatics and reasoning==
* How do various related factors such as linguistic [[pragmatics]] and [[emotion]] relate to the inferences people draw?&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Noveck, I. A. (2004) Pragmatic Inferences Related to Logical Terms. In Noveck, I. A. &amp; [[Dan Sperber|Sperber]], D. (ed.), ''Experimental Pragmatics'', Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanchette, I. &amp; Richards, A. (2004). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00751.x Reasoning about emotional and neutral materials]. Is logic affected by emotion? ''Psychological Science'', 15, 745-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Decision making is often influenced by the emotion of regret and the element of risk. People are strongly motivated by regret and we can see this when they select options they tend to select the option that they will regret the least trying to minimize the amount of regret we will have.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, T., &amp; Zeelenberg, M. (2002). [http://www.bbs.sciopsy.com/viewthread.php?tid=2761&amp;extra=&amp;page=1 Regret in decision making]. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 11, 212-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Many decisions also include a large element of risk, and in these cases people tend to ask themselves what the level of risk is. They ask themselves how much dread they would experience when thinking about a nuclear accident, and then use that dread as an indicator of risk.&lt;ref&gt;Slovic, P., et al., (2002). The affect heuristic. In t. Gilvoch, D. Griffen, &amp; New York, NY: Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; We ask “how does this make me feel?” rather than “how risky is this?”

[[Antonio Damasio]] suggests that [[Somatic marker hypothesis|somatic markers]], certain memories that can cause a strong bodily reaction, act as a way to guide decision making as well. For example, when you are remembering a scary movie and once again become tense and your palms might begin to sweat. Damasio argues that when making a decision we rely on our “gut feelings” to assess various options, and this makes us decide to go with a decision that is more positive and stay away from those that are negative.&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A.R. (1994) Descartes’ error: Emotion reason, and the human brain. New York, NY: Putnam.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that the orbitofrontal cortex - located at the base of the frontal lobe, just above the eyes - is crucial in your use of somatic markers, because it is the part in the brain that allows you to interpret emotion.

Another note to make is that when emotion shapes decisions, the influence is usually based on predictions of the future. When people ask themselves how they would react, they are making inferences about the future. Researchers suggest [[affective forecasting]], the ability to predict your own emotions, is poor because people tend to overestimate how much they will regret their errors.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Morewedge, Risen, &amp; Wilson, T. D. (2004). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00681.x Looking forward to looking backward]. Psychology Science, 15, 346-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience of reasoning==
* What are the neural correlates of reasoning, often investigated using [[event-related potentials]] and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]?&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Goel, V. (2005). Cognitive Neuroscience of Deductive Reasoning.  In Holyoak, K. J. &amp; Morrison, R. G. (ed.). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Racial equality''' occurs when [[institution]]s give [[equal opportunity]] to people of all [[race (human categorization)|races]]. In other words, institutions ignore persons' racial [[phenotypic trait|physical traits]] or [[skin color]], and give everyone legally, morally, and politically equal opportunity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/racial-equality |title=Racial Equality - Dictionary definition of Racial Equality |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western world|Western society]] today, there is more [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] and more [[racial integration|integration]] among races. Initially, attaining equality has been difficult for [[black people|African]], [[Asian people|Asian]], and [[Latino]] people, especially in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Landauro |first=Victor |title=Racial Equality |work=Junior Scholastic |page=10-1 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |date=26 April 2004 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[United States]], racial equality, has become a law that regardless of what race an individual is, they will receive equal treatment, opportunity, education, employment, and politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Background==

===Civil War===
Slavery was the key to the start of the bloodiest and most traumatic war in America's history. The American Civil War was fought from 1861 to 1865. By 1860 one in three persons in the Southern States belonged to another, in a population of twelve million, four million were slaves. In September 1862 Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation, which avowed the aim of freeing the slaves in the Confederacy, and made abolition one of the North's central war aims.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Civil War|last=Davies|first=Phil|publisher=Pocket Essentials|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North took the victory. Did the end of the war represent a gain or a loss for the country? The war represents a defeat for freedom simply to be let alone, for the beneficiaries of inherited wealth or those who prefer to live on the margins of society, but a victory for those, like the immigrants from Europe and the newly emancipated blacks, who needed government to provide the necessary conditions for the pursuit of happiness.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Struggle of African American society==

===Post War equality===
Four million slaves were freed by the result of the American Civil War. In a few years later the South's elite white was in control again. Economic power was the main reason. Deprived of control over the means of earning a living, the blacks were forced into dependence on white landowners.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The blacks worked as farm laborers, or as tenants under the sharecropping system. The biggest problem was the blacks were at the mercy of their white bosses, who would tell them how to vote. Segregations of schools, healthcare and housing became entrenched in the South and the black was relegated to the status of second-class citizen.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Health===
The health of many residents differed depended on areas of living. The poor inner-cities did not or lack the necessary health care that was available in outside areas. Many of the inner-city's location was the main cause for this problem. They were isolated from other parts of society which was a large contributor to the poor health of these residents. Also, the overcrowded living conditions added to the poor health of the residents by the spread of infectious diseases.

==Martin Luther King Jr.==
[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] is better known as a civil rights leader in the United States concerning racial equality. Martin Luther King Jr. became one of the greatest leaders due to his stance concerning various mistreated African-American men and women in the South.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=African American Almanac : 400 Years of Triumph, Courage and Excellence|last=Carney|first=Jessie|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2011|isbn=9781578593231|location=|pages=45–50|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he played many roles in society and won an award for the movement he conducted. Martin Luther King Jr. not only took part in the [[Montgomery bus boycott]], became a key speaker at the March on Washington, and was one of the youngest individuals to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], but he also handled his opinion in a peaceful manner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; King kept his anger toward the idea of [[Racial segregation|segregation of race]] to himself; however, he did show his passion of equality in his speeches and [[peaceful protest]].

King displayed his very first [[civil rights movement]] by voluntarily taking a stance in the Montgomery bus boycott. The bus boycott had started by [[Rosa Parks]] refusing to give up her seat for a white male after a long and tiring day at work. Thus, after Park's arrest, King gathered the black community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in hopes for boycotting against the bus, by cutting the use of transportation. This boycott continued on for 382 days. Although, King had to overcome many attacks towards him such as arrest, and violent harassment, the result was their (African-Americans) first victory: black men and women were allowed to ride the buses in Montgomery equally as the whites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Rosa Parks==
Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913 in Montgomery, Alabama. She attended the all-black [[Alabama State College]], and soon worked at [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) as a secretary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rosa Parks had become an activists by an event that triggered other events to occur. On December 1, 1955&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parks had taken the bus home from work, when all of a sudden she was being forced to give up her seat for a white male. Rosa Parks had been frustrated of the way black individuals were treated; thus, she refused and was arrested and fined $14.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Parks' refusal and arrest had caused a dilemma for white individuals, especially for the ones that owned the bus business. The Montgomery bus boycott had started to desegregate public transportation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, Martin Luther King Jr. had gotten involved to not only motivate the mistreated African-American population, but to share his passion of equality. This boycott lasted 382 days and ended on December 21, 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the end of the bus boycott, both Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. had become national heroes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the Supreme Court passed a law which declared it unconstitutional to segregate on Montgomery buses.

==Groups and organizations==

===Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)===
Martin Luther King Jr. was the founder of [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], by having summoned various numbers of black leaders in 1957.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He became the President of this activist group and decided to improve communities by managing peaceful protests and boycotts regarding the social ethics of discrimination and segregation between races.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===National Association of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)===
First created on February 12, 1909 in Springfield, Illinois.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.naacp.org/oldest-and-boldest/|title=NAACP {{!}} Oldest and Boldest|newspaper=NAACP|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was against violence that was directed towards African Americans. There objective was to eliminate racial inequality, and guarantee the political, educational, social and economic equality for citizens. Their office was located in New York.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Moorfield Storey was named president, while, Du Bois, was the only African American Director of Publications.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Congress of Racial Equality===
There was a [[civil rights]] group called [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) that came together to fight corruption and segregation in a nonviolent manner. CORE grew profoundly after the 1950s, beginning with [[James Farmer]] who later became the leader of the group and a civil rights activist in 1941. He went back to his "Native South" and visited to a local movie theater, where he came upon the "crow's nest", an area that was reserved for blacks. He opposed the [[Jim Crow laws]]. He realized that his friends and himself supported those laws by what they did in their daily actions. He soon wrote a memo and summoned for the formation of a group of individuals that were powerful from mind and body to be able to take personal nonviolent actions to end [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=1035898|title=The Congress of Racial Equality and Its Strategy on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CORE was established in 1942 in Chicago. It was a branch of a "Peace-Lover" organization, which was called the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (FOR). CORE used nonviolent actions procedures that involved sit-ins, which were done in lunch counters in Chicago. By 1947, CORE contributed with an interracial bus ride across the upper part of the South. They were testing state buses that the [[U.S Supreme Court]] ordered to be desegregated, which was the ''[[Morgan v. Virginia]]'' decision in 1946. This led to some success for the facilities that were testing out the orders they were given, but it didn't grab much attention especially in the national level, which was their main goal. By 1960, there was a new wave of nonviolent [[direct action]] protests that initiated through the student [[sit-in movement]]. CORE's national director James Farmer repeated the [[Journey of Reconciliation]]. Another Supreme Court ruling, ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'' (1960), ordered a stop to segregation in the interstate bus terminals. That came to be the Freedom Rides. The [[Freedom Riders]] traveled deep into the south and were attacked by segregationists along Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;KIRK, JOHN A. "Please Help Us": The Fort Smith Congress Of Racial Equality Chapter, 1962-1965." Arkansas Historical Quarterly 73.3 (2014): 293-317. Academic Search Complete. Web. 5 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

CORE began in the North and was mainly concentrated in public areas. About two decades ago, the North had segregated spots where blacks were not allowed. Those places, for example, were restaurants, bowling alleys, skating rinks, and barber shops. More successful efforts were the work settings where there were some experiments with interracial workers and in housing co-operatives. CORE's main focus was to increase public recognition in the north. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, CORE moved to the border states of Missouri, Maryland, and Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rich, Marvin. "The Congress of Racial Equality and Its Strategy". ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 357 (1965): 113–118. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accomplishments of CORE and NAACP=== 
In the first few weeks of April the two groups CORE and NAACP combined forces to make a change in racial equality. Both the groups protesters constructed a plan to shut down construction of the city's Municipal Services Building, by marching in front of Mayor James Tate's North Philadelphia row house.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|year=2004|title=Affirmative Action from Below: Civil Rights, the Building Trades, and the Politics of Racial Equality in the Urban North, 1945-1969|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2068/central/docview/224893942/fulltext/D9AE847082174E94PQ/1?accountid=40611|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=|pages=145-173|via=ProQuest Central}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many protesters had engaged in various fights involving police and white unionists.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Moreover, the two groups had caused many debates to open up regarding racial politics, discrimination, and employment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Technique ====
CORE's technique was always nonviolence as the method of fighting [[racial injustice]]. CORE was the first organization to use nonviolent actions in order to stop many issues that affected the black community. The student sit-ins started in February 1960. Within the year, 130 eating locations opened up in the southern communities. They were interested in how CORE approached the issue of segregation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%253A4978|title=This is CORE. {{!}} ucf.digital.flvc.org|website=ucf.digital.flvc.org|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion ====
CORE grew in the early 1940s, but continued to be composed of small groups. They persisted in being small because of the students who were part of the organization. The students would graduate and move away. Also, others were fighting for a specific cause and once the issue has been dealt with, they disappeared. CORE was only a voluntary organization; there was no paid staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Main goals ====
In the South:
*[[Desegregation]]
*[[Voter registration]]

In the North:
*Better jobs
*Better housing
*[[School integration in the United States|School integration]]

Many outsiders started to notice the efforts of the group. They supported them and started the Freedom Rides.  CORE was more involved in the [[Black Power]] movement around the mid-1960s. Then things shifted to integration and nonviolent actions toward the organization of communities, the separation of the people, and Black Power. Also, as whites and blacks started to work together to fight over the dilemmas of segregation, white liberals weren't fond of the idea that they were working together. CORE's issues changed over time, so they worked on different actions that would come up.

==Protests==

===Sit-ins===
[[Sit-in]]s, the oldest technique, have been used by CORE the most. CORE divided people into three different groups: one with all black individuals, one with all whites, and one that was interracial. These three different groups would go to a segregated eating area before the busiest hour and wait to be attended quietly. This was used to open up restaurants, and was later used for other locations.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Standing in line===
This was used at cafeterias, ticket booths, and other places where one stands in a line in order to be served. If someone is refused, the CORE members who might be in line before him/her will also refuse to step out of line and interrupt service. CORE did this at movie theaters in Kentucky, and at a swimming pool at Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey. This technique was also important for stopping segregation.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==In the twenty-first century==

===Attitudes===
Since 1942, two particular issues have evolved in racial equality.  One is the handling of blacks to ensure equality, which was favored by the white community, and the other is the differences between southerners and non-southerners. These two issues were observed by the [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC). They made questions that plotted five main topics that targeted blacks at the time. The five points that affected racial equality and tracked during the years 1965–1980 were ''year, region, cohort, and education''.&lt;ref name=Case&gt;Case, Charles E., and Andrew M. Greeley. "Attitudes Toward Racial Equality." Humboldt Journal of Social Relations 16.1 (1990): 67-94. ProQuest. Web. 1 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many educational systems in the south and non-southern areas were in favor of segregated educational institutions among blacks. They also didn't want blacks near their neighborhood or [[interracial marriage]]s to happen.&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

==Laws==

===Thirteenth Amendment===
The abolishment of slavery in all states.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Edward|year=2014|title=THE ORIGINS OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN AMERICA.|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2240/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=146eced3-29c2-4279-8bd6-dfaf5495365f%40sessionmgr4006&amp;hid=4207&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100183276&amp;db=fth|journal=Case Western Reserve Law Review|volume=64|pages=755-816|via=EBSCO host}}{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ring of Gyges''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|ˌ|dʒ|iː|z}} ({{lang-grc-gre|Γύγου Δακτύλιος}}) is a [[mythology|mythical]] [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] artifact mentioned by the [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]] in Book 2 of his ''[[Plato's Republic|Republic]]'' (2:359a–2:360d).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/631825| jstor = 631825| title = Ringing the Changes on Gyges: Philosophy and the Formation of Fiction in Plato's Republic| journal = [[Journal of Hellenic Studies]]| volume = 121| pages = 12–29| year = 2001| last1 = Laird | first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grants its owner the power to become [[invisibility|invisible]] at will. Through the story of the ring, ''Republic'' considers whether an intelligent person would be moral if they did not have to fear being caught and punished for doing injustices.

==The legends==
[[Gyges of Lydia]] was a historical king, the founder of the [[Mermnad dynasty]] of [[Lydia]]n kings. Various ancient works—the most well-known being ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 1.7–13&lt;/ref&gt;—gave different accounts of the circumstances of his rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Kirby Flower | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1902 | title = The Tale of Gyges and the King of Lydia | journal = [[American Journal of Philology]] | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 361–387 | publisher =  | jstor = 288700 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; All, however, agree in asserting that he was originally a subordinate of King [[Candaules]] of [[Lydia]], that he killed Candaules and seized the throne, and that he had either seduced Candaules' Queen before killing him, married her afterwards, or both.

In [[Glaucon]]'s recounting of the myth, an unnamed ancestor of Gyges&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeplato|Republic|359d|gr}}: "τῷ [Γύγου] τοῦ Λυδοῦ προγόνῳ". In ''Republic'', Book 10 ({{Citeplato|Republic|612b}}), Socrates refers to the ring as "the ring of Gyges" ({{lang|grc|τὸν Γύγου [[wikt:δακτύλιος|δακτύλιον]]}}). For this reason, the story is simply called "The Ring of Gyges".&lt;/ref&gt; was a shepherd in the service of the ruler of Lydia. After an earthquake, a cave was revealed in a mountainside where he was feeding his flock. Entering the cave, he discovered that it was in fact a tomb with a bronze horse containing a [[cadaver|corpse]], larger than that of a man, who wore a [[gold]]en [[finger ring|ring]], which he pocketed. He discovered that the ring gave him the power to become invisible by adjusting it. He then arranged to be chosen as one of the messengers who reported to the king as to the status of the flocks. Arriving at the palace, he used his new power of invisibility to seduce the queen, and with her help he murdered the king, and became king of Lydia himself.

==The role of the legend in ''Republic''==
In ''Republic'', the tale of the ring of Gyges is described by the character of Glaucon who is the brother of Plato. Glaucon asks whether any man can be so [[virtue|virtuous]] that he could resist the temptation of being able to perform any act without being known or discovered. Glaucon suggests that [[morality]] is only a [[social construction]], the source of which is the desire to maintain one's reputation for virtue and justice. Hence, if that sanction were removed, one's moral character would evaporate.

Glaucon posits:

{{quote|Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a god among men.

Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust.

For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.
|Plato|''Republic'', 360b–d ([[Benjamin Jowett|Jowett]] trans.)}}

Though his answer to Glaucon's challenge is delayed, Socrates ultimately argues that justice does not derive from this social construct: the man who abused the power of the Ring of Gyges has in fact enslaved himself to his appetites, while the man who chose not to use it remains rationally in control of himself and is therefore happy. (Republic 10:612b)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Tolkien was influenced by Plato's story, a search on "Gyges" and "Plato" in his letters and biography provides no evidence for this.  Unlike Plato's ring, Tolkien's exerts an active malevolent force that necessarily destroys the morality of the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, ''The Lord of the Ring'', Book I, Chapter 2, "The Shadow of the Past".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cicero retells the story of Gyges in ''[[De Officiis]]'' to illustrate his thesis that a wise or good individual bases decisions on a fear of moral degradation as opposed to punishment or negative consequences.  Cicero follows with a discussion of the role of [[thought experiment]]s in philosophy.  The hypothetical situation in question is complete immunity from punishment of the kind afforded to Gyges by his ring.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Officiis]]'' 3.38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for the Study of Evolution''' is a professional organization of [[evolutionary biologists]]. It was formed in the [[United States]] in 1946 to promote [[evolution]] and the integration of various fields of science concerned with evolution and to organize the publication of a scientific journal to report on new research on evolution across a variety of fields.

The Society was established at a meeting in St. Louis on March 30, 1946. Fifty-seven scientists attended the meeting, which was chaired by [[Alfred E. Emerson]]. [[George Gaylord Simpson]] was elected as the Society's first President, with [[E. B. Babcock]], Emerson, and [[J. T. Patterson]] as his Vice-presidents and [[Ernst Mayr]] as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Joseph. 1994.

For the 'promotion' and 'integration' of various fields: first years of ''Evolution'', 1947-1949. ''Archives of Natural History'' '''27''': 231-259.&lt;/ref&gt; This society grew as an extension of the US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]'s Committee on Common Problems of Genetics and Paleontology (later renamed the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology and Systematics).&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Joe, ed. 2004.

''Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences''. ''33'': 283-313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual meeting of the society was held in Boston, December 28–31, 1946. A grant from the [[American Philosophical Society]] led to the publication of the journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''.

Commonly known as 'evolution meeting,' the annual conference is often held together with the [[Society of Systematic Biologists]] and the [[American Society of Naturalists]].

The society has an official journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. It was started in 1947 and is published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Evolution''|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15585646|website=Wiley Online Library|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it launched a second journal ''Evolution Letters''.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20563744&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solitary confinement''' is a form of [[imprisonment]] distinguished by living in single cells with little or no contact to other inmates, strict measures to control [[contraband]], and the use of additional security measures and equipment. It is specifically designed for disruptive inmates that are security risks to other inmates, the prison staff, or the prison itself. It is mostly employed for violations of discipline, such as [[murder]], [[hostage-taking]], [[deadly assault]], and [[riot]]ing. However, it is also used as a measure of protection for inmates, whose safety is threatened by other inmates. Prison authorities consider solitary confinement an administrative placement measure, not a punishment.

Solitary confinement is colloquially referred to in [[American English]] as "the hotbox", "the hole", "AdSeg" (administrative segregation), the "SHU" (pronounced "shoe"), an acronym for "Special Housing Unit" or "Security Housing Unit"; in [[Australian English]] as "the Slot" or "the Pound"; in [[British English]] as "the block", "The Segregation Unit", or "the cooler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/5559761/Army-captain-was-real-life-Cooler-King-from-The-Great-Escape.html |title=Army captain was real life 'Cooler King' from The Great Escape |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |author=&lt;!--no by-line--&gt; |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/3517476.stm |title=Cooler King recalls Great Escape |work=[[BBC News]] |author=&lt;!--no by-line--&gt; |date=16 March 2004 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called prison "'segregation' and 'restrictive housing.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Solitary confinement has received severe criticism for having detrimental psychological effects&lt;ref name="arrigo" /&gt; and, to some and in some cases, constituting [[torture]].&lt;ref name="gawande9" /&gt; According to a 2017 review study, "a robust scientific literature has established the negative psychological effects of solitary confinement", leading to "an emerging consensus among correctional as well as professional, mental health, legal, and human rights organizations to drastically limit the use of solitary confinement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haney|first=Craig|date=2017-11-03|title=Restricting the Use of Solitary Confinement|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092326|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092326|issn=2572-4568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical controversy ==

Research surrounding the possible psychological and physiological effects of solitary confinement dates back to the 1830s. When the new prison discipline of separate confinement was introduced at the [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in Philadelphia in 1829, commentators attributed the high rates of mental breakdown to the system of isolating prisoners in their cells. Charles Dickens, who visited the Philadelphia Penitentiary during his travels to America, described the "slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Notes|last=Dickens|first=Charles|publisher=Chapman and Hall|year=1842|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison records from the Denmark institute in 1870 to 1920 indicate that staff noticed inmates were exhibiting signs of mental illnesses while in isolation, revealing that the persistent problem has been around for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter Scharff |last=Smith |title='Degenerate Criminals': Mental Health and Psychiatric Studies of Danish Prisoners in Solitary Confinement, 1870–1920 |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |date=August 2008 |volume=35 |number=8 |pages=1048–1064 |doi=10.1177/0093854808318782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first comment by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] about solitary confinement's effect on prisoner mental status was made in 1890 (In re Medley 134 U.S. 160).&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/In_re_Medley/Opinion_of_the_Court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; In it the court found that the use of solitary confinement produced reduced mental and physical capabilities.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; The use of solitary confinement in prisons was first introduced to regulate unruly prisoners and keep them away from the rest of the prison society (Haney, Craig; Lynch, Mona). However, solitary confinement has been linked to several developments of mental disorders, one of which being [[Ganser syndrome]]. A man developed Ganser syndrome after being held in solitary confinement for a long term sentence; however, that development is seen as rare and is unlikely in most cases.

The effects of solitary confinement on mental health are undeniable. According to the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry online, solitary confinement can cause an array of mental disorders, as well as provoke an already existing mental disorder in a prisoner, causing more trauma and symptoms. Solitary confinement is a form of imprisonment practiced worldwide, but no positive effects of the punishment have been proven (Jaapl). Nonetheless, penal confinement involving solitude has been described as having a beneficent effect on [[anthrophobes]].{{citation needed|reason=Cannot find source – Murchinson was 13 in 1900 and JGP didn't exist until 1924|date=June 2016}} &lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murchison |first1=Carl |title=The Journal of Genetic Psychology |date=1900 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Use ==
The practice is used when a prisoner is considered dangerous to themselves or to others, is suspected of organizing or being engaged in illegal activities outside of the prison, or, as in the case of a prisoner such as a [[pedophilia|pedophile]] or [[witness]], is at a high risk of being harmed by another inmate or inmates. The latter example is a form of [[protective custody]]. Solitary confinement is also the norm in [[supermax prison]]s where prisoners who are deemed dangerous or of high risk are held. It may be hard to determine the number of people currently being held in solitary confinement because some prisons have a hard time defining it. However, it is estimated that 80,000 to 100,000 people are currently in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Effects and access to care ===
The effects of solitary confinement on juveniles can be highly detrimental to their growth. The isolation of solitary confinement can cause anguish, provoke serious mental and physical health problems, and work against rehabilitation for juveniles.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kysel |first=Ian |title=Growing Up Locked Down: Youth in Solitary Confinement in Jails and Prisons in the United States |date=October 2012 |journal=&lt;!--Joint report by ACLU/HRW--&gt; |publisher=[[ACLU]] &amp; [[Human Rights Watch]] |location=U.S. |isbn=1-56432-949-6 |format=PDF |url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us1012ForUpload.pdf |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Because young people are still developing, traumatic experiences like solitary confinement may have a profound effect on their chance to rehabilitate and grow.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;  Solitary confinement can worsen both short- and long-term psychological and physical problems or make it more likely that such problems will develop.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|22}} The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Human Rights Watch]] created a report that incorporated the testimony of some juvenile inmates. Many interviews described how their placement in solitary confinement exacerbated the stresses of being in jail or prison. Many spoke of harming themselves with staples or razors, having hallucinations, losing touch with reality, and having thoughts of or attempting suicide – all this while having very limited access to health care.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|29–35}}

Juveniles in solitary confinement are routinely denied access to treatment, services, and programming required to meet their medical, psychological, developmental, social, and rehabilitative needs.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|3,92}}  The ACLU and the Human Rights Watch have made recommendations at both a State and Federal level regarding their lack of access to medical services etc.

As well as severe and damaging psychological effects, solitary confinement manifests physiologically as well. Solitary confinement has been reported to cause [[hypertension]], [[headaches]] and [[migraines]], profuse sweating, [[dizziness]], and [[heart palpitations]]. Many inmates also experience extreme weight loss due to digestion complications and abdominal pain. Many of these symptoms are due to the intense anxiety and sensory deprivation. Inmates can also experience neck and back pain and muscle stiffness due to long periods of little to no physical activity. These symptoms often worsen with repeated visit to solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy Corcoran|first1=Mary|title=Effects of Solitary Confinement on the Well Being of Prison Inmates|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2015/spring/corcoran|website=NYU Steinhardt Department of Applied Psychology|publisher=NYU Steinhardt|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legality ===
The [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on Torture and other UN bodies have stated that the solitary confinement (physical and social isolation of 22–24 hours per day for 1 day or more) of young people under age 18, for any duration, constitutes cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

==== Human rights ====
In the UK, the state has a duty to “set the highest standards of care” when it limits the liberties of children.&lt;ref name=alex2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crook |first=Frances |title=Where Is Child Protection in Penal Custody? |date=September 2006 |journal=Criminal Behavior &amp; Mental Health |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=137–141 |doi=10.1002/cbm.627 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbm.627/abstract |subscription=yes |access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe, Frances Crook included, that incarceration and solitary confinement are the harshest forms of possible punishments and “should only be taken as a last resort.” &lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Additionally, because children are still mentally developing, incarceration should not encourage them to commit more violent crimes.&lt;ref name= alex2 /&gt;

==== Effects ====
The [[penal system]] has been cited as failing to protect juveniles in custody.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; In the UK, “twenty-nine children have died in penal custody in 1990. Some 41% of the children in custody were officially designated as being vulnerable.”&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; This is attributed to the fact that isolation and physical restraint are being used as the first response to punish them for simple rule infractions.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Moreover, Frances Crook argues that these punitive policies not only violate their basic rights, but also leave the children mentally unstable and left with illnesses that are often ignored.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Overall, the solitary confinement of youth is considered to be counterproductive because the “restrictive environment…and intense regulation of children” aggravates them, instead of addressing the issue of rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt;

===History in the United States===
The [[penal system]] in the United States developed under two separate systems known as the [[Auburn system]] and [[Separate system|Pennsylvania system]].&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; The current system of solitary confinement was derived originally from the Pennsylvania model which was characterized by "isolation and seclusion." &lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Evidence has shown that [[Quakers]] and [[Calvinists]] supported solitary confinement as an alternative form of punishment. At the time it was meant to provide a prisoner with solitude “to reflect on his misdeeds” and restore his relationship with God.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griest|first=Stephanie Elizondo|title=The Torture of Solitary Confinement|url=http://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/spring-2012-the-age-of-connection/the-torture-of-solitary/|date=Spring 2012|journal=[[The Wilson Quarterly]]|volume=36|issue=2|pages=22–29|access-date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitary confinement was intended as an alternative to public floggings which were common at the time. In 1818, New York reformer and Friend, [[Thomas Eddy]], lobbied for [[Penal labour|inmate labor]] and solitary confinement in place of other forms of punishment such as [[hanging]]. Shortly after, New York decided to include solitary confinement and inmate labor into their penal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Graber|title='When Friends Had the Management It Was Entirely Different': Quakers and Calvinists in the Making of New York Prison Discipline|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/254531|journal=Quaker History|date=Fall 2008|volume=97|number=2|pages=19–40|doi=10.1353/qkh.0.0011|subscription=yes|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|US Federal Prison system]], solitary confinement is known as the Special Housing Unit (SHU),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/mcr/MCR_visit_hours.pdf Institution Supplement – Visiting Regulations, USP McCreary] (from the Bureau of Prisons, US Department of Justice website. Retrieved 1 May 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced like "shoe" ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|uː}}). California's prison system also uses the abbreviation SHU, but it stands for Security Housing Units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Facilities_Locator/COR.html Visitors, State Prison, Corcoran (CSP-COR)], from the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] website. (Retrieved 12 June 2016.)&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, it is known as the Special Management Unit (SMU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solitarywatch.com/2011/05/22/voices-from-solitary-an-insane-asylum-disguised-as-an-smu/ |title=Voices from Solitary: An Insane Asylum Disguised As an SMU |publisher=[[Solitary Watch]] |date=22 May 2011 |first1=James|last1=Ridgeway |first2=Jean|last2=Casella}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current estimates of the number of inmates held in solitary confinement are difficult to determine, though generally the minimum held at any given time has been determined to be 20,000, with estimates as high as 80,000.&lt;ref name="naday"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naday|first1=Alexandra|last2=Freilich|first2=Joshua|last3=Mellow|first3=Jeff|title=The Elusive Data on Supermax Confinement|url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/69|journal=[[The Prison Journal]]|volume=88|number=1|date=March 2008|pages=69–93|doi=10.1177/0032885507310978|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Juveniles ===
Juveniles are held in solitary confinement in jails and prisons across the United States, often for days, weeks, months, or even years in order to punish, protect, house, or treat some of the youth held there.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|2}} There is significant controversy surrounding the use of solitary confinement in cases of juveniles.

===Troubled Teen Industry===
The Troubled Teen Industry is a loosely connected series of for-profit [[wilderness therapy]] programs, boot camps, [[therapeutic boarding schools]], and [[residential treatment centers]].  These facilities house youth after parents sign away custody of their children.  These children can be sent to these facilities for any reason, without committing a crime, without a trial, and without legal representation.  Solitary confinement is used widely in these programs, including wilderness programs, where children are left alone for weeks in the wilderness.  Some programs place children in solitary rooms.  Other times, "code silence," or "comm block," is used, which means that the child is not allowed to speak, and the other inmates must ignore them and pretend they do not exist.  This practice was documented at [[Island View Residential Treatment Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://testkitchen.huffingtonpost.com/island-view/|title=The Troubled-Teen Industry Has Been A Disaster For Decades. It's Still Not Fixed.|website=The Troubled-Teen Industry Has Been A Disaster For Decades. And It's Still Not Fixed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychiatric hospitals===
Patients in psychiatric hospitals are often put into solitary confinement, usually for 24 hours at a time, when staff members determine that they are a danger to themselves or others.

===Federal prisons ===
The use of SHUs within the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] is regulated under {{CodeFedReg|28|541}}. When placed in the SHU, prisoners are either in "administrative detention status", a non-punitive status which removes prisoners from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of correctional facilities, or protect the public, or "disciplinary segregation status", a punitive status imposed only by a Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) as a sanction for committing prohibited acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscfr|28|541|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 100 prohibited acts, all of which may result in solitary confinement, including unauthorized physical contact such as kissing, using abusive or obscene language, feigning illness, [[Right to petition in the United States|circulating a petition]], insolence towards a staff member, engaging in or encouraging a group [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration or protest]], and participating in or encouraging a [[strike action|labor strike]] (also known as a [[prison strike]]), gang activity, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscfr|28|541|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State prisons and municipal jails ===

He has been in SHU for over 20 years after violent incidents directed at prison staff.

He is currently serving a sentence of 82 years to [[Life imprisonment|life]] at [[Five Points Correctional Facility]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Luis Rosado, known as 'Blue Boy', is another prisoner with a violent history facing indefinite solitary confinement in New York State's Correctional system.

Solitary confinement is becoming more and more popular throughout the U.S. with some "supermax" prisons have nothing but solitary confinement cells. "Some people are held in solitary confinement in special "supermax" prisons, such as California's Pelican Bay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5584254|title=At Pelican Bay Prison, a Life in Solitary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia's Red Onion, and the federal government's ADX in Florence, Colorado. At least 44 states&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urban.org/uploadedPDF/411326_supermax_prisons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal system now have supermax prisons, which are generally composed solely of solitary confinement cells. Other prisoners live in SHUs, RHUs, and IMUs within ordinary prisons, and even inside local jails."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== California ====
When California opened its first "adjustment center", the goal was to return prisoners to the mainline prison population and ultimately to a society through an enrichment program of psychological and social services.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haney|first1=Craig |last2=Lynch|first2=Mona |title=Regulating Prisons of the Future: A Psychological Analysis of Supermax and Solitary Confinement |journal=[[New York University School of Law|NYU]] Rev. Law &amp; Social Change |year=1997 |volume=23 |pages=478–558 |url=http://www.probono.net/prisoners/stopsol-reports/416694.Regulating_Prisons_of_the_Future |access-date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the plan was never executed. In 1983, [[George Deukmejian]] was elected as the California governor and during his time, he formed what was then the state's newest prison – a massive, windowless “security housing unit” (SHU). SHU was intended to segregate over a thousand prisoners from the rest of the prison system through isolation. Deukmejian boasted that the [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] was a "state-of-the-art prison that will serve as a model for the rest of the nation...".&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

The prisoners are kept confined to their cells almost twenty-three hours a day and all forms of human contact through refined locking and monitoring systems are minimized. Pelican Bay SHU was one of the first visible “super-maximum security” facilities and thus it attracted lots of media attention.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt; Those opposing the conditions of California's “supermax” resulted in the federal court criticizing certain features of the prison but left the basic regimen of segregation and isolation largely intact.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

One of the policies of supermax confinement among other policies is designed to increase punishment by removing gang members from the mainline population and subject them to solitary confinement, whether it is for a set amount of time or an indefinite duration. In a recent study, it noted that the California Department of corrections has implemented ways to fix their alleged gang problem, such as using ‘confidential informants,’ segregating gang members, intercepting gang communications, setting up task forces to monitor and track gang members, locking up gang leaders in high security prisons, and ‘locking down’ entire institutions.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

These facilities, supermax prisons, were originally designed to contain and control the worst criminals and those who did not adhere to the rules of prisons, AKA "the worst of the worst".&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; As of 2001, the count of inmates in administrative segregation in California was 5,982 representing an 80.2% change over time, but this number is not quite correct due to deficient files provided.&lt;ref name="naday" /&gt; Increasingly, the practice of using solitary confinement long term, instead of the intended three-month period, in the supermax prisons as inmate management has become the norm.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; The selected inmates, who wear jumpsuits that differentiate them from the general population, will spend around 23 hours a day alone in a cell where they are offered very little and fully monitored as is procedure at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] which is one of the largest supermax prisons in the United States.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; In order to be sent to Pelican Bay, the inmate has either committed murder, assault, riots, threatening staff or fellow inmates, and even gang affiliation which must be validated by the prison staff.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;

There are 22 SHU units of Pelican Bay which include 132 eight-cell pods that are lit by heavy Plexiglass skylights enclosed by steel cell doors.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; The inmates are provided with a concrete slab as a bed, a toilet, small shelf, and a concrete stool with no windows in an 80 sq. foot space.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; SHU inmates are allotted for an hour and a half of exercise every day where they are taken to a 26 by 20 foot area surrounded by 20 foot high cement walls.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; Only one prisoner from each pod can move at a time and will be placed in waist restraints for any medical/dental appointments to assist in the examination process and may also have leg restraints placed on them before they are able to leave the unit depending on the purpose of the appointment.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;

In [[San Quentin State Prison]], the violence rates were still high in the 1980s despite the similar lockdowns and procedures of Pelican Bay because these prisoners use the small windows out of lockdown to either harm themselves or others.&lt;ref name="kupers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kupers |first=Terry A. |title=What To Do With the Survivors? Coping With the Long-Term Effects of Isolated Confinement |journal=[[Criminal Justice and Behavior]] |volume=35 |number=8 |date=August 2008 |pages=1005–1016 |doi=10.1177/0093854808318591 |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/35/8/1005 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically will try not to harm themselves while in the psychiatric hospital ward either, but they will plan out while in lockdown until they can see their plan through.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt; However even as they near their release dates, they are moved to “prerelease programs” out of the SHU which are successful with some prisoners, but it causes most others to become even more uncontrollable and unpredictable due to their mental states that aren’t properly cared for or screened.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt;

In May 2012, California's prison system faced a lawsuit from the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] and a group of California attorneys for the use of long terms of solitary confinement, some lasting for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Devereaux|first=Ryan |title=Prisoners challenge legality of solitary confinement lasting more than a decade |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/31/california-prison-lawsuit-solitary-confinement |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=31 May 2012 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, easing some conditions for inmates in near-solitary confinement in California prisons has died in the state legislature. The bill was among others supposed to reform Security Housing Units rules to allow the inmates to keep photographs and make a phone call after three months of good behavior was listed as inactive on Friday after a decision on Thursday evening by state Senator Loni Hancock to drop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bernstein|first=Sharon |title=Bill to reform California's near-solitary prison units dies |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/30/us-usa-california-prisons-idUSKBN0GU01D20140830 |date=30 August 2014 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maryland ====

In 2012, a report was conducted by the [[Vera Institute of Justice]] revealed that Maryland's use of restricted housing was twice the national average (8.5% versus an average of 4%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/interfaithaction/pages/13/attachments/original/1412026936/VERA_study_-_Review_of_MD_Use_of_Segregation_in_Adult_Prisons.pdf?1412026936 Vera Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation was introduced in &lt;ref name="2014 bill"&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-03-31/news/bs-ed-solitary-confinement-20140330_1_solitary-confinement-discipline-inmates-prisoners 2014 bill]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

According to a psychiatrist, Dr. Annette Hanson's article,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shrink-rap-today/201108/solitary-confinement-rumor-and-reality&lt;/ref&gt;  who works with Maryland's Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), prolonged segregation does not provide deleterious effects on inmates. DPSCS also asserted that solitary confinement doesn't exist in their institutions.&lt;ref name="2014 bill"/&gt;

==== New York ====
Since the 1980s, the [[New York City Department of Correction]] has increased the use of segregation as a discipline and management tool. In effect, segregation is a secondary sentence imposed by the correctional facility, which is usually unrelated to the conviction for which the person is incarcerated.&lt;ref name="browne2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Browne|first1=Angela |last2=Cambier|first2=Alissa |last3=Agha|first3=Suzanne |title=Prisons Within Prisons: The Use of Segregation in the United States |journal=[[Federal Sentencing Reporter]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=October 2011 &lt;!--Sentencing Within Sentencing--&gt; |pages=46–49 |doi=10.1525/fsr.2011.24.1.46 |url=http://www.vera.org/pubs/prisons-within-prisons-segregation |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are high rates of use of solitary confinement in [[New York (state)|New York]] when compared to other U.S. states.  Within the New York prison system, solitary confinement is frequently imposed for nonviolent, “trivial prisoner offenses.” Usually the common misconception is that solitary confinement is a punishment of last resort, reserved for inmates who present a threat of violence or escape.&lt;ref name=casella&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casella|first1=Jean |last2=Ridgeway|first2=James |title=New York's Black Sites |date=11 July 2012 |journal=[[The Nation]] |volume=295 |issue=5 |pages=18–24 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/new-yorks-black-sites/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates that are released from solitary confinement go through a “transitional unit” but failure in the program results in their return to solitary confinement.  Overall, most of the inmates fail and return to solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="okeefe2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Keefe |first=Maureen L. |title=Administrative Segregation from within: A Corrections Perspective |journal=[[The Prison Journal]] |volume=88 |issue=1 |date=March 2008 |pages=123–143 |doi=10.1177/0032885507310999 |url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/123.abstract |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York has the highest rate of “disciplinary segregation” in the country, making solitary confinement a regular every day action among the prison. Although prisons nationwide have decreased use of solitary confinement, the [[New York City Department of Correction]] expanded its capacity by 27 percent in 2011 and another 44 percent in 2012, according to the NYC Jails Action Coalition. Although the DOC housed 1,000 more inmates in 1990 than it does today, its jails have more solitary cells now. Due to this the city is topping the charts of municipalities with a high rate of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=bartlett /&gt; On any given day, there are about 4,500 men, women, and children in some form of isolated confinement in New York State prisons. This is not including New York City's jails, which are run under a separate system, where those in solitary confinement reach close to 1,000 or more.&lt;ref name="casella"/&gt;

A new bill was introduced by Councilman [[Danny Dromm]] would require the [[Department of Correction]] to post a monthly report on its website about punitive segregation. It would also require data on the number of people in punitive segregation, the length of time in this setting, the nature of the infractions, age, mental health, if they were prescribed medication or moved to a hospital, violence against others and inmate requests.&lt;ref name=bartlett /&gt; Many are supportive of this bill with the goal being to make jail facilities safer for inmates and correction officers.Individuals who are released and experience solitary confinement go back into their communities and reoffend at higher rates than general population prisoners causing them to land back into prison.  Policy changes that will reduce the use and long-term impact of segregation will benefit not only the staff and prisoners in these units but also ultimately the well-being of facilities, systems, and the community.&lt;ref name="browne2011"/&gt;  Councilman Dromm also issued a separate resolution seeking to end the practice of the time owed. For example, an inmate, because of good behavior or other reasons, might only have served 100 of his or her 180-day sentence in solitary and then was released. A few years or even decades later the person is rearrested. Under current rules he or she must complete those unserved 80 days in solitary. This resolution however is only a request since the Council does not have the authority to make the [[Department of Correction]] adhere.&lt;ref name=bartlett&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bartlett |first=Josey  |title=Bill aims to reduce solitary confinement |url=http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/bill-aims-to-reduce-solitary-confinement/article_45a63073-4949-51ee-a404-72d7816288c0.html |date=25 April 2013 |work=Queens Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== New York City: Rikers Island =====
The [[New York City Department of Correction]]s reported that in fiscal year 2012 more than 14.4 percent of all adolescents detained at [[Rikers Island]] between the ages of 16 and 18 were held in at least one period of solitary confinement while detained.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|131–132}} The average length of time young people spent in solitary confinement at Rikers Island was 43 days. More than 48 percent of adolescents at this institution have diagnosed mental health problems.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|132}} As violence associated with the [[crack epidemic]] became increasingly common, new measures were taken. The Red ID card system, instituted in the early 1990s, was a way of identifying inmates with histories of inciting riots, cuttings, stabbings, and other dangerous behaviors. It almost always meant the convict had spent time in a notorious ward designated for punitive confinement called "The Bing" (HDM 5 Block). Prisoners  Pavle Stanimirović, James Rosado, Tyrone Green, Pedro Hernandez, [[Willie Bosket]], Hector Rivera, [[Ángel Nieves Díaz|Ángel Díaz]], John Maldonado and Dominick Pollatti all spent time in "The Bing."

The New York City Department of Correction ended punitive segregation for adolescents in December 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/566-14/de-blasio-administration-ends-use-punitive-segregation-adolescent-inmates-rikers-island#/0|title=De Blasio Administration Ends Use of Punitive Segregation for Adolescent Inmates on Rikers Island|date=17 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended punitive segregation for young adults, 18 to 21, in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/10/officially-ponte-says-rikers-solitary-confinement-banned-for-young-adults-106128|title=Ponte says solitary confinement of young inmates now officially banned at Rikers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly due to the case of [[Kalief Browder]].

==Europe==
The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has three labels for solitary confinement: [[complete sensory isolation]], [[total social isolation]] and [[relative social isolation]].&lt;ref name="Verdictp3"&gt;{{cite report |title=Oslo District Court declaratory judgement for breach of the ECHR art. 3 &amp; 8; Anders Behring Breivik plaintiff |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/f/domisakenomsoningsforhold15107496tviotirabbstaten.pdf |date=20 April 2016 |format=PDF |access-date=25 April 2016 |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429020641/http://www.dagbladet.no/f/domisakenomsoningsforhold15107496tviotirabbstaten.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], or CPT, defines solitary confinement as "whenever a prisoner is ordered to be held separately from other prisoners, for example, as a result of court decision, as a disciplinary sanction imposed within the prison system, as a preventative administrative measure or for the protection of the prisoner concerned".&lt;ref name="Verdictp3"/&gt;

In [[Italy]], a person sentenced to more than one life sentence is required to serve a period of between 6 months to 3 years in solitary confinement.

=== United Kingdom ===
Solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure for prisoners in Europe was largely reduced or eliminated during the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="gawande9"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gawande|first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/30/090330fa_fact_gawande |title=Is long-term solitary confinement torture?|work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, only 40 out of 75,000 inmates held in [[England and Wales]] were placed in solitary confinement cells.&lt;ref name="tapley10"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tapley|first=Lance |title=The Worst of the Worst: Supermax Torture in America |date=1 November 2010 |url=http://www.bostonreview.net/tapley-supermax-torture-in-america.php |publisher=[[Boston Review]] |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secure housing units ==
Officially, the purpose of placing prisoners in secure housing units (SHUs) is to increase control over dangerous inmates. Some hope the SHU encourages prisoners to reflect on their actions. These units are characterized by extreme isolation of prisoners who "are housed in small cells with solid steel doors…for 22 to 23 hours per day."&lt;ref name=arrigo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arrigo|first1=Bruce A. |last2=Bullock|first2=Jennifer Leslie |title=The Psychological Effects of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners in Supermax Units |date=19 November 2007 &lt;!--published online before print--&gt; |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy &amp; Comparative Criminology |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=622–640 |doi=10.1177/0306624X07309720 |url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/52/6/622.abstract |subscription=yes |access-date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates are also deprived of social interaction and denied access to educational or therapeutic programs and health care while being held in SHUs.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
It has been shown that the conditions of these secure housing units have severe mental and psychological effects on prisoners.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Prisoners in SHUs are isolated for long periods of time. Instances of assault and torture against these prisoners in response to trivial things have also been cited.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Social isolation housing, can reduce environmental stimulation, and causes a feeling of loss of control over all aspects of a prisoner's daily life. These environmental stimulations include but aren't limited to hypersensitivity to stimuli, distortions and hallucinations, increased anxiety and nervousness, diminished impulse control, severe and chronic depression, appetite loss and weight loss, heart palpitations, talking to oneself, problems sleeping, nightmares, self-mutilation, difficulties with thinking, concentration, and memory, and lower levels of brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birckhead|first=Tamar|year=2015|title=Children in isolation: the solitary confinement of youth|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/wflr50&amp;div=4&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#|journal=Law Journal Library|volume=|pages=1–80|via=George Mason University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common justification by officials is that prisoners of certain natures deserve to be punished for the threat that they pose to society.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; This can be attributed to the fear of increasing crime rates and therefore, support the government's effort to enforce harsher forms of punishment.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;

The most "notorious example of the extreme social isolation found in supermaximum custody units" is the SHU at [[SouthPort]] NYDOCS [[Upstate Correctional Facility]] &amp; [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; From studying conditions at Pelican Bay, researchers argue that long-term social isolation "carries major psychiatric risks." &lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Prisoners are susceptible to developing mental illnesses because they are confined to coffin-like conditions and denied access to basic health services.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Illnesses range from anxiety, clinical depression, and self-mutilation to suicidal thoughts and SHU syndrome.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Yet, it is important to note that the duration of the isolation is the most important factor in determining the effects of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name= arrigo /&gt;

=== Scrutiny ===
[[Supermax prison]]s, large-scale implementations of secure housing units, employ solitary confinement to isolate predatory, disorderly inmates from the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Kate |last1=King |first2=Benjamin |last2=Steiner |first3=Stephanie R. |last3=Breach |title=Violence in the Supermax: A Self Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=[[The Prison Journal]] |volume=88 |number=1 |date=March 2008 |pages=144–68. |url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/144 |doi=10.1177/0032885507311000 |access-date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Bureau of Prisons create special supermax facilities to contain the most aggressive inmates in a protective effort.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Kate King, professor and director of Criminal Justice at [[Murray State University]], Benjamin Steiner, professor of Criminal Justice at the [[University of Cincinnati]], and Stephanie Ritchie Breach, director of the Third District Youth Court, explain how while violence has always been a factor in prison life, the level of aggression is magnified in facilities where all such members of the prison system are concentrated.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; These scholars argue that the violent nature of supermax prisons such as [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] are perpetrated by prison culture itself.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; King, Steiner, and Breach question the effectiveness of these institutions and claim the violent reputation of American prisons stems from this departure from the treatment model.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Supermax prisons are also scrutinized on legal and ethical bases. Scholars Jesenia Pizarro and Vanja Stenius note that the overall constitutionality of these prisons are still quite unclear.&lt;ref name=pizarro2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pizarro|first1=Jesenia |last2=Stenius|first2=Vanja M.

=== Recidivism ===
Shira E. Gordon, a University of Michigan Law Student, argues that solitary confinement leads to an increase in [[recidivism]] and violence. To substantiate this conclusion, she cites two quantitative research based studies that support this nexus and counters those who argue that solitary confinement deters recidivism.&lt;ref name=gordon2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Shira E.|title=Solitary Confinement, Public Safety, and Recidivism|journal=[[University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform|U. Mich. J. Law Reform]]|volume=47|issue=2|year=2014|pages=495–528|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/mjlr/vol47/iss2/6/|access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Mears and William Bales “compared recidivism rates by matching…prisoners who were incarcerated in solitary confinement with prisoners who had been in the general prison population.”&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; They found that "24.2 percent of the prisoners held in solitary confinement were reconvicted of a violent crime compared to 20.5 percent of prisoners held in population."&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; And this behavior may be attributed to the mental illnesses prisoners may develop, as well as the dehumanizing treatment they are subject to.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Psychiatric ===
According to a March 2014 article in ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', “Inmates in jails and prisons attempt to harm themselves in many ways, resulting in outcomes ranging from trivial to fatal.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaba|first1=Fatos |last2=Lewis|first2=Andrea |last3=Sarah|first3=Glowa-Kollisch |last4=Hadler|first4=James |last5=Lee|first5=David |last6=Alper|first6=Howard |last7=Selling|first7=Daniel |last8=MacDonald|first8=Ross |last9=Solimo|first9=Angela &lt;!--and Amanda Parsons, Homer Venters--&gt; |title=Solitary Confinement and Risk of Self-Harm Among Jail Inmates |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |volume=104 |issue=3 |date=March 2014 |pages=442–447 |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301742 |format=PDF |access-date=18 March 2014 |display-authors=1 |doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301742 |pmid=24521238 |pmc=3953781}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some inmates are known to have psychiatric disorders prior to entering the prison, others develop mental disorders as a result of being placed in solitary confinement. A main issue within the prison system and solitary confinement is the high number of inmates who turn to self-harm.&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; Studies have shown that the longer one stays in the prison, the more at risk he or she is to self-harm.

One study has shown that “inmates ever assigned to solitary confinement were 3.2 times as likely to commit an act of self-harm per 1000 days at some time during their incarceration as those never assigned to solitary.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; The study has concluded that there is a direct correlation between inmates who self-harm and inmates that are punished into solitary confinement. Many of the inmates look to self-harm as a way to “avoid the rigors of solitary confinement.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; Mental health professionals ran a series of tests that ultimately concluded that “self-harm and potentially fatal self-harm associated with solitary confinement was higher independent of mental illness status and age group.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt;

Physicians have concluded that for those inmates who enter the prison already diagnosed with a mental illness, the punishment of solitary confinement is extremely dangerous in that the inmates are more susceptible to exacerbating the symptoms.&lt;ref name=metzner2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metzner|first1=Jeffrey L. |last2=Fellner|first2=Jamie |title=Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness in U.S. Prisons: A Challenge for Medical Ethics |date=March 2010 |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|J Am Acad Psychiatry Law]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=104–108 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/1/104.full |access-date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional organizations, like the [[National Commission on Correctional Health Care]] (NCCHC), the [[Society of Correctional Physicians|American College of Correctional Physicians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Society of Correctional Physicians Calls for Caution Placing Mentally Ill in Segregation An Important Band-Aid|url = http://jcx.sagepub.com/content/20/2/92|journal = Journal of Correctional Health Care|date = 1 April 2014|issn = 1078-3458|pmid = 24659757|pages = 92–94|volume = 20|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/1078345814522959|first = Marc F.|last = Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA), work to improve the mental health services, however, the systems within the prisons "remain woefully inadequate."&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt;  "Psychological effects can include anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive disturbances, perceptual distortions, obsessive thoughts, paranoia, and psychosis."&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; These studies suggest that a main issue with isolating prisoners who are known to have mental illnesses is that it prevents the inmates from ever possibly recovering. Instead, many "mentally ill prisoners decompensate in isolation, requiring crisis care or psychiatric hospitalization." It is also noted that if a prisoner is restrained from interacting with the individuals they wish to have contact with they exhibit similar effects.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt;

Suicide is often seen as a means to escape from solitary confinement, especially amongst those who deal with deeper mental illnesses like depression. Depression is one of the most common reasons why inmates often kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/what-does-solitary-confinement-do-to-your-mind/|title=What Does Solitary Confinement Do To Your Mind?|work=FRONTLINE|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitary confinement has been said to increase symptoms of those with mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/05/solitary.aspx|title=Alone, in 'the hole'|work=apa.org|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environment is a factor ====
"Prisoner mental health is becoming increasingly important," and has caught the attention of the [[World Health Organization]], which aims to reduce the "effects of imprisonment on mental health."  One study focused on the "prison environment rather than on individual factors."&lt;ref name=walker2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker|first1=J. |last2=Illingworth|first2=C. |last3=Canning|first3=A. |last4=Garner|first4=E. |last5=Woolley|first5=J. |last6=Taylor|first6=P. |last7=Amos|first7=T. |title=Changes in Mental State Associated with Prison Environments: A Systematic Review |date=18 November 2013 &lt;!--Epub--&gt; |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=427–36 |doi=10.1111/acps.12221 |display-authors=1 |pmid=24237622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study tested two time periods, short-term and long-term, that evaluated the "mental state changes in response to changes in the environment or prison setting."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt; It ultimately concluded that solitary confinement was "associated with negative effects on mental health."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt; Segregation, though similar to solitary confinement, could not be proven to have lasting negative effects on inmates, although those who were segregated had worse mental health than those who were not segregated. The study also concluded that crowding had its own problems, as "increased levels of social density had negative effects on the mental health of inmates."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt;

===Social===
Some sociologists argue that prisons create a unique social environment that do not allow inmates to create strong social ties outside or inside of prison life. Men are more likely to become frustrated, and therefore more mentally unstable when keeping up with family outside of prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lindquist|first=Christine H. |title=Social Integration and Mental Well-Being Among Jail Inmates |journal=Sociological Forum |volume=15|issue=3 |date=September 2000 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.1023/A:1007524426382 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1007524426382 |subscription=yes |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme forms of solitary confinement and isolation can affect the larger society as a whole. The resocialization of newly released inmates who spent an unreasonable amount of time in solitary confinement and thus suffer from serious mental illnesses is a huge dilemma for society to face.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt; The effects of isolation unfortunately do not stop once the inmate has been released. After release from segregated housing, psychological effects have the ability to sabotage a prisoner's potential to successfully return to the community and adjust back to ‘normal’ life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/health/solitary-confinement-mental-illness.html|title=Solitary Confinement: Punished for Life|last=Goode|first=Erica|date=3 August 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inmates are often startled easily, and avoid crowds and public places. They seek out confined small spaces because the public areas overwhelm their sensory stimulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Ineffectiveness===
In 2002, the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America, chaired by [[John Joseph Gibbons]] and [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] found that: "The increasing use of high-security segregation is counter-productive, often causing violence inside facilities and contributing to recidivism after release."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/Confronting_Confinement.pdf |title=Confronting Confinement: A Report of The Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons |date=8 June 2006 |authors=John J. Gibbons &amp; Nicholas de B. Katzenbach, co-chairs |accessdate=18 June 2011 |format=PDF &lt;!--publisher-The Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solitary confinement has been traditionally used as a behavioral reform of isolating prisoners physically, emotionally and mentally in order to control and change inmate behavior. Recently arrived inmates are more likely to violate prison rules than their inmate counterparts and thus are more likely to be put in solitary confinement. Additionally, individual attributes and environmental factors combine to increase an inmate's likelihood of being put into solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Kenneth|title=Adjusting to Prison Life|journal=Crime and Justice|volume=16|pages=275|doi=10.1086/449208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture===
{{POV section|date=June 2016|talk=Torture_NPOV}}
Solitary confinement is considered to be a form of [[psychological torture]] with measurable long-term physiological effects when the period of confinement is longer than a few weeks or is continued indefinitely.

The documented psychological effects led one judge in a 2001 suit to rule that "Solitary confinement units are virtual incubators of psychoses—seeding illness in otherwise healthy inmates and exacerbating illness in those already suffering from mental infirmities."&lt;ref&gt;''Ruiz v. Johnson'', 154 F.Supp.2d 975 (S.D.Tex.2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, as of 2016, there have been thirty-five U.S. Supreme Court cases petitioning solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://solitarywatch.com/resources/u-s-supreme-court-cases/|title=U.S. Supreme Court Cases|date=11 December 2010|newspaper=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan E. Méndez, told the General Assembly's third committee, which deals with social, humanitarian, and cultural affairs, that the practice could amount to torture.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097|title=UN News - Solitary confinement should be banned in most cases, UN expert says|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=18 October 2011|website=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Considering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles,” he warned.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

In November 2014. the United Nations Committee Against Torture noted that full isolation for 22–23 hours a day in super-maximum security prisons is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_COC_USA_18893_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations have also banned the use of solitary confinement for longer than 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author1=Ramin Skibba |url=https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2018/hidden-damage-solitary-confinement | title=The hidden damage of solitary confinement |date= June 22, 2018 |magazine=[[Knowable Magazine]]|doi=10.1146/knowable-062118-065101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse===
Misuse of solitary confinement has been widely controversial. In immigration detention centers, reports have surfaced concerning its use against detainees in order to keep those knowledgeable about their [[Human rights|rights]] away from other detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Homer|last1=Venters |first2=Dana|last2=Dasch-Goldberg |first3=Andrew|last3=Rasmussen |first4=Allen S.|last4=Keller |title=Into the Abyss: Mortality and Morbidity Among Detained Immigrants |journal=[[Human Rights Quarterly]] |date=May 2009 |volume=31|number=2|pages=474–495 |doi=10.1353/hrq.0.0074 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/265311 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[prison-industrial complex]] itself, reports of solitary confinement as punishment in work labor prisons have also summoned much criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang|first1=Tracy F.

===Access to healthcare===
Research has shown that the routine features of prison can make huge demands on limited coping resources. After prison many ex-convicts with mental illness do not receive adequate treatment for their mental health issues, because health services turn them away. This is caused by restrictive policies or lack of resources for treating the formerly incarcerated individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Primm|first1=Annelle B. |last2=Osher|first2=Fred C. |last3=Gomez|first3=Marisela B. |title=Race and Ethnicity, Mental Health Services and Cultural Competence in the Criminal Justice System: Are we Ready to Change? |journal=Community Mental Health Journal |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=557–569 |doi=10.1007/s10597-005-6361-3 |pmid=16142538 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study focusing on women and adolescent men, those who had health insurance, received mental health services, or had a job were less likely to return to jail.

===Ethics===
Treating mentally ill patients by sentencing them into solitary confinement has captured the attention of human rights experts who conclude that “solitary confinement may amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment” that violates rights specifically targeting cruel, inhuman treatment.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; Health care professionals and organizations recognize the fact that solitary confinement is not ethical, yet the segregating treatment fails to come to a halt.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; “Experience demonstrates that prisons can operate safely and securely without putting inmates with mental illness in typical conditions of segregation.” &lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; Despite this and medical professionals’ obligations, segregation policies have not changed because mental health clinics believe that “isolation is necessary for security reasons.” &lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; In fact, many believe that it is ethical for physicians to help those in confinement but that the physicians should also be trying to stop the abuse. If they cannot do so they are expected to undertake public advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzner|first=Jeffrey L.|last2=Fellner|first2=Jamie|date=1 March 2010|title=Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness in U.S. Prisons: A Challengefor Medical Ethics|url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/1/104|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=104–108|issn=1093-6793|pmid=20305083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

The legality of solitary confinement has been frequently challenged over the past sixty years as conceptions surrounding the practice have changed.  Much of the legal discussion concerning solitary confinement has centered on whether or not it constitutes torture or cruel and unusual punishment. While [[international law]] has generally begun to discourage solitary confinement's use in penal institutions,&lt;ref name=conley2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conley |first=Anna |title=Torture in US Jails and Prisons: An Analysis of Solitary Confinement Under International Law |date=April 2013 |journal=Vienna J. on Int'l Const. Law |volume=7 |pages=415–453 |url=http://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/vioincl7&amp;section=52 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; opponents of solitary confinement have been less successful at challenging it within the [[United States legal system]].

===International law===

Throughout the twentieth century, the [[United Nations]]' stance on solitary confinement has become increasingly oppositional. International law has reflected this change, and UN monitoring has led to a major reduction of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

In 1949, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].  Although the Declaration is non-binding, the basic human rights outlined within it have served as the foundation of [[customary international law]].&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The relevance of the Declaration to solitary confinement is found in Article 5, which states that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a5 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights] (UN.org)&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, if solitary confinement is believed to constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, then the country practicing solitary confinement is violating the provisions set by the UDHR.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), effective 1976, reiterates the fifth article of the UDHR; Article 7 of the ICCPR identically states, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|title=OHCHR - International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|work=ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ICCPR is a legally binding agreement, any nation that is signatory to the covenant would be violating international law if it practiced torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.

At the time that the UDHR and ICCPR were adopted, solitary confinement was not yet believed to constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Its practice, therefore, was not believed to violate international law. This changed, however, after the UN definition of torture was outlined in detail in the 1984 [[Convention Against Torture]] (CAT); Article 1.1 of the CAT states that torture is "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person" for any reason such as obtaining information or punishment, and Article 16 of the same convention prohibits "other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". Based on these provisions, many members of the UN began to believe that solitary confinement's detrimental psychological effects could, indeed, constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, if not, torture.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; In the years following the CAT, UN representatives "have publicly decried the use of solitary confinement as a violation of the CAT and ICCPR," as well as the UDHR.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

In more recent years, UN representatives have strengthened their efforts to stop solitary confinement from being used worldwide.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; The urgency with which representatives have undertaken these efforts is largely due to the [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs|UN Special Rapporteurs]] on Torture, [[Manfred Nowak]] and [[Juan E. Méndez|Juan Méndez]].&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Nowak and Méndez have both "repeatedly unequivocally stated that prolonged solitary confinement is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and may amount to torture".&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Nowak and Méndez have been especially critical of long-term or prolonged solitary confinement, which they define as lasting fifteen days or more.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Their authority and explicit characterization of solitary confinement as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment has led the UN to include long-term to indefinite solitary confinement in the group of practices that violate the provisions outlined in the UDHR, ICCPR, and CAT. Solitary confinement lasting for a short period of time, however, is allowed under international law when used as a last resort, though Nowak, Mendez, and many other UN representatives believe that the practice should be abolished altogether.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

=== United States law ===
In the U.S., opponents of solitary confinement have argued (with varying success) that the practice violates prisoners’ [[Constitutional right#United States|Constitutional rights]]. Despite the long history of litigation over the practice, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has yet to definitively state whether or not solitary confinement is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of long-term solitary confinement only once in the ‘‘[[Wilkinson v. Austin]]'’ case. In contrast to the Supreme Court's inaction, lower courts of the U.S. have imposed constitutional limitations on the use of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; Despite such limitations, the federal courts have refused to find that solitary confinement is per se unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; The U.S. has also effectively “insulated itself from any official sanction for international violations by not submitting to the jurisdiction” of committees that enforce the ICCPR or CAT.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

====Eighth Amendment====

Since solitary confinement has been designated as “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” under international law, many lawyers have argued that it is also the kind of “cruel and unusual punishments” prohibited by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. Proving this to be the case, however, has been a difficult task for attorneys at every level of the court system.

In light of the serious, long-lasting psychological effects solitary confinement can have, inmates have argued that the mental injuries they suffer qualify as “cruel and unusual punishment.” Prison officials contend that placing inmates in prolonged solitary confinement is necessary for various reasons.  Some of these reasons include separating violent prisoners from the general population, separating vulnerable inmates (such as juveniles) from others, and punishing those prisoners who attempt to cause riots or try to escape.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt; Prisoners argue, however, that the nature of these kinds of offenses does not justify the use of solitary confinement; in their eyes “there is simply no strong security need for the total social isolation that exists at some supermax prisons”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

A large portion of the court cases addressing solitary confinement have approached the practice as a violation of Eighth Amendment rights. Courts have generally agreed that solitary confinement is, indeed, a violation of the Eighth Amendment for inmates with preexisting mental illness or juveniles.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt; However, the Supreme Court concluded that “while there was a risk of serious psychological injury to inmates, that risk was not of ‘sufficiently serious magnitude’ to find a ‘per se’ violation of the Eighth Amendment for ‘‘all’’ prisoners placed in long-term solitary confinement”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

Showing that solitary confinement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment has proven difficult for inmates and their attorneys. The Supreme Court requires ‘extreme deprivations’ in order to have merits for a ‘conditions-of-confinement claim’ and courts have also held that inmates are only protected against “certain kinds of extreme deprivations” by the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; In ‘‘[[Farmer v. Brennan]]’’, the Supreme Court set two requirements that must be fulfilled in order to challenge solitary confinement as “cruel and unusual”.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; First, prisoners must show that a “substantial risk of serious harm to inmates” and second, that the prison officials were “deliberately indifferent” to such risk.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; To prove a prison official's “deliberate indifference,” the prisoner must “show evidence that the official was ‘actually’ aware of a prisoner's serious need and chose to ignore it”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; Since the psychological impact of solitary confinement is not believed to be “objectively” cruel and unusual within the U.S. legal system, and because it is difficult to establish that prison officials are “indifferent” to prisoner health and safety, inmates and attorneys alleging these two requirements have faced limited success.

The [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA) further complicates inmates’ ability to claim that solitary confinement's psychological damage constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Section 1997e(e) of the PLRA states that {{quote|no Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cockrell|first=John F.|title=Solitary Confinement: The Law Today and the Way Forward|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/89007447/solitary-confinement-law-today-way-forward|journal=[[Law &amp; Psychology Review]]|volume=37|date=March 2013|pages=211–227|access-date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This demonstrates that the Eighth Amendment provides “greater protection” against physical injury than against mental pain.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  Therefore, unless a prisoner can demonstrate physical injury as a result of solitary confinement, he or she is unable to recover damages for any “mental or emotional injury” the confinement causes.  As a result, the Eighth Amendment has not always been proven to be the most effective approach to argue against the practice of solitary confinement.

==== Due process and the Fourteenth Amendment ====
Litigating against solitary confinement on the basis of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and [[due process clause|due process]] is another less common strategy inmates have used.  The Fourteenth Amendment limits the “types of prisoners” that can be placed in solitary confinement and the time the prisoners can be confined.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  The due process clause within the Fourteenth Amendment also regulates solitary confinement in that prisoners must be given reviews before and during their placement in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Court cases made on these bases do not necessarily address any “underlying problems” of solitary confinement, but they do call for increased monitoring, hearing, and reviews.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;

Inmates who are placed in solitary confinement “must be accorded meaningful periodic review to ensure that segregation [solitary confinement] is not a ‘pretext for indefinite confinement’”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lobel|first=Jules|title=Prolonged Solitary Confinement and the Constitution|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume11/issue1/Lobel11U.Pa.J.Const.L.115(2009).pdf|journal=[[Journal of Constitutional Law|J. Const. Law]]|volume=11|issue=1|date=December 2008|pages=115–138|format=PDF|access-date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Jules Lobel, professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, explains, {{quote|When a prisoner is placed in a supermax, the due process requirement of meaningful periodic review requires that his or her behavior be re-evaluated at regular intervals to determine whether supermax confinement is still warranted.}} Lobel contends that the trend in U.S. supermax prisons is to not submit these reviews at all or to provide a review with a predetermined outcome to keep the prisoner in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  If this is indeed the case, then such inmates’ due process rights are violated.

In ''[[Wilkinson v. Austin]]'', the Supreme Court held that, in addition to the due process right to meaningful review, prisoners also have a due process right to “a statement of the reasons why they were placed or retained at the supermax” so they can better understand how to behave in the future in order to be released from solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  Lobel argues that this “implies that the officials must provide something more than a general statement that the prisoner is very dangerous”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  According to Lobel this is not what usually happens at supermax facilities, so the inmates’ due process rights are violated in this way as well.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

In recent circuit court cases, courts have ruled that solitary confinement of 305 days or more constitutes an “atypical and significant hardship” that implicates due process.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;

==== Alternative litigation techniques ====
Recognizing that the amount of proof needed to show that solitary confinement violates prisoners’ rights “is simply too high to trigger constitutional protections,” attorneys have started to approach solitary confinement from a different angle.  John F. Cockrell, a recent graduate from the University of Alabama School of Law, suggests that those who challenge solitary confinement do so in context of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA).&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  Cockrell reasons that {{quote|When claims under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments fail, [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990#Title II|Title II]] [of the ADA] may offer an avenue to improve the provision of services to the mentally ill in prisons and solitary confinement, but ipso facto improving the conditions under which all inmates in solitary confinement live.}}

In the past few years, several internal committees and administrative bodies involved in the United States prison and legal systems have also begun to question solitary confinement's legality.  In June 2012, for example, the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|US Senate Judiciary Committee]] held its first hearing on solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Likewise, as of 2013, the [[US Bureau of Prisons]] has announced that it will conduct its first review of how solitary confinement is used in federal prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Additionally, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] found multiple violations of the Constitution and ADA after investigating the use of solitary confinement for mentally ill inmates in two Pennsylvania prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The [[US Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] Agency (ICE) has also revised segregation procedures for detainees.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

=== Mentally ill inmates and juveniles ===
Studies have illustrated that mentally ill inmates and juveniles are two groups more severely affected by solitary confinement than other prisoners.  As such, the [[Solitary confinement of mentally ill prisoners in the United States|solitary confinement of mentally ill inmates]] and juveniles has been upheld as cruel and unusual in both international and US courts.

The UN has “expressly prohibit[ed] solitary confinement of juveniles and individuals with mental illness”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Convention on the Rights of the Child have played major roles in establishing the UN's position on solitary confinement of mentally ill inmates and juveniles respectively.

Within the US legal system, too, courts have held that the solitary confinement of the mentally ill is “cruel and unusual”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  In fact, David Fathi, Director of the ACLU's [[National Prison Project]], found that “every federal court that has considered claims by severely mentally ill prisoners held in solitary confinement has found this treatment unconstitutional”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  These court rulings are significant in light of the fact that more than half of the prisoners currently serving jail time in the US are mentally ill according to the US Bureau of Prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Furthermore, approximately 30% or more of prisoners in solitary confinement are mentally ill.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  These rulings have the potential to dramatically change how prisons deal with mentally ill inmates, as prison officials would no longer be able to “warehouse” “difficult” prisoners if they have a preexisting mental illness.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  It should be noted, however, that these rulings do not guarantee that the mentally ill will not be put in solitary confinement; while they are considered a vulnerable group, these prisoners still have “limited” recourse to the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;

One landmark case, ''Madrid v. Gomez'', challenged the conditions of the Security Housing Unit (SHU) in the [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].  The court ruled that the current conditions were not “per se violative of the Eighth Amendment” with respect to all inmates.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  However, in regard to SHU's isolation of the mentally ill and the conditions of their solitary confinement, the court found that the prison had violated the Eighth Amendment.  Despite it being a landmark case, the rulings of the case have yet to set a trend among cases against other prison systems because SHU's conditions were known to be more extreme and harsh than other supermax prisons.

Juveniles who are charged as adults and placed in adult prisons are usually put in [[protective custody]], and often the conditions of protective custody are similar to those of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Juvenile justice experts, social scientists, and national correctional standards all agree that solitary confinement is an “ineffective therapeutic tool” that is detrimental to juveniles who are still in an “uncertain, unformed state of social identity”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Given that they are developing mentally and physically, some experts have suggested that “they are severely and permanently damaged by such conditions to a greater extent than adults”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

==Actions==
The use of long-term solitary confinement, along with other grievances, has triggered organized resistance from prisoners and advocacy groups in the United States. Prisoners in California and elsewhere have launched hunger strikes, citing cruel and unusual uses of solitary confinement as a major reason. Hundreds of prisoners in the United States, acting through the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, have in 2012 filed a petition against solitary confinement at the [[United Nations]]. The petition alleges that solitary confinement constitutes torture and should be addressed by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/california-prisons-solitary-confinement-challenged-un-petition-429116 |title=California Prisons' Solitary Confinement Challenged In UN Petition |work=[[International Business Times]] |date=23 March 2012 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2013 California prisoner hunger strike]] saw approximately 29,000 prisoners protesting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/california-prison-hunger-strike-30000_n_3567639.html |first=Kathleen |last=Miles |title=California Prison Hunger Strike: 30,000 Inmates Refuse Meals |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=9 July 2013 |language=en |access-date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statewide hunger strike reaching 2/3 of California's prisons began with the organizing of inmates at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]]. On 11 July 2011, prisoners at Pelican Bay State Prison began a hunger strike to “protest torturous conditions in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) there”...and to advocate for procedural and policy changes like the termination of the “debriefing process” which forces prisoners “to name themselves or others as gang members as a condition of access to food or release from isolation”.&lt;ref name=lauren1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Marjorie |title=Prisoners Strike Against Torture in California Prisons |date=July 2011 |journal=National Lawyers Guild Review |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=61–62 |url=http://marjoriecohn.com/prisoners-strike-against-torture-in-california-prisons |access-date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 7,000 inmates throughout the California prison system stood in solidarity with these Pelican State Bay prisoners in 2011 by also refusing their food.&lt;ref name=lauren1 /&gt; Also in solidarity with the 2011 Pelican Bay prisoners on strike is the Bay Area coalition of grassroots organizations known as the [[Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity coalition]]. This coalition has aided the prisoners in their strike by providing a legal support force for their negotiations with the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] (CDCR) and by creating and running a media based platform to raise support and awareness for the strikers and their demands among the general public.&lt;ref name=lauren1 /&gt;

The CDCR's failure to meet the demands of the Pelican State Bay Prison hunger strikers in 2011 resulted in the aforementioned [[2013 California prisoner hunger strike]]. Similar to the Pelican Bay State Prison hunger strike is the organizing of January 2011 in the supermax [[Ohio State Penitentiary]], where prisoners Bomani Shakur, Siddique Abdullah Hasan, Jason Robb, and Namir Abdul Mateen began a hunger strike “to protest what they call their harsh mistreatment under solitary confinement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goodman|first1=Amy |last2=Lynd|first2=Staughton |title=Prisoners at Supermax Ohio Penitentiary Begin Hunger Strike to Protest 17+ Year Solitary Confinement |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=4 January 2011 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/1/4/prisoners_at_supermax_ohio_penitentiary_begin_hunger_strike_to_protest_17_year_solitary_confinement |access-date=12 June 2016}} (Video interview w. transcript).&lt;/ref&gt; These prisoners decided to start rejecting their meals until they could be relocated from solitary confinement to [[death row]] where their treatment as prisoners would improve. Another example took place in Fall of 2010, when prisoners throughout Georgia's prison system organized a strike in opposition to violations of the US Constitution 8th amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment for minute infractions of rules.&lt;ref name=lauren2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Casella|first1=Jean |last2=Ridgeway|first2=James |title=Georgia Prisoners' Strike: "We Locked Ourselves Down" |work=[[Solitary Watch]] |date=13 December 2010 |url=http://solitarywatch.com/2010/12/13/georgia-prisoners-strike-we-locked-ourselves-down/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates throughout the state, in facilities like Rogers State Prison and [[Hays State Prison]] engaged in a “self-imposed [[lockdown]]” to incite action from the [[Georgia Department of Corrections]] in meeting their demands.&lt;ref name=lauren2 /&gt; Similar to other prison strikes demanding systemic change in the policing and policies of prisons like the Pelican State Bay hunger strike, this self-imposed lockdown strike has reached “across multiple facilities and across racial and factional lines”.&lt;ref name=lauren2 /&gt;

Solitary confinement has served as a site of inspiration for protest-organizing against its use in and outside of prisons and conversely, as a response tactic for prisons to react to the protest-organizing of its prisoners. In March 2014, authorities at the [[Northwest Detention Center]] in Washington relegated multiple detainees to solitary confinement units after their participation in protests for the improvement of conditions within the facility and in solidarity with activist organizing against deportation escalations outside of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Honig|first1=Doug |last2=Lee|first2=Melissa |title=Hunger Strikers Released from Solitary Confinement at New Detention Center |date=4 April 2014 |publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Washington State |url=https://aclu-wa.org/news/hunger-strikers-released-solitary-confinement-nw-detention-center |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizing against the use of solitary confinement isn't limited to the work of prisoners subject to or at risk for this treatment. Community organizing outside of prisons has also occurred to shed light on the use of solitary confinement in prisons and work towards its abolition or highly refined use. Free and accessible journals like “Turning the Tide: Journal of Anti-Racist Action, Research, &amp; Education” and web-based projects like [[Solitary Watch]] and the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition website also work to disseminate information about the use of solitary confinement in prisons and support actions to bring about the end of this practice in prisons.

Dr. Eisenman, an Art History professor and activist, who is involved in many “stop max” movements centered in Illinois, studies solitary confinement and explains its eventual decline.&lt;ref name=Proponents&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenman|first=Stephen |title=The Resistible Rise and Predictable Fall of the US Supermax |journal=[[Monthly Review]] |date=November 2009 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=31–45 |doi=10.14452/mr-061-06-2009-10_4 |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2009/11/01/the-resistable-rise-and-predictable-fall-of-the-u-s-supermax/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1800s solitary confinement was practiced in the penitentiary systems and its implementation and popularity at various prisons grew throughout the centuries.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; The practice of solitary confinement grew partly because of stigmatizing language used to refer to certain prisoners like ‘the worst of the worst,’ which became a form of “self-justifying the logic of torture”.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Yet, as the use of solitary confinement progressed, public discourse around solitary confinement transitioned from a legitimate form of punishment to torture.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Because many prisoners in solitary confinement suffered severe mental and physical illnesses, Eisenman describes that by the end of the nineteenth century “prisoner isolation and sensory deprivation were widely understood to be forms of torture”.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Therefore, human rights groups condemned the use of solitary confinement or ‘supermax’ systems, and national and local ‘stop max’ movements have initiated in America and worldwide to stop the use of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt;

==Alternatives and reform==

===Possible alternatives===
Scrutiny of super-maximum security prisons and the institutionalization of solitary confinement is accompanied by suggestions for alternative methods. One alternative is to administer medical treatment for disorderly inmates who display signs of mental illness.&lt;ref name=sahil3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcat.org/torture-in-us-prisons/learn-more-/alternatives-to-solitary-confinement|title=Alternatives to Solitary Confinement - National Religious Campaign Against Torture|first=Heather|last=Rice|website=www.nrcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Corrections|Correction Department]] of [[New York City]] implemented plans to transfer mentally ill inmates to an internal facility for further help rather than solitary confinement in 2013.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Dora B. Schriro, correction commissioner, said that treatment would help turn a “one size fits all” policy into a program to promote success in jail and the outside world.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; A second alternative is to deal with long-term inmates by promoting familial and social relationships through the encouragement of visitations which may help boost morale.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Carl Kummerlowe believes that familial counseling and support may be useful for inmates nearing the end of a long-term sentence that may otherwise exhibit signs of aggression.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; This alternative would help inmates cope with extreme long term sentences in prisons such as those harbored in [[Pelican Bay State Prison|Pelican Bay]].&lt;ref name=king /&gt; A third alternative would involve regular reevaluation and accelerated transition of isolated inmates back to prison population to help curb long-term effects of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; These alternative methods suggest a more [[restorative justice]] approach to handling high-security offenders.

===Recent reform===
Many states such as [[Colorado]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Maine]] have implemented plans to reduce use of supermax prisons and solitary confinement and have begun to show signs of reform.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Joseph Ponte, Corrections Commissioner of Maine, cut supermax prison population by half.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Colorado has announced reforms to limit the use of solitary confinement in prisons following a study that showed significant levels of confinement and isolation in prisons.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Washington has also showed signs of decreased use of solitary confinement, low segregation of overall prison population, and emphasis on alternative methods.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt;

== Counter-arguments ==
There have been studies that have shown no difference between inmates in solitary confinement and those in normal lockup. For example, "Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners" examines a study that compared twenty prison inmates that were put into isolation to twenty inmates from [[Prison|general population]] that were used as the controls.  The subjects were tested immediately before and after being put into isolation and the results showed that although there was a slight difference in subjective feelings, there were no mental or [[psychomotor retardation|psychomotor]] changes.&lt;ref name=walters1963&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walters|first1=Richard |last2=Callagan|first2=John |last3=Newman|first3=Albert |title=Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |date=February 1963 |volume=119 |issue=8 |pages=771–73 |doi=10.1176/ajp.119.8.771 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.119.8.771?journalCode=ajp |access-date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners" argues that the negative effects of solitary have often been overemphasized and that the reason these negative findings are often reported is due to the characteristic difference between those who end up in solitary confinement and those who do not.&lt;ref name=walters1963/&gt;

"Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement," analyzes multiple studies conducted at different prisons throughout the United States.  There was no difference found in the stress levels between the inmates inside of solitary confinement and those in general lockup according to this study.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suedfeld|first1=Peter |last2=Ramirez|first2=Carmenza |last3=Deaton|first3=John |last4=Baker-Brown|first4=Gloria |title=Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement |journal=[[Criminal Justice and Behavior]] |volume=9 |issue=3 |date=September 1982 |pages=303–40 |doi=10.1177/0093854882009003004 |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/9/3/303.abstract |access-date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews were conducted that showed that inmates had a fear of the mental effects that solitary confinement would have, but that mental harm rarely occurred.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; There was also no significant difference between the results of the [[CPI]] Scale between the control and the experimental group according to "Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement."&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; This article proposes the idea that some inmates have inherent characteristics that allow them to better adapt to solitary confinement while others do not, similar to the ability to adapt to any new environment.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt;  Furthermore, it showed that the majority of inmates adapted to solitary confinement within a few days finding ways to pass time such as sleeping, thinking about the future, and exercising.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; This article argues that this study gives a better representation of the effects of solitary confinement as it claims the participants are average inmates in traditional solitary confinement conditions, rather than controlled experimental conditions. The conclusions drawn from this study include the argument of consistency; that in order to prove that solitary confinement is harmful to inmates, there needs to be some sort of consistent negative result and their findings do not match this.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt;

It should be emphasized that these studies were conducted in 1963 and 1982, respectively.

==Proponents==
Proponents{{who|date=October 2016}} of solitary confinement propound that solitary confinement can improve the safety of inmates and prison staff. Earlier justifications for solitary confinement in the mid 20th century included protection for a prisoner whose sexual orientation, religion, or race were far too different and seen as vulnerable to attack from fellow inmates.{{cn |date= October 2018}}

==Solitary Confinement of Women ==
{{main|Solitary confinement of women}}
While studies have shown the effects of solitary confinement to be detrimental to all inmates, '''solitary confinement of women''' has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. Solitary confinement rates for women in the [[United States]] are roughly comparable to those for men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solitarywatch.com/facts/faq/|title=FAQ|date=2012-01-31|website=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and about 20% of prisoners will be in solitary confinement at some point during their prison career.

== Incidence ==
According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]’ report from 2011-2012, about 20% of female prison inmates and 17% of female jail inmates spent some time in solitary confinement during that year, numbers which are comparable to rates for men.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Solitary confinement is allegedly used to prevent violence within the prison population, and is becoming more common with the prison industrial complex and the rise in incarceration rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In most prisons, inmates that are put into solitary confinement fall into one of three categories: disciplinary segregation, voluntary administrative segregation, and involuntary administrative segregation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bottos, Shauna. 2007. ''Profile of Offenders in Administrative Segregation: A Review of the Literature''. Research Report No. B-39. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; Disciplinary segregation is used as a punishment, while administrative segregation is a preventative measure intended to protect either the inmate being isolated or the other inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While segregation as a disciplinary measure or a precaution that protects other inmates is allegedly reserved for offenders who have committed violent acts while in prison, women in particular are often put into solitary for much smaller offenses, such as throwing things or talking back to guards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2001-01-01|title=Telling the Story: A Study in the Segregation of Women Prisoners|jstor=29768065|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=196–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used against women who complain of sexual assault from prison guards or other inmates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union. 2014. “Worse Than Second-Class: Solitary Confinement of Women in the United States.” Retrieved May 2, 2016 (https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/worse_than_second-class.pdf).
&lt;/ref&gt; Once they are in solitary confinement, women are often monitored more closely and disciplined more harshly than men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Disciplinary segregation ===
An offender who has committed a “serious disciplinary offense” may be put in solitary confinement as a punitive measure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inmates put into disciplinary segregation are not required to be given the same privileges as those put into administrative segregation,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the duration of their stay in isolation tends to be shorter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wichmann, Cherami and Kelly Taylor. 2004. ''Federally Sentenced Women in Administrative Segregation: A Descriptive Analysis''. Research Report No. R-158. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; According to a magazine written by inmates in a California prison, the practice operates under a “guilty until proven innocent” protocol, holding prisoners in solitary confinement even before it is clear that they committed the infraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preasmyer|first=Amy|date=2014|title=Together we can make a difference|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates who are considered to be politically threatening are sometimes put into isolation; although the United States does not officially hold political prisoners, some inmates in solitary confinement are there because of their political activism. This justification often means that minorities are more likely to end up in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Administrative segregation ===
Administrative segregation, or “ad seg," is typically more common than disciplinary segregation, and serves to protect either the inmate being placed in solitary or others in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An offender may be put into administrative segregation if they are thought to be dangerous to others or if their own safety is in danger, or if “the inmate has the potential to interfere with an ongoing investigation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Often women who vocalize the fact that they feel threatened by someone else will be put into solitary confinement, and similarly, if they are accused of acting threatening in any way, they are put into solitary without being able to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rojo|first=Misty|date=2014|title=Solitary Torture in Women’s Prisons|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are put into administrative segregation tend to be those women who have had trouble adjusting to prison life and who are seen as “high-risk” and “high-needs” when they enter the prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because this type of segregation is not intended as punishment, inmates in administrative segregation are legally required to be treated in the same way as those in general confinement in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Voluntary ====
Women prisoners sometimes request to be put into solitary confinement, most often for their own protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, some women are thought to request solitary confinement to avoid “further assaults on their identity” that might arise from their interactions and experiences in prison.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2006-01-01|title=TO BE, ONE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE: Spatio—temporality in Prison Segregation|jstor=23639455|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=46|issue=4|pages=587–612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that women who have been in voluntary administrative segregation tend to have high personal or emotional needs, and some have struggled with substance abuse, although few have difficulty with “community functioning.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Involuntary ====
Women prisoners who are deemed to be dangerous to other prisoners are sometimes put into administrative segregation; a prisoner can also be put in segregation if the officers determine that she herself is in danger and needs this protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Like women who are voluntarily put into segregation, these women tend to have high personal and emotional needs, but many of them also have difficulties functioning in the community or associating with other people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Women put in segregation ===
In general, women tend to be subjected to harsher disciplinary practices in prisons than men.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shaylor, Cassandra. 1998. “It's Like Living in A Black Hole: Women of Color and Solitary Confinement in the Prison Industrial Complex.” ''New England Journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement'' 385:390-420.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of solitary confinement, women are often put into segregation for committing small errors while in prison, for example spitting at a guard, while men must commit more violent infractions, such as attacking a guard, for segregation to become necessary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This could arise from the fact that women in prison are held to especially high standards of femininity, and prisons encourage them to conform to very traditional ideas of being a woman.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This model of femininity requires women to be “pure, passive, heterosexual, and located in motherhood."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When women do not comply with this standard while imprisoned, they are punished further. In fact, some prisons specifically isolate women who seem “butch” or not traditionally feminine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Arkles, Gabriel. 2009. "Safety and Solidarity Across Gender Lines: Rethinking Segregation of Transgender People in Detention." Temple ''Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review'' 18(2):515-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another catalyst for being put into solitary confinement that applies overwhelmingly to women is that prisoners who complain of abusive treatment by guards are often segregated as retaliation. In particular, women who speak out after guards have sexually harassed them are often put into segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only does this mean that guards who are guilty of sexually harassing inmates go unpunished, it also decreases the likelihood that women will report harassment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In some prisons, women may be put into solitary confinement because their mental health issues prove to be too difficult for the authorities to deal with or are exhausting their resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the prison authorities are unable to address their inmates’ health concerns, they may put them into solitary confinement to avoid solving the problem. This means that the women in solitary confinement are often already at risk for mental health or other challenges, due to previous health concerns or sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Consequences for women ==
Solitary confinement has been shown to be detrimental to the mental and physical well-being of all inmates, but there are some ways in which being put into segregation can be more harmful for women than for men. This is often due to patriarchal structures that exist outside of the prison environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They “experience segregation ''as women''”; they are both subjected to slightly different treatment than men are and their perception of this treatment may differ as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
Being put into solitary confinement can be very damaging to the mental health of female inmates, particularly those with a history of mental or physical illness, as has been found in a number of studies that observed and interviewed women who were being held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Being held in a small space without access to objects, recreation, or human contact can lead to claustrophobia, anger, depression, hallucinations,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=The Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766384|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; insomnia, and obsessive ideation or fixation on dying.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=Follow-Up Report on the Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766385|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a psychosomatic level, inmates in solitary confinement often experience a loss of appetite and/or weight, dizziness, or heart palpitations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Prison staff often do not respond adequately to complaints of any of these symptoms, and sometimes refuse to offer medical care or medication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some of the anxiety that inmates, particularly female inmates, experience in solitary confinement comes from a loss or confusion of identity. Prisoners in solitary confinement are not allowed to decorate the small rooms that they are in or to bring most of their possessions that they were allowed in general confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This prevents the women from having any sort of entertainment, but also exacerbates feelings of a loss of individuality and of personal identity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Studies of the conditions of segregation, and interviews with the women who are subjected to them, have shown that women may also experience a collapse or confusion of identity while in prison because of their removal from their community and because of the unusual experience of space and time while in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Prisoners attach a lot of importance to the items that they have in their rooms; when they are placed into solitary confinement and no longer allowed to keep these identifying objects with them, they begin to lose their sense of self.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further, because prisoners kept in segregation often interact little with the outside world, and because the routines of eating and cleaning may be different from in general confinement, the women lose their ability to mark time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Fire Inside'' magazine, written by offenders in California women's prisons, quotes one prisoner as saying that her recommendation for those held in solitary confinement is “to create a schedule” and figure out the time of day, because it “helps to assert control over your own life and not be totally defined by whatever ‘routine’ the prison is forcing on you.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehorn|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Surviving Solitary|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of their identity that is destroyed is their ability to form relationships with others. In most societies, women are perceived as being particularly social; having relationships with other people is seen as an essential element of their role as women in particular. This is of course impossible when in solitary confinement. It has been argued that this has a harmful effect on women especially. These conclusions were drawn from interviews with women who were still in solitary confinement, women who had been in solitary but had since been transferred back to the general prison population, and women who had been in solitary but had been released from incarceration, suggesting that these effects carry over beyond their time in segregation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some prisons do allow inmates in solitary confinement to use recreation rooms and exercise yards, but these are often monitored by cameras, creating a sense of powerlessness and humiliating and deterring the women from using these facilities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Feelings of powerlessness or hopeless are exacerbated by the fact that women are often unsure of how long they will be held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

All of these factors combined can have different effects on women, making them either increasingly anxious or increasingly indifferent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While some women feel desperate and angry, others attempt to feel as little as possible in order to mitigate the effects of segregation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of the detrimental effect on their mental stability, inmates in solitary confinement often resort to self-harm; this behavior is more common in women than in men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can sometimes lead to women being held in solitary confinement for longer, as punishment for their destructive actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, it reinforces the guards’ perceptions of these women as particularly violent or dangerous to the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Sexual abuse ===
Women in solitary confinement are often watched over by male guards, which can result in sexual harassment ranging from discomfort caused by guards watching them during private moments to nonconsensual sexual contact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Male guards often are present while women shower or undress, stripping away the women's right to the privacy of their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because women in solitary confinement experience so little human contact, the gaze of their guards is often the only interaction that they have with another person; this can exacerbate the feelings of loss of privacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Similarly, the clothing the women are required to wear is sexualized and humiliating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}} In some prisons, women in segregation wear a “baby doll,” a long shapeless dress, with no underclothes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}} Although men sometimes are required to wear the “baby doll” as well, women find that wearing it while being watched by their male guards is degrading and makes them feel powerless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}}

Beyond this, women in segregation are sometimes subjected to sexual abuse or physical harassment by their male guards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are often forced to undergo thorough strip searches, during which the guards are more forceful and invasive than is strictly necessary&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and serves mostly to demonstrate the guards’ authority over the inmates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Because so many female inmates have been victims of sexual or physical abuse, this forces them to relive the trauma of their previous abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be especially devastating for women whose mental states are already deteriorating, due to prior mental illness or to the effects of being in segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It can also result in pregnancy, and pregnant women in solitary confinement—whether the pregnancy was a result of a rape by a guard or not—are often denied proper medical care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women have also reported stories of being publicly humiliated when asking for additional sanitary pads during their menstrual periods,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or being forced to hand in their used pads in order to acquire a new one, according to the women who contributed to ''The Fire Inside'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They are entirely dependent on male guards, even for such personal needs as this.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Separation from children ===
Women are more likely than men to be the primary guardian of a child or children; having a mother who is in solitary confinement, then, can be very detrimental to the children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Inmates in solitary confinement have much less frequent contact with family members, and when they do, they are usually separated by a partition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although inmates are allowed some visits from immediate family members, a long background check is required.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Children with mothers in prison are at a greater risk for depression or anxiety, substance abuse, or involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These factors are only furthered by the more distanced relationship that becomes necessary with a mother in solitary confinement and the restrictions on visitation that accompany that.

=== Reentry ===
Women who are released from solitary confinement into the general prison population are more likely than men to experience stigmatization and humiliation from the prison guards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This often leads to them isolating themselves and not interacting with other prisoners even when they are not in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once they are released from prison, too, they often have a harder time adjusting to being a part of society again, and frequently end up back in prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ex-offenders who were held in solitary confinement are more likely to commit violent acts against others once released than those who spent all their time in the general prison population.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As one California prisoner who wrote for ''The Fire Inside'' prison magazine put it, “We go through these kind of mental, emotional, and spiritual stages. At first when you get here you’re angry and disoriented…Paranoia sets in…I slowly began to think of this cell as my safe place…What happens next year when they take the box away?” She, and other women in solitary confinement, become unequipped to deal with the outside world and the knowledge of technological advancement, social interaction skills, and mental stability that it requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Stages of the SHU|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women of color in solitary confinement ==
In general, women of color, like men of color, are more likely to be put in prison than white women and men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Likewise, they are thought to be somewhat disproportionately represented in the solitary confinement population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margo|first=Schlanger,|date=2013-01-01|title=Prison Segregation: Symposium Introduction and Preliminary Data on Racial Disparities|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/articles/461/|journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2011-2012, 16% of white prison inmates, 20% of black/African American prison inmates, 16% of Hispanic or Latino prison inmates, and 20% of prison with some other racial identification were in solitary confinement at some point. The difference was slightly less pronounced in jails, with 17% of white, 17% of black/African American, 15% of Hispanic/Latino, and 21% of other inmates spending time in solitary confinement. There is no data available that specifically documents the intersection between race and gender.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5433|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) - Use of Restrictive Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 2011–12|website=www.bjs.gov|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of people of color in isolation is only slightly higher than the number of white people, their experiences in solitary confinement may differ. Women in solitary confinement are treated as less than human, in ways which parallel not only the larger societal degradation of women but also that of people of color. The sexually abusive nature of their interactions with the guards, and the denial of medical care, social contact, and resources, can be seen as racialized. In particular, guards often refer to women in solitary confinement using slurs that are both misogynist and racist.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women who are put into solitary confinement are often isolated because of actions that challenge dominant perspectives of femininity. Because women of color are often seen as possessing these non-feminine qualities already, they are more susceptible to being put into solitary confinement because of this kind of behavior. Black women are often perceived as “aggressive and recalcitrant,” Latina women are thought to be “loud and belligerent, sexually aggressive, or…unable to speak English,” and Native American women are seen as “backward, savage, and/or primitive.” Because of these preconceptions, women of color are thought to deviate strongly from the feminine ideal, which can be grounds for putting them in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Representations of crime in popular media serve to perpetuate racial stereotypes as well. Offenders of color, including women, are often portrayed as violent, hypersexual, or drug-addicted. While this is true of women of color in the general prison population as well as those held in solitary confinement, there is a particularly strong culture of fear that is built up around segregation units and the prisoners who are held there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Inmates who appear to belong to particular minority groups are often profiled by prison guards as more likely to be dangerous, violent, or involved in a gang, and therefore are moved into isolation; for example, prisoners who speak a language other than English are sometimes targeted as foreign and therefore gang-involved or dangerous.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerness|first=Bonnie|last2=Lewey|first2=Jamie Bissonette|date=2014-01-01|title=Race and the Politics of Isolation in U.S. Prisons|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4474">'''Steering ratio''' refers to the ratio between the turn of the [[steering wheel]] (in degrees) or handlebars and the turn of the wheels (in degrees).&lt;ref name="Pacejka"&gt;{{cite book

The steering ratio is the ratio of the number of degrees of turn of the steering wheel to the number of degrees the wheel(s) turn as a result. In [[Motorcycle|motorcycles]], [[Tricycle|delta tricycles]] and [[Bicycle|bicycles]], the steering ratio is always 1:1, because the steering wheel is fixed to the front wheel. A steering ratio of x:y means that a turn of the steering wheel x degree(s) causes the wheel(s) to turn y degree(s). In most [[Car|passenger cars]], the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1. For example, if one complete turn of the steering wheel, 360 degrees, causes the wheels to turn 24 degrees, the ratio is then 360:24 = 15:1.

A higher steering ratio means that the steering wheel is turned more to get the wheels turning, but it will be easier to turn the steering wheel. A lower steering ratio means that the steering wheel is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the steering wheel. Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio, which will make the steering wheel easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the steering wheel. In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder to turn.

==Variable-ratio steering==
Variable-ratio steering is a system that uses different ratios on the rack in a [[rack and pinion]] steering system. At the center of the rack, the space between the teeth are smaller and the space becomes larger as the pinion moves down the rack. In the middle of the rack there is a higher ratio and the ratio becomes lower as the steering wheel is turned towards lock. This makes the steering less sensitive when the steering wheel is close to its center position and makes it harder for the driver to [[oversteer]] at high speeds. As the steering wheel is turned towards lock, the wheels begin to react more to steering input

==Steering quickener==
A steering quickener is used to modify the steering ratio of factory-installed steering system, which in turn modifies the response time and overall handling of vehicle. When a steering quickener is employed in an automobile, the driver of the automobile can turn the steering wheel a smaller degree compared to a factory-installed steering system without a steering quickener, to turn the vehicle through same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steer Quick with a Quick Steer |work=Stock Car Racing |date=April 22, 2005 |accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the steering effort needed will greatly increase. If the automobile is equipped with power steering, overloading the power steering pump can also be a concern.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Grishin, [https://racingrebel.com/subaru-steering-quickener-installation/ "Subaru Steering Quickener Installation"], ''Racing Rebel'', Retrieved 2017-07-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate definition==
Another use of the term '''steering ratio''' is for the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire behavior and the actual turning radius based on real tire behavior.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Values less than one, where the front wheel [[Slip angle|side slip]] is greater than the rear wheel side slip, are described as [[Understeer|under-steering]]; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as [[Oversteer|over-steering]]. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as  [[Countersteering#Other_uses|counter-steering]].

'''TAMPEP''' ('''European Network for HIV/STI Prevention and Health Promotion among Migrant Sex Workers''') is an international organization that supports the health and human rights of [[migrant worker|migrant]] [[sex worker]]s in Europe.&lt;ref name=ducket&gt;Margaret Ducket, [http://data.unaids.org/Publications/IRC-pub02/jc519-migrantsrighttohealth_en.pdf Migrants' Right to Health], [[UNAIDS]] Best Practice Collection, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1993, with headquarters in [[Amsterdam]], the organization initially operated in Italy, Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. Today, it coordinates a network of 26 organizations in 25 countries of the [[European Union]], and receives funding from the [[European Commission]] as well as from national governmental and non-governmental organizations.

The main concern of the project is [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention; it approaches the problem from a general health and human rights approach, working for empowerment and self-determination of female and transsexual migrant sex workers, and for improvements in their working conditions and social situation.&lt;ref name=ducket/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brussa L, [http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102284097.html Migrant Sex workers in Europe: the experience of TAMPEP], ''15th International Conference on AIDS'', Bangkok Thailand 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The member organizations employ [[street work]], [[peer educator]]s and informational materials to contact migrant sex workers.&lt;ref name=gp&gt;[http://www.tampep.eu/documents/tampep_generalpresentation.pdf TAMPEP General Presentation], retrieved 4 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The organization produces regular reports about the situation of prostitutes in Europe.

TAMPEP's literature emphasizes the need to cleanly distinguish between the issues of [[human trafficking|trafficking]], [[sex work]] and [[Human migration|migration]]. TAMPEP opposes trafficking as a human rights abuse, but supports efforts to improve working conditions of sex workers and to facilitate migration.&lt;ref name=pos&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/com_diseases/documents/fp_commdis_2002_frep_17_3_en.pdf TAMPEP Position Paper on Migration and Sex Work (2002)], retrieved 4 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

TAMPEP has also operated in [[Nigeria]], where it helps to rehabilitate sex workers deported from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

[[File:Wachstafel.jpg|thumb|Roman ''tabula'' or [[wax tablet]] with [[stylus]].]]

'''''Tabula rasa''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|b|j|ə|l|ə|_|ˈ|r|ɑː|s|ə|,_|-|z|ə|,_|ˈ|r|eɪ|-}}) refers to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] idea that individuals are born without built-in [[mental content]] and that therefore all knowledge comes from [[experience]] or [[perception]]. Proponents of tabula rasa generally disagree with the doctrine of [[innatism]] which holds that the mind is born already in possession of certain knowledge. Generally, proponents of the ''tabula rasa'' theory also favour the "nurture" side of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate when it comes to aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behaviour, knowledge and [[Wisdom#Sapience|sapience]].

==History==
''Tabula rasa'' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase often translated as "'''blank slate'''" in [[English language|English]] and originates from the Roman ''tabula'' used for notes, which was blanked by heating the wax and then smoothing it.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5PwrAAAAYAAJ |title=A Concise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |publisher=Spottiswoode and Co. |author=Smith, Sir William |year=1898 |location=London |pages=608–9 |editor=Cornish, F. Warre}}&lt;/ref&gt; This roughly equates to the English term "blank slate" (or, more literally, "erased slate") which refers to the emptiness of a [[Slate (writing)|slate]] prior to it being written on with chalk. Both may be renewed repeatedly, by melting the wax of the tablet or by erasing the chalk on the slate.

==Philosophy==
{{See also|Empiricism}}
In [[Western philosophy]], the concept of ''tabula rasa'' can be traced back to the writings of [[Aristotle]] who writes in his treatise "Περί Ψυχῆς" (''[[De Anima]]'' or ''On the Soul'') of the "unscribed tablet." In one of the more well-known passages of this treatise he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Haven't we already disposed of the difficulty about interaction involving a common element, when we said that mind is in a sense potentially whatever is thinkable, though actually it is nothing until it has thought? What it thinks must be in it just as characters may be said to be on a writing-tablet on which as yet nothing stands written: this is exactly what happens with mind.{{sfn|Aristotle, ''De Anima''|loc=429b29–430a1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This idea was further developed in Ancient Greek philosophy by the [[stoicism|Stoic]] school. Stoic epistemology emphasizes that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bardzell |first=Jeffrey |title=Speculative Grammar and Stoic Language Theory in Medieval Allegorical Narrative: From Prudentius to Alan of Lille |date=June 11, 2014 |publisher=Routledge |pages=18–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doxographer [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] summarizes this view as "When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz 4.11 translated by {{cite book |last1=Long |first1=A.A. |last2=Sedley |first2=D.N. |title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Vol. 1 |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge |location=Cambridge, Ma |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] attributes a similar belief to the Stoic [[Zeno of Citium]] when he writes in [[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]] that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perception, again, is an impression produced on the mind, its name being appropriately borrowed from impressions on wax made by a seal; and perception they divide into, comprehensible and incomprehensible: Comprehensible, which they call the criterion of facts, and which is produced by a real object, and is, therefore, at the same time conformable to that object; Incomprehensible, which has no relation to any real object, or else, if it has any such relation, does not correspond to it, being but a vague and indistinct representation.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 43-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the eleventh century, the theory of ''tabula rasa'' was developed more clearly by the [[Persian people|Persian]] philosopher [[Avicenna]]  (Ibn Sina in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]). He argued that the "...human intellect at birth resembled a ''tabula rasa'', a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know," and that knowledge is attained through "...[[empirical]] familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts," which develops through a "...[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]]; observations lead to propositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts." He further argued that the intellect itself "...possesses levels of development from the static/material intellect (''al-‘aql al-hayulani''), that potentiality can acquire knowledge to the active intellect (''al-‘aql al-fa‘il''), the state of the human intellect at conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twelfth century, the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-[[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and novelist, [[Ibn Tufail]], known as "Abubacer" or "Ebn Tophail" in the West, demonstrated the theory of ''tabula rasa'' as a [[thought experiment]] through his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqzan]]'', in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]], through [[experience]] alone. The [[Latin]] translation of his [[philosophical novel]], entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of ''tabula rasa'' in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), The Impact of the Philosophus autodidactus: Pocockes, John Locke and the Society of Friends, in: G. A. Russell (ed.), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–262, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Velazquez Sibyl Meadows Museum.jpg|thumb|''[[Female Figure (Velázquez)|Female Figure (Sibyl with Tabula Rasa)]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]], c. 1648]]
In the thirteenth century, [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] brought the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] notions to the forefront of [[Christian philosophy|Christian thought]]. These notions sharply contrasted with the previously held [[Platonism|Platonic]] notions of the human mind as an entity that preexisted somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body here on Earth (see Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''Apology'', as well as others). [[St. Bonaventure]] (also thirteenth century) was one of the fiercest intellectual opponents of Aquinas, offering some of the strongest arguments toward the Platonic idea of the mind.

The writings of Avicenna, Ibn Tufail, and Aquinas on the ''tabula rasa'' theory stood unprogressed and untested for several centuries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} For example, the [[late medieval]] English jurist [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]], in his work ''[[In Praise of the Laws of England]]'' (Chapter VI), takes for granted the notion of ''tabula rasa'', stressing it as the basis of the need for the education of the young in general, and of young princes specifically. "Therefore, Prince, whilst you are young and your mind is as it were a clean slate, impress on it these things, lest in future it be impressed more pleasurably with images of lesser worth." (''His igitur, Princeps, dum Adolescens es, et Anima tua velut'' '''Tabula rasa''', ''depinge eam, ne in futurum ipsa Figuris minoris Frugi delectabilius depingatur''.)

The modern idea of the theory, however, is attributed mostly to [[John Locke]]'s expression of the idea in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (he uses the term "white paper" in Book II, Chap. I, 2). In Locke's philosophy, ''tabula rasa'' was the theory that at birth the (human) mind is a "blank slate" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's [[sense|sensory]] experiences. The notion is central to Lockean empiricism; it serves as the starting point for Locke's subsequent explication (in Book II) of simple ideas and complex ideas. As understood by Locke, ''tabula rasa'' meant that the mind of the individual was born blank, and it also emphasized the freedom of individuals to author their own [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. Individuals are free to define the content of their character—but basic identity as a member of the human species cannot be altered. This presumption of a free, self-authored mind combined with an immutable human nature leads to the Lockean doctrine of "natural" rights. Locke's idea of ''tabula rasa'' is frequently compared with [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s viewpoint of human nature, in which humans are endowed with inherent mental content—particularly with selfishness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The eighteenth-century Swiss philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used ''tabula rasa'' to support his argument that warfare is an advent of society and agriculture, rather than something that occurs from the human state of nature. Since ''tabula rasa'' states that humans are born with a "blank-slate", Rousseau uses this to suggest that humans must learn warfare.

''Tabula rasa'' also features in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]]. Freud depicted personality traits as being formed by family dynamics (see [[Oedipus complex]]). Freud's theories imply that humans lack free will, but also that genetic influences on human personality are minimal. In Freudian psychoanalysis, one is largely determined by one's upbringing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The ''tabula rasa'' concept became popular in social sciences during the twentieth century. Early ideas of [[eugenics]] posited that human intelligence correlated strongly with social class, but these ideas were rejected, and the idea that genes (or simply "blood") determined a person's character became regarded as racist. By the 1970s, scientists such as [[John Money]] had come to see [[gender identity]] as socially constructed, rather than rooted in genetics.

===Psychology and neurobiology===
{{main|Nature versus nurture}}
Psychologists and neurobiologists have shown evidence that initially, the entire [[cerebral cortex]] is programmed and organized to process sensory input, control motor actions, regulate emotion, and respond reflexively (under predetermined conditions).&lt;ref name="tabula rasa0"&gt;{{cite journal

For example, psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] showed that—in contrast to written language—the brain is "programmed" to pick up spoken language spontaneously.&lt;ref name="Pinker 2002"/&gt;

There have been claims by a minority in psychology and neurobiology, however, that the brain is ''tabula rasa'' only for certain behaviours. For instance, with respect to one's ability to acquire both general and special types of knowledge or skills, [[Michael Howe (psychologist)|Howe]] argued against the existence of innate talent.&lt;ref name=howe1998&gt;M. J. Howe, [[J. W. Davidson]] and J. A. Sloboda. (1998). [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=29991 Innate talents: reality or myth?] ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences|Behav. Brain. Sci.]]'', '''21''', 399–407; discussion 407–42.&lt;/ref&gt; There also have been neurological investigations into specific learning and memory functions, such as [[Karl Lashley]]'s study on [[Mass Action Principle (neuroscience)|mass action]] and serial interaction mechanisms.

Important evidence against the ''tabula rasa'' model of the mind comes from [[behavioural genetics]], especially [[twin studies|twin]] and [[adoption]] studies (see below). These indicate strong genetic influences on personal characteristics such as [[IQ]], [[alcoholism]], [[gender identity]], and other traits.&lt;ref name="Pinker 2002"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, multivariate studies show that the distinct faculties of the mind, such as memory and reason, fractionate along genetic boundaries. Cultural universals such as [[emotion]] and the relative resilience of psychological adaptation to accidental biological changes (for instance the [[David Reimer]] case of gender reassignment following an accident) also support basic biological mechanisms in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|date=1997-03-01|title=Sex Reassignment at Birth|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/518304|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|language=en|volume=151|issue=3|pages=298|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social pre-wiring====
Twin studies have resulted in important evidence against the ''tabula rasa'' model of the mind, specifically, of [[social behaviour]].

'''The social pre-wiring hypothesis''' refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behaviour. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behaviour cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behaviour]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]]&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;.

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behaviour|social behaviours]] that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin fetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten fetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin fetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;.

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin fetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behaviour]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin fetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions."&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;.

===Computer science===
In [[computer science]], ''tabula rasa'' refers to the development of autonomous agents with a mechanism to reason and plan toward their goal, but no "built-in" knowledge-base of their environment. Thus they truly are a blank slate.

In reality autonomous agents possess an initial data-set or knowledge-base, but this cannot be immutable or it would hamper autonomy and heuristic ability.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Even if the data-set is empty, it usually may be argued that there is a built-in [[bias]] in the reasoning and planning mechanisms.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Either intentionally or unintentionally placed there by the human designer, it thus negates the true spirit of ''tabula rasa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/koans.html The Jargon Files: "Sussman attains enlightenment"], also see the article section [[Hacker koan#Uncarved block|Hacker koan: Uncarved block]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A synthetic (programming) language parser ([[LR(1)]], [[LALR(1)]] or [[SLR(1)]], for example) could be considered a special case of a ''tabula rasa'', as it is designed to accept ''any'' of a possibly infinite set of source language programs, within a ''single'' programming language, and to output either a good parse of the program, or a good machine language translation of the program, either of which represents a ''success'', or, alternately, a ''failure'', and nothing else. The "initial data-set" is a set of tables which are generally produced mechanically by a parser table generator, usually from a [[Backus–Naur form|BNF]] representation of the source language, and represents a "table representation" of that ''single'' programming language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8082">'''"The Centipede's Dilemma"''' is a short poem that has lent its name to a psychological effect called the '''centipede effect''' or '''centipede syndrome'''. The centipede effect occurs when a normally automatic or unconscious activity is disrupted by consciousness of it or reflection on it. For example, a golfer thinking too closely about her swing or someone thinking too much about how he knots his tie may find his performance of the task impaired. The effect is also known as '''hyper-reflection''' or '''Humphrey's law'''&lt;ref name=colman&gt;{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|title=A Dictionary of Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-953406-7|pages=120|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the English psychologist [[George Humphrey (psychologist)|George Humphrey]] (1889–1966), who propounded it in 1923. As he wrote of the poem, "This is a most psychological rhyme. It contains a profound truth which is illustrated daily in the lives of all of us". The effect is the reverse of a [[solvitur ambulando]].

==The poem==
The poem, a short rhyme, is usually attributed to Katherine Craster (1841–1874)&lt;ref name="colman"/&gt; in ''Pinafore Poems'', 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connolly|first=Kevin|title=Psychologically Speaking: A Book of Quotations|year=1999|publisher=BPS Books|location=Leicester|isbn=978-1-85433-302-5|page=220|author2=Martlew, Margaret }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881 it had begun appearing in journals such as ''The Spectator''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=The Spectator|volume=54|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Living Age''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Littell|first1=Eliakim|last2=Littell|first2=Robert S.|work=The Living Age|volume=150|publisher=The Living Age Co. Inc.|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem later appeared in an article by British zoologist [[Ray Lankester|E.&amp;nbsp;Ray Lankester]], published in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on May 23, 1889,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lankester|first=E.&amp;nbsp;Ray|title=Muybridge Photographs|journal=Nature|date=23 May 1889|pages=78–80|url=https://archive.org/stream/naturejournal40londuoft/naturejournal40londuoft_djvu.txt | volume=40|doi=10.1038/040078b0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which discussed the work of the photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] in capturing the motion of animals: "For my own part," wrote Lankester, "I should greatly like to apply Mr. Muybridge's cameras, or a similar set of batteries, to the investigation of a phenomenon more puzzling even than that of 'the galloping horse'. I allude to the problem of 'the running centipede{{' "}}. Lankester finished the article on a fanciful note by imagining the "disastrous results in the way of perplexity" that could result from such an investigation, quoting the poem and mentioning that the author was unknown to him or to the friend who sent it to him. It has since been variously attributed to specific authors but without convincing evidence, and often appears under the title "The Centipede's Dilemma".

The version in the article is as follows:

:A centipede was happy – quite!
:Until a toad in fun
:Said, "Pray, which leg moves after which?"
:This raised her doubts to such a pitch,
:She fell exhausted in the ditch
:Not knowing how to run.

Another version of the Centipede's Dilemma:

:A centipede was happy – quite!
:Until a toad in fun
:Said, "Pray, which leg comes after which?"
:Which threw her mind in such a pitch,
:She laid bewildered in the ditch
:Considering how to run.

Modern versions of the poem often recast it in verse as a fable of a spider (or other protagonist) who found a clever way to avoid being eaten.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Another rhyme goes:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

:A spider met a centipede while hurrying down the street,
:"How do you move at such a speed, with all so many feet?"
:"I do not have to contemplate to keep them all in line,
:But if I start to concentrate they're tangled all the time!"

==In psychology and philosophy==
The psychologist [[George Humphrey (psychologist)|George Humphrey]] referred to the tale in his 1923 book ''The Story of Man's Mind'':&lt;ref name=humphrey&gt;{{cite book|last=Humphrey|first=George|title=The Story of Man's Mind|year=1923|publisher=Small, Maynard and company|location=Boston|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No man skilled at a trade needs to put his constant attention on the routine work", he wrote. "If he does, the job is apt to be spoiled". He went on to recount the centipede's story, commenting, "This is a most psychological rhyme. It contains a profound truth which is illustrated daily in the lives of all of us, for exactly the same thing happens if we pay conscious attention to any well-formed habit, such as walking". Thus, the eponymous "Humphrey's law" states that once performance of a task has become automatized, conscious thought about the task, while performing it, impairs performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roeckelein|first=Jon&amp;nbsp;E.|title=Dictionary of Theories, Laws, and Concepts in Psychology|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-30460-6|page=447|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas habit diminishes and then eliminates the attention required for routine tasks, this [[automaticity]] is disrupted by attention to a normally [[unconscious competence]].

The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] referred to the centipede effect in his book ''Knowledge and the Body-Mind Problem: In Defence of Interaction'':&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl R.|editor-last=Notturno|editor-first=M.&amp;nbsp;A.|title=Knowledge and the Body-Mind Problem: In Defence of Interaction|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcjnmyRhQwsC&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;ots=tLMilPiJvv&amp;dq=%22centipede%20effect%22&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=%22centipede%20effect%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-11504-9|pages=116|edition=1st. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "if we have learnt certain movements so that they have sunk below the level of conscious control, then if we try to follow them consciously we very often interfere with them so badly that we stop them". He gives the example of the violinist [[Adolf Busch]] who was asked by fellow-violinist [[Bronisław Huberman]] how he played a certain passage of [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Beethoven's violin concerto]]. Busch told Huberman that it was quite simple—and then found that he could no longer play the passage.

The psychiatric psychoanalyst [[Theo L. Dorpat]] compares questions and interventions irrelevant to the patient's current thought process during [[psychotherapy]] in his book ''Gaslighting'' to "the story of the centipede who became disorganized and unable to walk after he was asked, 'What's wrong with your 34th left foot?'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorpat|first=Theo&amp;nbsp;L.|title=Gaslighting, the Double-Whammy, Interrogation and Other Methods of Convert Control in Psychotherapy &amp; Analysis|year=1996|publisher=Aronson|location=Northvale, New Jersey|isbn=978-1-568-21828-1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

In 1903, ''[[Simplicissimus]]'' magazine printed an adaptation of the story by the Austrian author [[Gustav Meyrink]], "The Curse of The Toad" (''Der Fluch der Kröte''). The fable was also published in Meyrink's 1903 collection of tales, ''The Hot Soldier and Other Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Zipes|editor-first=Jack|title=The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-860115-9|page=318|edition=1st published.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spider Robinson]]'s short story "The Centipede's Dilemma" concerns a psychic who uses instinctive telekinetic powers to cheat at darts, and is foiled when another character triggers hyper-reflection in him.

In statistics, a '''volcano plot''' is a type of [[scatter-plot]] that is used to quickly identify changes in large data sets composed of replicate data.&lt;ref name="pmid12702200"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1186/gb-2003-4-4-210| pmid = 12702200| year = 2003| last1 = Cui | first1 = X. | title = Statistical tests for differential expression in cDNA microarray experiments| journal = Genome Biology| volume = 4| issue = 4| pages = 210| last2 = Churchill | first2 = G. A. | pmc = 154570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It plots significance versus [[Fold change|fold-change]] on the y and x axes, respectively.  These plots are increasingly common in [[List of omics topics in biology|omic]] experiments such as [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], and [[metabolomics]] where one often has a list of many thousands of replicate data points between two conditions and one wishes to quickly identify the most meaningful changes. A volcano plot combines a measure of statistical significance from a statistical test (e.g., a [[p value]] from an [[ANOVA]] model) with the magnitude of the change, enabling quick visual identification of those data-points (genes, etc.) that display large magnitude changes that are also [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]].

A volcano plot is constructed by plotting the negative log of the [[p value]] on the [[y axis]] (usually base 10). This results in data points with low p values (highly significant) appearing toward the top of the plot. The [[x axis]] is the log of the [[fold change]] between the two conditions.  The log of the fold change is used so that changes in both directions appear equidistant from the center.  Plotting points in this way results in two regions of interest in the plot: those points that are found toward the top of the plot that are far to either the left- or right-hand sides. These represent values that display large magnitude fold changes (hence being left or right of center) as well as high [[statistical significance]] (hence being toward the top).

Additional information can be added by coloring the points according to a third dimension of data (such as signal intensity), but this is not uniformly employed. Volcano plots are also used to graphically display a [[significance analysis of microarrays]] (SAM) gene selection criterion, an example of [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]].&lt;ref name="pmid23075208"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1142/S0219720012310038| pmid = 23075208| title = Volcano plots in analyzing differential expressions with mRNA microarrays| journal = [[Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology]]| volume = 10| issue = 6| pages = 1231003| year = 2012| last1 = Li | first1 = W. | authorlink1 = Wentian Li| arxiv = 1103.3434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of volcano plot can be generalized to other applications, where the [[x axis]] is related to a measure of
the strength of a statistical signal, and [[y axis]] is related to a measure of the [[statistical significance]] of the signal.
For example, in a [[genetic association]] [[case-control]] study, such as [[Genome-wide association study]],
a point in a volcano plot represents a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]].
Its x value can be the [[odds ratio]] and its y value can be -log10 of the [[p value]] from a [[Chi-square test]]
or a Chi-square [[test statistic]].&lt;ref name="pmid23602812"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2013.02.003| pmid = 23602812| title = Using volcano plots and regularized-chi statistics in genetic association studies| journal = [[Computational Biology and Chemistry]]| volume = 48| pages = 77–83| year = 2014| last1 = Li | first1 = W. | authorlink1 = Wentian Li| last2 = Freudenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Suh | first3 = Y.
