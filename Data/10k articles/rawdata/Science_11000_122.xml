[[File:Acinonyx kurteni BW.jpg|thumb|right| Reconstruction of "''Acinonyx kurteni''"]]

"'''''Acinonyx kurteni'''''", or the '''Linxia cheetah''', is a discredited fossil specimen of an extinct [[Acinonyx|cheetah]] discovered in [[China]]. The [[scientific name]] was assigned for the [[skull]] that was originally described to be that of an extinct [[species]] of cheetah, [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Asia]] during the [[Late Pliocene]] sub-epoch. It was estimated to have lived around 2.2 to 2.5 [[Megaannum|Ma]] [[Before present|BP]], existing for approximately {{Mya|2.5-2.2|million years}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081229-cheetah-skull.html|title=Ancient Cheetah Fossil Points to Old World Roots?|accessdate=2009-01-05|work=National Geographic Magazine|date=2008-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090121062934/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081229-cheetah-skull.html| archivedate= 21 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fossil discovery was reported in 2008, and was claimed to be the most primitive ''Acinonyx'' lineage so far discovered. Further, the study concluded that the cheetahs originated in the [[Old World]], not the [[New World]] as previously believed.&lt;ref name=chris&gt;{{cite journal | author = Christiansen P, Mazák JH| url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/2/512.full | title = A primitive Late Pliocene cheetah, and evolution of the cheetah lineage | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  | date = January 13, 2009 | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages =  512–515 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0810435106 | pmid = 19114651 | pmc = 2626734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/29/fossil-cheetah-skull-evolution |title=Fossilised skull suggests cheetahs evolved in Asia not Americas | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=James | last=Randerson | date=December 29, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought to share some features with the modern cheetah, ''[[Acinonyx jubatus]]'', such as in having enlarged [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]]es for air intake during sprinting, while its teeth show primitive features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28435011/|title=Big cats traced to Asia, not America: Ancient cheetah skull discovered in China challenges old theories|accessdate=February 22, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318162542/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28435011/| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long suspicion of the authenticity of the fossil, it was finally accepted as a [[forgery]] in 2012.

==Discovery and description==

The fossil skull was discovered in 2008 and described in 2009 by Per Christiansen, from the [[University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum|Zoological Museum]] in Copenhagen, and Ji H. Mazák, of the [[Shanghai Science and Technology Museum]], in the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA]]''. It was reported as being discovered from the Late Pliocene, fossiliferous-rich “Hezheng” locality in [[Linxia County|Linxia]] basin (hence the popular name "Linxia cheetah"), in the south-eastern part of [[Gansu Province]], [[China]]. The species name was given in honour of [[Björn Kurtén]], the late professor of paleontology at the [[University of Helsinki]]. The skull was almost complete except for the [[occipital condyle]]s, basioccipital region and upper [[canine tooth|canine]]s. It resembles the true cheetahs in having a tall skull with a domed structure, a very wide braincase relative to skull length, enlarged frontal sinuses, a large [[Anterior nasal aperture|nasal aperture]], and a well-developed occipital crest. But the upper [[premolar]]s are very primitive, like those of some extinct felines. It is older than earlier described species, such as the European ''[[Acinonyx pardinensis]]'' (dated to about 2.2 Ma old) and the North African ''[[Acinonyx aicha]]'' (about 2.5 Ma old).&lt;ref name=chris/&gt; Thus, it apparently disproved the prevailing notion that cheetahs originated in the New World.&lt;ref name=knev&gt;{{cite web| author=Knevitt O  | title= 5 Greatest Palaeontology Fakes Of All Time #5: The Linxia Cheetah |url= http://www.science20.com/between_death_and_data/5_greatest_palaeontology_fakes_all_time_5_linxia_cheetah-75104|date=9 January 2011 |work=Science 2.0  |publisher=ION Publications LLC  |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrediting==

Even at the time of pre-publication of the research paper in 2008, there were already strong doubts about the veracity of the fossil. [[Tao Deng]], Professor of Paleontology at the Institute for Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in China, upon [[proofreading]] the manuscript, noted the possible forgery of the fossil, and immediately reported this to ''PNAS''. Just from the published pictures, Deng said that he could see that parts of the skull had been concocted from plaster. The technical give away was that the [[parietal bone|parietal]] area appeared glued together from disparate bone pieces, to imitate the skull of a modern cheetah.&lt;ref name=knev/&gt; He noted that parts of the skull were created from plaster, and are missing part of the parietal crests. However, his objection to publication was denied in an editorial letter on 5 February 2009, on the grounds that Deng had not personally examined the fossil.&lt;ref name=ivan&gt;{{cite web| author= Ivanoransky | title=  Author retracts PNAS paper about alleged Pliocene cheetah fossil that critics said was a fake|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/author-retracts-pnas-about-alleged-pliocine-cheetah-fossil-that-had-been-questioned/ |date= 20 August 2012|work= Retraction Watch |publisher= |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qiu Zhanxiang, a global expert in mammalian craniums, also supported the claim that the skull was forged. Since then it has been criticised publicly by a number of paleontologists in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=  | title= Top Ten (Top 10) Fraudulent/Fake Fossil Cases In History |url= http://tumblehomelearning.com/top-ten-top-10-fraudulentfake-fossil-cases-in-history/|date=28 May 2012 |work=  |publisher= Tumblehome Learning, Inc.|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mazák denied anyone else access to the fossil, and upon inquiry, the senior author, Christiansen, had never seen the original specimen.&lt;ref name=ivan/&gt;

By 2010, there was increasing suspicion in the scientific community that the fossil was fake, including a number of others from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Stone R |title=Altering the Past: China's Faked Fossils Problem  |year =2010 |url= | journal= Science | volume= 330 | issue= 6012 |pages = 1740–1741 |pmid= 21205648 |pmc= |doi=10.1126/science.330.6012.1740}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two discoverers responded with a published defense of their fossil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Mazák JH, Christiansen P |title= A defense of the primitive cheetah skull |year = 2011|url= | journal=Science  | volume= 331 | issue= 6021 |pages =1136–1137  |pmid= 21385697 |pmc= |doi= 10.1126/science.331.6021.1136-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Deng was finally allowed access to the original fossil upon invoking the ''PNAS'' data access policy, and on examination, his primary observations were proven correct. He concluded that the fossil has been collected from the [[Late Miocene]] (several million years older than estimated in the original publication) red clay in [[Guanghe County]], and not from the reported region in Dongxiang County. In addition, the [[zygomatic arch]]es of the skull were made from [[rib]]s, the [[incisor]]s were actually [[premolar]]s from other carnivores, and the posterior part of the skull was simply a crude plaster.&lt;ref name=ivan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wang X  |title= Mortgaging the future of Chinese paleontology |year = 2013|url= | journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  | volume= 110 | issue= 9 |page = 3201 |pmid= 23431183 |pmc=3587247 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1301429110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deng asked Mazák to retract the paper. Mazák finally conceded by stating (on 20 August 2012 in ''PNAS'') that: “after further examination, it was determined that the fossil used in the study was a composite specimen from the late Miocene laterite and not from the early Pleistocene loess. The article is hereby retracted.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mazák JH| title = Retraction for Christiansen and Mazák, A primitive Late Pliocene cheetah, and evolution of the cheetah lineage | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 109 | issue = 37 | pages = 15072 | year = 2012 |pmid= 22908293| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211510109 | pmc=3443189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|An illustration of Hero's aeolipile]]
An '''aeolipile''' (or '''aeolipyle''', or '''eolipile'''), also known as a '''Hero's engine''', is a simple bladeless [[radial turbine|radial steam turbine]] which spins when the central water container is heated. Torque is produced by steam jets exiting the turbine, much like a [[tip jet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/J/jet_engine.html jet engine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or rocket engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/TRC/Rockets/history_of_rockets.html NASA Glenn Learning Technologies Project (LTP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD, [[Hero of Alexandria]] described the device in [[Roman Egypt]], and many sources give him the credit for its invention.&lt;ref name="HeroSteamEngine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Herons von Alexandria Druckwerke und Automatentheater|author-last=Hero|author-link=Hero of Alexandria|others=Wilhelm Schmidt (translator)|place=Leipzig|publisher=B.G. Teubner|date=1899|language =Greek, German|url=https://archive.org/stream/heronsvonalexandhero#page/228/mode/2up|pages=228–232|chapter=Pneumatika, Book II, Chapter XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aeolipile Hero described is considered to be the first recorded [[steam engine]] or reaction [[steam turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;"turbine." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 18 July 2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-45691&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The name – derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word Αἴολος and [[Latin]] word ''pila'' – translates to "the ball of [[Aeolus]]", Aeolus being the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of the air and wind.

Pre-dating Heron's writings, a device called an aeolipile was described in the 1st century BC by [[Vitruvius]] in his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''; however, it is unclear if it is the same device or a predecessor, as he does not mention rotating parts.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"/&gt;

==Description and physics==
[[Image:Herosenginesmall.jpg|thumb|A classroom model of an aeolipile]]
The aeolipile consists of a vessel, usually a "simple" [[solid of revolution]], such as a [[sphere]] or a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], arranged to rotate on its axis, having oppositely bent or curved [[nozzle]]s projecting from it ([[tipjets]]). When the vessel is pressurized with steam, steam is expelled through the nozzles, which generates thrust due to the [[rocket engine|rocket]] principle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/aeolipile.html Aeolipile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of the 2nd and 3rd of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. When the nozzles, pointing in different directions, produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment (mechanical [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]]), or [[torque]], causing the vessel to spin about its axis. Aerodynamic drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed ([[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]) and consume the accelerating torque, eventually cancelling it and achieving a [[steady state]] speed.

Typically, and as Heron described the device, the water is heated in a simple [[boiler]] which forms part of a stand for the rotating vessel. Where this is the case, the boiler is connected to the rotating chamber by a pair of pipes that also serve as the [[wiktionary:Pivot|pivot]]s for the chamber. Alternatively the rotating chamber may itself serve as the boiler, and this arrangement greatly simplifies the pivot/bearing arrangements, as they then do not need to pass steam. This can be seen in the illustration of a classroom model to the right.

==History==
[[File:Aeolipile (from Pneumatica).jpg|thumb|right|Illustration from Hero's ''Pneumatica'']]
Both Heron and Vitruvius draw on the much earlier work by [[Ctesibius]] (285–222 BC), Ctesibius or Ktesibios or Tesibius was an inventor and mathematician in [[Alexandria]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]]. He wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps.

===Vitruvius's description===
[[Vitruvius]] (c. 80 BC – c. 15 AD) mentions aeolipiles by name:

"Æolipylæ are hollow brazen vessels, which have an opening or mouth of small size, by means of which they can be filled with water.  Prior to the water being heated over the fire, but little wind is emitted. As soon, however, as the water begins to boil, a violent wind issues forth."&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"&gt;''"De Architectura": Chapter VI (paragraph 2)&lt;br /&gt;from "Ten Books on Architecture" by [[Vitruvius]] (1st century BC), published 17, June, 08 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html] accessed 2009-07-07&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heron's description===
Heron (c. 10–70 AD) takes a more practical approach, in that he gives instructions how to make one:

{{quote|№ 50. The Steam-Engine.&lt;br /&gt;
PLACE a cauldron over a fire: a ball shall revolve on a pivot. A fire is lighted under a cauldron, A B, (fig. 50), containing water, and covered at the mouth by the lid C D; with this the bent tube E F G communicates, the extremity of the tube being fitted into a hollow ball, H K. Opposite to the extremity G place a pivot, L M, resting on the lid C D; and let the ball contain two bent pipes, communicating with it at the opposite extremities of a diameter, and bent in opposite directions, the bends being at right angles and across the lines F G, L M. As the cauldron gets hot it will be found that the steam, entering the ball through E F G, passes out through the bent tubes towards the lid, and causes the ball to revolve, as in the case of the dancing figures.&lt;ref name="HeroSteamEngine"/&gt;}}

==Practical usage==
[[Image:aeolipile.jpg|thumb|right|A modern replica of Hero's aeolipile]]
It is not known whether the aeolipile was put to any practical use in ancient times, and if it was seen as a pragmatic device, a whimsical novelty, an object of reverence, or some other thing. A source described it as a mere curiosity for the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry|last=Gruntman|first=Mike|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=156347705X|location=Reston, VA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hero's drawing shows a standalone device, and was presumably intended as a "temple wonder," like many of the other devices described in ''[[Pneumatica]]''{{what|date=April 2017}}.&lt;ref name = "HeroSteamEngine"&gt;{{citation | title = Pneumatica | chapter = Section 50 – The Steam Engine | author = Hero | place = Alexandria | date = 1851 | origyear = reprint of 1st century CE original | publisher = Taylor Walton and Maberly | publication-place = London | chapter-url =http://himedo.net/TheHopkinThomasProject/TimeLine/Wales/Steam/URochesterCollection/Hero/section50.html | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}   Translated from the original Greek by Bennet Woodcroft '' (Professor of Machinery in [[University College London]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius, on the other hand, mentions use of the aeolipile for demonstrating the physical properties of the weather. He describes the aeolipile as
{{quote|…a scientific invention [to] discover a divine truth lurking in the laws of the heavens.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius" /&gt;}}
After describing the device's construction (see above) he concludes:
{{quote|…Thus from this slight and very short experiment we may understand and judge the mighty and wonderful laws of the heavens and the nature of winds.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius" /&gt;}}In 1543, [[Blasco de Garay]], a scientist and a captain in the Spanish navy, demonstrated before the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V]] and a committee of high officials an invention he claimed could propel large ships in the absence of wind using an apparatus consisted of copper boiler and moving wheels on either side of the ship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation and Technological Diffusion: An economic history of early steam engines|last=Kitsikopoulos|first=Harry|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138948112|location=Oxon|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account was preserved by the royal Spanish archives at [[Simancas]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Floating Palaces of the Great Lakes: A History of Passenger Steamships on the Inland Seas|last=Stone|first=Joe|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=9780472071753|location=Ann Arbor|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that de Garay used Hero's aeolipile and combined it with the technology used in Roman boats and late medieval galleys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Here, de Garay's invention introduced an innovation where the aeolipile had practical usage, which was to generate motion to the paddlewheels, demonstrating the feasibility of steam-driven boats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Algebra Project reaches approximately 10,000 students and approximately 300 teachers per year in 28 local sites across 10 states.

The Algebra Project focuses on the Southern U.S., where the Southern Initiative of the Algebra Project is directed by [[Dave Dennis (activist)|David J. Dennis, Sr.]], and on the Young Peoples' Project (YPP), which recruits, trains and deploys high school and college age "Math Literacy Workers" to work with their younger peers in a variety of math learning opportunities and engage "the demand side" of mathematics education reform. The YPP is directed by [[Omowale Moses]].

Increased student performance in mathematics, as well as greater numbers of students enrolling in college preparatory mathematics classes, is a well documented outcome of the project's work.

==History==
The Algebra Project was born out of one parent's concern with the mathematics education of his children in the public schools of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. In 1982, Bob Moses (who had been providing additional math instruction to his daughter) joined Mary Lou Mehrling,  his daughter's eighth grade teacher, to help several students with the study of [[algebra]]. Moses, who had taught secondary school mathematics in [[New York City]] and [[Tanzania]], decided that an appropriate goal for those students was to have enough skills in algebra to qualify for honors math and science courses in high school. His success in producing the first students from the Open Program of the [[Martin Luther King School]] who passed the citywide algebra examination and qualified for ninth grade honors geometry was a testament to his skill as a teacher. It also highlighted a serious problem: Most students in the Open Program were expected not to do well in mathematics.

Moses approached the problem at the Open Program in a similar manner to problems he and others had faced in the early sixties in helping the black community of [[Mississippi]] seek political power through the vote. While on the surface the problem of the acquisition of political power looked like a simple issue of enticing people to vote, the problem would involve answering an interrelated set of questions. "What is the vote for?" "Why do we want it in the first place?" What must we do right now to ensure that when we have the vote, it will work for us to benefit our communities? Answers to these questions eventually resulted in an important context in which to ask people to vote. This context was the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]], a community based political party.

Similarly, the everyday issues of students failing at mathematics in the Open Program would require a more complex set of issues and community of individuals. Moses, the parent-as-organizer in the program, instinctively applied the lesson he had learned in Mississippi, transforming the everyday issues into a broader political question for the Open Program community to consider: What is algebra for? Why do we want children to study it? What do we need to include in the mathematics education of every middle school student, to provide each of them with access to the college preparatory mathematics curriculum in high school? Why is it important to gain such access? Within these questions, a context for understanding the problems of mathematics education emerged, and a possible solution and effort at community organizing represented by the Algebra Project began to take shape.

The answers to the questions, "What is algebra for?" and "Why do we want children to study it?", play an important role in the Algebra Project. The project assumes that there is a new standard in assessing mathematics education, a standard of mathematical literacy. In this not so far future, a broad range of mathematical skills will join traditional skills in reading and writing in the definition of literacy. These mathematical skills will not only be important in gaining access to college and math and science related careers, but will also be necessary for full participation in the economic life of this society. In this context, the Algebra Project has as a goal that schools embrace a standard of mathematics education that requires that children be mathematically literate. This will require a community of educators including parents, teachers and school administrators who understand the paramount importance of mathematics education in providing access to the economic life of this society. An answer to the question "What do we need to include in the mathematics education of every middle school student?" also frames the Algebra Project.

===Student strike===

From March 1, 2006 to March 4, 2006, [[Baltimore City Public School System]] students led by the [[Baltimore City]] Algebra Project and coming from high schools across Baltimore City held a three-day student strike to oppose an imminent plan to "consolidate" many area high schools into fewer buildings. The school system claims these buildings are underutilized, but the students and other advocates counter that the only reason there is extra space in these buildings is because class sizes often are about 40 students per class. [[Martin J. O'Malley|Mayor O'Malley]] listened to the students' demands, apparently out of concern that it could affect his status with the general public in a gubernatorial election year.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===The Young People's Project===

Founded in 1996, the [[Young People’s Project]] (YPP) is an outgrowth of the Algebra Project.  YPP has established sites in Jackson, MS, Chicago, IL, and the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts, and is developing programs in Miami, FL, Petersburg, VA, Los Angeles, CA, Ann Arbor, MI, and Mansfield, OH. Through Math Literacy Worker trainings and development, workshops and community events, YPP promotes math literacy as a tool for young people to demand of themselves, their communities and school systems, an education commensurate with the requirements for citizenship in today’s technology based economy.

Each established site employs from 30 to 100 high school and college age students on a part-time basis, and serves up to 1000 elementary and middle school students through a variety of on and off site programs.  As the founding members of YPP have moved from middle to high school to college, their development and the subsequent development of the young people they’ve attracted, has formed the basis for YPP’s evolution into a truly youth-driven organization.

In 2005, the Algebra Project initiated Quality Education as a Civil Right (QECR), a groundbreaking national organizing effort to establish a federal constitutional guarantee to quality public education for all.  Throughout 2005, YPP worked with students from Baltimore, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Oakland, Miami, Jackson, Chicago and Virginia to initiate a dialogue within America about QECR.  The Algebra Project and YPP students from Jackson and New Orleans hosted conferences, organized an innovative Spring Break Community Education Tour to Miami and participated in QECR planning meetings at Howard University, the University of Michigan, and Jackson State University.

'''Alpheus Spring Packard, Jr.''', LL.D. (February 19, 1839 – February 14, 1905) was an [[United States|American]] [[entomologist]] and [[palaeontologist]]. He described over 500 new animal species – especially butterflies and moths – and was one of the founders of ''[[The American Naturalist]]''.&lt;ref name="Cockerell"&gt;Cockerell (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was the son of [[Alpheus Spring Packard, Sr.]] (1798–1884) and the brother of [[William Alfred Packard]].  He was born in [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]], [[Maine]] and was Professor of [[Zoology]] and [[Geology]] at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] from 1878 until his death. He was a vocal proponent of Neo-[[Lamarckism]] during the [[eclipse of Darwinism]].&lt;ref name="Sorenson"&gt;Sorenson (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

His chief work was the classification and anatomy of [[arthropod]]s, and contributions to economic [[entomology]], [[zoogeography]], and the [[phylogeny]] and metamorphoses of [[insect]]s. Packard was appointed to the [[United States Entomological Commission]] in 1877 where he served with [[Charles Valentine Riley]] and [[Cyrus Thomas]].&lt;ref name="Mallis"&gt;Mallis (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote school textbooks, such as ''Zoölogy for High Schools and Colleges'' (eleventh edition, 1904).  His ''Monograph of the Bombycine Moths of North America'' was published in three parts (1895, 1905, 1915, edited by T. D. A. Cockerell).

He died on February 14, 1905.

'''Backstairs Passage Glacier''' ({{Coord|75|2|S|162|36|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] about {{convert|2|nmi|km|0}} long, draining east along the north side of [[Mount Crummer]] to the [[Ross Sea]]. The Magnetic Pole Party, led by [[Edgeworth David]], of the [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09]], ascended this glacier from the Ross Sea, then continued the ascent via [[Larsen Glacier]] to the plateau of [[Victoria Land]]. So named by David's party because of the circuitous route to get to Larsen Glacier.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

'''Baxter Glacier''' ({{Coord|76|40|S|161|51|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] nurtured by icefalls from [[Flight Deck Neve]], flowing northeast between [[Flagship Mountain]] and [[Mount Davidson (Antarctica)|Mount Davidson]] to enter [[Fry Glacier]], in [[Convoy Range]], [[Victoria Land]]. It was named by a 1976–77 [[Victoria University of Wellington Antarctic Expedition]] (VUWAE) field party after [[James K. Baxter]], [[New Zealand]] poet and social critic.

at No. 7 College Square North, completed in 1831. The portico is an exact copy of the octagon tower of Andronicus in Athens.]]
The '''Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society ''' was founded in 1821 to promote the scientific study of animals, plants, [[fossils]], [[rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[minerals]].

The Society was founded by [[George Crawford Hyndman]], [[James Lawson Drummond]], [[James Grimshaw]], [[James McAdam]], [[Robert Patterson (Belfast)|Robert Patterson]], [[Robert Simms (the younger)|Robert Simms]], [[Francis Archer]], the [[Thomas Dix Hincks]], [[Edward Hincks]] and [[Edmund Getty]]. Five years later in 1826 [[Alexander Henry Haliday]] and [[William Thompson (naturalist)|William Thompson]] both joined. In 1823, the Society's collection and the small collection begun in 1788 in the rooms of the [[Linen Hall Library|Belfast Reading Society]] and that of the [[Belfast Literary Society]] were moved to [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution|Belfast Academical Institution]] where [[James Bryce (Belfast)|James Bryce]] was centralising Belfast's rapidly expanding natural history holdings. A new building opened at No. 7 College Square North in 1831.

How big were the first collections are unknown but the 1831 figure of 300 insects given when the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society Museum opened to non-members may refer to specimens on display. The research material would have been much more numerous and expanded rapidly during the next decade. Specimens from England, the [[West Indies]], [[Sápmi (area)|Lapland]], France, [[Greece]], Italy, [[Senegal]], [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Ceylon]], [[Mauritius]], [[Colombia]], [[Recife]], [[Peru]], [[Virginia]], [[India]] and West Africa were acquired by gift. The Society maintained an excellent library and received many journals from corresponding members of English and continental natural history societies. Notable contributors were [[John Obadiah Westwood]], [[Francis Walker (entomologist)|Francis Walker]], [[Carl August Dohrn]]), [[Maximilian Spinola]] and [[John Gould]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Many of the collections and some of the books were transferred to the [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College Museum]], Dublin in 1843 after the society became the [[Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society]] in 1842 when lectures in chemistry, physics, engineering and were allowed. Specimens remaining in [[Belfast]] are kept in the [[Ulster Museum]] where they bear the tag BNHPS collection.The formerly central role of natural history and archaeology diminished from this year on and in 1863 the [[Belfast Naturalists' Field Club]] was founded. The fragmentary BNHS minute books (pre 1842) and few letters are in the [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]], in [[Belfast]].  The Society still exists today retaining ownership of the Old Museum Building, publishing occasional books, and running a lecture series out of the Linen Hall Library.

==The museum==
'''MUSEI BELFASTIANI''' 

''Fundamenta Prima PraesentibusSocietatis Historiae Naturalis apud BelfastamSociis, aliisque multis scientiae faventibusqui ad hoc opus pecuniam contulerant:Locavit Vir Honoratissimus [[George Chichester, 2nd Marquess of Donegall|Georgius Augustus Chichester]] Marchio de DonegallIV. Non Maias MDCCCXXX.Rege Augustissimo Georgio IV.Annum Regni XI.Agente.[[Thomas Duff|Thomas J Duff]], [[Thomas Jackson (architect)|T. Jackson]], Architectis''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Thomas Jackson - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100015529|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;''; J. Johnston, Redemptore''.

The museum was the first erected in Ireland by public subscription. From its inception in 1831 and for 47 years the Museum employed a curator [[taxidermist]] named William Darragh (1813–1892). In the first report of the society he wrote an account entitled "Directions for preserving subjects in natural history". This covered birds, tortoises etc., lizards and serpents, fish, shells, corals, seafans etc., crabs, lobsters etc., asterias or starfish, insects, botanical specimens, seeds, minerals and Fossil. He notes, correctly anticipating foreign specimens "As there is now no vexatious delay or trouble experienced by Custom-house regulations, specimens of natural history being admitted free of duty, it is recommended that all packages may be entered in the ship's papers, and if a list of all the contents of each package could, with convenience, be attached inside the lid of the box or cover, the risk of injury to the specimens, by examination at the Custom-house, would in great measure be avoided". Also "Should it even happen that the specimens be already possessed by the Society, still duplicates are desirable, since such as are not possessed by the Museum can be readily exchanged for others that may be wanted".
[[Image:BNHSMuseum.jpg|thumb|230px|left|The Museum in 1831. The architects were [[Thomas Duff]] and [[Thomas Jackson (architect)|Thomas Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/2763/Jackson-thomas#tab_works|title=Jackson, thomas - Dictionary of Irish Architects|website=www.dia.ie|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has three stories. In the lower story were the lecture-room and library. Each of the upper stories is a single room, forty-seven feet in length, and twenty-seven feet wide, which housed the public museum. A laboratory was later attached to the lecture room.]]

Although the focus of the collections was primarily on zoology, botany and geology substantial [[Archaeology|archaeological]], [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[antiquarian]] acquisitions were made and in 1835 the Society gained an Egyptian mummy, [[Takabuti]].

==The library==
With the tumultuous years of 1789–1815, European culture was transformed by revolution, war and disruption. By ending many of the social and cultural props of the previous century, the stage was set for dramatic economic, political and social change of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Late Enlightenment]] of which the development of learned societies was a part. One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularisation. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured "to make information available to the greatest number of people". As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies. Books owned by the Belfast Natural History Society reflect such changes, although some of the more expensive works were the gift of [[Thomas Fortescue, 1st Baron Clermont|Thomas Fortescue]] and [[Arthur Hill, 4th Marquess of Downshire|Arthur Hill]]. They included:

'''Butter grading''' involves the [[Food grading|grading]], inspection, assessment and sorting of [[butter]] to quantify its quality, freshness, and conformity to legal requirements.

==United States==
Butter sold in the United States is assigned one of three letter grades; AA, A, and B.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt;  By a 1923 act of [[United States Congress|Congress]], all butter sold in the United States must be composed of at least 80% [[Butterfat|milkfat]].&lt;ref name=cheesehead&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eatwisconsincheese.com/dairy/butter/butter-basics/butter-standards |title=Butter Standards |author= |date= |website=Wisconsin Cheese |publisher=Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board |access-date=November 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126012940/http://www.eatwisconsincheese.com/dairy/butter/butter-basics/butter-standards |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Butter is graded based on the sweetness of its flavor, the quality of cream the butter was made from, the smoothness of its texture, and the degree of flavor impurities such as acidity, bitterness, [[Animal feed|feed]], malty, musty, weed, and whey.&lt;ref name=mclagen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/grades.html |title=USDA Butter Grades |last=McLagan|first=Jennifer|editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Sally E. |date= |website=WebExhibits |publisher=Institute for Dynamic Educational Advancement |access-date=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grade indication of the butter is usually displayed in the most prominent area of the packaging, although it may also be displayed on the side or elsewhere.&lt;ref name=mclagen /&gt;

When grading butter, the inspector begins with a score of 100.&lt;!--does this test have a name?--&gt;  Each defect in flavor, texture, color, or saltiness results in a subtraction of one-half, one, or one and one-half points, depending on the characteristic and the degree of the defect, whether it is slight, definite, or pronounced.&lt;ref name=cheesehead /&gt;  Butter that exceeds certain workmanship dis-ratings is rated on flavor only, and can not attain the highest grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/butter-grades-and-standards |title=Butter Grades and Standards |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=USDA Agricultural Marketing Service |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |access-date=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grade AA''' butter, made from sweet cream, is the highest grade of butter, has a sweet flavor, and is readily spreadable.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drinc.ucdavis.edu/dfoods2_new.htm |title=General Butter Information |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Dairy Research and Information Center |publisher=University of California, Davis |access-date=November 21, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the butter is salted, the salt must be evenly distributed and not interfere with the smooth texture of the butter.&lt;ref name=mclagen /&gt;  To get this grade, the butter must achieve a score of at least 93 out of a possible 100.&lt;ref name=maven&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoodmaven.com/diary/00000388.html |title=Butter Grading |last1=Schwartz |first1=Arthur |date=2012 |website=The Food Maven |access-date=November 21, 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is widely available at most places food products are sold.&lt;ref name=davis /&gt;  Butter graded as "AA" does not necessarily indicate the butter may meet the expectations of gourmands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joepastry.com/2011/what-distinguishes-a-high-quality-butter-from-regular-butter/ |title=What distinguishes a “high quality” butter from regular butter? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 25, 2011 |website=Joe Pastry |access-date=November 21, 2015 |quote=Yet the American grading system is a rather crude instrument for trying to quantify the qualities that separate ordinary butters from extraordinary ones.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grade A''', made from fresh cream, has a stronger flavor than grade AA butter.&lt;ref name=davis /&gt;  Butter of this grade must score 92 points.&lt;ref name=maven /&gt;  It is likely to be of a coarser texture than grade AA.  Like grade AA, it is widely available at food markets across the country.&lt;ref name=davis /&gt;

'''Grade B''' butter is the lowest grade of butter available for consumer use.  It is often made from [[sour cream]].&lt;ref name=davis /&gt; Grade B butter must score at least 90 points, anything less can not be made available to United States consumers.  The texture of this grade may be crumbly, sticky, or watery.&lt;ref name=mclagen /&gt;  This grade of butter is usually only used in cooking, or some manufacturing processes, although many consumers will find it perfectly palatable.&lt;ref name=maven /&gt;

In addition, all U.S. butters must pass microbiological standards.&lt;ref name=cheesehead /&gt;

==Canada==
Butter, along with other dairy products, is given a grade of Canada 1, Canada 2, or Canada 3.&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/dairy-products/imports-interprovincial-trade/eng/1300214060169/1300214161699 |title=Import and Interprovincial Requirements for Dairy Products – Overview |author= |date=April 2, 2015 |website=Canadian Food Inspection Agency |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=November 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028134129/http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/dairy-products/imports-interprovincial-trade/eng/1300214060169/1300214161699 |archivedate=October 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gisslen |first=Wayne |date=2004 |title=Professional Baking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YrQZi41PqKEC&amp;pg=PA41|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=41 |isbn=9780471464273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Butter of the first grade cannot be made from cream given the second grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dairyinfo.gc.ca/pdf/reg/saskdairyproductgrading.pdf |title=The Dairy Product Grading Regulations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 1, 1978 |website=Canadian Dairy Information Centre |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grade 3 butter is a processing grade used for product packaged and sold in bulk.&lt;ref name=canada /&gt;

'''''Canada's Deadly Secret: Saskatchewan Uranium and the Global Nuclear System''''' is a 2007 book by Jim Harding which chronicles the struggle over Saskatchewan's [[uranium mining]], and demonstrates the negative impacts on Aboriginal rights and environmental health, and the effect of free trade. Professor Harding argues that [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] cannot mitigate [[global warming]] and that the "peaceful atom" does not exist. [[Helen Caldicott]] wrote the foreword to the book.&lt;ref name=jim&gt;[http://www.nuwinfo.se/harding200710frenwood.html  Canada's Deadly Secret - Saskatchewan Uranium and the Global Nuclear System]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Jim Harding is an emeritus professor of environmental/ justice studies and was director of research for Prairie Justice Research at the [[University of Regina]]. He is a founding member of the Regina Group for a Non-Nuclear Society and [[International Uranium Congress]]. Harding also acted as Prairie Correspondent for ''Nuclear Free Press'' and consultant to the award-winning film ''Uranium''.&lt;ref name=jim/&gt;

Several reviews of the book have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canadiandimension.com/articles/1743 |title=Review: Canada's Deadly Secret: Saskatchewan Uranium and the Global Nuclear System  |author=Marita Moll  |date=July 10, 2008 |work=Canadian Dimension }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spokesmanbooks.com/Spokesman/PDF/Reviews100.pdf |title=Saskatchewan Uranium |author=Christopher Gifford |date=n.d. |work=Spokesman books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''City rhythm''' is a [[metaphor]] for the regular coming and going in [[city|cities]], the repetitive activities, the sounds and smells that occur regularly in cities. The recognition of city rhythms is a useful metaphor, helping to understand [[modernity|modern]] city life. The concept of city rhythm makes it possible to understand the multitude of aspects of city life. Traditional approaches to urban thinking focus on one such rhythm only, normally the dominant one. This leads to the omission of many aspects of city life.

''Dominant rhythm'' is a metaphor used in conjunction with city rhythm. It is the most powerful rhythm in a [[city]], enabling the shaping and forming of time and space, both within the city and in faraway places through [[city network|networks]].

These dominant rhythms are not fixed and indeed change. [[religion|Religious]] rhythms were more dominant in the past, whereas at present [[economics|economic]] rhythms prevail.

[[File:Stadt Fulda - Ordnungsamt, Land Rover Freelander.JPG|thumb|Patrol car of Ordnungsamt [[Fulda]], [[Germany]]]]

'''Code enforcement''', sometimes encompassing [[law enforcement]], is the act of enforcing a set of [[wiktionary:rule|rule]]s, [[principle]]s, or [[law]]s (especially [[Codification (law)|written ones]]) and ensuring observance of a system of [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s or [[Custom (law)|customs]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} An [[authority]] usually enforces a [[civil code]], a set of rules, or a body of laws and compel those subject to their authority to behave in a certain way.

In the United States, those employed in various capacities of code enforcement may be called Code Enforcement Officers, Municipal Regulations Officers, or with various titles depending on their specialization.

In Canada and some Commonwealth Countries, the term [[Bylaw Enforcement Officer]] is more commonly used, as well as [[Municipal Law Enforcement Officer]] or [[Municipal Enforcement Officer]].

In [[Germany]] [[Bylaw enforcement officer | order enforcement offices]] are established under the [[States of Germany | state´s]] laws and local regulations under different terms like ''Ordnungsamt'' (order enforcement office), ''Ordnungsdienst'' (order enforcement service), ''Gemeindevollzugsdienst'' (municipal code enforcement office), ''Polizeibehörde'' (police authority) or ''[[Municipal police (Germany) | Stadtpolizei]]'' (city police) for general-duty bylaw enforcement units.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], various names are used, but the word [[Wiktionary:Warden|Warden]] is commonly used for various classes of non-police enforcement personnel (such as Game Warden, Traffic Warden, Park Warden).

Various persons and organizations ensure compliance with laws and rules, including:

* [[Building inspector]], an official who is charged with ensuring that construction is in [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] with local codes.
* [[Fire marshal]], an official who is both a police officer and a firefighter and enforces a [[fire code]].
* [[Health inspector]], an official who is charged with ensuring that [[restaurants]] meet local health codes.
* [[Police]] forces, charged with maintaining public order, crime prevention, and enforcing [[criminal law]].
* [[Zoning enforcement officer]], an official who is charged with enforcing the zoning code of a local jurisdiction, such as a [[municipality]] or [[county]].
* [[Parking enforcement officer]], an official who is charged with enforcing street parking regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2731">In [[optics]], the '''complex beam parameter''' is a [[complex number]] that specifies the properties of a [[Gaussian beam]] at a particular point z along the axis of the beam. It is usually denoted by ''q''. It can be calculated from the beam's vacuum [[wavelength]] λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[radius of curvature (optics)|radius of curvature]] ''R'' of the [[phase front]], the [[index of refraction]] ''n'' (''n''=1 for air), and the beam radius ''w'' (defined at 1/''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; intensity), according to:&lt;ref name=Yariv&gt;{{cite book |first=Amnon |last=Yariv |year=1989 |title=Quantum Electronics |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-60997-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{q(z)} = \frac{1}{R(z)} - \frac{i\lambda_0}{\pi n w(z)^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, ''q'' can be calculated according to
:&lt;math&gt; q(z) = z + \frac{i \pi n w_0^2}{\lambda_0}= z + z_\mathrm{R} i\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Yariv/&gt;
where ''z'' is the location at which ''q'' is calculated, relative to the location of the [[beam waist]], ''z''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Rayleigh range]], and ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]].

==Uses of the complex beam parameter==
The complex beam parameter is usually used in [[ray transfer matrix analysis]], which allows the calculation of the beam properties at any given point as it propagates through an optical system, if the ray matrix and the initial complex beam parameter is known.  This same method can also be used to find the fundamental mode size of a stable [[optical resonator]].

Given the initial beam parameter, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, one can use the ray transfer matrix of an optical system, &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} A &amp; B \\ C &amp; D \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, to find the resulting beam parameter, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, after the beam has traversed the system:&lt;ref name=Yariv/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; q_f = \frac{Aq_i+B}{Cq_i+D}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is often convenient to express this equation in terms of the reciprocals of ''q'':&lt;ref name=Yariv/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {  1 \over q_f } = \frac{C+D/q_i}{A+B/q_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

To find the complex beam parameter of a stable [[optical resonator]], one needs to find the ray matrix of the cavity.  This is done by tracing the path of beam in the cavity.  Assuming a starting point, find the matrix that goes through the cavity and return until the beam is in the same position and direction as the starting point. With this matrix and by making ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, a quadratic is formed as:

:&lt;math&gt;C{q_f}^2 + (D-A)q_f - B = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving this equation gives the beam parameter for the chosen starting position in the cavity, and by propagating, the beam parameter for any other location in the cavity can be found.

Various fringe theories have arisen to speculate about purported alternative origins for the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and the [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), with claims ranging from it being due to accidental exposure to supposedly purposeful acts. Several inquiries and investigations have been carried out as a result, and each of these theories have consequently been determined to be based on unfounded and/or false information. HIV has been shown to have evolved from or be closely related to the [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) in West Central Africa sometime in the early 20th century. HIV was discovered in the 1980s by the French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]]. Before the 1980s, HIV was an unknown deadly disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sharp | first1 = P.

==Discredited theories==

In 1987 there was some consideration given to the possibility that the "Aids epidemic may have been triggered by the mass vaccination campaign which eradicated [[smallpox]]".  An article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Wright| first = Pearce| title = Smallpox vaccine 'triggered Aids virus'| newspaper = [[The Times]]| location = London| date = 11 May 1987}}&lt;!-- FYI there are some unofficial copies of it on the web, or you can search and pay for the official version at {{cite web

 |df=dmy 
}}   --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[The Times]]'' suggested this, quoting an unnamed "adviser to WHO" with "''I believe the smallpox vaccine theory is the explanation to the explosion of Aids''".  It is now thought that the [[smallpox vaccine]] causes serious complications for people who already have impaired immune systems&lt;!-- this is taken from [[Smallpox vaccine#Post-eradication vaccination]] --&gt;, and the ''Times'' article described the case of a military recruit with "dormant HIV" who died within months of receiving it.  But no citation was provided regarding people who did not previously have HIV. Currently HIV is considered to be a [[contraindication]] for the smallpox vaccine—both for an infected person and their sexual partners and household members.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a research article was published in 2010 suggesting that it might have been the actual eradication of smallpox and the subsequent ''ending'' of the mass vaccination campaign contributed to the sudden emergence of HIV. The theory was the possibility that immunization against smallpox "might play a role in providing an individual with some degree of protection to subsequent HIV infection and/or disease progression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Weinstein  | first1 = RS| last2 = Weinstein  | first2 = MM| last3 = Alibek     | first3 = K| last4 = Bukrinsky  | first4 = MI| last5 = Brichacek  | first5 = Beda| title = Significantly reduced CCR5-tropic HIV-1 replication in vitro in cells from subjects previously immunized with Vaccinia Virus | journal = BMC Immunology| volume = 11| issue = 1| page = 23| publisher = BioMed Central| date = 18 May 2010| url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/11/23| issn =1471-2172| pmid = 20482754| pmc = 2881106| doi = 10.1186/1471-2172-11-23| accessdate =  20 June 2010 }}

===Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) theory===

The dermatologist Alan Cantwell, in self-published books entitled ''AIDS and the Doctors of Death: An Inquiry into the Origin of the AIDS Epidemic'' (1988) and ''Queer Blood: The Secret AIDS Genocide Plot'' (1993), said that HIV is a [[genetically modified organism]] developed by U.S. Government scientists. The virus was then introduced into the population through [[Hepatitis B]] (via the [[Hepatitis B vaccine]]) experiments performed on gay and bisexual men between 1978–1981 in major U.S. cities. Cantwell claims that these experiments were directed by [[Wolf Szmuness]], and that there was an ongoing government cover-up of the origins of the AIDS epidemic. Similar theories have been advanced by [[Robert B. Strecker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Strecker Memorandum - AIDS is a man made disease|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BSZ1vSf1co|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilde Krim, and [[Milton William Cooper]].

===Oral polio vaccine (OPV) theory===

In the 1999 version of his [[OPV AIDS hypothesis]], [[Edward Hooper (journalist)|Edward Hooper]] proposed that early batches of the [[oral polio vaccine]] (OPV) grown in cultures of chimpanzee kidney cells, infected with a chimpanzee virus, were the original source of HIV-1 in Central Africa.

===Additional theories===
These theories generally attribute HIV's origin to the [[US government]] or its contractors:

====Created at Fort Detrick====
[[Jakob Segal]] (1911–1995), a professor at [[Humboldt University]] in then-[[East Germany]], proposed that HIV was engineered at a U.S. military laboratory at [[Fort Detrick]], by splicing together two other viruses, [[Visna]] and [[Human T-lymphotropic virus|HTLV-1]]. According to his theory, the new virus, created between 1977 and 1978, was tested on prison inmates who had volunteered for the experiment in exchange for early release. He further suggested that it was through these prisoners that the virus was spread to the population at large. 

At the end of the [[Cold War]], former [[KGB]] agents [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] and [[Oleg Gordievsky]] independently revealed that the Fort Detrick hypothesis was a propaganda operation devised by the KGB's [[First Chief Directorate]] codenamed "[[Operation INFEKTION]]". This revelation was later supported by officer Günther Bohnensack of section X of [[East Germany]]'s [[Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung]]. 

It is known that Segal was in close contact with Russian KGB officers and Mitrokhin mentioned him as a central asset of the operation.&lt;ref name="Andrew 1999 319"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Andrew |first=Christopher|author2=Vasili Mitrokhin|title=The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB|publisher=Basic Books|year=1999|isbn=0-465-00310-9|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="einestages.spiegel.de"&gt;Johanna Lutterroth: [http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/25017/das_propaganda_virus_des_kgb.html ''Aids-Verschwörung. Das Propaganda-Virus des KGB'']. Spiegel Online, 2012-6-26 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not entirely clear whether Segal pursued the hypothesis independently on his own accord or whether he was simply following orders. Segal himself always denied the latter and kept pursuing the hypothesis even after the operation had been canceled and the Cold War had ended.

====Conspiracy to decrease the population====
In ''Behold a Pale Horse'' (1991), radio broadcaster and author [[Milton William Cooper]] (1943–2001) proposed that [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] was the result of a conspiracy to decrease the populations of [[Black people|blacks]], [[Hispanics]], and [[homosexuals]].&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9781118045633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|accessdate=January 17, 2013|page=175|chapter=Illuminati|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA175}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Engineered for bio-warfare====
The dentist and entrepreneur [[Leonard G. Horowitz]], author of the self-published works ''Emerging Viruses: AIDS &amp; Ebola. Nature, Accident or Intentional?'' (1996) and ''Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare'' (2001), advanced the theory that the virus that causes AIDS was engineered by such U.S. Government defense contractors as [[Litton Industries|Litton Bionetics]] for the purposes of bio-warfare and "population control". He believes that HIV was deliberately designed in a US military lab in the 1970s for use as a genocidal weapon.

==Prevalence of conspiracy beliefs==
According to Phil Wilson, executive director of the Black AIDS Institute in Los Angeles, conspiracy theories are becoming a barrier to the prevention of AIDS since people start to believe that no matter what the measures they take, they can still be prone to contracting this disease. This makes them less careful when engaging in practices that put them at risk because they believe there is no point.&lt;ref name=Fears2005&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fears|first1=Darryl|title=Study: Many Blacks Cite AIDS Conspiracy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33695-2005Jan24.html|website=www.washingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=12 June 2017|date=January 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Nearly half of the 500 African Americans surveyed said that HIV is man-made. More than one-quarter said they believed that AIDS was produced in a government laboratory, and 12 percent believed it was created and spread by the CIA... At the same time, 75 percent said they believe medical and public health agencies are working to stop the spread of AIDS in black communities."&lt;ref name=Fears2005 /&gt;

==Prominent endorsers of discredited theories==

====Nation of Islam====
The [[Nation of Islam]] endorses the view that governments and pharmaceutical companies have pursued genocidal racist policies including the creation and spread of HIV. Consequently, the group called for a boycott of U.S.-sponsored vaccination programs for children. Leonard Horowitz has been cited as influential in the boycott decision.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Peter, ''Conspiracy Culture: From the Kennedy Assassination to the X-files'', p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jeremiah Wright====
In 2008, the controversial Reverend [[Jeremiah Wright]] cited Leonard Horowitz in support of his view that the U.S. government invented HIV as a means of genocide against black people.

====Wangari Maathai====
The 2004 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate and environmental activist [[Wangari Maathai]] was asked by a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] interviewer if she stood by a previous alleged claim that "AIDS is a biological weapon manufactured by the developed world to wipe out the black race". Maathai responded, "I have no idea who created AIDS and whether it is a biological agent or not. But I do know things like that don't come from the moon. (...) I guess there is some truth that must not be too exposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Faris, Stephan | title=10 Questions: Wangari Maathai | publisher=TIME.com/CNN | date=10 October 2004 | url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901041018-713166,00.html | accessdate=2007-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maathai subsequently issued a written statement in December 2004: "I neither say nor believe that the virus was developed by white people or white powers in order to destroy the African people. Such views are wicked and destructive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenbeltmovement.org/a.php?id=30 from the Green Belt Movement website- Wangari Maathai's "The Challenge of AIDS in Africa"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006082858/http://greenbeltmovement.org/a.php?id=30 |date=6 October 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manto Tshabalala-Msimang====
In 2000 [[Department of Health (South Africa)|South Africa's Minister of Health]] [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]] received criticism for distributing the chapter from Cooper's book discussing this theory to senior South African government officials.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=SA Government steps into Aids row|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/924927.stm|accessdate=January 17, 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=September 14, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicoli Nattrass]], a longtime critic of AIDS denialists, criticized Tshabalala-Msimang for lending legitimacy to Cooper's theories and disseminating them in Africa.&lt;ref name=Nattrass&gt;{{cite book|last=Nattrass|first=Nicoli|title=The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back|year=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231149129|pages=4, 23–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TehyoBCpVHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|authorlink=Nicoli Nattrass|accessdate=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4275">'''Electromagnetically induced grating''' (EIG) is an optical [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] phenomenon where an [[interference pattern]] is used to build a dynamic spatial [[diffraction grating]] in matter. EIGs are dynamically created by [[light]] interference on optically resonant materials and rely on [[population inversion]] and/or optical [[coherence (physics)|coherence]] properties of the material. They were first demonstrated with population gratings on atoms.&lt;ref&gt;Mitsunaga et al.,  Phys. Rev. A 59, 4773 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  EIGs can be used for purposes of atomic/molecular velocimetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0030-4018(99)00228-X |title=Transient Bragg diffraction by a transferred population grating: application for cold atoms velocimetry |year=1999 |author=Tabosa, J |journal=Optics Communications |volume=165 |pages=59|bibcode = 1999OptCo.165...59T }}&lt;/ref&gt; to probe the material optical properties such as coherence and population life-times,&lt;ref&gt;G.C.Cardoso, Phys.

Lett. 30, 699  2005 ; Su XM, Ham BS, Dynamic control of the photonic band gap using quantum coherence
Phys. Rev. A 71, 013821 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Related but different effects are thermally induced gratings and  [[photolithographic|photolithography]] gratings.

== Writing, Reading and Phase matching conditions for EIG diffraction ==

Figure 1 shows a possible beam configuration to write and read an EIG. The period of the grating is controlled by the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The writing and reading frequencies are not necessarily the same. E&lt;sub&gt;_B&lt;/sub&gt; is referred as the "backward" reading beam and E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the signal obtained by diffraction on the grating.

[[File:Write-Read EIG color.jpg|left|thumb|260px|'''Figure 1''': Writing and reading an EIG]]

The phase-matching conditions for the EIG for the plane-wave approximation is given by the simple geometric relation:

&lt;math&gt;\sin\beta=n \Bigl(\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}\Bigr) \sin(\theta/2)&lt;/math&gt;,

where the angles are given according to Fig. 2, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt; are the frequencies of the writing (W, W') and reading beam (R), respectively,  and n is the effective index of refraction of the medium.

[[File:Bragg-condition.jpg|center|thumb|350px|'''Figure 2''': Phase matching conditions for EIG diffraction]]

== Types of EIG ==

[[File:Grating-types.jpg|right|thumb|300px|'''Figure 3''': Difference between a "matter grating" and a "population grating". The [[smiley]]s :-( and :-) represent ground and optically excited atoms, respectively.]]

'''Matter Gratings''': The writing lasers form a grating by modulating density of matter or by localizing matter (trapping) on the regions of maxima (or minima) of the writing interference fields. A thermal grating is an example. Matter gratings have slow dynamics (milliseconds) compared to population and phase gratings (potentially nanoseconds and faster).

'''Population Gratings''': The writing lasers are resonant with optical transitions in the matter and the grating is formed by [[optical pumping]]. (See Fig. 3)

'''Coherence Gratings''': A grating where the writing lasers form a coherent matter pattern. An example is a pattern of  [[electromagnetically induced transparency]]

== Applications ==

Usually two [[laser]]s at an angle are used to build an EIG. The EIG is used to diffract a third laser, to  monitor the behavior of the underlying substrate where the EIG was written or to serve as a switch for one of the lasers involved in the process.

{{#section-h:List of ecoregions in Japan|Ecoregions overview}}

Also, [[Chiba Prefecture]] has an extensive [[shrubland]], and patches of high altitude [[grassland]] are dotting the many mountain ridges of Japan, most notably at [[Hida Mountains]].

These habitats harbour at least 5565 and possibly as much as 7000 species of vascular plants, making Japan to rank number 48 among countries with the most diverse flora, according to survey performed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/03plants.htm Countries with the most number of vascular plant species]&lt;/ref&gt;. Among these, approximately 2900 plant species are endemic to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bgci.org/japan/home_01/ Botanic Gardens Conservation International - The Rich and Diverse Flora of Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant biome of Japan is forest, which composition varies with region and altitude. Roughly, the forests are dominated by [[Cryptomeria]] (''sugi'') in [[Hokkaido]], [[Fagus crenata]] (''buna'') in Eastern Japan, and by [[Quercus myrsinifolia]] (''shirakashi'') in Western Japan.

General Formal Ontology (GFO): A Foundational Ontology Integrating Objects and Processes. Part I: Basic Principles. Research Group Ontologies in Medicine (Onto-Med), University of Leipzig. &lt;/ref&gt; GFO has been developed by Heinrich Herre, Barbara Heller and collaborators  (research group [http://www.onto-med.de/ Onto-Med]) in [[Leipzig]]. Although GFO provides one taxonomic tree, different axiom systems may be chosen for its modules. In this sense, GFO provides a framework for building custom, domain-specific ontologies. GFO exhibits a three-layered meta-ontological architecture consisting of an abstract top level, an abstract core level, and a basic level.
Primarily, the ontology GFO:
* includes objects as well as processes and both are integrated into one coherent system,
* includes levels of reality,&lt;ref&gt;R. Poli. The Basic Problem of the Theory of Levels of Reality. Axiomathes, 2001. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;
* is designed to support interoperability by principles of ontological mapping and reduction,

==Taxonomic tree of GFO==
[[Image:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|170px|thumb|Basic taxonomic tree of the General Formal Ontology]]
GFO (General Formal ontology) draws a fundamental distinction between [[concrete entity|concrete entities]], [[Category (philosophy)|categories]] and [[set (mathematics)|set]]s. Sets are described by an axiomatic fragment of [[set theory]] of Zermelo-Fraenkel, although fragments of anti-[[foundation axiom]] set theories such as [[Non-well-founded_set_theory|ZF-AFA]] are considered.

Concrete entities are entities which are in [[time]] and [[space]], while [[Category (philosophy)|categories]] have [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] character.

==Categories==
The common property of all categories is that they can be ''predicated'' of an entity.

Categories in GFO are further divided in [[immanent universal]]s, [[conceptual structure]]s and [[symbolic structure]]s. Immanent universals are so-called [[Aristotle|Aristotlian]] [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], in the sense that they are considered ''in re''. This means, that these universals exist in all the entities which instantiate an immanent universal, independent of an observer. An example of an immanent universal could be APPLE. The universal APPLE exists in ''all'' apples, independent of [[perception]] by an agent.

[[Concept]]ual structures are mental representations of entities or universals, and they exist in an agent's [[mind]]. For example, the individual representation of the (linguistic) term "apple" inside an agent's mind (determined by the agent's experience, knowledge and belief, etc.).

Symbolic structures are signs which may be instantiated by tokens. They have the property to stand for something beyond themselves. An example is the physical pattern "apple", which instantiates the "APPLE" symbolic structure.

==Space and time==
GFO uses a theory of space and time which is inspired by the philosophy of [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]]. For time, time-[[interval (time)|intervals]], called [[chronoid]]s, are taken as primitive. Existentially dependent on these time-intervals are time-boundaries. Time-boundaries of different time-intervals may coincide. This notion of coincidence is equivalent to a formalization of time-based on the ''meets'' relation (due to Allen and Hayes).

Connected three-dimensional parts of space are called "[[topoid]]s". As chronoids, topoids may coincide at a two-dimensional boundary. This boundary may coincide with other (two-dimensional) boundaries at a one-dimensional boundary, and so on.

==Processes and objects==
GFO distinguishes [[process (philosophy)|processes]] and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s. Processes unfold in time, they have temporal parts. Objects (called [[presential]]s) have no temporal parts, and may only exist on time-boundaries. Presentials are dependent on processes. This can be seen as a derivation of the dependency-relations in the formalization of time: processes are always framed by a chronoid; and as time-boundaries are dependent on chronoids, so are presentials dependent on processes.

DOLCE and other ontologies face the problem of "identity": how is it possible to model the persistence of an object through time. In GFO, this problem is made explicit: all presentials explicitly exist only at a single time-boundary; persistence is modelled by a special type of category, a persistent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15842">The '''hafnium controversy''' is a debate over the possibility of 'triggering' rapid energy releases, via gamma ray emission, from a [[nuclear isomer]] of [[hafnium]], '''&lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf'''. The energy release is potentially 5 orders of magnitude (100,000 times) more energetic than a chemical reaction, but 2 orders of magnitude less than a nuclear fission reaction. In 1998, a group led by Carl Collins of the University of Texas at Dallas reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=82|issue=4|pages=695–698|year=1999| title=Accelerated Emission of Gamma Rays from the 31-yr Isomer of &lt;sup&gt;178&lt;/sup&gt;Hf Induced by X-Ray Irradiation|author=Collins, C.B., Davanloo, F., Iosif, M.|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.695|bibcode=1999PhRvL..82..695C|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Physical Review C|volume=61|issue=5|pages=054305–054305–7|year=2000| title=Gamma emission from the 31-yr isomer of &lt;sup&gt;178&lt;/sup&gt;Hf induced by x-ray irradiation|author=Collins, C.B., Davanloo, F., Rusu, A.C.|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.61.054305|bibcode = 2000PhRvC..61e4305C |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; having successfully initiated such a trigger. Signal-to-noise ratios were small in those first experiments, and to date no other group has been able to duplicate these results. [[Peter Zimmerman]] described claims of weaponization potential as having been based on "[[Voodoo Science|very bad science]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200706/backpage.cfm |title=The Strange Tale of the Hafnium Bomb: A Personal Narrative |author=[[Peter Zimmerman]] |date=June 2007 |website=[[American Physical Society]] |access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
'''&lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf''' is a particularly attractive candidate for [[induced gamma emission]] (IGE) experiments, because of its high density of stored energy, 2.5 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] per nucleus, and long 31-year [[half life]] for storing that energy. If radiation from some agent could "trigger" a release of that stored energy, the resulting cascade of gamma photons would have the best chance of finding a pair of excited states with the inverted lifetimes needed for [[stimulated emission]]. While induced emission adds only power to a radiation field, stimulated emission adds [[coherence (physics)|coherence]]. The possibility to manipulate gamma ray coherence, even to a small degree, would be interesting.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrick E. Thomsen [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_v130/ai_4539152/ Pumping up hope for gamma ray laser], Science News, Nov 1, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The lifetime of the hafnium isomer is long enough for tractable amounts of material to be collected into experimental targets. Such samples would hold no hazards for personnel working with the material; 1 microgram of &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf has an [[Activity (radioactivity)|activity]] of {{convert|1.5|MBq|uCi|abbr=off|lk=on}}.

A proposal to test the efficacy for "triggering" &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf was approved by a NATO-Advanced Research Workshop (NATO-ARW) held in [[Predeal]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the NATO-ARW are collected in ''Hyperfine Interactions'', '''107''', pp 3–492 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the proposal was to use incident protons to bombard the target, α-particles were available when the first experiment was scheduled. It was done by a French, Russian, Romanian and American team. Results were said &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hafniumisomer.org/isomer/03IsomerHistory_files/frame.htm/ Link to review of "Isomer Triggering history from one participant.]&lt;/ref&gt; to be extraordinary, but the results were not published. Nevertheless, &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf was implied to be of special importance to potential applications of IGE. A controversy quickly erupted.

== Importance ==
*&lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf has the highest excitation energy of any comparably long-lived isomer. One [[gram]] of pure &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf contains approximately 1330 [[megajoule]]s of energy, the equivalent in about 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of the explosive [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. The half-life of &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf is 31 years or 1 Gs (gigasecond, 1,000,000,000 seconds) so that a gram's natural radioactivity is 1.6 TBq ([[becquerel|terabecquerels]]) or roughly 40 Ci ([[curie]]s). The activity is in a cascade of penetrating gamma rays, the most energetic of which is 0.574 MeV. Substantial shielding would be needed for human safety if the sample were to be 1 gram of the pure isomer. However, so far the nuclear isomer exists only at low concentrations (&lt;0.1%), within multi-isotopic hafnium. One gram of this material has about 1.33 [[megajoule]]s of energy, about an order of magnitude better than compressed hydrogen.
*All energy released would be in the form of photons; X-rays and gamma rays.
*If all the energy in the nucleus could be released within a short time, say 1 ns, one gram of pure &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf would produce an x-ray burst with extremely high power on the order of 1 GJ/ns or 1000 PetaWatts (see also  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607000414/http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter3/prefixes.html exawatts]). However, quantitative estimates indicate that the energy released by the nuclear isomer is much less than the energy needed to initiate the process; the power needed to initiate IGE would have to occur over a shorter time scale than the release of the nuclear energy, and would therefore be even more extremely disproportionate.
*The characteristic scales of times for processes involved in applications would be favorable for consuming all of the initial radioactivity. The process for triggering a sample by IGE would use photons to trigger and produce photons as a product. The propagation of photons occurs at the speed of light while mechanical disassembly of the target would proceed with a velocity comparable to that of sound. Untriggered &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf material might not be able to get away from a triggered event if the photons didn't interact first with the electrons. 
*Both the proposal to the NATO-ARW and the fragmentary results from the subsequent experiment indicated that the energy of the photon needed to initiate IGE from &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf would be less than 300 keV. Many economical sources of such low energy X-rays were available for delivering quite large fluxes to target samples of modest dimensions.
*Samples of &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf were and remain available at low concentrations &lt;0.1%.

== Chronology of notable events ==
*Around 1997 the JASONS advisory group took testimony about the triggering of nuclear isomers. The [[JASON Defense Advisory Group]] published a relevant public report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=High Energy Density Explosives|author1=N. Lewis |author2=R. Garwin |author3=D. Hammer |author4=W. Happer |author5=R. Jeanloz. J. Katz |author6=S. Koonin |author7=P. Weinberger |author8=E. Williams | date= October 1997| publisher= JSR-97-110|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/jason/he.pdf}} Sect. 4, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that they concluded that such a thing would be impossible and should not be attempted. Despite intervening publications in peer-reviewed journals of articles written by an international team reporting IGE from &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf, around 2003 IDA took testimony, again from relevant scientists on matters of the credibility of reported results. Professor Carl Collins, the lead U.S. member of the team publishing the successes, did not testify.

*Around 2003, [[DARPA]] initiated exploratory research termed stimulated isomer energy release (SIER) and public interest was aroused, at both popular levels&lt;ref&gt;

*The first focus of SIER was whether significant amounts of &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf could be produced at acceptable costs for possible applications. A closed panel called HIPP was charged with the task and concluded that it could. However, a scientist on that confidential DARPA HIPP review panel "leaked" prejudicial but preliminary concerns to the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/10.23.03/hafnium-0343.html San Jose newspaper article.], October, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This unsubstantiated assertion set into motion the subsequent cascade of inaccurate reports about the so-called "outrageous costs" of isomer triggering.
*Having satisfied the charge to the HIPP panel to explore the problem of production at acceptable cost, the SIER program turned to the matter of definitive confirmation of the reports of IGE from &lt;sup&gt;178m2&lt;/sup&gt;Hf. A task of TRiggering Isomer Proof (TRIP) was mandated by DARPA and assigned to a completely independent team from those reporting success previously. The "gold standard" of hafnium-isomer triggering was set as the Rusu dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;C. Rusu (PhD Dissertation, U of Texas at Dallas, 2002)Available from: [http://tls.il.proquest.com/umi/dissertations/disexpress.shtml ''Proquest'' (Order Number: 3087127)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051015054033/http://tls.il.proquest.com/umi/dissertations/disexpress.shtml |date=2005-10-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The TRIP experiment required independent confirmation of the Rusu dissertation. It was successful, but could not be published.

==Definition==
The '''higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions''' (HOSIDF) were first introduced&lt;ref&gt;P.W.J.M. Nuij, O.H. Bosgra, M. Steinbuch, Higher Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions for the Analysis of Nonlinear Systems with Harmonic Responses, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 20(8), 1883–1904, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://w3.wtb.tue.nl/en/people_pages/?script=showemp.php&amp;pid=901 dr. ir. P.W.J.M. Nuij]. The HOSIDFs are an extension of the sinusoidal input [[describing function]]&lt;ref&gt;Gelb, A., and W. E. Vander Velde: Multiple-Input Describing Functions and Nonlinear System Design, McGraw Hill, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; which describe the response ([[Gain (electronics)|gain]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]]) of a system at harmonics of the base frequency of a sinusoidal input signal. The HOSIDFs bear an intuitive resemblance to the classical [[frequency response function]] and define the periodic output of a stable, [[Causal system|causal]], [[time invariant]] [[nonlinear system]] to a [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] input signal:

&lt;math&gt; u(t) = \gamma \sin(\omega_0 t + \varphi_0) &lt;/math&gt;

This output is denoted by &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt; and consists of harmonics of the input frequency:

&lt;math&gt; y(t) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{K} |H_k(\omega_0,\gamma)|\gamma^k \cos\big(k(\omega_0t + \varphi_0) + \angle H_k(\omega_0,\gamma) \big) &lt;/math&gt;

Defining the single sided spectra of the input and output as &lt;math&gt; U(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y(\omega) &lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt; |U(\omega_0)|=\gamma &lt;/math&gt; yields the definition of the k-th order HOSIDF:

&lt;math&gt; H_k(\omega_0,\gamma) = \frac{Y(k\omega_0,\gamma)}{U^k(\omega_0,\gamma)} &lt;/math&gt;

==Advantages and applications==
The application and analysis of the HOSIDFs is advantageous both when a nonlinear model is already identified and when no model is known yet. In the latter case the HOSIDFs require little model assumptions and can easily be identified while requiring no advanced mathematical tools. Moreover, even when a model is already identified, the analysis of the HOSIDFs often yields significant advantages over the use of the identified nonlinear model. First of all, the HOSIDFs are intuitive in their identification and interpretation while other nonlinear model structures often yield limited direct information about the behavior of the system in practice. Furthermore, the HOSIDFs provide a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions in case nonlinearities cannot be neglected. In practice the HOSIDFs have two distinct applications: Due to their ease of identification, HOSIDFs provide a tool to provide on-site testing during system design. Finally, the application of HOSIDFs to (nonlinear) controller design for nonlinear systems is shown to yield significant advantages over conventional time domain based tuning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25028">In [[physics]], the '''history of centrifugal and centripetal forces''' illustrates a long and complex evolution of thought about the nature of [[force]]s, [[Principle of relativity|relativity]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.

==Huygens, Leibniz, Newton, and Hooke==

Early scientific ideas about [[centrifugal force]] were based upon [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive perception]], and [[circular motion]] was considered somehow more "natural" than [[straight-line motion]]. According to Domenico Bertoloni-Meli:
:"For Huygens and Newton centrifugal force was the result of a curvilinear motion of a body; hence it was located in nature, in the object of investigation. According to a more recent formulation of classical mechanics, centrifugal force depends on the choice of how phenomena can be conveniently represented. Hence it is not located in nature, but is the result of a choice by the observer. In the first case a mathematical formulation mirrors centrifugal force; in the second it creates it."&lt;ref&gt;

[[Christiaan Huygens]] coined the term "centrifugal force" in his 1659 ''De Vi Centrifuga''&lt;ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] as part of his "[[solar vortex theory]]" conceived of centrifugal force as a real outward force which is induced by the circulation of the body upon which the force acts.  An inverse cube law centrifugal force appears in an equation representing planetary [[orbit]]s, including non-circular ones, as Leibniz described in his 1689 ''Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis''.&lt;ref&gt;

Leibniz's equation is still used today to solve planetary orbital problems, although his solar vortex theory is no longer used as its basis.&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;

Leibniz produced an equation for planetary orbits in which the centrifugal force appeared as an outward inverse cube law force in the radial direction:&lt;ref name="Linton"&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot r = -k/r^{2} + l^{2}/r^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Newton himself appears to have previously supported an approach similar to that of Leibniz.&lt;ref name=Swetz/&gt; Later, Newton in his ''Principia'' crucially limited the description of the dynamics of planetary motion to a frame of reference in which the point of attraction is fixed. In this description, Leibniz's centrifugal force was not needed and was replaced by only continually inward forces toward the fixed point.&lt;ref name=Linton/&gt; Newton objected to Leibniz's equation on the grounds that it allowed for the centrifugal force to have a different value from the centripetal force, arguing on the basis of his third law of motion, that the centrifugal force and the centripetal force must constitute an equal and opposite action-reaction pair. In this however, Newton was mistaken, as the reactive centrifugal force which is required by the third law of motion is a completely separate concept from the centrifugal force of Leibniz's equation.&lt;ref name=Swetz&gt;

Huygens, who was, along with Leibniz, a neo-Cartesian and critic of Newton, concluded after a long correspondence that Leibniz's writings on celestial mechanics made no sense, and that his invocation of a harmonic vortex was logically redundant, because Leibniz's radial equation of motion follows trivially from Newton's laws.  Even the most ardent modern defenders of the cogency of Leibniz's ideas acknowledge that his harmonic vortex as the basis of centrifugal force was dynamically superfluous.&lt;ref&gt;A. R. Hall, Philosophers at War, 2002, pp 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the idea of circular motion as caused by a single force was introduced to Newton by [[Robert Hooke]].&lt;ref name="xnewton"/&gt;

Newton described the role of centrifugal force upon the height of the oceans near the equator in the ''[https://archive.org/stream/newtonspmathema00newtrich/newtonspmathema00newtrich_djvu.txt Principia]'':
{{Quotation
 |Since the centrifugal force of the parts of the earth, arising from the earth's diurnal motion, which is to the force of gravity as 1 to 289, raises the waters under the equator to a height exceeding that under the poles by 85472 Paris feet, as above, in Prop. XIX., the force of the sun, which we have now shewed to be to the force of gravity as 1 to 12868200, and therefore is to that centrifugal force as 289 to 12868200, or as 1 to 44527, will be able to raise the waters in the places directly under and directly opposed to the sun to a height exceeding that in the places which are 90 degrees removed from the sun only by one Paris foot and 113 V inches ; for this measure is to the measure of 85472 feet as 1 to 44527.

The effect of centrifugal force in countering gravity, as in this behavior of the tides, has led centrifugal force sometimes to be called "false gravity" or "imitation gravity" or "quasi-gravity".&lt;ref name=Volovik&gt;

==Eighteenth century==

It wasn't until the latter half of the 18th century that the modern "[[fictitious force]]" understanding of the centrifugal force as a pseudo-force artifact of rotating reference frames took shape.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1746 [[mémoire|memoir]] by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], "the idea that the centrifugal force is fictitious emerges unmistakably."&lt;ref name=Meli&gt;[[#Reference-idMeli1990|Meli 1990]], "The Relativization of Centrifugal Force".&lt;/ref&gt; Bernoulli, in seeking to describe the motion of an object relative to an arbitrary point, showed that the magnitude of the centrifugal force depended on which arbitrary point was chosen to measure circular motion about. Later in the 18th century [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] in his ''Mécanique Analytique'' explicitly stated that the centrifugal force depends on the rotation of a system of [[perpendicular]] [[axis of rotation|axes]].&lt;ref name=Meli/&gt; 
In 1835, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] analyzed arbitrary motion in rotating systems, specifically in relation to waterwheels. He coined the phrase "compound centrifugal force" for a term which bore a similar mathematical expression to that of centrifugal force, albeit that it was multiplied by a factor of two.&lt;ref&gt;

The force in question was perpendicular to both the [[velocity]] of an object relative to a rotating frame of reference and the [[axis of rotation]] of the frame. Compound centrifugal force eventually came to be known as the [[Coriolis Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Anders (July 1998).

==Absolute versus relative rotation==

The idea of centrifugal force is closely related to the notion of [[absolute rotation]]. In 1707 the Irish bishop [[George Berkeley]] took issue with the notion of [[absolute space]], declaring that "motion cannot be understood except in relation to our or some other body". In considering a solitary globe, all forms of motion, uniform and accelerated, are unobservable in an otherwise empty universe.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;

 |publisher=Cambridge University Press
 |edition =2nd
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This notion was followed up in modern times by [[Ernst Mach]]. For a single body in an empty universe, motion of any kind is inconceivable. Because rotation does not exist, centrifugal force does not exist. Of course, addition of a speck of matter just to establish a reference frame cannot cause the sudden appearance of centrifugal force, so it must be due to rotation relative to the entire mass of the universe.&lt;ref name=Mach&gt;

Thus, for example, if we wonder how rapidly our galaxy is rotating, we can make a model of the galaxy in which its rotation plays a part. The rate of rotation in this model that makes the observations of (for example) the flatness of the galaxy agree best with physical laws as we know them is the best estimate of the rate of rotation&lt;ref name=Genz&gt;

==Role in developing the idea of inertial frames and relativity==

{{Main article|Inertial frame of reference}}

In the [[Bucket argument|rotating bucket]] experiment, Newton observed the shape of the surface of water in a bucket as the bucket was spun on a rope. At first the water is flat, then, as it acquires the same rotation as the bucket, it becomes parabolic.  Newton took this change as evidence that one could detect rotation relative to "absolute space" experimentally, in this instance by looking at the shape of the surface of the water.

Later scientists pointed out (as did Newton) that the laws of mechanics were the same for all observers that differed only by uniform translation; that is, all observers that differed in motion only by a constant velocity. Hence, "absolute space" was not preferred, but only one of a set of frames related by [[Galilean transformation]]s.&lt;ref name=Pippard&gt;

Ultimately this notion of the transformation properties of physical laws between frames played a more and more central role.&lt;ref name=symmetries&gt;
The idea of transformation properties of physical laws under various transformations is a central topic in modern physics, related to such basic concepts as [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s like conservation of energy and momentum through [[Noether's theorem]]. See, for example,

It was noted that accelerating frames exhibited "fictitious forces" like the centrifugal force. These forces did not behave under transformation like other forces, providing a means of distinguishing them. This peculiarity of these forces led to the names ''inertial forces'', ''pseudo-forces'' or ''fictitious forces''. In particular, fictitious forces ''did not appear at all'' in some frames: those frames differing from that of the fixed stars by only a constant velocity. In short, a frame tied to the "fixed stars" is merely a member of the class of "inertial frames", and absolute space is an unnecessary and logically untenable concept. The preferred, or "inertial frames", were identifiable by the ''absence of fictitious forces''.&lt;ref name=Rothman2&gt;

The idea of an inertial frame was extended further in the [[special theory of relativity]]. This theory posited that ''all'' physical laws should appear of the same form in inertial frames, not just the laws of mechanics. In particular, [[Maxwell's equations]] should apply in all frames. Because Maxwell's equations implied the same speed of light in the vacuum of [[free space]] for all inertial frames, inertial frames now were found to be related not by Galilean transformations, but by [[Poincaré transformation]]s, of which a subset is the [[Lorentz transformation]]s. That posit led to many ramifications, including [[Lorentz contraction]]s and [[relativity of simultaneity]]. Einstein succeeded, through many clever [[thought experiments]], in showing that these apparently odd ramifications in fact had very natural explanation upon looking at just how measurements and clocks actually were used. That is, these ideas flowed from [[operational definition]]s of measurement coupled with the experimental confirmation of the constancy of the [[speed of light]].

Later the general theory of relativity further generalized the idea of frame independence of the laws of physics, and abolished the special position of inertial frames, at the cost of introducing [[curved space-time]]. Following an analogy with centrifugal force (sometimes called "[[#ArtificialGravity|artificial gravity]]" or "false gravity"), [[gravity]] itself became a fictitious force,&lt;ref name=VonBaeyer&gt;

In short, centrifugal force played a key early role in establishing the set of inertial frames of reference and the significance of fictitious forces, even aiding in the development of general relativity.

==The modern conception==

The modern interpretation is that [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force in a rotating reference frame]] is a pseudo-force that appears in equations of motion in [[rotating reference frame|rotating frames of reference]], to explain effects of [[inertia]] as seen in such frames.&lt;ref&gt;

In the context of [[human evolution]], '''human vestigiality''' involves those [[phenotypic trait|traits]] (such as [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] or [[behavior]]s) occurring in [[human]]s that have lost all or most of their original [[function (biology)|function]] through [[evolution]]. Although structures called ''[[Vestigiality|vestigial]]'' often appear functionless, a vestigial structure may retain lesser functions or develop minor new ones. In some cases, structures once identified as vestigial simply had an unrecognized function.

The examples of human vestigiality are numerous, including the anatomical (such as the human [[Coccyx|tailbone]], [[Wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]], and [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|inside corner of the eye]]), the behavioral ([[goose bumps]] and [[palmar grasp reflex]]), and molecular ([[pseudogene]]s). Many human characteristics are also vestigial in other [[primate]]s and related animals.

== History ==
[[Charles Darwin]] listed a number of putative human vestigial features, which he termed rudimentary, in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' (1890). These included the [[Intrinsic muscles of external ear|muscles of the ear]], [[wisdom teeth]], the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[tail bone]], [[body hair]], and the [[Nictitating membrane|semilunar fold]] in the corner of the [[human eye|eye]]. Darwin also commented on the sporadic nature of many vestigial features, particularly musculature. Making reference to the work of the anatomist [[William Turner (anatomist)|William Turner]], Darwin highlighted a number of sporadic muscles which he identified as vestigial remnants of the [[panniculus carnosus]], particularly the [[sternalis muscle]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C, ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'', London: John Murray, 1890, p.13.[https://archive.org/details/ajp4619.0001.001.umich.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner W, ''On the musculus sternalis'', Proc. Royal Soc. Edinburgh session 1866–1867, p.65.[https://archive.org/stream/proceedingso618661869roya#page/64/mode/2up/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, [[Robert Wiedersheim]] published [[Robert Wiedersheim#The Structure of Man|''The Structure of Man'']], a book on [[human anatomy]] and its relevance to man's evolutionary history. This book contained a list of 86 human organs that he considered vestigial, or as Wiedersheim himself explained: "Organs having become wholly or in part functionless, some appearing in the Embryo alone, others present during Life constantly or inconstantly. For the greater part Organs which may be rightly termed Vestigial."&lt;ref name="The Structure of Man"&gt;Wiedersheim, R. (1893) ''The Structure of Man: An Index to His Past History''. Second Edition. Translated by H. and M. Bernard. London: Macmillan and Co. 1895. [https://archive.org/details/structureofmanin00wiediala]&lt;/ref&gt; His list of supposedly vestigial organs included many of the examples on this page as well as others then mistakenly believed to be purely vestigial, such as the [[pineal gland]], the [[thymus gland]], and the [[pituitary gland]]. Some of these organs that had lost their obvious, original functions later turned out to have retained functions that had gone unrecognized before the discovery of hormones or many of the functions and tissues of the immune system.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;Muller, G. B. (2002) "Vestigial Organs and Structures." in Encyclopedia of Evolution. Mark Pagel, editor in chief, New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 1131–1133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Koerth-Baker | first=Maggie | title=Vestigial Organs Not So Useless After All | date=30 July 2009 | work=National Geographic | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090730-spleen-vestigial-organs.html | accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples included:
* the role of the pineal in the regulation of the [[circadian rhythm]] (neither the function nor even the existence of melatonin was yet known);
* discovery of the role of the [[thymus]] in the immune system lay many decades in the future; it remained a mystery organ until after the mid-20th century;
* the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] and [[hypothalamus]] with their many and varied hormones were far from understood, let alone the complexity of their interrelationships.

Historically, there was a trend not only to dismiss the [[vermiform appendix]] as being uselessly vestigial, but an anatomical hazard, a liability to [[Appendicitis|dangerous inflammation]]. As late as the mid-20th century, many reputable authorities conceded it no beneficial function.&lt;ref name="WellsSOF"&gt;Wells, H.g. Huxley, J. Wells, G. P. The Science of Life. Pub. Cassell 1931&lt;/ref&gt; This was a view supported, or perhaps inspired, by Darwin himself in the 1874 edition of his book [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]. The organ's patent liability to appendicitis and its poorly understood role left the appendix open to blame for a number of possibly unrelated conditions. For example, in 1916, a surgeon claimed that removal of the appendix had cured several cases of [[Trigeminal neuralgia|trifacial neuralgia]] and other nerve pain about the head and face, even though he stated that the evidence for appendicitis in those patients was inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, M. I.: Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 67, Issues 15-26, 1916. Page 1326&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of hormones and hormonal principles, notably by [[Endocrinology|Bayliss and Starling]], argued against these views, but in the early twentieth century, there remained a great deal of fundamental research to be done on the functions of large parts of the digestive tract. In 1916, an author found it necessary to argue against the idea that the colon had no important function and that "...the ultimate disappearance of the appendix is a coordinate action and not necessarily associated with such frequent inflammations as we are witnessing in the human..."&lt;ref&gt;W. Colin MacKenzie. A Contribution to the Biology of the Vermiform Appendix. Medical record, Volume 89 Page 342 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been a long history of doubt about such dismissive views. Around 1920, the prominent surgeon [[Kenelm Hutchinson Digby]] documented previous observations, going back more than thirty years, that suggested lymphatic tissues, such as the tonsils and appendix, may have substantial immunological functions.

=== Appendix ===
[[File:Ileum-Caecum-Colon of rabbit IMG 5771.JPG|thumb|Ileum, caecum and colon of rabbit, showing ''Appendix vermiformis'' on fully functional [[caecum]].]]
[[File:Gray536.png|right|thumb|The human vermiform appendix on the vestigial caecum.]]
In modern humans, the [[vermiform appendix]] is a vestige of a redundant organ that in ancestral species had digestive functions, much as it still does in extant species in which intestinal flora hydrolyze [[cellulose]] and similar indigestible plant materials.&lt;ref name=Descent&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1871). ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''. John Murray: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Some herbivorous animals, such as rabbits, have a terminal vermiform appendix and [[cecum]] that apparently bear patches of tissue with immune functions and may also be important in maintaining the composition of [[intestinal flora]]. It does not however seem to have much digestive function, if any, and is not present in all herbivores, even those with large caeca.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stevens, C. Edward |author2=Hume, Ian | title = Comparative Physiology of the Vertebrate Digestive System | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-521-61714-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the accompanying pictures however, the human appendix typically is about comparable to that of the rabbit's in size, though the caecum is reduced to a single bulge where the ileum empties into the colon.&lt;ref name="WellsSOF" /&gt; Some carnivorous animals may have appendices too, but seldom have more than vestigial caeca.&lt;ref name="StPRCESD"&gt;Peter Robert Cheeke, Ellen S. Dierenfeld, Comparative Animal Nutrition and Metabolism. Publisher: CABI;  2010 {{ISBN|978-1-84593-631-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the possibility of vestigial organs developing new functions, some research suggests that the appendix may guard against the loss of symbiotic bacteria that aid in digestion, though that is unlikely to be a novel function, given the presence of vermiform appendices in many herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21153898/|title=Appendix may be useful after all – Health – Health care – More health news – NBC News|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Randal Bollinger |first1=R. |last2=Barbas |first2=Andrew S. |last3=Bush |first3=Errol L. |last4=Lin |first4=Shu S. |last5=Parker |first5=William |title=Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=249 |issue=4 |pages=826–31 |year=2007 |pmid=17936308 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Intestinal bacterial populations entrenched in the appendix may support quick re-establishment of the flora of the large intestine after an illness, poisoning, or after an antibiotic treatment depletes or otherwise causes harmful changes to the bacterial population of the colon.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Q. Choi, "The Appendix: Useful and in Fact Promising", ''Live Science'', 2009, [http://www.livescience.com/10571-appendix-fact-promising.html Appendix has useful function]&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 study, however, refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and presence. It is widely present in [[euarchontoglires]] (a superorder of mammals that includes rodents and primates) and has also evolved [[Convergent evolution|independently]] in the [[diprotodont]] [[marsupials]], [[monotreme]]s, and is highly diverse in size and shape which could suggest it is not vestigial. Researchers deduce that the appendix has the ability to protect good bacteria in the gut. That way, when the gut is affected by a bout of diarrhea or other illness that cleans out the intestines, the good bacteria in the appendix can repopulate the digestive system and keep the person healthy.&lt;ref name=SEAL09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01809.x |pmid=19678866 |title=Comparative anatomy and phylogenetic distribution of the mammalian cecal appendix |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1984–99 |year=2009 |last1=Smith |first1=H.

=== Coccyx ===
The [[coccyx]], or tailbone, is the remnant of a lost [[tail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Spectrum of human tails: A report of six cases |author=Biswanath Mukhopadhyay, Ram M. Shukla, Madhumita Mukhopadhyay, Kartik C. Mandal, Pankaj Haldar, &amp; Abhijit Benare |journal=Journal of Indian Association of Pediatric Surgeons |year=2012 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=23–25 |doi=10.4103/0971-9261.91082 |pmid=22279360 |pmc=3263034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All mammals have a tail at some point in their development; in humans, it is present for a period of 4 weeks, during [[Carnegie stages|stages]] 14 to 22 of [[human embryogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0940-9602(11)80496-6 |pmid=8059973 |title=Morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of axial structures in the transitory human tail |journal=Annals of Anatomy - Anatomischer Anzeiger |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=277–86 |year=1994 |last1=Saraga-Babić |first1=Mirna |last2=Lehtonen |first2=Eero |last3=Švajger |first3=Anton |last4=Wartiovaara |first4=Jorma }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tail is most prominent in human embryos 31–35 days old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/aja.1001520108 |pmid=677043 |title=Evidence of a role for cell death in the disappearance of the embryonic human tail |journal=American Journal of Anatomy |volume=152 |issue=1 |pages=111–29 |year=1978 |last1=Fallon |first1=John F. |last2=Simandl |first2=B. Kay }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tailbone, located at the end of the spine, has lost its original function in assisting balance and mobility, though it still serves some secondary functions, such as being an attachment point for muscles, which explains why it has not degraded further.  The coccyx serves as an attachment site for tendons, ligaments, and muscles. It also functions as an insertion point of some of the muscles of the pelvic floor.
In rare cases, congenital defect results in a [[Tail#Human tails|short tail-like structure]] being present at birth. Twenty-three cases of human babies born with such a structure have been reported in the medical literature since 1884.&lt;ref name=Dao&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0046-8177(84)80079-9 |pmid=6373560 |title=Human tails and pseudotails |journal=Human Pathology |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=449–53 |year=1984 |last1=Dao |first1=Anh H. |last2=Netsky |first2=Martin G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000637-198804000-00009 |pmid=3284435 |title=Detailing the Human Tail |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=340–4 |year=1988 |last1=Dubrow |first1=Terry J. |last2=Wackym |first2=Phillip Ashley |last3=Lesavoy |first3=Malcolm A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases such as these, the spine and skull were determined to be entirely normal. The only abnormality was that of a tail approximately twelve centimeters long. These tails were able to be surgically removed, and the individuals have resumed normal lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3171/jns.1985.63.3.0461 |pmid=3894599 |title=The human tail: A benign stigma |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=461–2 |year=1985 |last1=Spiegelmann |first1=Roberto |last2=Schinder |first2=Edgardo |last3=Mintz |first3=Mordejai |last4=Blakstein |first4=Alexander }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wisdom teeth ===
&lt;!--This section also appears in the wisdom teeth article, please try to keep the two in harmony--&gt;
[[Wisdom tooth|Wisdom teeth]] are vestigial third molars that human ancestors used to help in grinding down plant tissue. The common postulation is that the skulls of human ancestors had larger jaws with more teeth, which were possibly used to help chew down foliage to compensate for a lack of ability to efficiently digest the [[cellulose]] that makes up a plant cell wall. As human diets changed, smaller jaws were [[Natural Selection|naturally selected]], yet the third molars, or "wisdom teeth", still commonly develop in human mouths.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Dr. George B. [http://www.txtwriter.com/backgrounders/Evolution/EVpage12.html "Evidence for Evolution"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310041049/http://txtwriter.com/Backgrounders/Evolution/EVpage12.html |date=10 March 2008 }}. (Page 12) Txtwriter Inc. 8 Jun 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, wisdom teeth have become useless and even harmful to the extent where surgical procedures are often performed to remove them.

[[Agenesis]] (failure to develop) of wisdom teeth in human populations ranges from zero in [[Tasmanian Aboriginals]] to nearly 100% in [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous Mexicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rozkovcová |first1=E |last2=Marková |first2=M |last3=Dolejsí |first3=J |title=Studies on agenesis of third molars amongst populations of different origin |journal=Sbornik Lekarsky |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=71–84 |year=1999 |pmid=11220165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is related to the [[PAX9]] gene (and perhaps other genes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0509562103 |pmid=16585527 |pmc=1458632 |title=Natural selection and molecular evolution in primate PAX9 gene, a major determinant of tooth development |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=103 |issue=15 |pages=5676–81 |year=2006 |last1=Pereira |first1=T.

=== Vomeronasal organ ===
In some animals, the [[vomeronasal organ]] (VNO) is part of a second, completely separate sense of smell, known as the [[Olfaction|accessory olfactory system]]. Many studies have been performed to find if there is an actual presence of a VNO in adult human beings. Trotier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/25.4.369 |pmid=10944499 |title=The Vomeronasal Cavity in Adult Humans |journal=Chemical Senses |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=369–80 |year=2000 |last1=Trotier |first1=D. |last2=Eloit |first2=C |last3=Wassef |first3=M |last4=Talmain |first4=G |last5=Bensimon |first5=J. L. |last6=Døving |first6=K. B. |last7=Ferrand |first7=J }}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that around 92% of their subjects who had not had septal surgery had at least one intact VNO. Kjaer and Fisher Hansen, on the other hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0722.1996.tb00043.x |pmid=8653495 |title=The human vomeronasal organ: Prenatal developmental stages and distribution of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone |journal=European Journal of Oral Sciences |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=34–40 |year=1996 |last1=Kjær |first1=Inger |last2=Hansen |first2=Birgit Fischer }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the VNO structure disappeared during fetal development as it does for some primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ar.1152 |pmid=11519019 |title=Reappraisal of the vomeronasal system of catarrhine primates: Ontogeny, morphology, functionality, and persisting questions |journal=The Anatomical Record |volume=265 |issue=4 |pages=176–92 |year=2001 |last1=Smith |first1=Timothy D. |last2=Siegel |first2=Michael I. |last3=Bhatnagar |first3=Kunwar P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smith and Bhatnagar (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1469-7580.2000.19730421.x |pmid=11117628 |pmc=1468143 |title=The human vomeronasal organ.

Won (2000) found evidence of a VNO in 13 of his 22 cadavers (59.1%) and in 22 of his 78 living patients (28.2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Won |first1=J |last2=Mair |first2=EA |last3=Bolger |first3=WE |last4=Conran |first4=RM |title=The vomeronasal organ: an objective anatomic analysis of its prevalence |journal=Ear, Nose, &amp; Throat Journal |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=600–5 |year=2000 |pmid=10969469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given these findings, some scientists have argued that there is a VNO in adult human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=A |last2=Josephson |first2=R |last3=Hawke |first3=M |title=Clinical and histological evidence for the presence of the vomeronasal (Jacobson's) organ in adult humans |journal=The Journal of Otolaryngology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=71–9 |year=1985 |pmid=4068105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=René |last1=Foltán |first2=Jiří |title=Behavioral changes of patients after orthognathic surgery develop on the basis of the loss of vomeronasal organ: a hypothesis |journal=Head &amp; Face Medicine |volume=5 |pages=5 |year=2009 |last2=Šedý |pmid=19161592 |pmc=2653472 |doi=10.1186/1746-160X-5-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most investigators have sought to identify the opening of the vomeronasal organ in humans, rather than identify the tubular epithelial structure itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhatnagar |first1=Kunwar P. |last2=Smith |first2=Timothy D. |title=The human vomeronasal organ.

Among studies that use microanatomical methods, there is no reported evidence that human beings have active sensory neurons like those in working vomeronasal systems of other animals.&lt;ref name="Bhatnagar87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Witt06"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Witt |first1=M |last2=Hummel |first2=T |title=Vomeronasal Versus Olfactory Epithelium: Is There a Cellular Basis for Human Vomeronasal Perception? |volume=248 |pages=209–59 |year=2006 |pmid=16487792 |doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(06)48004-9 |series=International Review of Cytology |isbn=978-0-12-364652-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is no evidence to date that suggests there are nerve and axon connections between any existing sensory receptor cells that may be in the adult human VNO and the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wysocki CJ, Preti G |title=Facts, fallacies, fears, and frustrations with human pheromones |journal=The Anatomical Record Part A: Discoveries in Molecular, Cellular, and Evolutionary Biology |volume=281 |issue=1 |pages=1201–11 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15470677 |doi= 10.1002/ar.a.20125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, there is no evidence for any accessory olfactory bulb in adult human beings,&lt;ref name="Bhatnagar87" /&gt; and the key genes involved in VNO function in other mammals have become [[pseudogene]]s in human beings. Therefore, while the presence of a structure in adult human beings is debated, a review of the scientific literature by Tristram Wyatt concluded, "most in the field … are sceptical about the likelihood of a functional VNO in adult human beings on current evidence."&lt;ref name="wy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wyatt |first=Tristram D. |year=2003 |title=Pheromones and Animal Behaviour: Communication by Smell and Taste |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-48526-5 |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macalister, Annals and Magazine of Natural History, vol. vii., 1871, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans and other primates such as the [[orangutan]] and [[chimpanzee]] however have ear [[muscle]]s that are minimally developed and non-functional, yet still large enough to be identifiable.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt; A muscle attached to the ear that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, can no longer be said to have any biological function. In humans there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and it can be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bair|first1=J.

The outer structure of the ear also shows some vestigial features, such as the node or point on the helix of the ear known as [[Darwin's tubercle]] which is found in around 10% of the population.

=== Eye ===
The [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|plica semilunaris]] is a small fold of tissue on the inside corner of the eye. It is the vestigial remnant of the [[nictitating membrane]], an organ that is fully functional in some other species of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Owen|Owen, R.]] 1866–1868. ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates''. London.{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its associated muscles are also vestigial.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt; Only one species of [[primate]], the [[Calabar angwantibo]], is known to have a functioning nictitating membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330250307 |pmid=5971502 |title=The skin of primates.

The [[orbitalis muscle]] is a vestigial or rudimentary nonstriated muscle (smooth muscle) of the eye that crosses from the infraorbital groove and sphenomaxillary fissure and is intimately united with the periosteum of the orbit. It was described by Johannes Peter Müller and is often called Müller's muscle. The muscle forms an important part of the lateral orbital wall in some animals, but in humans it is not known to have any significant function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=653491 |year=1978 |author1=Toerien |first1=M.

=== Reproductive system ===
{{Main|List of homologues of the human reproductive system}}

==== Genitalia ====
In the [[internal genitalia]] of each human sex, there are some residual organs of [[mesonephric duct|mesonephric]] and [[paramesonephric duct|paramesonephric]] ducts during embryonic development:
* [[Gartner's duct]]
* [[Epoophoron]]
* [[Vesicular appendages of epoophoron]]
* [[Paroophoron]]

Human vestigial structures also include leftover embryological remnants that once served a function during development, such as the belly button, and analogous structures between biological sexes. For example, men are also born with two nipples, which are not known to serve a function compared to women.&lt;ref&gt;"Breast Anatomy and Embryology." Essentials of Plastic Surgery (2015): 355-61&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to genitourinary development, both internal and external genitalia of male and female fetuses have the ability to fully or partially form their analogous [[phenotype]] of the opposite biological sex if exposed to a lack/overabundance of androgens or the SRY gene during fetal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(06)80172-1 |pmid=7965425 |title=True hermaphroditism: Genetic variants and clinical management |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=738–44 |year=1994 |last1=Hadjiathanasiou |first1=C.G. |last2=Brauner |first2=R. |last3=Lortat-Jacob |first3=S. |last4=Nivot |first4=S. |last5=Jaubert |first5=F. |last6=Fellous |first6=M. |last7=Nihoul-Fékété |first7=C. |last8=Rappaport |first8=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4274/jcrpe.2495 |pmid=26761946 |pmc=5096479 |title=Homozygous Ala65Pro Mutation with V89L Polymorphism in SRD5A2 Deficiency |journal=Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=218–23 |year=2016 |last1=Eren |first1=Erdal |last2=Edgünlü |first2=Tuba |last3=Asut |first3=Emre |last4=Karakaş Çelik |first4=Sevim }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of vestigial remnants of genitourinary development include the [[hymen]], which is a [[membrane]] that surrounds or partially covers the external [[vagina]]l opening that derives from the sinus tubercle during fetal development and is homologous to the male [[seminal colliculus]].&lt;ref name=Healey2010&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/174_2010_128 |chapter=Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract |title=Imaging of Gynecological Disorders in Infants and Children |pages=21–30 |series=Medical Radiology |year=2010 |last1=Healey |first1=Andrew |isbn=978-3-540-85601-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers{{who|date=January 2013}} have hypothesized that the persistence of the hymen may be to provide temporary protection from [[infection]], as it separates the vaginal lumen from the urogenital sinus cavity during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2008.03.009 |pmid=19646660 |title=Hymen Sparing Surgery for Imperforate Hymen: Case Reports and Review of Literature |journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=e61–4 |year=2009 |last1=Basaran |first1=Mustafa |last2=Usal |first2=Deniz |last3=Aydemir |first3=Cumhur }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the [[glans penis]] and the [[clitoris]], the [[labia minora]] and the ventral penis, and the ovarian follicles and the seminiferous tubules.&lt;ref name=Healey2010/&gt;

In modern times, there is controversy regarding whether the [[foreskin]] is a vital or vestigial structure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Roger|date=2011-11-22|title=Vital or vestigial? The foreskin has its fans and foes|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/183/17/1963|journal=CMAJ|language=en|volume=183|issue=17|pages=1963–1964|doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-4014|issn=0820-3946|pmc=3225416|pmid=22025652}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, British physician Douglas Gairdner noted that the foreskin plays an important protective role in newborns. He wrote, “It is often stated that the prepuce is a vestigial structure devoid of function... However, it seems to be no accident that during the years when the child is incontinent the glans is completely clothed by the prepuce, for, deprived of this protection, the glans becomes susceptible to injury from contact with sodden clothes or napkin.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the physical act of sex, the foreskin reduces friction, which can reduce the need for additional sources of lubrication.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; "Some medical researchers, however, claim [[Circumcision|circumcised]] men enjoy sex just fine and that, in view of recent research on HIV transmission, the foreskin causes more trouble than it’s worth."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The area of the outer forskin measures between 7–100 cm2,&lt;ref&gt;Kigozi G, Wawer M, Ssettuba A, et al. .

The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. London, UK: John Murray; 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; In the March 2017 publication of the Global Health Journal: Science and Practice, Morris and Krieger wrote, "The variability in foreskin size is consistent with the foreskin being a vestigial structure."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Morris BJ, Krieger JN, Klausner JD|date=March 2017|title=CDC's Male Circumcision Recommendations Represent a Key Public Health Measure|url=http://www.ghspjournal.org/content/5/1/15|journal=Global Health, Science and Practice|volume=5|issue=1|pages=15–27|doi=10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00390|pmc=5478224|pmid=28351877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin speculated that the sensitivity of the foreskin to fine touch might have served as an “early warning system” in our naked ancestors while it protected the glans from the intrusion of biting insects and parasites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Musculature ===
A number of [[muscles]] in the human body are thought to be vestigial, either by virtue of being greatly reduced in size compared to homologous muscles in other species, by having become principally tendonous, or by being highly variable in their frequency within or between populations.

==== Head ====
The Occipitalis Minor is a muscle in the back of the head which normally joins to the [[auricular muscles]] of the ear. This muscle is very sporadic in frequency—always present in Malays, in 56% of Africans, 50% of Japanese, 36% of Europeans, and is nonexistent in the [[Khoikhoi]] people of southwestern Africa and in [[Melanesia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30079154 |first1=Alexander |last1=Macalister |year=1875 | title =Additional Observations on Muscular Anomalies in Human Anatomy. (Third Series) With a Catalogue of the Principal Muscular Variations Hitherto Published |journal=The Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy |volume=25 |pages=1–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other small muscles in the head associated with the occipital region and the post-auricular muscle complex are often variable in their frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archfaci.6.5.342 |pmid=15381582 |title=Variability of the Postauricular Muscle Complex |journal=Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=342–7 |year=2004 |last1=Guerra |first1=Aldo Benjamin |last2=Metzinger |first2=Stephen Eric |last3=Metzinger |first3=Rebecca Crawford |last4=Xie |first4=Chen |last5=Xie |first5=Yue |last6=Rigby |first6=Peter Lister |last7=Naugle |first7=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platysma, a quadrangular (four sides) muscle in a sheet-like configuration, is a vestigial remnant of the panniculous carnosus of animals. In horses, it is the muscle that allows it to flick a fly off its back.

==== Face ====
In many non-human mammals, the upper lip and sinus area is associated with [[whiskers]] or vibrissae which serve a sensory function. In humans, these whiskers do not exist but there are still sporadic cases where elements of the associated vibrissal capsular muscles or sinus hair muscles can be found. Based on histological studies of the upper lips of 20 cadavers, Tamatsu et al. found that structures resembling such muscles were present in 35% (7/20) of their specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ca.20497 |pmid=17458869 |title=Vestiges of vibrissal capsular muscles exist in the human upper lip |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=628–31 |year=2007 |last1=Tamatsu |first1=Yuichi |last2=Tsukahara |first2=Kazue |last3=Hotta |first3=Mitsuyuki |last4=Shimada |first4=Kazuyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arm ====
The [[palmaris longus muscle]] is seen as a small tendon between the [[flexor carpi radialis]] and the [[flexor carpi ulnaris]], although it is not always present. The muscle is absent in about 14% of the population, however this varies greatly with ethnicity. It is believed that this muscle actively participated in the arboreal locomotion of primates, but currently has no function, because it does not provide more grip strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2014/178906 |pmid=24860810 |pmc=4016873 |title=Morphometric and Statistical Analysis of the Palmaris Longus Muscle in Human and Non-Human Primates |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2014 |pages=1-6 |year=2014 |last1=Aversi-Ferreira |first1=Roqueline A.

==== Torso ====
The [[pyramidalis muscle]] of the abdomen is a small and triangular muscle, anterior to the [[rectus abdominis]], and contained in the [[rectus sheath]]. It is absent in 20% of humans and when absent, the lower end of the rectus then becomes proportionately increased in size. Anatomical studies suggest that the forces generated by the pyramidalis muscles are relatively small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1447-073X.2007.00226.x |pmid=19159363 |pmc=3531545 |title=Architecture and fiber type of the pyramidalis muscle |journal=Anatomical Science International |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=294–7 |year=2008 |last1=Lovering |first1=Richard M. |last2=Anderson |first2=Larry D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] of the back has several sporadic [[Latissimus dorsi muscle#Variations|variations]]. One particular variant is the existence of the dorsoepitrochlearis or latissimocondyloideus muscle which is a muscle passing from the tendon of the latissimus dorsi to the long head of the [[triceps brachii]].

==== Leg ====
The [[plantaris muscle]] is composed of a thin muscle belly and a long thin tendon. The muscle belly is approximately {{convert|5|-|10|cm|inch|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} long, and is absent in 7–10% of the human population. It has some weak functionality in moving the knee and ankle but is generally considered redundant and is often used as a source of tendon for grafts. The long, thin tendon of the plantaris is humorously called "the freshman's nerve", as it is often mistaken for a nerve by first-year medical students.

==== Tongue ====
Another intriguing example of human vestigiality occurs in the tongue, specifically the chondroglossus muscle.  In a morphological study of 100 Japanese cadavers, it was found that 86% of fibers identified were solid and bundled in the appropriate way to facilitate speech and mastication.  The other 14% of fibers were short, thin and sparse – nearly useless, and thus concluded to be of vestigial origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0940-9602(02)80087-5 |pmid=12392330 |title=Morphological study of the human chondroglossus muscle in Japanese |journal=Annals of Anatomy - Anatomischer Anzeiger |volume=184 |issue=5 |pages=493–9 |year=2002 |last1=Ogata |first1=Shigemitsu |last2=Mine |first2=Kazuharu |last3=Tamatsu |first3=Yuichi |last4=Shimada |first4=Kazuyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breasts ===
[[Supernumerary nipple|Extra nipples]] or [[Accessory breast|breasts]] sometimes appear along the [[Milk line|mammary lines]] of humans, appearing as a remnant to mammalian ancestors who possessed more than two nipples or breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kajava | first1 = Y | year = 1915 | title = The proportions of supernumerary nipples in the Finnish population | url = | journal = Duodecim | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 143–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0971-6866.108051 |pmid=23716953 |pmc=3656534 |title=Seven nipples in a male: World′s second case report |journal=Indian Journal of Human Genetics |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=373–5 |year=2012 |last1=Goyal |first1=Tarang |last2=Bakshi |first2=SK |last3=Varshney |first3=Anupam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ==
[[File:Gaensehaut.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Goose bumps]] are an example of a vestigial human reaction to stress.]]
Humans also bear some vestigial behaviors and reflexes.&lt;ref name=Spinney&gt;{{Citation|title=Remnants of evolution |author=Laura Spinney |journal=New Scientist |year=2008 |volume=198 |issue=2656 |pages=42–45 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(08)61231-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the formation of [[goose bumps]] in humans under [[stress (medicine)|stress]] is a vestigial [[reflex action|reflex]]; a possible function in human evolutionary ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger and scaring off predators.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles.

The [[palmar grasp reflex]] is supported to be a vestigial behavior in human infants. When placing a finger or object to the palm of an infant, it will securely grasp it. This grasp is found to be rather strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology |edition=fifth |author=Peter Gray |year=2007 |page=66 |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-0617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[infant]]s—37% according to a 1932 study—are able to support their own weight from a rod,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OzL2Bgvf9Q0C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22chancy+and+mcgraw+(31)+investigated+the+reflex+in+the+125+infants%22%22 Behavior Development in Infants] (via Google Books) by Evelyn Dewey, citing a study "Reflexes and other motor activities in newborn infants: a report of 125 cases as a preliminary study of infant behavior" published in the ''Bull. Neurol. Inst. New York'', 1932, Vol. 2, pp. 1–56.&lt;/ref&gt;, although there is no way they can cling to their mother. The grasp is also evident in the feet too. When a baby is sitting down, its prehensile feet assume a curled-in posture, similar to that observed in an adult chimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |pages=85–86 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archetype: A Natural History of the Self |author=Anthony Stevens |year=1982 |page=87 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7100-0980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ancestral primate would have had sufficient body hair to which an infant could cling unlike modern humans, thus allowing its mother to escape from danger, such as climbing up a tree in the presence of a predator without having to occupy her hands holding her baby.

It has been proposed that the [[hiccup]] is an evolutionary remnant of earlier [[amphibian]] [[respiratory system|respiration]].&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.10224 |pmid=12539245 |title=A phylogenetic hypothesis for the origin of hiccough |journal=BioEssays |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=182–8 |year=2003 |last1=Straus |first1=C. |last2=Vasilakos |first2=K. |last3=Wilson |first3=R.

A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphibians such as tadpoles gulp air and water across their gills via a rather simple motor reflex akin to mammalian hiccuping. The motor pathways that enable hiccuping form early during fetal development, before the motor pathways that enable normal lung ventilation form. Thus, according to recapitulation theory, the hiccup is evolutionarily antecedent to modern lung respiration. Additionally, they point out that hiccups and amphibian gulping are inhibited by elevated CO{{Sub2}} and may be stopped by [[GABAB receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] agonists, illustrating a possible shared physiology and evolutionary heritage. These proposals may explain why premature infants spend 2.5% of their time hiccuping, possibly gulping like amphibians, as their lungs are not yet fully formed. Fetal intrauterine hiccups are of two types. The physiological type occurs before 28 weeks after conception and tend to last five to ten minutes. These hiccups are part of fetal development and are associated with the myelination of the [[phrenic nerve]], which primarily controls the thoracic diaphragm. The phylogeny hypothesis explains how the hiccup reflex might have evolved, and if there is not an explanation, it may explain hiccups as an evolutionary remnant, held-over from our amphibious ancestors.
This hypothesis has been questioned because of the existence of the afferent loop of the reflex, the fact that it does not explain the reason for glottic closure, and because the very short contraction of the hiccup is unlikely to have a significant strengthening effect on the slow-twitch muscles of respiration.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for most of this paragraph.

There are also vestigial molecular structures in humans, which are no longer in use but may indicate common ancestry with other species. One example of this is [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]], a gene that is functional in most other mammals and produces an [[enzyme]] that synthesizes [[vitamin C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-4165(99)00123-3 |pmid=10572964 |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects |volume=1472 |issue=1–2 |pages=408–11 |year=1999 |last1=Ohta |first1=Yuriko |last2=Nishikimi |first2=Morimitsu }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans and other members of the suborder [[Haplorrhini]], a mutation disabled the gene and made it unable to produce the enzyme. However, the remains of the gene are still present in the [[human genome]] as a vestigial genetic sequence called a [[pseudogene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishikimi M, Fukuyama R, Minoshima S, Shimizu N, Yagi K |title=Cloning and chromosomal mapping of the human nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the enzyme for L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis missing in man |journal=J.

'''IC 2233''', also known as '''UGC 4278''', is a [[spiral galaxy]] lying in the constellation of [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]]. IC 2233 is located between 26 and 40 million light-years away from [[Earth]]. A comparatively quiet galaxy with a low rate of star formation (less than one solar mass every twenty years), it was long thought to be possibly interacting with the [[NGC 2537|Bear's Paw galaxy]]. However, this is now considered highly unlikely as [[Radio astronomy|radio]] observations with the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] showed the two galaxies lie at different distances.&lt;ref name="Matthews 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Matthews, Lynn D. |author2=Uson, Juan M. |date=2007|title=H I Imaging Observations of Superthin Galaxies.

'''Jill Cornell Tarter''' (born January 16, 1944) is an American [[astronomer]] best known for her work on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]). Tarter is the former [[wikt:director|director]] of the Center for SETI Research, holding the [[Bernard M. Oliver]] Chair for SETI at the [[SETI Institute]].{{R|"SETI"}}{{R|"NYT-20120618"}}{{R|"foxnews52212"}}

==Early life and education==
Tarter grew up in [[New York (state)|New York State]], and graduated from [[Eastchester High School]] in 1961 (and was elected to its alumni association's hall of fame in 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EASTCHESTER HS/Alumni Association HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES|url=https://district.eastchesterschools.org/m/file.php/1/Hall_of_Fame_inductees_1.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his death when she was twelve years old, Tarter's father was an early inspiration by encouraging her curiosity when she resisted suggestions that she follow pursuits considered more appropriate for a girl and announced that she wanted to be an engineer. On family trips to Florida she with her father would look up at the dark skies and wonder who or what might be out there.{{R|"Scoles"}}{{R|"Cosier"}}

Tarter earned a Bachelor of Engineering Physics degree as an undergraduate at [[Cornell University]] and as the only woman in the engineering program. Her professional interest in astronomy emerged as she pursued a [[Master's degree]] and [[PhD]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]].{{R|"Scoles"}}{{R|"Cosier"}}{{R|"Koren"}} It was in her PhD thesis where she coined the term "[[brown dwarf]]" while researching small-mass objects that fail to stably fuse hydrogen.{{R|"JillTarter2014"}}

==Astronomy career==
[[File:Jill Tarter Life Beyond Earth CSICon 2016.jpg|thumb|"Life Beyond Earth" [[CSICon]] 2016]]
Tarter has worked on a number of major scientific projects, most relating to the search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. As a [[graduate student]], she was inspired to do SETI research by the [[Project Cyclops|Cyclops Report]]. [[Charles Stuart Bowyer|Stuart Bowyer]] gave her the report to read when Bowyer discovered that Tarter could program the then-outdated [[PDP-8|PDP-8/S]] computer that had been donated by Jack Welch for Bowyer's SETI project at [[Hat Creek Radio Observatory]]. She worked with Bowyer on the radio-search project [[SERENDIP]] and created the corresponding [[backronym]], "Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations".{{R|"Scoles"}} She was project scientist for NASA's [[High Resolution Microwave Survey]] (HRMS) in 1992 and 1993 and subsequently director of [[Project Phoenix (SETI)|Project Phoenix]] (HRMS reconfigured) under the auspices of the SETI Institute. She was co-creator with [[Margaret Turnbull]] of the [[HabCat]] in 2002, a principal component of Project Phoenix. Tarter has published dozens of technical papers and lectures extensively both on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the need for proper science education. She had spent 35 years in the quest for extraterrestrial life when she announced her retirement in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Jacqui|title=Silent witness|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405171149/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/print/3593/silent-witness?page=0%2C0|website=COSMOS|publisher=Cosmos Magazine|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{R|"foxnews52212"}}{{R|"NYT-20120618"}}

On October 20, 2006, Tarter appeared on the [[Point of Inquiry]] podcast to discuss the question: "Are we alone?" Tarter stated, "Humans will have a different view about being human if and when we know the answer to the 'Are we alone?' question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

In 2011, Tarter delivered a talk, "Intelligent Life in the Universe: Is Anybody Out There?", at the first [[Starmus Festival]] in the Canary Islands. The Festival, founded by astronomer [[Garik Israelian]], was a blend of astronomy, allied sciences, music, and art. Tarter subsequently joined the Starmus Board of Directors, along with Israelian, astrophysicist and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] founding guitarist [[Brian May]], theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], and others. Her 2011 talk was published in the book ''Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/starmus-festival-and-stephen-hawking-launch-the-book-starmus-50-years-of-man-in-space-274263251.html|title=Starmus Festival and Stephen Hawking Launch the Book "Starmus, 50 Years of Man in Space"|first=Starmus Festival and Promotur-Canary Islands Tourism|last=Board|publisher=|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarter is a member of the [[CuriosityStream]] Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CuriosityStream Advisory Board|url=https://curiositystream.com/board|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the [[Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013]] was introduced into Congress. Tarter was listed by one commentator as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass.&lt;ref name=wiredMay&gt;{{cite news|last=Marlow|first=Jeffrey|title=The Science Laureate of the United States|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/05/the-science-laureate-of-the-united-states/|accessdate=12 September 2013|newspaper=[[Wired Magazine]]|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, science journalist Sarah Scoles published a biography of Tarter and a history of SETI, called ''Making Contact: Jill Tarter and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pegasusbooks.com/books/making-contact-9781681774411-hardcover|title=Making Contact|website=pegasusbooks.com|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Tarter's astronomical work is illustrated in [[Carl Sagan]]'s novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]''. In the [[Contact (1997 American film)|film version of ''Contact'']], the protagonist Ellie Arroway is played by [[Jodie Foster]]. Tarter conversed with the actress for months before and during filming, and Arroway was "largely based" on Tarter's work.{{R|"Space.com"}} She has also been featured in John Boswell's ''Symphony of Science'' music video, "The Poetry of Reality (An Anthem for Science)".&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell (melodysheep), {{YouTube|9Cd36WJ79z4|"The Poetry of Reality (An Anthem for Science)"}}, February 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to [[SETIcon|Seticon II]] in 2012 Tarter addressed concerns about alien invasion, like those seen in [[Science fiction film|science fiction films]], in particular those expressed by [[Stephen Hawking]]. Correlated with Hawking's reservations is his belief that humans should not attempt to broadcast signals in order to contact alien civilizations ([[Active SETI]]). Tarter thinks that aliens evolved enough to communicate with and travel to Earth will be long-lived enough to have needed to grow beyond violent tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orwig|first1=Jessica|title=A world leading scientist on the search for extraterrestrials pointed out a flaw in Stephen Hawking's fear of finding intelligent aliens|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jill-tarter-says-stephen-hawking-is-wrong-about-aliens-2016-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{R|"SETIcon"}}
: “Often the aliens of science fiction say more about us than they do about themselves.... While Sir Stephen Hawking warned that alien life might try to conquer or colonize Earth, I respectfully disagree. If aliens were able to visit Earth that would mean they would have technological capabilities sophisticated enough not to need slaves, food, or other planets. If aliens were to come here it would be simply to explore. Considering the age of the Universe, we probably wouldn’t be their first extraterrestrial encounter, either. We should look at movies like ‘Men in Black III,’ ‘Prometheus’ and ‘Battleship’ as great entertainment and metaphors for our own fears, but we should not consider them harbingers of alien visitation.”{{R|"SETIcon"}}

The '''Journal Article Tag Suite''' ('''JATS''') is an [[XML]] format used to [[Metadata|describe]]  [[scientific literature]] published online. It is a [[technical standard]] developed by the [[National Information Standards Organization]] (NISO) and approved by the [[American National Standards Institute]] with the code '''Z39.96-2012'''.

The NISO project was a continuation of the work done by [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NLM/NCBI]], and popularized by the NLM's [[PubMed Central]] as an [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] for archiving and interchange of [[open-access journal|scientific open-access journals]] and its contents with [[XML]].

With the NISO standardization the NLM initiative has gained a wider reach, and several other repositories, such as [[SciELO]] and [[Redalyc]], adopted the XML formatting for [[Scientific literature|scientific articles]].

The JATS provides a set of XML elements and attributes for describing the textual and graphical content of journal articles
as well as some non-article material such as letters, editorials, and book and product reviews.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 {{ISSN|1041-5653}}. See [http://www.niso.org/standards/z39-96-2012 z39.96-2012.pdf] at www.niso.org/standards/z39-96-2012&lt;/ref&gt;
JATS allows for descriptions of the full article content or just the article header metadata; 
and allows other kinds of contents, including research and non-research articles, letters, editorials, and book and product reviews.

== History ==
Since its introduction, NCBI's NLM Archiving and Interchange [[Document type definition|DTD]] suite has become the [[De facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] for journal article markup in [[Academic publishing|scholarly publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3227009 | pmid=22140303 | doi=10.3998/3336451.0014.106 | volume=14 | title=NISO Z39.96The Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS): What Happened to the NLM DTDs? | year=2011 | journal=J Electron Publ | last1 = Beck | first1 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of NISO JATS, it has been elevated to a [[De jure|true standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zimmerman |first=Sara |date=2012 |title= The new NISO journal Article Tag Suite standard |website=Zeeba.tv |url=http://river-valley.zeeba.tv/the-new-niso-journal-article-tag-suite-standard/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even without public data interchange, the advantages of NISO JATS adoption affords publishers in terms of streamlining production workflows and optimizing system interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Paul |last1=Donohoe |first2=Jenny |last2=Sherman |first3=Ashwin |last3=Mistry |title=The Long Road to JATS |date=2015 |conference=JATS-Con 2015 |book-title=Journal Article Tag Suite Conference (JATS-Con) Proceedings 2015 |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information |location=Bethesda, MD |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279831/ |conference-url=http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con/2015/schedule2015.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Tommie |last1=Usdin |first2=Deborah Aleyne |last2=Lapeyre |first3=Carter M. |last3=Glass |title=Superimposing Business Rules on JATS |date=2015 |conference=JATS-Con 2015 |book-title=Journal Article Tag Suite Conference (JATS-Con) Proceedings 2015 |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information |location=Bethesda, MD |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279902/ |conference-url=http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con/2015/schedule2015.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical scope==
By design, this is a model for journal articles, such as the typical research article found in an [[International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers|STM journal]], and not a model for complete journals.&lt;ref name=JATSIntro&gt;{{cite web |title=General Introduction |date=August 2012 |website=Journal Publishing Tag Library NISO JATS Version 1.0 |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information |url=http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.0/n-7w00.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tag sets ===
[[File:Jats-the3specs.png|thumb|The  3 specifications. Due to their color-coded documentation, are colloquially referred to by color.]]
There are three tag sets:
; Journal ''Archiving'' and Interchange ({{color|green|Green}})
: "The most permissive of the Tag Sets,"&lt;ref name=JATSHome&gt;{{cite web |title=JATS: Journal Article Tag Suite |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information |url=http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily intended for the capture and archiving of extant journal data.
; Journal ''Publishing'' ({{color|blue|Blue}})
: "A moderately prescriptive Tag Set,"&lt;ref name=JATSHome/&gt; intended for general use in journal production and publication.
: Formally this model is a subset of the ''Archiving'' model. This is the most frequently used JATS variant.
; Article ''Authoring'' ({{color|orange|Orange}})
: "The most prescriptive [tightest and smallest] of the Tag Sets,"&lt;ref name=JATSHome/&gt; intended for the relatively lightweight creation of journal articles valid to JATS.
: Formally this model a subset of the ''Publishing'' model.

[[Document type definition]]s (also released in the form of [[RELAX NG]] and [[XML schema]]) define each set and incorporate other standards such as [[MathML]] and XHTML Tables (although not in the [[XHTML]] [[XML namespace|namespace]]).

=== Document structure ===
JATS ''Publishing'' set defines a document that is a top-level component of a journal such as an article, a book or product review, or a letter to the editor. Each such document is composed of front matter (required) and up to three optional parts.&lt;ref name=JATSIntro/&gt; These must appear in the following order:
; Front matter
: The article front matter contains the metadata for the article (also called article header information), for example, the article title, the journal in which it appears, the date and issue of publication for that issue of that journal, a copyright statement, etc. Both article-level and issue-level metadata (in the element &lt;code&gt;&lt;article-meta&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and journal-level metadata (in the element &lt;code&gt;&lt;journal-meta&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) may be captured.
; Body (of the article)
: The body of the article is the main textual and graphic content of the article. This usually consists of paragraphs and sections, which may themselves contain figures, tables, sidebars (boxed text), etc. The body of the article is optional to accommodate those repositories that just keep article header information and do not tag the textual content.
; Back matter
: If present, the article back matter contains information that is ancillary to the main text, such as a glossary, appendix, or list of cited references.
; Floating material
: A publisher may choose to place all the floating objects in an article and its back matter (such as tables, figures, boxed text sidebars, etc.) into a separate container element outside the narrative flow for convenience of processing.&lt;ref name=JATSIntro/&gt;

Following the front, body, back, and floating material, there may be either one or more responses to the article or one or more subordinate articles.&lt;ref name=JATSIntro/&gt;

== Example ==
This is the minimal article's structure,

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE article
  PUBLIC "-//NLM//DTD JATS (Z39.96) Journal Publishing DTD v1.0 20120330//EN"
         "JATS-journalpublishing1.dtd"
&gt;
&lt;article dtd-version="1.0" article-type="article" specific-use="migrated"
 xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" 
&gt;
  &lt;front&gt;...&lt;/front&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;back&gt;...&lt;/back&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;DOCTYPE&lt;/code&gt; header is optional,  a legacy from [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]] and [[Document type definition|DTD]]-oriented [[XML schema#Validation|validators]]. The &lt;code&gt;dtd-version&lt;/code&gt; attribut can be used even without a DTD header.

The root element &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt; is common for any version of JATS or "JATS family", as NLM DTDs.  The rules for &lt;code&gt;front&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; and  &lt;code&gt;back&lt;/code&gt; tags validation, depends on the JATS version, but all versions have similar structure, with good compatibility in a range of years. The evolution of the schema preserves an overall stability.

Less common, "only &lt;code&gt;front&lt;/code&gt;", "only &lt;code&gt;front&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;back&lt;/code&gt;" variations are also used for other finalities than full-content representation. The general article composition (as an [[Backus–Naur form|DTD-content expression]]) is
&lt;pre&gt;
   (front, body?, back?, floats-group?, (sub-article* | response*))
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Tools ==
There are a variety of tools for create, edit, convert and transform JATS.
They range from simple forms&lt;ref&gt;A 2012's semanticpublishing.wordpress.com [http://semanticpublishing.wordpress.com/2012/12/20/jats-metadata-entry-form/ JATS Metadata Input Form].&lt;/ref&gt; to complete conversion automation:

=== Conversion ===
;To JATS: Take as input a scientific document, and, with some human support, produce a JATS output.
* [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] ([[LibreOffice]]) and [[MS Word]] documents to JATS:
** ''OxGarage'':&lt;ref name="oxga"&gt;http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/oxgarage/ ([http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/OxGarage documentation])&lt;/ref&gt; can convert documents from various formats into "National Library of Medicine (NLM) DTD 3.0".
** ''meTypeset'': meTypeset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/MartinPaulEve/meTypeset|title=MartinPaulEve/meTypeset|work=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; "is a fork of the OxGarage stack" "to convert from Microsoft Word .docx format to NLM/JATS-XML".
** ''eXtyles'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inera.com/extyles-products/extyles|title=eXtyles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; automates time-consuming aspects of document editing in Microsoft Word and exports to JATS XML (as well as many other DTDs).
* [[Markdown]] to JATS: [[pandoc]]'s "pandoc-jats" plugin.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats  ([http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/12/12/from-markdown-to-jats-xml-in-one-step/ how-to and explain])&lt;/ref&gt; Pandoc 2.0 can convert a number of input formats to JATS.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pandoc-discuss/09XJwmrTXjI/hNKYso_5AgAJ&lt;/ref&gt;
* PDF to JATS: this is a very difficult problem to solve.  Success depends on how well structured your PDFs are and, for batch conversion, how consistently structured your PDFs are.
**  Shabash Merops&lt;ref&gt;http://shabash.net/merops/automatic_text_editing.php&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ''Public Knowledge Project''&lt;ref name="pkp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pkp.sfu.ca/|title=Public Knowledge Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developing a pipeline for converting PDF to JATS.  It will include use of ''pdfx''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Constantin | first1 = S.Pettifer | year = 2013 | title = PDFX: fully-automated PDF-to-XML conversion of scientific literature | url = | journal = Proceedings of the 2013 ACM symposium on Document engineering - DocEng ''13| volume = | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1145/2494266.2494271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Editors ===
* JATS Framework for oXygen XML Editor:  users of oXygen XML Editor and oXygen XML Author can now install support for current versions of NISO JATS (and as a bonus, NLM BITS). Based on an identifier given in a DOCTYPE declaration, oXygen will detect that you are editing a JATS document and provide stylesheets and utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/wendellpiez/oXygenJATSframework|title=wendellpiez/oXygenJATSframework|work=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== JATS central repositories  ==
As NISO JATS began the ''de facto'' and ''de juri'' standard for [[open access journal]]s, the [[scientific community]] has  adopted the JATS repositories as a kind of [[legal deposit]], more valuable than the [[Digital library|traditional digital libraries]] where only a PDF version is stored. [[Open knowledge]] need richer and structured formats as JATS: PDF and JATS must be certified as "same content", and the set "PDF+JATS" forming the unit of legal deposit. 
List of ''JATS repositories'' and its contained:

* [[PubMed Central]]: (please check these numbers)
** US PubMed Central: in 2016 ~3.8 million articles&lt;ref&gt;PMC home, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Europe PubMed Central]]: in 2016 ~3,7 million articles &lt;ref&gt;PMC Europe, "about" page, http://europepmc.org/About&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[PubMed Central Canada]]: in 2013 ~2.6 million articles.&lt;ref&gt;PMC-Canadá FAQ, http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/static/aboutUs/#q6&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[SciELO]]: in 2016 ~0.6 million articles&lt;ref&gt;SciELO home, http://www.scielo.org/php/index.php?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

These repositories do overlap and the same article can be held by more than one repository.

== Alternatives and semantic ==
There are some effort and experiments using [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] conversion in the 2012,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK100491/&lt;/ref&gt; with no impact in the JATS community.
  
Later, in ~2016, for [[Semantic Web]] context, with [[Schema.org|SchemaOrg]] initiative, the class [http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle ScholarlyArticle] was defined, receiving better reception. It  is an initial "JATS-like standardization" for RDF contexts of use.

A '''Le Fort fracture of the skull''' is a classic transfacial [[bone fracture|fracture]] of the midface, involving the [[maxillary bone]] and surrounding structures in either a horizontal, pyramidal or transverse direction. The hallmark of Lefort fractures is traumatic ''pterygomaxillary separation'', which signifies fractures between the [[Pterygoid processes of the sphenoid|pterygoid plates]], horseshoe shaped bony protuberances which extend from the inferior margin of the [[maxilla]], and the maxillary sinuses. Continuity of this structure is a [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]] for stability of the midface, involvement of which impacts surgical management of trauma victims, as it requires fixation to a horizontal bar of the [[frontal bone]]. The pterygoid plates lie posterior to the upper dental row, or alveolar ridge, when viewing the face from an anterior view. The fractures are named after French [[surgeon]] [[René Le Fort]] (1869–1951), who discovered the fracture patterns by examining crush injuries in [[cadavers]].&lt;ref name="Allsop02"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Allsop D, Kennett K |veditors=Nahum AM, Melvin J |chapter=Skull and facial bone trauma| title=Accidental injury: Biomechanics and prevention |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2002 |pages=254–258 |isbn=0-387-98820-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4l5fopEI0EC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=facial+trauma#PPA255,M1 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==

'''Lefort I''' — Slight swelling of the upper lip, [[ecchymosis]] is present in the buccal sulcus beneath each zygomatic arch, malocclusion, mobility of teeth. Impacted type of fractures may be almost immobile and it is only by grasping the maxillary teeth and applying a little firm pressure that a characteristic grate can be felt which is diagnostic of the fracture. Percussion of upper teeth results in cracked pot sound. Guérin's sign is present characterised by ecchymosis in the region of greater palatine vessels.

'''Lefort II''' and '''Lefort III''' (common) — Gross edema of soft tissue over the middle third of the face, bilateral circumorbital ecchymosis, bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage, epistaxis, CSF rhinorrhoea, dish face deformity, diplopia, enophthalmos, cracked pot sound.

'''Lefort II''' — Step deformity at infraorbital margin, mobile mid face, anesthesia or paresthesia of cheek.

'''Lefort III''' — Tenderness and separation at frontozygomatic suture, lengthening of face, depression of ocular levels ([[enophthalmos]]), hooding of eyes, and tilting of occlusal plane, an imaginary curved plane between the edges of the incisors and the tips of the posterior teeth. As a result, there is gagging on the side of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22964406|year=2012|author1=Lo Casto|first1=A|title=Imaging evaluation of facial complex strut fractures|journal=Seminars in Ultrasound, CT and MRI|volume=33|issue=5|pages=396–409|last2=Priolo|first2=G.

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:LeFort109M.jpg|thumb|left|A 3-D CT reconstruction showing a LeFort type 1 fracture ( fracture line is marked by an arrow )]]
Diagnosis is suspected by physical exam and history, in which, classically, the [[hard palate|hard]] and [[soft palate]] of the midface are mobile with respect to the remainder of facial structures. This finding can be inconsistent due to the midfacial [[bleeding]] and [[edema|swelling]] that typically accompany such injuries, and so confirmation is usually needed by [[x-ray|radiograph]] or [[computed tomography|CT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23233885|pmc=3518003|year=2012|author1=Kim|first1=S.

=== Classification ===
{{double image|right|LeFort1e.png|120|LeFort1a.png|150|LeFort I fracture}}
There are three types of Le Fort fractures. As the classification increases, the anatomic level of the maxillary fracture ascends from inferior to superior with respect to the maxilla:

*'''Le Fort I fracture''' (horizontal), otherwise known as a ''floating palate'', may result from a force of injury directed low on the maxillary [[Alveolar ridge|alveolar rim]], or upper dental row, in a downward direction. The essential component of these fractures, in addition to pterygoid plate involvement, is involvement of the [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] [[Anterior nasal aperture|bony margin of the nasal opening]]. They also involve the medial and lateral buttresses, or walls, of the [[maxillary sinus]], traveling through the face just above the [[alveolar ridge]] of the upper dental row. At the midline, the inferior nasal septum is involved. Historically, it has also been referred to as a [[Alphonse Guérin|Guérin]] fracture, although this name is less commonly used in practice.

{{double image|right|LeFort2b.png|120|LeFort2a.png|150|LeFort II fracture}}
*'''Le Fort II fracture''' (pyramidal) may result from a blow to the lower or mid maxillary area. In addition to pterygoid plate disruption, their distinguishing component is involvement of [[orbit (anatomy)|inferior orbital rim]]. When viewed from the front, the fracture is classically shaped like a pyramid. It extends from the nasal bridge at or below the nasofrontal suture through the superior medial [[buttress|wall]] of the maxilla, inferolaterally through the [[lacrimal gland|lacrimal]] bones which contain the tear ducts, and inferior orbital floor through or near the [[infraorbital foramen]].

{{double image|right|LeFort3b.png|120|LeFort3a.png|150|LeFort III fracture}}
*'''Le Fort III fracture''' (transverse), otherwise known as ''craniofacial dissociation'', may follow impact to the nasal bridge or upper maxilla. The salient feature of these fractures, beyond pterygoid plate involvement, is that they invariably involve the [[zygomatic arch]], or cheek bone.  These fractures begin at the nasofrontal and frontomaxillary sutures and extend posteriorly along the medial wall of the orbit, through the nasolacrimal groove and [[ethmoid sinus|ethmoid air cells]]. The [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] is thickened posteriorly, limiting fracture extension into the optic canal. Instead, the fracture continues along the orbital floor and infraorbital fissure, continuing through the lateral orbital wall to the zygomaticofrontal junction and zygomatic arch. Within the nose, the fracture extends through the base of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid air cells, the [[vomer]], which are both part of the nasal septum. As with the other fractures, it also involves the junction of the pterygoids with the maxillary sinuses. [[CSF rhinorrhea]], or leakage of the nutrient laden fluid that bathes the brain, is more commonly seen with these injuries due to ethmoid air cell disruption, as the air cells are located immediately beneath the skull base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23322824|year=2013|author1=Winegar|first1=B. A.|title=Spectrum of critical imaging findings in complex facial skeletal trauma|journal=RadioGraphics|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–19|last2=Murillo|first2=H|last3=Tantiwongkosi|first3=B|doi=10.1148/rg.331125080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment is surgical, and usually is able to be performed once life-threatening injuries are stabilized, to allow the patient to survive the general anesthesia needed for [[maxillofacial surgery]]. First a ''frontal bar'' is used, which refers to the thickened frontal bone above the frontonasal sutures and the superior orbital rim. The facial bones are suspended from the bar by open reduction and internal fixation with [[titanium]] plates and screws, and each fracture is fixed, first at its superior attachment to the bar, then at the inferior attachment to the displaced bone. For stability, the zygomaticofrontal suture is usually replaced first, and the palate and alveolar ridge are usually fixed last. Finally, after the horizontal and vertical maxillary buttresses are stabilized, the orbital fractures are fixed last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23348288|year=2013|author1=Chung|first1=K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1307">In [[botany]], a '''light curve''' shows the [[photosynthetic]] response of leaf tissue or algal communities to varying light intensities. The shape of the curve illustrates the principle of [[limiting factor]]s; in low light levels, the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of [[chlorophyll]] and the efficiency of the [[light-dependent reaction]]s, but in higher light levels it is limited by the efficiency of [[RuBisCo]] and the availability of [[carbon dioxide]]. The point on the curve where these two differing slopes meet is called the light saturation point and is where the light-dependent reactions are producing more [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] than can be utilized by the [[light-independent reaction]]s. Since photosynthesis is also limited by ambient carbon dioxide levels, light curves are often repeated at several different constant carbon dioxide concentrations.&lt;ref name="2a"&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1073/pnas.22.8.504 | last= Smith | first= E.L. |date=August 1936 |title= Photosynthesis in Relation to Light and Carbon Dioxide |journal= PNAS | pmid= 16577734|volume=22 |issue=8 | pmc= 1079215 |pages=504–511 |id= |quote= |bibcode = 1936PNAS...22..504S | jstor=86299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Tables of natural history, from [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]
'''Natural history''' is a domain of inquiry involving [[organism]]s including [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s in their environment; leaning more towards [[observation]]al than [[experiment]]al methods of study. A person who studies natural history is called a '''naturalist''' or '''natural historian'''.

Natural history encompasses [[Scientific method|scientific research]] but is not limited to it.&lt;ref&gt;With ''natural history'' articles more often published today in [[List of science magazines|science magazines]] than in [[scientific journal|academic journals]].([http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history Natural History ''WordNet Search, princeton.edu''].&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic study of any category of [[nature|natural]] objects or organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{Citation |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while it dates from studies in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]] and the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|mediaeval Arabic world]], through to European [[Renaissance]] naturalists working in near isolation, today's natural history is a [[cross discipline]] umbrella of many specialty sciences; e.g., [[geobiology]] has a strong multi-disciplinary nature.

==Definitions==
===Before 1900===
The meaning of the English term "natural history" (a [[calque]] of the [[Latin]] ''historia naturalis'') has narrowed progressively with time; while, by contrast, the meaning of the related term "nature" has widened (see also [[#History|History]] below).

In [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], "natural history" covered essentially anything connected with [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], or which used materials drawn from nature, such as [[Pliny the Elder]]'s [[Natural History (Pliny)|encyclopedia of this title]], published [[circa]] 77 to 79 AD, which covers [[astronomy]], [[geography]], humans and their [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[superstition]], as well as animals and plants.

Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions: the [[humanities]] (primarily what is now known as [[classics]]) and [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]], with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment. The study of nature revived in the [[Renaissance]], and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge, itself divided into descriptive natural history and  [[natural philosophy]], the analytical study of nature. In modern terms, natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], while natural history included the [[biology|biological]] and [[geology|geological]] sciences. The two were strongly associated. During the heyday of the [[gentleman scientist]]s, many people contributed to both fields, and early papers in both were commonly read at professional [[Academy of Sciences|science society]] meetings such as the [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] – both founded during the seventeenth century.

Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives, such as Linnaeus' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koerner |first=Lisbet |authorlink=Lisbet Rausing |title=Linnaeus: Nature and Nation |year=1999 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-09745-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted the development of geology to help find useful [[mineral]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Barnes and Steven Shapin, "Natural order: historical studies of scientific culture", Sage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1900===
Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources, and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field, creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them. For example, while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study, it can also be defined as a body of knowledge, and as a craft or a practice, in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lowe Fleischner, ''The Way of Natural History'', Trinity University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lycee Michelet Vanves bibliotheque collection histoire naturelle.jpg|thumb|left|A natural history collection in a French public secondary school]]
Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment, as seen in this definition by Marston Bates: "Natural history is the study of animals and Plants – of organisms. ... I like to think, then, of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual – of what plants and animals do, how they react to each other and their environment, how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities"&lt;ref&gt;Marston Bates, ''The nature of natural history'', Scribners, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and this more recent definition by D.S. Wilcove and T. Eisner: "The close observation of organisms—their origins, their evolution, their behavior, and their relationships with other species".&lt;ref&gt;D. S Wilcove and T. Eisner, "The impending extinction of natural history," Chronicle of Higher Education 15 (2000): B24&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on organisms in their environment is also echoed by H.W. Greene and J.B. Losos: "Natural history focuses on where organisms are and what they do in their environment, including interactions with other organisms. It encompasses changes in internal states insofar as they pertain to what organisms do".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Greene and J. B. Losos, "Systematics, Natural-History, and Conservation – Field Biologists Must Fight a Public-Image Problem," Bioscience 38 (1988): 458–462&lt;/ref&gt;

Some definitions go further, focusing on direct observation of organisms in their environment, both past and present, such as this one by G.A. Bartholomew: "A student of natural history, or a naturalist, studies the world by observing plants and animals directly. Because organisms are functionally inseparable from the environment in which they live and because their structure and function cannot be adequately interpreted without knowing some of their evolutionary history, the study of natural history embraces the study of fossils as well as physiographic and other aspects of the physical environment".&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Bartholomew, "The Role of Natural History in Contemporary Biology", Bioscience 36 (1986): 324–329&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread in many definitions of natural history is the inclusion of a descriptive component, as seen in a recent definition by H.W. Greene: "Descriptive ecology and ethology".&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Greene, "Organisms in nature as a central focus for biology", Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20 (2005):23–27&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have argued for a more expansive view of natural history, including S. Herman, who defines the field as "the scientific study of plants and animals in their natural environments. It is concerned with levels of organization from the individual organism to the ecosystem, and stresses identification, life history, distribution, abundance, and inter-relationships.

It often and appropriately includes an esthetic component",&lt;ref&gt;S. G Herman, "Wildlife biology and natural history: time for a reunion", The Journal of wildlife management 66, no. 4 (2002): 933–946&lt;/ref&gt; and T. Fleischner, who defines the field even more broadly, as "A practice of intentional, focused attentiveness and receptivity to the more-than-human world, guided by honesty and accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Fleischner, "Natural history and the spiral of offering", Wild Earth 11, no. 3/4 (2002): 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions explicitly include the arts in the field of natural history, and are aligned with the broad definition outlined by B. Lopez, who defines the field as the "Patient interrogation of a landscape" while referring to the natural history knowledge of the Eskimo ([[Inuit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barry Lopez, ''Arctic Dreams'', Vintage, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different framework for natural history, covering a similar range of themes, is also implied in the scope of work encompassed by many leading [[natural history museum]]s, which often include elements of anthropology, geology, paleontology and astronomy along with botany and zoology,&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History, [http://www.amnh.org/about/ Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145807/http://www.amnh.org/about/ |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field Museum, [http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103185243/http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or include both cultural and natural components of the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Natural History Museum, [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/index.html Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plurality of definitions for this field has been recognized as both a weakness and a strength, and a range of definitions have recently been offered by practitioners in a recent collection of views on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://declinetorebirth.org/conversations/an-accepted-way-of-viewing-art An Accepted Way of Viewing Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Blackberry]] from the 6th century ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'' manuscript]]
Natural history begins with [[Aristotle]] and other ancient philosophers who analyzed the diversity of the natural world. Natural history was understood by [[Pliny the Elder]] to cover anything that could be found in the world, including living things, geology, astronomy, technology, art and humanity.&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;{{cite book | title=Natural History: A Selection | publisher=Penguin Classics | author=Pliny the Elder | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-14-044413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' was written between 50 and 70 AD by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], a Roman physician of Greek origin. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted in the [[Renaissance]], making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books.

From the [[ancient Greeks]] until the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]] and other 18th century naturalists, a major concept of natural history was the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]], an arrangement of minerals, vegetables, more primitive forms of animals, and more complex life forms on a linear scale of supposedly increasing perfection, culminating in our species.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964&gt;{{citation |date=1964 | origyear=1936 |author=Arthur O. Lovejoy |authorlink=Arthur Oncken Lovejoy |title=The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u3HZjTpkTgC |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Natural history was basically static through the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe – although in the [[Arabic]] and [[Oriental]] world it proceeded at a much brisker pace. From the thirteenth century, the work of Aristotle was adapted rather rigidly into [[Christian philosophy]], particularly by [[Thomas Aquinas]], forming the basis for [[natural theology]]. During the Renaissance, scholars (herbalists and humanists, particularly) returned to direct observation of plants and animals for natural history, and many began to accumulate large collections of exotic specimens and unusual [[monster]]s. [[Leonhart Fuchs]] was one of the three founding fathers of botany, along with [[Otto Brunfels]] and [[Hieronymus Bock]]. Other important contributors to the field were [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Konrad Gesner]] (''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]''), [[Frederik Ruysch]], or [[Gaspard Bauhin]].&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;"[http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?category=Natural+History Natural History Timeline]". HistoryofScience.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid increase in the number of known organisms prompted many attempts at classifying and organizing species into [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]], culminating in the system of the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;ref name="natural"/&gt;

===Birth of scientific biology===&lt;!--off topic? Biology isn't NH--&gt;
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges Buffon]] is best remembered for his ''[[Histoire naturelle]]'', a 44 volume encyclopedia describing quadrupeds, birds, minerals and some science and technology. Reptiles and fish were covered in supplements by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]].]]&lt;!--not discussed in text, no refs!--&gt;
A significant contribution to English natural history was made by [[parson-naturalist]]s such as [[Gilbert White]], [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]], [[John George Wood]], and [[John Ray]], who wrote about plants, animals, and other aspects of nature. Many of these men wrote about nature to make the [[natural theology]] argument for the existence or goodness of God.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Armstrong|title=The English Parson-naturalist: A Companionship Between Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB0hEc4CN3wC|accessdate=31 March 2013|year=2000|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|isbn=978-0-85244-516-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Europe]], professional disciplines such as botany, geology, [[mycology]], [[palaeontology]], [[physiology]] and [[zoology]] were formed. ''Natural history'', formerly the main subject taught by college science professors, was increasingly scorned by scientists of a more specialized manner and relegated to an "amateur" activity, rather than a part of science proper. In Victorian Scotland it was believed that the study of natural history contributed to good mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |title='An aid to mental health': natural history, alienists and therapeutics in Victorian Scotland| author=Finnegan, Diarmid A. |year=2008 |volume=39 |pages=326–337 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2008.06.006| pmid=18761284| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in Britain and the United States, this grew into specialist hobbies such as the [[Ornithology|study of birds]], butterflies, seashells ([[malacology]]/[[conchology]]), beetles and wildflowers; meanwhile, scientists tried to define a unified discipline of biology (though with only partial success, at least until the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]). Still, the traditions of natural history continue to play a part in the study of biology, especially ecology (the study of natural systems involving living organisms and the inorganic components of the Earth's biosphere that support them), [[ethology]] (the scientific study of animal behavior), and [[evolutionary biology]] (the study of the relationships between life-forms over very long periods of time), and re-emerges today as integrative organismal biology.

Amateur collectors and natural history entrepreneurs played an important role in building the world's large natural history collections, such as the [[Natural History Museum, London]], and the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington D.C.

Three of the greatest English naturalists of the nineteenth century, [[Henry Walter Bates]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]—who all knew each other—each made natural history travels that took years, collected thousands of specimens, many of them new to science, and by their writings both advanced knowledge of "remote" parts of the world—the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], and the [[Malay archipelago]], among others—and in so doing helped to transform biology from a descriptive to a theory based science.

The understanding of "Nature" as "an organism and not as a mechanism" can be traced to the writings of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (Prussia, 1769–1859). Humboldt's copious writings and research were seminal influences for Charles Darwin, [[Simón Bolívar]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], and [[John Muir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Wulf]] (2015),''[[The Invention of Nature]]'', Knopf {{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
{{further|List of natural history museums}}
Natural history [[museum]]s, which evolved from [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]], played an important role in the emergence of professional biological disciplines and research programs. Particularly in the 19th century, scientists began to use their natural history collections as teaching tools for advanced students and the basis for their own [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] research.

==Societies==
[[File:Szczecin pomnik Jana Czekanowskiego.jpg|thumb|The monument of [[Jan Czekanowski]], a president of [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]] (1923–1924), in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]]]
The term "natural history" alone, or sometimes together with archaeology, forms the name of many national, regional and local natural history societies that maintain records for [[animal]]s (including [[birds]] (ornithology), [[insect]]s ([[entomology]]) and [[mammal]]s (mammalogy)), [[fungi]] ([[mycology]]), plants (botany) and other organisms. They may also have [[geological]] and [[microscope|microscopical]] sections.

Examples of these societies in Britain include the [[Natural History Society of Northumbria]] founded in 1829, [[London]] Natural History Society (1858), [[Birmingham Natural History Society]] (1859), [[British Entomological and Natural History Society]] founded in 1872, [[Glasgow]] Natural History Society, [[Manchester]] Microscopical and Natural History Society established in 1880, Whitby Naturalists' Club founded in 1913,&lt;ref name="whitbynaturalistsclub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitbynaturalists.co.uk |title=Whitby Naturalists' Club |publisher=whitbynaturalists.co.uk |accessdate=January 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarborough Field Naturalists' Society and the Sorby Natural History Society, [[Sheffield]], founded in 1918.&lt;ref name="WMBC-Oldest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older|title=Older Organisations|last=Mabbett|first=Andy|date=20 November 2010|publisher=[[West Midland Bird Club]]|accessdate=11 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523040849/http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older |archivedate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of natural history societies was also spurred due to the growth of British colonies in tropical regions with numerous new species to be discovered. Many [[civil servants]] took an interest in their new surroundings, sending specimens back to museums in [[UK|Britain]]. (See also: [[Indian natural history]])

Societies in other countries include the [[American Society of Naturalists]] and [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1959">As the tip of a plant [[shoot]] grows, new leaves are produced at regular time intervals if temperature is held constant. This time interval is termed the '''plastochron''' (or '''plastochrone''').&lt;ref name="Silk"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Silk | first=Wendy Kuhn | last2=Erickson | first2=Ralph O. | title=Kinematics of plant growth | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology| volume=76 | issue=4 | year=1979 | pages=481–501 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(79)90014-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''plastochrone index''' and the [[leaf plastochron index]] are ways of measuring the age of a plant dependent on morphological traits rather than on chronological age.{{clarify|date=November 2016}} Use of these indices removes differences caused by germination, developmental differences and exponential growth.

==Definitions==
The spatial pattern of the arrangement of leaves is called [[phyllotaxis|phyllotaxy]] whereas the time between successive leaf initiation events is called the plastochron and the rate of emergence from the [[Bud#Types_of_buds|apical bud]] is the [[phyllochron]].

==Plastochron ratio==
In 1951, F. J. Richards introduced the idea of the plastochron ratio and developed a system of equations to describe mathematically a centric representation using three parameters: plastochron ratio, divergence angle, and the angle of the cone tangential to the apex in the area being considered.&lt;ref&gt;FJ Richards, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London, Ser. B 235, 509 (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/3/455.short Orthostichy, Parastichy and Plastochrone Ratio in a Central Theory of Phyllotaxis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging [[Petiole (botany)|phyllodes]] or leaf variants experience a sudden change from a high [[humidity]] environment to a more [[arid]] one. There are other changes they encounter such as variations in light level, [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] and the gaseous content of the air.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14962">The '''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters''' ({{lang-no|Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskab}}, DKNVS) is a [[learned society]] based in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]].

==History==
DKNVS was founded in 1760 by the [[diocese of Nidaros|bishop of Nidaros]] [[Johan Ernst Gunnerus]], headmaster at the [[Trondheim Cathedral School]] [[Gerhard Schøning]] and Councillor of State [[Peter Frederik Suhm]] under the name ''Det Trondhiemske Selskab'' (the Trondheim Society). From 1761 it published academic papers in a series titled ''Skrifter''. It was the northernmost learned society in the world, and was established in a time when Norway did not have universities or colleges.&lt;ref name=uio&gt;{{cite book|last=Collett|first=John Peter|title=Historien om Universitetet i Oslo|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|date=1999|pages=14–16|isbn=82-00-12937-3|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morgenbladet.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100305/OAKTUELT/703059901/-1/AKTUELT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135033/http://www.morgenbladet.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20100305%2FOAKTUELT%2F703059901%2F-1%2FAKTUELT |date=2011-07-17 }} Lederartikel i [[Morgenbladet]] fra 5.mars 2010 til DKNVS 250-års jubileum&lt;/ref&gt;

It received the royal affirmation of its statutes on 17 July 1767,&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskab|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Det_Kongelige_Norske_Videnskabers_Selskab|language=Norwegian|accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given its present name at a ceremony on 29 January 1788, king [[Christian VII of Denmark]]'s birthday.&lt;ref name=tby&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1996|title=Vitenskapsselskapet|encyclopedia=Trondheim byleksikon|edition=|author=Bratberg, Terje|editor=Arntzen, Jon Gunnar|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|pages=599–600|isbn=82-573-0642-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1771, when [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] took over the [[de facto]] rule of [[Denmark-Norway]], Johan Ernst Gunnerus was summoned to [[Copenhagen]], where he was given the mission to establish a university in Norway. Gunnerus did not suggest that the university be established in Trondhjem, but in southern [[Kristiansand|Christianssand]] (Kristiansand), due to its proximity to [[Jutland]]. If this happened, he would have the Society of Sciences and Letters moved to Christianssand, to correspond with the new university. However, the plan was never carried out. Struensee's reign ended in 1772, but he reportedly dismissed the plan before this.&lt;ref name=uio/&gt; (Kristiansand got [[University of Agder|its university]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Universitetet i Agder|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Universitetet_i_Agder|language=Norwegian|accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The society was housed in the premises of [[Trondheim katedralskole|Trondheim Cathedral School]] until 1866, when it acquired its own localities.&lt;ref name=tby/&gt; Since 1903 its main task was to run [[NTNU Museum of Natural History and Archaeology|a museum]]. In 1926 there was a split in which the museum became a separate entity, receiving the assets of the learned society. Also in 1926, another publication series ''Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskab Forhandlinger'' was inaugurated.&lt;ref name=tby/&gt; Ownership of the museum was transferred to the [[University of Trondheim]] in 1968,&lt;ref name=tby2&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1996|title=Vitenskapsmuseet|encyclopedia=Trondheim byleksikon|edition=|author=Bratberg, Terje|editor=Arntzen, Jon Gunnar|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|pages=598–599|isbn=82-573-0642-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; today the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]],&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; but DKNVS re-received some assets in a 1984 reorganization, and now controls these assets through the foundation DKNVSS.&lt;ref name=tby2/&gt;

A history of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters was written in 1960 by [[Hans Midbøe]], and released in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Hans Midbøe|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Hans_Midb%C3%B8e|language=Norwegian|accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with the 250th anniversary of the Society, Håkon With Andersen, Brita Brenna, Magne Njåstad, and Astrid Wale wrote an updated history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Håkon With|last2=Brenna|first2=Brita|last3=Njåstad|first3=Magne|last4=Wale|first4=Astrid|title=Aemula Lauri – The Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, 1760–2010|date=2008|publisher=Science History Publications|isbn=978-0-88135-383-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, [[Arild Stubhaug]] wrote a shorter history, prepared for a general audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stubhaug|first1=Arild|title=Den lange linjen – Historien om Videnskabsselskabet i Trondheim|date=2010|publisher=Tapir Akademisk Forlag|location=Trondheim|isbn=978-82-519-2523-5|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The board of directors consists of seven people, five men and two women. It is led by praeses [[Steinar Supphellen]] and vice-praeses [[Kristian Fossheim]]. Other board members are Hanna Mustaparta, Britt Dale, Ola Dale, Joar Grimsbu and Asbjørn Moen. The daily administration is led by a secretary-general; Kristian Overskaug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dknvs.no/boardadministration.htm|title=Board/administration|publisher=Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters|accessdate=7 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020114739/http://www.dknvs.no/boardadministration.htm |archivedate = 20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board is responsible for awarding the [[Gunnerus Medal]]&lt;ref&gt;Yngvar Reichelt (in Norwegian): Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskabs medaljer.

Before 1815, the sitting King held the title of praeses, while the highest-ranked non-royal member was vice praeses. In the tradition of Gunnerus the bishop, the latter post was filled by clerics until 1820, when [[Christian Krohg (government minister)|Christian Krohg]] took the seat. From 1815 the King holds the title of "protector". Today King [[Harald V of Norway]] is protector of the society.&lt;ref name=tby/&gt;

Members of the learned society are divided into two divisions, Letters and Sciences. In 2005 there were 470 members, of whom 134 were foreign.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; This is a marked increase from 1996, when it had 399 members, of whom 94 were foreign.&lt;ref name=tby/&gt;

== Awards ==
The society awards the following prizes:

=== Gunnerus Sustainability Science Award ===
The '''[[Gunnerus Sustainability Science Award]]''' is the society's highest award. It is awarded for outstanding scientific work that promotes [[sustainable development]] globally. As of 2017 the prize is awarded by DKNVS in collaboration with the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ntnu.edu/sustainability-science/award NTNU's information on the award]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The award was established in 2012, as a cooperation between DKNVS, [[Sparebanken Midt-Norge]] and the foundation [[Technoport (Norway)|Technoport]]. It is named after the Norwegian scientist and bishop [[Johan Ernst Gunnerus]], and consists of a cash award of 1,000,000 [[Norwegian krone]]r.

The first laureate was announced in February 2012, and the prize was handed over the 17 April in [[Olavshallen]] in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]] during the conference [[Technoport 2012]].&lt;ref name="prize2012a"&gt;{{cite web

'''Scientometrics''' is the study of measuring and analysing [[science]], technology and innovation. Major research issues include the measurement of impact, reference sets of articles to investigate the impact of journals and institutes, understanding of scientific citations, mapping scientific fields and the production of indicators for use in policy and management contexts.&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff"&gt;[[Loet Leydesdorff|Leydesdorff, L.]] and Milojevic, S., "Scientometrics" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4566 arXiv:1208.4566] (2013), forthcoming in: Lynch, M. (editor), ''International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences'' subsection 85030. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice there is a significant overlap between scientometrics and other scientific fields such as [[bibliometrics]], information systems, [[information science]] and [[science of science policy]].

== Historical development ==
Modern scientometrics is mostly based on the work of [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] and [[Eugene Garfield]]. The latter created the [[Science Citation Index]]&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff" /&gt; and founded the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] which is heavily used for scientometric analysis. A dedicated academic journal, [[Scientometrics (journal)|''Scientometrics'']], was established in 1978. The industrialization of science increased the quantity of publications and research outcomes and the rise of the computers allowed effective analysis of this data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek de Solla Price|De Solla Price, D.]], ''editorial statement''. '''Scientometrics''' Volume 1, Issue 1 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; While the sociology of science focused on the behavior of scientists, scientometrics focused on the analysis of publications.&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff" /&gt; Accordingly, scientometrics is also referred to as the scientific and empirical study of science and its outcomes.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowry | first1 = Paul Benjamin | last2 = Romans | first2 = Denton | last3 = Curtis | first3 = Aaron | year = 2004 | title = Global journal prestige and supporting disciplines: A scientometric study of information systems journals | ssrn = 666145 | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 29–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowry, Paul Benjamin 2013"&gt;Lowry, Paul Benjamin; Moody, Gregory D.; Gaskin, James; Galletta, Dennis F.; Humpherys, Sean; Barlow, Jordan B.; and Wilson, David W.  (2013). "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2186798  Evaluating journal quality and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) Senior Scholars’ journal basket via bibliometric measures: Do expert journal assessments add value?]," MIS Quarterly (MISQ), vol. 37(4), 993–1012. Also, see YouTube video narrative of this paper at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQIDkA-ke0&amp;feature=youtu.be.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, around the turn of the century, evaluation and ranking of scientists and institutions came more into the spotlights. Based on bibliometric analysis of scientific publications and citations, the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] ("Shanghai ranking") was first published in 2004 by the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]. Impact factors became an important tool to choose between different journals and the rankings such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] (THE-ranking) became a leading indicator for the status of universities. The [[H-index|''h''-index]] became an important indicator of the productivity and impact of the work of a scientist. However, alternative author-level indicators has been proposed (see for example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Belikov, A.V. |author2=Belikov, V.V. | year = 2015 | title = A citation-based, author- and age-normalized, logarithmic index for evaluation of individual researchers independently of publication counts | journal = F1000Research | volume = 4 | pages= 884 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.7070.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Around the same time, interest of governments in evaluating research for the purpose of assessing the impact of science funding increased. As the investments in scientific research were included as part of the U.S. [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA), a major economic stimulus package, programs like [[STAR METRICS]] were set up to assess if the positive impact on the economy would actually occur.&lt;ref name="Lane1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lane | first1 = J | title = Assessing the Impact of Science Funding | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Methods of research include qualitative, quantitative and computational approaches. The main foci of studies have been on institutional productivity comparisons, institutional research rankings, journal rankings &lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowry, Paul Benjamin 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowry | first1 = Paul Benjamin | last2 = Humphreys | first2 = Sean | last3 = Malwitz | first3 = Jason | last4 = Nix | first4 = Joshua C | year = 2007 | title = A scientometric study of the perceived quality of business and technical communication journals | ssrn = 1021608 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 352–378 | doi = 10.1109/TPC.2007.908733 }} Recipient of the Rudolph Joenk Award for Best Paper Published in IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing faculty productivity and tenure standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dean | first1 = Douglas L | last2 = Lowry | first2 = Paul Benjamin | last3 = Humpherys | first3 = Sean | year = 2011 | title = Profiling the research productivity of tenured information systems faculty at U.S. institutions | ssrn = 1562263 | journal = MIS Quarterly | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 1–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; assessing the influence of top scholarly articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karuga | first1 = Gilbert G. | last2 = Lowry | first2 = Paul Benjamin | last3 = Richardson | first3 = Vernon J. | year = 2007 | title = Assessing the impact of premier information systems research over time | ssrn = 976891 | journal = Communications of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 19 | issue = 7| pages = 115–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and developing profiles of top authors and institutions in terms of research performance  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowry | first1 = Paul Benjamin | last2 = Karuga | first2 = Gilbert G. | last3 = Richardson | first3 = Vernon J. | year = 2007 | title = Assessing leading institutions, faculty, and articles in premier information systems research journals | ssrn = 1021603 | journal = Communications of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 20 | issue = 16| pages = 142–203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant finding in the field is a principle of cost escalation to the effect that achieving further findings at a given level of importance grow exponentially more costly in the expenditure of effort and resources. However, new algorithmic methods in search, [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]] are showing that is not the case for many information retrieval and extraction-based problems. Related fields are the [[history of science and technology]], [[philosophy of science]] and [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].

Journals in the field include ''[[Scientometrics (journal)|Scientometrics]], [[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'', and ''[[Journal of Informetrics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-informetrics/|title = Journal of Informetrics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics]] founded in 1993 is an association of professionals in the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30776">'''Social rule system theory''' is an attempt to formally approach different kinds of social rule systems in a unified manner.  Social rules systems include institutions such as [[norm (sociology)|norms]], [[laws]], regulations, [[taboo]]s, [[Norm (sociology)|customs]], and a variety of related concepts and are important in the [[social science]]s and [[humanities]].  Social rule system theory is fundamentally an [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalist]] approach to the social sciences, both in its placing primacy on institutions and in its use of sets of rules to define concepts in social theory.

== Overview ==
Social rule system theory notes that most human social activity is organized and regulated by socially produced and reproduced systems of rules.  These rules have a tangible existence in societies&amp;nbsp;– in language, customs and codes of conduct, norms and laws, and in social institutions such as family, community, market, business enterprises, and government agencies.  Thus, this theory posits that the making, interpretation, and implementation of social rules are [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] in human society, as are their reformulation and transformation. 

Human [[agent (economics)|agents]] (individuals, groups, organizations, communities, and other collectivities) produce, carry, and reform these systems of social rules, and this frequently takes place in ways they neither intend nor expect. This does not mean that social rule systems do not change.  They can and do, and that change can be endogenous and exogenous to the society. The implementation of rules&amp;nbsp;– and the maintenance of some order&amp;nbsp;– always calls for cumulative experience, adjustment, adaptation, etc. In such ways, normative and institutional innovation is generated. There is a continual interplay&amp;nbsp;– a [[dialectic]], if you will&amp;nbsp;– between the regulated and the unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;(Lotman, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; 

What is more, at the same time that social rule systems strongly influence actions and interactions, they are formed and reformed by the actors involved. Human [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] is manifest in this dialectical process, played out by participating actors having their specific competencies and [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s, their situational analyses, interpretations, and strategic responses to immediate pushes and pulls to which they are subject.

== History ==
The development of a more systematic conceptualization and theorizing about social rules and systems of social rules emerged in the late 1970s in the collaborative work of [[Thomas Baumgartner]], [[Tom R. Burns]], [[Philippe DeVille]], and later [[Helena Flam]], [[Reinier de Man]], [[Atle Midttun]], [[Anders Olsson (writer)|Anders Olsson]], and others. Its formalization stemmed from a number of articles in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Burns et al. (1985) and Burns and Flam (1987), Machado (1998), Carson (2004), Flam and Carson (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social theory concepts such as norm, value, belief, role, social relationship, and institution as well as [[game]] were shown to be definable in a uniform way in terms of rules and rule complexes. Rules and rule configurations may be treated as mathematical objects (the mathematics is based on contemporary developments at the interface of mathematics, logic, and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Gomolinska, 2000; Gomolinska, 2002, 2004, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Rules may be imprecise, possibly inconsistent, and open to a greater or lesser extent to modification and transformation by the participants.

Rules are key concepts in the [[new institutionalism]],&lt;ref&gt;([[James G. March|March]] and Olsen, 1984; [[Douglas North|North]], 1990; [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]], 1990; Powell and [[Paul DiMaggio|DiMaggio]], 1991; [[William Richard Scott|Scott]], 1995, among others)&lt;/ref&gt; in several variants of socio-cultural evolutionary theory,&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Dietz, 1992; [[Geoffrey Hodgson|Hodgson]] 2002; Schmid and [[Franz M. Wuketits|Wuketits]], 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and in work in semiotics,&lt;ref&gt;([[Yuri Lotman|Lotman]], 1975; Posner, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; linguistics,&lt;ref&gt;([[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]], 1957; 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy on “language games”.&lt;ref&gt;([[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many other researchers developing and applying rule concepts in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;one would also include Cicourel (1974), [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] (1984), [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1974), [[Horace Romano Harré|Harré]] (1979), Harre and Secord (1972), [[Charles E. Lindblom|Lindblom]] (1977), and Twining and Miers (1982), among many others&lt;/ref&gt; In general, much of the use of rule concept in the social sciences and humanities has been informal and even metaphorical, with the major exception of Chomsky.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky 1957, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social rules and the patterning of action ==
Social rule systems are used to examine all levels of human interaction.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Flam, 1987; Carson, 2005; Giddens, 1984; Goffman, 1974; Harré, 1979; Lotman, 1975; Posner, 1989, among others)&lt;/ref&gt; They provide more than potential constraints on action possibilities. They also generate opportunities for social actors to behave in ways that would otherwise be impossible, for instance, to [[coordination game|coordinate]] with others, to mobilize and to gain systematic access to strategic resources, to command and allocate substantial human and physical resources, and to solve complex social problems by organizing [[collective action]]s. In guiding and regulating interaction, social rules give behavior recognizable, characteristic patterns, and make such patterns understandable and meaningful for those who share in the rule knowledge.

===Culture and institutional arrangements===
[[Image:Brazilian Carnival.jpg|thumb|The [[Brazilian Carnival]] parade in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is given meanings through shared understanding of culturally defined rules.]]
On the macro-level of culture and institutional arrangements, rule system complexes are examined: language, cultural codes and forms, institutional arrangements, shared paradigms, norms and “rules of the game”.&lt;ref&gt;.  Lotman (1975) and Posner (1989) offer valuable semiotic perspectives with important (not yet analyzed on our part) parallels.&lt;/ref&gt; On the actor level, one refers to roles, particular norms, strategies, action paradigms, and social grammars (for example, procedures of order, turn taking, and voting in committees and democratic bodies). There are not only role grammars but semantics and pragmatics. There are processes of meaning, interpretation, and adaptation associated with rule application and implementation. 

Grammars of action are associated with culturally defined roles and institutional domains, indicating particular ways of thinking and acting. In that sense, the grammars are both social and conventional. For instance, in the case of gift giving or reciprocity in defined social relationships, actors display a competence in knowing when a gift should be given or not, how much it should be worth, or, if one should fail to give it or if it lies under the appropriate value, what excuses, defenses and justifications might be acceptable. Someone ignorant of these rules, e.g. a child or someone from a totally different culture would obviously make mistakes (for which they would probably be excused by others). Similarly, in the case of "making a promise," rule knowledge indicates under what circumstances a promise may or may not legitimately be broken&amp;nbsp;– or at least the sort of breach of a promise that might be considered acceptable. In guiding and regulating interaction, the rules give behavior recognizable, characteristic patterns rules should be adhered to as it should be.  &lt;ref&gt;magie&lt;/ref&gt;

To varying degrees actors collectively produce and reproduce patterns of appropriate or acceptable possibilities. This can be conceptualized and mathematically developed as an ideal point or collection of "approximations". Thus, a community of actors sharing a rule complex recognize a wide variety of varying performances of a given rule as a family of resemblances, or "the same thing.” Both in this sense&amp;nbsp;– and in the sense that social rules are never learned identically and undergo different rates of adaptation and change over time&amp;nbsp;– the concept of rule, and of culture generally, is distributive. &amp;nbsp;– making the patterns understandable and meaningful for those sharing in the rule knowledge. 

Shared rules are the major basis for knowledgeable actors to derive, or to generate, similar situational expectations. They also provide a frame of reference and categories, enabling participants to readily communicate about and to analyze social activities and events. In such ways, uncertainty is reduced, predictability is increased. This is so even in complex situations with multiple actors playing different roles and engaging in a variety of interaction patterns. As Harre and Secord (1972:12) point out, “It is the self-monitoring following of rules and plans that we believe to be the social scientific analogue of the working of generative causal mechanisms in the processes which produce the non-random patterns studied by natural scientists.”

===Cognitive processes===
Social rule systems play then an important role in cognitive processes, in part by enabling actors to organize and to frame perceptions in a given institutional setting or domain. On the basis of a more or less a common rule system, questions such as the following can be intersubjectively and collectively answered: 
* what is going on in this situation; 
* what kind of activity is this; 
* who is who in the situation, what specific roles are they playing; 
* what is being done; why is this being done? 

The participating actors can understand the situation in intersubjective ways. In a certain sense, they can simulate and predict what will happen in the interactions on the basis of the applied rules. Hence, rule systems provide not only a basis for interpretative schemes but also the concrete basis for actors to plan and judge actions and interactions. 

Social rules are also important in normative and moral communications about social action and interaction. Participants refer to the rules in giving accounts, in justifying or criticizing what is being done (or not done), in arguing for what should or should not be done, and also in their social attribution of who should or should not be blamed for performance failures, or credited with success. Actors also exploit rules when they give accounts in order to try to justify certain actions or failures to act, as part of a strategy to gain legitimacy, or to convince others that particular actions are "right and proper" in the context.

===Textually encoded social rules===
[[Image:Magna_Carta_(British_Library_Cotton_MS_Augustus_II.106).jpg|thumb|The [[Magna Carta]] from 1215 is an early [[England|English]] form of encoded social and legal rules.]]
So called formal rules are found in sacred books, legal codes, handbooks of rules and regulations, or in the design of organizations or technologies that an elite or dominant group seeks to impose in a particular social setting. For instance, a formal organization such as a bureaucracy consists of, among other features, a well-defined hierarchical authority structure, explicit goals and policies, and clear-cut specialization of function or division of labor. 

Informal rules appear less "legislated" and more "spontaneous" than formal rules. They are generated and reproduced in ongoing interactions. The extent to which the formal and informal rule systems diverge or contradict one another varies. Numerous organizational studies have revealed that official, formal rules are not always those that operate in practice. In some cases the informal unwritten rules not only contradict formal rules but take precedence over them under some conditions. Informal rules emerge for a variety of reasons. In part, formal rules fail to completely specify action (that is provide complete directions) or to cover all relevant (or emergent) situations. 

The situations (in which rules are applied or implemented) are particularistic, even idiosyncratic, whereas formal rules of behavior are more or less general. In some situations (especially emergent or new situations), actors may be uncertain or disagree about which rules apply or about the ways in which to apply them. They engage in situational analyses and rule modification, or even rule innovation out of which emerge informal rules (which may be formalized later).

===Interpretation and variability===
However strongly actions are patterned by rules, social life is sufficiently complex that some imagination and interpretation are required in applying rules to a specific action and interaction context. Imagination generates variability in action from actor to actor, and even for a given actor over time. 

Rules are also interpreted in their application. Even highly formalized, systematic rules such as laws and written rules of bureaucracy are never complete in their specification. They have to be interpreted and applied using situational information and knowledge. Adaptations and improvisations are common, even in the most formally organized institutions. In this sense, rules are generative, and their interpretation and implementation more or less context-dependent. 

Interpretation varies across a population sharing a rule system, and also across time. In addition, rules will sometimes be learned or implemented with error, providing in some cases an incorrect model for others. Both of these factors result in variability. Moreover, if an action at deviance with cultural rules or standard interpretations is perceived by other actors as advantageous, it may be copied, thus spreading what becomes a new cultural variant.

==Adherence to and compliance with social rules==
Actors adhere to and implement rule and rule systems to varying degrees. Compliance with, or refusal to comply with, particular rules are complicated cognitive and [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] processes. Typically, there are diverse reasons for rule compliance. Several of the most important factors are:

# Interest factors and [[instrumentalism]] (stressed by [[public choice]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspectives on self-interested behavior). Actors may advocate rules to gain benefits or to avoid losses.
# [[Identity (social science)|Identity]] and status. Adherence to rules&amp;nbsp;– and commitment to their realization&amp;nbsp;– may be connected to an actor's identity, role, or status, and the desire to represent self as identified by or committed to particular rules. It follows that a major motivation in maintaining (or changing rules)&amp;nbsp;– e.g. role complexes or distributive rules&amp;nbsp;– is to maintain or change their social status.
# Authoritative Legitimacy and Sacrality. Many rules are accepted and adhered to because persons or groups with social authority have defined or determined them, possibly by associating them with sacred principles or identifying their causal or symbolic relationship to actors' interests and status. In the contemporary world, we find the widespread institutionalization of abstract meta-rules of compliance that orient people to accepting particular definitions of reality and rule systems propagated by socially defined and often certified authorities, e.g. scientists and other experts. The authority may be scientific, religious, or political (for instance in the latter case, the fact that a democratic agency has determined the rules according to right and proper procedures). Certain rules may even be associated with [[God]], the sacred, and, in general, those beings or things that actors stand in awe of, have great respect for, and may associate with or share in their charisma by adhering to or following their rules.
# Normative/Cognitive Order. Actors may follow rules&amp;nbsp;– and try to ensure that others follow them&amp;nbsp;– because the rules fit into a cognitive frame for organizing their perceptions and making sense of what is going on. People react negatively to deviance&amp;nbsp;– even in cases where they are not directly affected (that is, there are no direct apparent self-interests), because the order is disturbed, potentially destabilized, and eroded.[[Image:Battle strike 1934.jpg|thumb|[[Teamsters]] clash with [[riot police]] in the [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934]].  Both groups use various methods to assure compliance with institutional rules.]]
# Social sanctions. Laws and formal organizational rules and regulations are typically backed up by specific social sanctions and designated agents assigned the responsibility and authority to enforce the rules. There are a variety of social controls and sanctions in any social group or organization which are intended to induce or motivate actors to adhere to or follow rules, ranging from coercion to more symbolic forms of social approval or disapproval, persuasion, and activation of commitments (in effect, "promises" that have already been made). In order to gain entrance or to remain in the group, one must comply with key group rules and role definitions. Exclusion from the group, if there are no alternative groups, becomes a powerful sanction.
# Inherent sanctions. Many rules, when adhered to in specific action settings, result in gains or payoffs that are inherent in following those rules, such as going with (or against) automobile traffic. In many cases, the reasons for compliance are [[consequentialist]]. As many social scientists point out: in automobile traffic, we adhere to or accept as right and proper traffic rules, in particular those relating to stopping, turning, etc. because without them, we recognize that the situation would be chaotic, dangerous, even catastrophic. Most technical rules, for example relating to operating machines or using tools, entail inherent sanctions. Following them is necessary (or considered necessary) for the proper functioning or performance of the technology, or achieving a certain desirable outcome or solution.
# [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]]. Actors may not know the consequences of rule compliance and follow rules because they are given, taken for granted, or believed generally to be right and proper. The benefits of adhering to some rule systems can, however, mask hidden costs.
# Habits, routines, and scripts. Much rule-following behavior is unreflective and routine. Many social rules are unverbalized, tacit, that is, part of a collective subconscious of strategies, roles, and scripts learned early in life or career, and reinforced in repeated social situations, for instance sex roles, or even many professional roles. Human beings acquire and learn cultural rules and roles&amp;nbsp;– in part through being taught, in part through observing and learning the patterns generated by others (that is, both through verbal and non-verbal communication). Of particular importance is the fact that rule systems learned in early socialization are associated with very basic values and meanings&amp;nbsp;– even personal and collective identity&amp;nbsp;– motivating at a deep emotional level commitment to the rules and a profound personal satisfaction in enacting them. Conformity is then a matter of habitual, unreflected and taken-for-granted ways of doing things.

As indicated above, some social rules are enforced, others not: indeed, rules can be distinguished on the basis of the degree to which, and the circumstances under which, they are socially enforced or enforceable. Of course, regardless of the degree of enforceability, they may be complied with because of a desire for order, intrinsic sanctions, or realizing one’s role and self-identity. Many rules that actors rigorously adhere to are not socially enforceable, but nevertheless actors utilize them in organizing social activities and in shaping social order. Harre and Secord (1972:17) emphasize the freedom of choice in relation to rules and roles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The mechanistic model is strongly deterministic; the role-rule model is not. Rules are not laws, they can be ignored or broken, if we admit that human beings are self-governing agents rather than objects controlled by external forces, aware of themselves only as helpless spectators of the flow of physical causality." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Social rule system theory and complex institutional arrangements==
[[Image:US Senate Session Chamber.jpg|thumb|242x|right|A regular legislative senate is a complex institutional arrangement.]]
On meso- and macro-levels of analysis, social rule system theory is applied to the description and analysis of institutions such as bureaucracy, markets, political systems, and science&amp;nbsp;– major orders in modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Flam, 1987; Carson, 2004; Flam and Carson, 2008; Machado, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; This entails more than a study of social structure, or a contribution to [[neo-institutionalism]]. 

It is a theory that analyses the links between social structure in the form of particular institutional arrangements including role relationships, on the one hand, and social action and social interaction, on the other. The theory shows, for example, in what ways markets and bureaucracies are organized and regulated by social rules at the same time that actors, both inside and outside these institutions, maintain or change the organizing principles and rules through their actions and interactions. The actors involved in a given institution use their institutional knowledge of relationships, roles, norms, and procedures to guide and organize their actions and interactions. But they also use it to understand and interpret what is going on, to plan and simulate scenarios, and to refer to in making commentaries and in giving and asking for accounts. Rule system theory stresses rule-based cognitive processes such as framing, contextualizing, and classifying objects, persons, and actions in a relevant or meaningful way (Carson, 2004).

In general, the cultural complex of rule systems contributes to making social life more or less orderly and predictable and solves problems of "existential uncertainty" within the group, organization, or community bearing and adhering to the rule culture.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Dietz, 1992; Garfinkel  1981; Luhmann, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; As suggested earlier, however, there is always a tension and a dynamic between the regulated and the unregulated, order and disorder (this is also pointed up in empirical studies.&lt;ref&gt;such as found in Carson (2004) and Machado (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers the production of appropriate or meaningful accounts, discourses, and commentaries in the context of the given institution.

In line with the new institutionalism, social rule system theory stresses that particular institutions and their organizational instantiations are deeply embedded in cultural, social, and political environments and that particular structures and practices are often reflections of as well as responses to rules, laws, conventions, paradigms built into the wider environment.&lt;ref&gt;(Powell, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule system change and evolution==
Institutional change entails changes in particular rule complexes and/or enforcement activities to the effect that new or deviant patterns of action and interaction are generated and encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Flam, 1987; Levi, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Social rule system theorists point to three major power mechanisms of rule system reproduction and change to explain the [[evolution]] of social rule systems and institutional arrangements:&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Carson, 2002; Burns and Dietz, 1992; Flam and Carson, 2008; Stinchcombe, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; the selective action of the environment; the constraining and facilitating conditions of institutional arrangements with their technologies, available resources, and participants; and creative/destructive human agency.

Selective environments operate to bring about the successes of some rule structures and the failure of others and, thereby, shifts in the prevalence of different forms. Rule system changes may be also initiated by social agents. For instance, an elite "legislates" an institutional change, or a social movement brings about change through coming to direct power or effectively pressuring and negotiating with an established power elite. Changes are also brought about through more dispersed processes, e.g. where one or more agents of a population discover a new technical or performance strategy and others copy the strategy, and, in this way, the rule innovation diffuses through social networks of communication and exchange. 

The introduction by social agents of new rules and their expression in transformed patterns of action or in innovative physical artifacts&amp;nbsp;– such as technologies and socio-technical infrastructures&amp;nbsp;– is a major part of institutional change and evolution. In other words, institutionalized changes may be brought about by the "selective forces" of social as well as physical environments or by the direct action of social agents. This model of change is applicable to economic, political, administrative, socio-technical, and scientific institutional arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

(1963) ''Aeronautical Engineering and Science'', McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service]] in 1959 for his contributions to the US rocket program.&lt;ref name="aes_1963"/&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:VonBraunTeam1961.jpg|left|thumb|Von Braun's rocket team in 1961. Haeussermann is second from the left.]]

Haeussermann was born in Germany shortly before the beginning of [[World War I]]. He eventually matriculated at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]], where he earned a doctorate in physics.&lt;ref name="aes_1963"/&gt; He was drafted into the German army for [[World War II]] and taken to the rocket development center at [[Peenemünde]] on December 1, 1939.&lt;ref name="astros"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/haermann.htm|title=Haeussermann|publisher=Astronautix.com|accessdate=2010-08-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715042158/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/haermann.htm|archivedate=2010-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 interview, he recalled seeing a [[rocket engine]] test upon his arrival there, saying, "I was flabbergasted, because on the first day I was shown a rocket test ... I was astonished that something like this was already existing." Asked about meeting [[Wernher von Braun|von Braun]], he enthusiastically replied, "I met him the second day. I was very interested about him." He worked on the [[V-2]] guidance and simulations by means of analog computers.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

He stayed at Peenemünde 3 years, then returned to Darmstadt where he worked for Kreiselgeraete and Siemens to develop a gyroscopic guidance platform. After the war, he was invited to join von Braun's team in [[Fort Bliss]], [[Texas]], but initially declined because his wife was ill.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="astros"/&gt;
 
[[Helmut Hölzer]] and [[Ernst Steinhoff]] accepted the [[Operation Paperclip]] invitation to the United States, traveled there in late 1945, and maintained contact with Haeussermann. Haeussermann came to the United States in 1947 to rejoin von Braun's team, working on ballistic missile guidance and control engineering at [[Fort Bliss]]. In 1951, the group moved to [[Redstone Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

In 1954, Haeussermann became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] [[United States nationality law|US citizen]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; At that time he was the director of the Guidance and Control Laboratory and head of the Astrionics Division of what is now [[Marshall Space Flight Center]].

[[NASA]] was formed in 1958, and Haeussermann was on the initial roster. There, he led electrical, computer systems, guidance, and navigation systems for the [[Saturn V]]. He took his responsibility for the astronauts safe transport seriously. He said, "I refused any congratulation before [[Apollo 11]] astronauts were safely back. Of course, we were very proud."&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

His contributions to the space program were recognized with the [[Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service]] in 1959.

Haeussermann remained an enthusiastic supporter of the space program and attended reunions and public events regularly until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/space/5500870.html|title=America honors the last of the German rocketeers|publisher=Newhouse News Service|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=January 1, 2011|first=Dave Dieter|last=Newhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in guidance and control===
Haeussermann's main area of work was in automatic guidance and control for missiles. For example, he was instrumental in the design of the [[Saturn V]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shelby G.|last=Spires|url=http://www.sgspires.com/Apollo11_IU.htm|title=Instrument Unit computer and Apollo 11|publisher=Sgspires.com|date=July 16, 1969|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted research more broadly, for instance in 3-axis attitude control&lt;ref name="nasa-x-50071"&gt;Haeussermann, W.

===Arthur Rudolph===
Haeussermann was a colleague of [[Arthur Rudolph]], who in the 1980s was investigated by the OSI and [[Eli Rosenbaum]] for alleged Nazi war crimes. Haeussermann was at one time part of Rudolph's defense team tasked with proving his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=zGZMTe25FsO_gQeLqdTyDw "Jewish currents, Volume 40, Issues 1-6"], Morning Freiheit Association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">'''Heinrich Lambert Wilhelm Hauchecorne''' (13 August 1828 – 15 January 1900) was a German [[geologist]] of [[French Huguenot]] parentage who was born in [[Aachen]]. 
[[File:Hauchecorne, Wilhelm.jpg|right|thumb|Relief of Hauchecorne, located at his gravesite.]]
He studied at the [[University of Berlin]] and at the [[Bergakademie Freiberg|''Bergakademie'' in Freiberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd116521503.html Hauchecorne, Heinrich Lambert Wilhelm] at Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt; Among his instructors were [[Heinrich Ernst von Beyrich]] (1815-1896), [[Gustav Rose]] (1798-1873) and [[Christian Samuel Weiss]] (1780-1856). Afterwards he became director of a copper mine near [[Rheinbreitbach]], and in 1866 was appointed director of the Berlin Mining Academy. In 1873 he became the co-director of the Prussian National Geological Survey.

Hauchecorne is credited with development of the Geological Survey's geological and [[mineralogical]] collections, and was responsible for consolidation of rock and mineral collections. He also introduced a standardization of color-codes for use on German [[geological map]]s that was eventually adopted throughout Europe.

In 1892, the mineral [[hauchecornite]] was named in his honor.

'''Wu Jie''' ({{zh|s=吴杰|t=吳杰|p=Wú Jié}}; born October 1963) is a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] military [[aviator|pilot]] and [[astronaut]] selected as part of the [[Shenzhou spacecraft|Shenzhou program]].

==Biography==
Wu Jie was born in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] province, [[China]]. In 1987 he graduated from the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) Engineering College and later the PLAAF Flight College. A [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot in the PLAAF, he had accumulated 1100 flight-hours.

In November 1996, he and [[Li Qinglong]], started training at the [[Russia]]n [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center]]. When they returned to China a year later, they acted as the trainers for the first group of Shenzhou astronauts. Before the flight of ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' it was thought that he or Li Qinglong would fly the mission, that was eventually flown by [[Yang Liwei]].

Wu was then one of the six astronauts in the final training for ''[[Shenzhou 6]]''.
