The [[United States]] has named a mountain in [[Antarctica]] in honour of Sinha, [[Mount Sinha|Mt Sinha]]. Mr Sinha's native place is Churamanpur, a village in the state of Bihar in the eastern part of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt Sinha!

&lt;!-- Akhouri Achyutanand Sinha is a fourteenth generation member of Akhouri family of Churamanpur, a village about 3 miles east of Buxar on NH Hiway 74 that runs from Buxar to Patna, capital of Bihar State. His forefather Akhoury Churaman Singh left Delhi in the middle of night in 1739 when Delhi was under attack and many members of his family were assassinated by the invaders, Nadir Shah of Persia (now called Iran). They had killed numerous people in Delhi and looted the wealth of people. On a small flotilla of boats on river Jamuna, the family travelled some 400 miles east via Kanpur, Varanansi and Buxar reaching a village Ahirouli. They were welcomed by the villagers and suggested that Akhouris can settle in a near by jungle. The acquired about 1600 acres of land and settled the village for Akhouri family who have lived in this village continuously. Our branch still has presence in the village while many others migrated to many places in India and world

Our family is highly focused on education and parent support education of their children. My father, Akhouri Chandra Bhusan Sinha had B.A., M.A. in history and did graduate with a law degree. He wanted one of his five children to become a lawyer. but none followed him. His father had B. A. and a law degree and became a Judge. Each of the five brothers had at least two or three college degrees. I had B.Sc., M.Sc. from India and did my Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Missouri at Columbia, MO. My two sisters, Anil and Manju were married and become house wife.

I was part of Independent India and wanted to explore the world and I did I have travelled all seven continents and travel with my wife Dorothy. We visit india and my village almost every year and still have many villagers with whom I talk. I visit my friend Maharaja Sri Kamal Singh and his family every year. I usually stay with my son, Akhouri Hridayanad Sinha and his wife in Delhi. Last year four of us travelled to Pondichery and Ootakamund, Lucknow, Kanpur and Buxar. I my opinion Kerala is the best state to visit for a foreign tourist.

I would say that people in the United States of America have been very kind and generous and supportive of my education and journey in my life so far.

'''Boris Borissovich Rohdendorf''' (12 July 1904 &amp;ndash; 21 November 1977) was a [[Russians|Russian]] 
[[entomology|entomologist]] and curator at the Zoological Museum at the [[University of Moscow]]. He attained the position of head of the [[Russian palaeoentomological school|Laboratory of Arthropods]], [[Paleontological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences]], Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]) in [[Moscow]]. A student of [[Andreas V.

[[File:Cognitive Science Hexagon.svg|300px|thumb|Figure illustrating the fields that contributed to the birth of cognitive science, including [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[Cognitive Psychology|psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from  [[George Armitage Miller|Miller, George A]] (2003). "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective". ''[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]]'' '''7'''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Cognitive science''' is the interdisciplinary, [[science|scientific]] study of the [[mind]] and its processes.&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field of researchers from Linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, computer science, and anthropology that seek to understand the mind. [http://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/summer2002/willingham.cfm How We Learn: Ask the Cognitive Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;  It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of [[cognition]] (in a broad sense). Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform [[information]]. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include [[language]], [[perception]], [[memory]], [[attention]], [[reasoning]], and [[emotion]]; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;[[Thagard, Paul]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2008 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from [[neuron|neural]] circuitry to modular brain organization.  The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that "thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures."&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

Simply put: Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of cognition in humans, animals, and machines. It encompasses the traditional disciplines of psychology, computer science, neuroscience, linguistics and philosophy. The goal of cognitive science is to understand the principles of intelligence with the hope that this will lead to better comprehension of the mind and of learning and to develop intelligent devices.
The cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s often referred to as the [[cognitive revolution]].

==Principles==

===Levels of analysis===
A central tenet of cognitive science is that a complete understanding of the mind/brain cannot be attained by studying only a single level. An example would be the problem of remembering a phone number and recalling it later. One approach to understanding this process would be to study behavior through direct observation, or [[naturalistic observation]]. A person could be presented with a phone number and be asked to recall it after some delay of time. Then, the accuracy of the response could be measured. Another approach to measure cognitive ability would be to study the firings of individual [[neuron]]s while a person is trying to remember the phone number. Neither of these experiments on its own would fully explain how the process of remembering a phone number works. Even if the technology to map out every neuron in the brain in real-time were available, and it were known when each neuron was firing, it would still be impossible to know how a particular firing of neurons translates into the observed behavior. Thus, an understanding of how these two levels relate to each other is imperative. ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience'' says, “the new sciences of the mind need to enlarge their horizon to encompass both lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience.”&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. J., Thompson, E., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). The embodied mind: cognitive science and human experience. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be provided by a functional level account of the process. Studying a particular phenomenon from multiple levels creates a better understanding of the processes that occur in the brain to give rise to a particular behavior.
[[David Marr (psychologist)|Marr]]&lt;ref&gt;Marr, D. (1982). ''Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information''. W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; gave a famous description of three levels of analysis:

# the ''computational theory'', specifying the goals of the computation;
# ''representation and algorithms'', giving a representation of the inputs and outputs and the algorithms which transform one into the other; and
# the ''hardware implementation'', how algorithm and representation may be physically realized.

(See also the entry on [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].)

===Interdisciplinary nature===
Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field with contributors from various fields, including [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[computer science]], [[anthropology]] and [[biology]].  Cognitive scientists work collectively in hope of understanding the mind and its interactions with the surrounding world much like other sciences do. The field regards itself as compatible with the physical sciences and uses the [[scientific method]] as well as [[simulation]] or [[model (abstract)|modeling]], often comparing the output of models with aspects of human cognition. Similarly to the field of psychology, there is some doubt whether there is a unified cognitive science, which have led some researchers to prefer 'cognitive sciences' in plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = G. A. | year = 2003 | title = The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 141–144 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00029-9 | pmid=12639696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrés|first=Joan|last2=Masanet|first2=Maria-Jose|date=2017|title=Communication Efficiency in Education: Increasing Emotions and Storytelling|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-05|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=51–60|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-05|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many, but not all, who consider themselves cognitive scientists hold a [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]] view of the mind—the view that mental states and processes should be explained by their function - what they do. According to the [[multiple realizability]] account of functionalism, even non-human systems such as robots and computers can be ascribed as having cognition.

===''Cognitive'' science: the term===
The term "cognitive" in "cognitive science" is used for "any kind of mental operation or structure that can be studied in precise terms" ([[George Lakoff|Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Johnson]], 1999). This conceptualization is very broad, and should not be confused with how "cognitive" is used in some traditions of [[analytic philosophy]], where "cognitive" has to do only with formal rules and truth conditional semantics.

The earliest entries for the word "''cognitive''" in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] take it to mean roughly ''"pertaining to the action or process of knowing"''. The first entry, from 1586, shows the word was at one time used in the context of discussions of [[Plato]]nic theories of [[knowledge]]. Most in cognitive science, however, presumably do not believe their field is the study of anything as certain as the knowledge sought by Plato.[https://www.ripublication.com/ijcir17/ijcirv13n1_08.pdf]

==Scope==
Cognitive science is a large field, and covers a wide array of topics on cognition. However, it should be recognized that cognitive science has not always been equally concerned with every topic that might bear relevance to the nature and operation of minds. Among philosophers, classical cognitivists have largely de-emphasized or avoided social and cultural factors, emotion, consciousness, [[animal cognition]], and [[comparative psychology|comparative]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] psychologies. However, with the decline of behaviorism, internal states such as affects and emotions, as well as awareness and covert attention became approachable again. For example, situated and embodied cognition theories take into account the current state of the environment as well as the role of the body in cognition. With the newfound emphasis on information processing, observable behavior was no longer the hallmark of psychological theory, but the modeling or recording of mental states.

Below are some of the main topics that cognitive science is concerned with. This is not an exhaustive list. See [[List of cognitive science topics]] for a list of various aspects of the field.

===Artificial intelligence===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence|Outline of artificial intelligence}}

Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the study of cognitive phenomena in machines. One of the practical goals of AI is to implement aspects of human intelligence in computers. Computers are also widely used as a tool with which to study cognitive phenomena. [[computer model|Computational modeling]] uses simulations to study how human intelligence may be structured.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ron (ed.) (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (See {{section link||Computational modeling}}.)

There is some debate in the field as to whether the mind is best viewed as a huge array of small but individually feeble elements (i.e. neurons), or as a collection of higher-level structures such as symbols, schemes, plans, and rules. The former view uses [[connectionism]] to study the mind, whereas the latter emphasizes symbolic computations. One way to view the issue is whether it is possible to accurately simulate a human brain on a computer without accurately simulating the neurons that make up the human brain.

===Attention===
{{Main|Attention}}

Attention is the selection of important information.  The human mind is bombarded with millions of stimuli and it must have a way of deciding which of this information to process.  Attention is sometimes seen as a spotlight, meaning one can only shine the light on a particular set of information.  Experiments that support this metaphor include the [[dichotic listening]] task (Cherry, 1957) and studies of [[inattentional blindness]] (Mack and Rock, 1998).  In the dichotic listening task, subjects are bombarded with two different messages, one in each ear, and told to focus on only one of the messages.  At the end of the experiment, when asked about the content of the unattended message, subjects cannot report it.

===Knowledge and processing of language===
[[Image:Cgisf-tgg.svg|thumb|230px|A [[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously|well known example]] of a [[Phrase structure rules|Phrase structure tree]]. This is one way of representing human language that shows how different components are organized hierarchically. ]]
{{Main|Theoretical linguistics|Cognitive linguistics|Language|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics}}

The ability to learn and understand language is an extremely complex process. Language is acquired within the first few years of life, and all humans under normal circumstances are able to acquire language proficiently. A major driving force in the theoretical linguistic field is discovering the nature that language must have in the abstract in order to be learned in such a fashion. Some of the driving research questions in studying how the brain itself processes language include: (1) To what extent is linguistic knowledge innate or learned?, (2) Why is it more difficult for adults to acquire a second-language than it is for infants to acquire their first-language?, and (3) How are humans able to understand novel sentences?

The study of language processing ranges from the investigation of the sound patterns of speech to the meaning of words and whole sentences. [[Linguistics]] often divides language processing into [[orthography]], [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. Many aspects of language can be studied from each of these components and from their interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.decodedscience.org/linguistics-short-introduction-beating-heart-human-communications/42808|title=Linguistics: Semantics, Phonetics, Pragmatics, and Human Communication|date=2014-02-16|work=Decoded Science|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Not sure that Decoded Science is the best possible source here|date=June 2018}}

The study of language processing in ''cognitive science'' is closely tied to the field of linguistics. Linguistics was traditionally studied as a part of the humanities, including studies of history, art and literature. In the last fifty years or so, more and more researchers have studied knowledge and use of language as a cognitive phenomenon, the main problems being how knowledge of language can be acquired and used, and what precisely it consists of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniela | last=Isac |author2=Charles Reiss | title= I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, 2nd edition |url= http://linguistics.concordia.ca/i-language/ | year=2013|page=5 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0199660179}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistics|Linguists]] have found that, while humans form sentences in ways apparently governed by very complex systems, they are remarkably unaware of the rules that govern their own speech. Thus linguists must resort to indirect methods to determine what those rules might be, if indeed rules as such exist. In any event, if speech is indeed governed by rules, they appear to be opaque to any conscious consideration.

===Learning and development===
{{Main|Learning|Developmental psychology}}

Learning and development are the processes by which we acquire knowledge and information over time. Infants are born with little or no knowledge (depending on how knowledge is defined), yet they rapidly acquire the ability to use language, walk, and recognize people and objects. Research in learning and development aims to explain the mechanisms by which these processes might take place.

A major question in the study of cognitive development is the extent to which certain abilities are [[innate]] or learned. This is often framed in terms of the [[nature and nurture]] debate. The [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] view emphasizes that certain features are innate to an organism and are determined by its [[genetics|genetic]] endowment. The [[Empiricism|empiricist]] view, on the other hand, emphasizes that certain abilities are learned from the environment. Although clearly both genetic and environmental input is needed for a child to develop normally, considerable debate remains about ''how'' genetic information might guide cognitive development. In the area of [[language acquisition]], for example, some (such as [[Steven Pinker]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pinker S., Bloom P.|title=Natural language and natural selection|year=1990|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|issue=4|pages=707–784|volume=13|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061|citeseerx=10.1.1.116.4044}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that specific information containing universal grammatical rules must be contained in the genes, whereas others (such as Jeffrey Elman and colleagues in [[Rethinking Innateness]]) have argued that Pinker's claims are biologically unrealistic. They argue that genes determine the architecture of a learning system, but that specific "facts" about how grammar works can only be learned as a result of experience.

===Memory===
{{Main|Memory}}

Memory allows us to store information for later retrieval. Memory is often thought of as consisting of both a long-term and short-term store. Long-term memory allows us to store information over prolonged periods (days, weeks, years). We do not yet know the practical limit of long-term memory capacity. Short-term memory allows us to store information over short time scales (seconds or minutes).

Memory is also often grouped into declarative and procedural forms. [[Declarative memory]]—grouped into subsets of [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[Episodic memory|episodic forms of memory]]—refers to our memory for facts and specific knowledge, specific meanings, and specific experiences (e.g. "Who was the first president of the U.S.A.?", or "What did I eat for breakfast four days ago?"). [[Procedural memory]] allows us to remember actions and motor sequences (e.g. how to ride a bicycle) and is often dubbed implicit knowledge or memory .

Cognitive scientists study memory just as psychologists do, but tend to focus in more on how memory bears on [[cognitive process]]es, and the interrelationship between cognition and memory. One example of this could be, what mental processes does a person go through to retrieve a long-lost memory? Or, what differentiates between the cognitive process of recognition (seeing hints of something before remembering it, or memory in context) and recall (retrieving a memory, as in "fill-in-the-blank")?

===Perception and action===
[[Image:Necker cube.svg|thumb|150px|[[The Necker cube]], an example of an optical illusion]]
[[Image:Grey square optical illusion.PNG|thumb|right|An optical illusion. The square A is exactly the same shade of gray as square B. See [[checker shadow illusion]].]]

{{Main|Perception}}

Perception is the ability to take in information via the [[senses]], and process it in some way. [[Visual perception|Vision]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] are two dominant senses that allow us to perceive the environment. Some questions in the study of visual perception, for example, include: (1) How are we able to recognize objects?, (2) Why do we perceive a continuous visual environment, even though we only see small bits of it at any one time? One tool for studying visual perception is by looking at how people process [[optical illusion]]s. The image on the right of a Necker cube is an example of a bistable percept, that is, the cube can be interpreted as being oriented in two different directions.

The study of [[Haptic perception|haptic]] ([[Touch|tactile]]), [[olfactory]], and [[gustatory]] stimuli also fall into the domain of perception.

Action is taken to refer to the output of a system. In humans, this is accomplished through motor responses. Spatial planning and movement, speech production, and complex motor movements are all aspects of action.

===Consciousness===
{{Main|Consciousness}}

Consciousness is the awareness whether something is an external object or something within oneself. 
This helps the mind having the ability to experience or to feel a sense of [[self]].

==Research methods==
Many different methodologies are used to study cognitive science. As the field is highly interdisciplinary, research often cuts across multiple areas of study, drawing on research methods from [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[computer science]] and [[systems theory]].

===Behavioral experiments===
In order to have a description of what constitutes intelligent behavior, one must study behavior itself. This type of research is closely tied to that in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[psychophysics]]. By measuring behavioral responses to different stimuli, one can understand something about how those stimuli are processed. Lewandowski and Strohmetz (2009) review a collection of innovative uses of behavioral measurement in psychology including behavioral traces, behavioral observations, and behavioral choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Actions can speak as loud as words: Measuring behavior in psychological science | first1 = Gary | last1 = Lewandowski | first2 = David | last2 = Strohmetz | journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | year = 2009| pages = 992–1002 | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00229  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral traces are pieces of evidence that indicate behavior occurred, but the actor is not present (e.g., litter in a parking lot or readings on an electric meter). Behavioral observations involve the direct witnessing of the actor engaging in the behavior (e.g., watching how close a person sits next to another person). Behavioral choices are when a person selects between two or more options (e.g., voting behavior, choice of a punishment for another participant).
* ''Reaction time.'' The time between the presentation of a stimulus and an appropriate response can indicate differences between two cognitive processes, and can indicate some things about their nature. For example, if in a search task the reaction times vary proportionally with the number of elements, then it is evident that this cognitive process of searching involves serial instead of parallel processing.
* ''Psychophysical responses.'' Psychophysical experiments are an old psychological technique, which has been adopted by cognitive psychology. They typically involve making judgments of some physical property, e.g. the loudness of a sound. Correlation of subjective scales between individuals can show cognitive or sensory biases as compared to actual physical measurements. Some examples include:
** sameness judgments for colors, tones, textures, etc.
** threshold differences for colors, tones, textures, etc.
* ''[[Eye tracking]].'' This methodology is used to study a variety of cognitive processes, most notably visual perception and language processing. The fixation point of the eyes is linked to an individual's focus of attention. Thus, by monitoring eye movements, we can study what information is being processed at a given time. Eye tracking allows us to study cognitive processes on extremely short time scales. Eye movements reflect online decision making during a task, and they provide us with some insight into the ways in which those decisions may be processed.

===Brain imaging===

Brain imaging involves analyzing activity within the brain while performing various tasks. This allows us to link behavior and brain function to help understand how information is processed. Different types of imaging techniques vary in their temporal (time-based) and spatial (location-based) resolution. Brain imaging is often used in [[cognitive neuroscience]].
* ''[[Single photon emission computed tomography]]'' and ''[[Positron emission tomography]]''. SPECT and PET use radioactive isotopes, which are injected into the subject's bloodstream and taken up by the brain. By observing which areas of the brain take up the radioactive isotope, we can see which areas of the brain are more active than other areas. PET has similar spatial resolution to fMRI, but it has extremely poor temporal resolution.
* ''[[Electroencephalography]]''. EEG measures the electrical fields generated by large populations of neurons in the cortex by placing a series of electrodes on the scalp of the subject. This technique has an extremely high temporal resolution, but a relatively poor spatial resolution.
* ''[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]]''. fMRI measures the relative amount of oxygenated blood flowing to different parts of the brain. More oxygenated blood in a particular region is assumed to correlate with an increase in neural activity in that part of the brain. This allows us to localize particular functions within different brain regions. fMRI has moderate spatial and temporal resolution.
* ''[[Optical imaging]]''. This technique uses infrared transmitters and receivers to measure the amount of light reflectance by blood near different areas of the brain. Since oxygenated and deoxygenated blood reflects light by different amounts, we can study which areas are more active (i.e., those that have more oxygenated blood). Optical imaging has moderate temporal resolution, but poor spatial resolution. It also has the advantage that it is extremely safe and can be used to study infants' brains.
* ''[[Magnetoencephalography]].'' MEG measures magnetic fields resulting from cortical activity. It is similar to [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], except that it has improved spatial resolution since the magnetic fields it measures are not as blurred or attenuated by the scalp, meninges and so forth as the electrical activity measured in EEG is. MEG uses SQUID sensors to detect tiny magnetic fields.

===Computational modeling===
{{See also|Computational cognition}}
[[Image:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|200px|An [[artificial neural network]] with two layers.]]

[[computer model|Computational models]] require a mathematically and logically formal representation of a problem. Computer models are used in the simulation and experimental verification of different specific and general [[property|properties]] of [[intelligence]].  Computational modeling can help us understand the functional organization of a particular cognitive phenomenon.
There are two basic approaches to cognitive modeling. The first is focused on abstract mental functions of an intelligent mind and operates using symbols, and the second, which follows the neural and associative properties of the human brain, is called subsymbolic.
* ''Symbolic modeling'' evolved from the computer science paradigms using the technologies of [[knowledge-based systems]], as well as a philosophical perspective, see for example "Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence" ([[GOFAI]]). They are developed by the first cognitive researchers and later used in [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]] for [[expert system]]s . Since the early 1990s it was generalized in [[systemics]] for the investigation of functional human-like intelligence models, such as [[personoid]]s, and, in parallel, developed as the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|SOAR]] environment. Recently, especially in the context of cognitive decision making, symbolic cognitive modeling has been extended to the [[socio-cognitive]] approach, including social and organization cognition, interrelated with a sub-symbolic non-conscious layer.
* ''Subsymbolic modeling'' includes ''[[Connectionism|connectionist/neural network models]].'' Connectionism relies on the idea that the mind/brain is composed of simple nodes and its problem-solving capacity derives from the connections between them. [[Neural nets]] are textbook implementations of this approach. Some critics of this approach feel that while these models approach biological reality as a representation of how the system works these models lack explanatory powers because, even in systems endowed with simple connection rules, the emerging high complexity makes them less interpretable at the connection-level than they apparently are at the macroscopic level.
* Other approaches gaining in popularity include (1) the use of [[Cognitive model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] theory and (2) also techniques putting symbolic models and connectionist models into correspondence (Neural-symbolic integration or [[hybrid intelligent systems]]). [[Bayesian cognitive science|Bayesian models]], often drawn from [[machine learning]], are also gaining popularity.

All the above approaches tend to be generalized to the form of integrated computational models of a synthetic/abstract intelligence, in order to be applied to the explanation and improvement of individual and social/organizational [[decision-making]] and [[Psychology of reasoning|reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ron (ed.), Grounding Social Sciences in Cognitive Sciences. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiological methods===
Research methods borrowed directly from [[neuroscience]] and [[neuropsychology]] can also help us to understand aspects of intelligence. These methods allow us to understand how intelligent behavior is implemented in a physical system.

* [[Transcranial direct current stimulation|Direct brain stimulation]]

==Key findings==
Cognitive science has given rise to models of human [[cognitive bias]] and [[risk]] perception, and has been influential in the development of [[behavioral finance]], part of [[economics]].  It has also given rise to a new theory of the [[philosophy of mathematics]], and many theories of [[artificial intelligence]], [[persuasion]] and [[coercion]]. It has made its presence known in the [[philosophy of language]] and [[epistemology]] as well as constituting a substantial wing of modern [[linguistics]]. Fields of cognitive science have been influential in understanding the brain's particular functional systems (and functional deficits) ranging from speech production to auditory processing and visual perception. It has made progress in understanding how damage to particular areas of the brain affect cognition, and it has helped to uncover the root causes and results of specific dysfunction, such as [[dyslexia]], [[anopia]], and [[hemispatial neglect]].

==History==
The cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s, called the [[cognitive revolution]]. Cognitive science has a prehistory traceable back to ancient Greek philosophical texts (see [[Plato]]'s [[Meno]] and [[Aristotle]]'s [[De Anima]]); and includes writers such as [[Descartes]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Benedict de Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], [[Pierre Cabanis]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[John Locke]].  However, although these early writers contributed greatly to the philosophical discovery of [[mind]] and this would ultimately lead to the development of psychology, they were working with an entirely different set of tools and core concepts than those of the cognitive scientist.

The modern culture of cognitive science can be traced back to the early [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] in the 1930s and 1940s, such as [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]], who sought to understand the organizing principles of the mind. McCulloch and Pitts developed the first variants of what are now known as [[artificial neural networks]], models of computation inspired by the structure of [[biological neural networks]].

Another precursor was the early development of the [[theory of computation]] and the [[digital computer]] in the 1940s and 1950s. [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alonzo Church]], [[Alan Turing]], and [[John von Neumann]] were instrumental in these developments. The modern computer, or [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann machine]], would play a central role in cognitive science, both as a metaphor for the mind, and as a tool for investigation.

The first instance of cognitive science experiments being done at an academic institution took place at [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], established by [[J.C.R. Licklider]] working within the psychology department and conducting experiments using computer memory as models for human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Hafner, K., &amp; Lyon, M. (1996). Where wizards stay up late: The origins of the Internet. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster., page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, [[Noam Chomsky]] published a scathing review of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''. At the time, Skinner's [[behaviorist]] paradigm dominated the field of psychology within the United States. Most psychologists focused on functional relations between stimulus and response, without positing internal representations. Chomsky argued that in order to explain language, we needed a theory like [[generative grammar]], which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order.

The term ''cognitive science'' was coined by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher Longuet-Higgins]] in his 1973 commentary on the [[Lighthill report]], which concerned the then-current state of [[Artificial Intelligence]] research.&lt;ref&gt;
Longuet-Higgins, H. C. (1973). "Comments on the Lighthill Report and the Sutherland Reply", in ''Artificial Intelligence: a paper symposium'', Science Research Council, 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; In the same decade, the journal ''[[Cognitive Science (journal)|Cognitive Science]]'' and the [[Cognitive Science Society]] were founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/about_description.html Cognitive Science Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717134015/http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/about_description.html |date=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding meeting of the [[Cognitive Science Society]] was held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1979, which resulted in cognitive science becoming an internationally visible enterprise.&lt;ref name="cogsci.ucsd.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/about-us/ucsd-cog-sci/ |title=UCSD Cognitive Science - UCSD Cognitive Science |access-date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Hampshire College]] started the first undergraduate education program in Cognitive Science, led by [[Neil Stillings]].  In 1982, with assistance from Professor Stillings, [[Vassar College]] became the first institution in the world to grant an undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 729 |url=http://cogsci.vassar.edu/about/index.html |title=About - Cognitive Science - Vassar College |publisher=Cogsci.vassar.edu |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the first Cognitive Science Department in the world was founded at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="cogsci.ucsd.edu"/&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, as access to computers increased, [[artificial intelligence]] research expanded. Researchers such as [[Marvin Minsky]] would write computer programs in languages such as [[LISP]] to attempt to formally characterize the steps that human beings went through, for instance, in making decisions and solving problems, in the hope of better understanding human [[thought]], and also in the hope of creating artificial minds. This approach is known as "symbolic AI".

Eventually the limits of the symbolic AI research program became apparent. For instance, it seemed to be unrealistic to comprehensively list human knowledge in a form usable by a symbolic computer program. The late 80s and 90s saw the rise of [[neural networks]] and [[connectionism]] as a research paradigm. Under this point of view, often attributed to [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart]], the mind could be characterized as a set of complex associations, represented as a layered network.  Critics argue that there are some phenomena which are better captured by symbolic models, and that connectionist models are often so complex as to have little explanatory power. Recently symbolic and connectionist models have been combined, making it possible to take advantage of both forms of explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Artur S. d'Avila Garcez]], Luis C. Lamb and Dov M.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Needham, MA. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  While both connectionism and symbolic approaches have proven useful for testing various hypotheses and exploring approaches to understanding aspects of cognition and lower level brain functions, neither are biologically realistic and therefore, both suffer from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-OCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Geographies: Feminism and the Microstructure of Cognition|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317958765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20realism%22&amp;f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Connectionism has proven useful for exploring computationally how cognition emerges in development and occurs in the human brain, and has provided alternatives to strictly domain-specific / domain general approaches. For example, scientists such as Jeff Elman, Liz Bates, and Annette Karmiloff-Smith have posited that networks in the brain emerge from the dynamic interaction between them and environmental input.&lt;ref&gt;Karmiloff-Smith, A. (2015). An alternative to domain-general or domain-specific frameworks for theorizing about human evolution and ontogenesis.

Some of the more recognized names in cognitive science are usually either the most controversial or the most cited. Within philosophy, some familiar names include [[Daniel Dennett]], who writes from a computational systems perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/computational-mind/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Rescorla|first=Michael|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Searle]], known for his controversial [[Chinese room]] argument,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/chineser/|title=Chinese Room Argument|last=Hauser|first=Larry|date=|website=Internet Enclclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerry Fodor]], who advocates [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fodor/|title=Fodor, Jerry {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others include [[David Chalmers]], who advocates [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] and is also known for articulating [[the hard problem of consciousness]], and [[Douglas Hofstadter]], famous for writing ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', which questions the nature of words and thought.

In the realm of linguistics, [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[George Lakoff]] have been influential (both have also become notable as political commentators). In [[artificial intelligence]], [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], and [[Allen Newell]]  are prominent.

Popular names in the discipline of psychology include [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]], [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]], [[Philip Johnson-Laird]],  and [[Steven Pinker]]. Anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]], [[Edwin Hutchins]], and [[Scott Atran]],    have been involved in collaborative projects with cognitive and social psychologists, political scientists and evolutionary biologists in attempts to develop general theories of culture formation, religion, and political association.

Computational theories (with models and simulations) have also been developed, by the likes of [[David Rumelhart]], [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]], [[Philip Johnson-Laird]], and so on.

Other contributions have been made by Marvin Minsky and Noam Chomsky.

The '''Compact Linear Collider''' (CLIC) is a concept for a future linear [[particle accelerator]] that aims to explore the next [[energy]] frontier. CLIC would collide [[electron|electrons]] with [[positron|positrons]] and is currently the only mature option for a multi-TeV linear [[collider]].

CLIC is proposed to be built at [[CERN]], across the border between [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] near [[Geneva]], with ﬁrst [[Particle beam|beams]] starting by the time the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) has ﬁnished operations around 2035.&lt;ref name=Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016/&gt;

The CLIC accelerator would use a novel two-beam acceleration technique at an [[acceleration]] [[gradient]] of 100 M[[electronvolt|eV]]/m, and its staged construction would provide [[collision|collisions]] at three [[center of mass|centre-of-mass]] [[energy|energies]] up to 3 TeV for [[mathematical optimization|optimal]] [[physics]] reach.&lt;ref name="Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016" /&gt; Cutting-edge [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) are being carried out in the study to achieve the high precision physics goals under challenging beam and [[background radiation|background]] conditions.

CLIC aims to discover new physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, through precision [[measurement]]''s'' of [[Standard Model]] properties as well as direct detection of new particles. The collider would offer superior sensitivity to [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] states, exceeding the predicted precision of the full LHC programme.&lt;ref name="Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016" /&gt; The current CLIC design includes the possibility for electron beam [[polarization (waves)|polarisation]], further constraining the underlying physics.&lt;ref name="Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016" /&gt;

The CLIC study produced a Conceptual Design Report (CDR) in 2012 and is working to present the case for the CLIC concept for the next Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics in 2019-2020.

== Background ==
There are two main types of particle colliders, which differ in the types of particles they collide: [[lepton]] colliders and [[hadron]] colliders. Each type of collider can produce different ﬁnal states of particles and can study different physics phenomena. Examples of hadron colliders are [[Intersecting Storage Rings|ISR]] at CERN, [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] at CERN, [[Tevatron]] in [[United States]], and the LHC at CERN. Examples of lepton colliders are [[SuperKEKB]] in [[Japan]], [[Beijing Electron–Positron Collider II|BEPC II]] in [[China]], [[DAFNE]] in [[Italy]], [[VEPP-2000|VEPP]] in [[Russia]], [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|SLAC]] in [[United States]], and [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]] at CERN. Some of these lepton colliders are still running.

Hadrons are compound objects, which leads to more complicated collision events and limits the achievable precision of physics measurements. Lepton colliders collide [[Elementary particle|fundamental particles]], therefore the initial state of each event is known and higher precision measurements can be achieved.

== Three energy stages ==

CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in three stages with different centre-of-mass energies: 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV, and 3 TeV.&lt;ref name=Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016/&gt; The [[luminosity|luminosities]] at each stage are expected to be 500 [[barn_(unit)|fb]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.5 ab&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 3 ab&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively,&lt;ref name=Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016/&gt; providing a broad physics programme over a 22-year period. These centre-of-mass energies have been motivated by current LHC data and physics potential studies carried out by the CLIC study.&lt;ref name=Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016/&gt;

Already at 380 GeV CLIC has good coverage of [[Standard Model]] physics; the energy stages beyond this allow for the discovery of new physics as well as increased precision of [[Standard Model]] processes. Additionally, CLIC will operate at the [[top quark]] [[pair production|pair-production]] threshold around 350 GeV with the aim of precisely measuring the properties of the top quark.&lt;ref name="Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016" /&gt;

== Physics case for CLIC ==
The CLIC linear collider would allow the exploration of new energy frontiers, provide possible solutions to unanswered problems, and enable the discovery of phenomena beyond our current understanding.
=== Higgs physics ===
The current LHC data suggest that the particle found in 2012 is the [[Higgs boson]] as predicted by the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics.&lt;ref name=atlas&gt;

=== Top-quark physics ===
[[File:CLICdp CLIC ILD ttbar 3TeV.png|alt=|thumb|280x280px|A top quark event at 3 TeV reconstructed in a simulated detector for CLIC]]
The top quark, the heaviest of all known fundamental particles, has currently never been studied in [[electron]]-[[positron]] collisions.&lt;ref name=Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016/&gt; The CLIC linear collider plans to have an extensive top quark physics programme. A major aim of this programme would be a threshold scan around the top quark pair-production threshold (~350 GeV) to precisely determine the [[mass]] and other signiﬁcant properties of the top quark. For this scan, CLIC currently plans to devote 15% of the running time of the ﬁrst stage, collecting 100 fb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016/&gt; This study would allow the top quark mass to be ascertained in a theoretically well-deﬁned manner and at a higher precision than possible with hadron colliders.&lt;ref name=Linssen_CLIC_CERN-2012/&gt; CLIC would also aim to measure the top quark electroweak couplings to the [[W and Z bosons|Z boson]] and the photon, as deviations of these values from those predicted by the [[Standard Model]] could be evidence of new physics phenomena, such as extra dimensions. Further observation of top quark decays with [[Flavour (particle physics)|ﬂavour]]-changing neutral currents at CLIC would be an indirect indication of new physics, as these should not be seen by CLIC under current [[Standard Model]] predictions.&lt;ref name=Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016/&gt;

=== New phenomena ===
CLIC could discover new physics phenomena either through indirect measurements or by direct observation. Large deviations in precision measurements of particle properties from the [[Standard Model]] prediction would indirectly signal the presence of new physics. Such indirect methods give access to energy scales far beyond the available collision energy, reaching sensitivities of up to tens of TeV. Examples of indirect measurements CLIC would be capable of at 3&amp;nbsp;TeV are: the detection of a [[W' and Z' bosons|Z′ boson]] (reach up to ~30&amp;nbsp;TeV) indicating a simple gauge extension beyond the [[Standard Model]];&lt;ref name=Blaising_Wells_CLIC_CERN-2012&gt;

== Beams and accelerators ==
To reach the desired 3 TeV beam energy, while keeping the length of the accelerator compact, CLIC targets an accelerating gradient up to 100 MV/m. CLIC is based on normal-[[Electrical conductivity|conducting]] acceleration cavities operated at room [[temperature]], as they allow for higher acceleration gradients than [[superconductivity|superconducting]] cavities. With this technology, the main limitation is the [[High voltage|high-voltage]] breakdown rate (BDR), which follows the [[empiricism|empirical]] law &lt;math&gt;BDR \propto E^{30}\tau^5&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the accelerating gradient and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the RF pulse length.&lt;ref name=Grudiev_Calatroni_Wuensch_LocalFieldQuantity_CERN-2009&gt;

In order to reach these high accelerating gradients while keeping the power consumption affordable, CLIC makes use of a novel two-beam-acceleration scheme: a so-called Drive Beam runs parallel to the colliding Main Beam. The Drive Beam is decelerated in special devices called Power Extraction and Transfer Structures (PETS) that extract energy from the Drive Beam in the form of powerful [[radio frequency|Radio Frequency]] (RF) waves, which is then used to accelerate the Main Beam. Up to 90% of the energy of the Drive Beam is extracted and efﬁciently transferred to the Main Beam.&lt;ref name=Adli_CLIC_CERN-2009&gt;

=== Main beam ===
The electrons needed for the main beam are produced by illuminating a [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]]-type [[cathode]] with a Q-switched polarised [[laser]], and are longitudinally polarised at the level of 80%.&lt;ref name=Aicheler_CLIC_CERN-2012&gt;

}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[positron]]''s'' for the main beam are produced by sending a 5 GeV electron beam on a [[tungsten]] target. After an initial acceleration up to 2.86 GeV, both electrons and positrons enter damping rings for [[Beam emittance|emittance]] reduction by [[radiation damping]]. Both beams are then further accelerated to 9 GeV in a common booster linac. Long transfer lines transport the two beams to the beginning of the main [[CERN Hadron LINACs|linacs]] where they are accelerated up to 1.5 TeV before going into the Beam Delivery System (BSD), which squeezes and brings the beams into collision. The two beams collide at the IP with 20 m[[radian|rad]] crossing [[angle]] in the horizontal plane.&lt;ref name=Aicheler_CLIC_CERN-2012/&gt;

=== Drive beam ===
Each Drive Beam complex is composed of a 2.5&amp;nbsp;km-long linac, followed by a Drive Beam Recombination Complex: a system of delay lines and combiner rings where the incoming beam pulses are interleaved to ultimately form a 12&amp;nbsp;GHz sequence and a local beam [[electric current|current]] as high as 100[[ampere|A]].&lt;ref name=Aicheler_CLIC_CERN-2012/&gt; Each 2.5&amp;nbsp;km-long Drive Beam linac is powered by 1&amp;nbsp;GHz [[klystron]]''s''. This produces a 148 µs-long beam (for the 1.5 TeV energy stage scenario) with a bunching [[frequency]] of 0.5&amp;nbsp;GHz. Every 244 ns the bunching phase is switched by 180 degrees, i.e. odd and even buckets at 1&amp;nbsp;GHz are ﬁlled alternately. This phase-coding allows the ﬁrst factor two recombination: the odd bunches are delayed in a Delay Loop (DL), while the even bunches bypass it. The [[time of flight]] of the DL is about 244 ns and tuned at the picosecond level such that the two trains of bunches can merge, forming several 244 ns-long trains with bunching frequency at 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, separated by 244 ns of empty space. This new time-structure allows for further factor 3 and factor 4 recombination in the following combiner rings with a similar mechanism as in the DL. The ﬁnal [[time]] structure of the beam is made of several (up to 24) 244 ns-long trains of bunches at 12&amp;nbsp;GHz, spaced by gaps of about 5.5 µs. The recombination is timed such that each combined train arrives in its own decelerator sector, synchronized with the arrival of the Main Beam.&lt;ref name=Aicheler_CLIC_CERN-2012/&gt; The use of low-frequency (1&amp;nbsp;GHz), long-pulse-length (148 µs) klystrons for accelerating the Drive Beam and the beam recombination makes it more convenient than using klystrons to directly accelerate the Main Beam.&lt;ref name=Aicheler_CLIC_CERN-2012/&gt;[[File:CLIC two beam module installed in the CLIC Test Facility at CERN (CTF3).jpg|thumb|Image of the CLIC Two Beam Module in the CLIC Test Facility, CERN ([[CTF3 (CERN)|CTF3]]).

=== Test facilities ===
The main [[technology]] challenges of the CLIC accelerator design have been successfully addressed in various test facilities. The Drive Beam production and recombination, and the two-beam acceleration concept were demonstrated at the [[CTF3 (CERN)|CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3)]].

== CLIC detector ==
[[File:CLICdet detector.png|thumb|CLICdet detector|alt=|280x280px]]
A state-of-the-art [[detector]] is essential to proﬁt from the complete physics potential of CLIC. The current detector design, named CLICdet, has been optimised via full [[simulation]] studies and R&amp;D activities.&lt;ref name="Alipour_CERN-2017"&gt;{{cite report

 |title= CLICdet: The post-CDR CLIC detector model
 |location=Geneva, Switzerland
 |year=2017
}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detector follows the standard design of grand particle detectors at high energy colliders: a cylindrical detector volume with a layered conﬁguration, surrounding the beam axis. CLICdet would have dimensions of ~13 x 12 m (height x length) and weigh ~8000 tonnes.&lt;ref name="Alipour_CERN-2017" /&gt;

=== Detector Layers ===
CLICdet consists of four main layers of increasing radius: vertex and tracking system, [[calorimeters]], [[solenoid]] [[magnet]], [[muon]] detector.&lt;ref name="Alipour_CERN-2017" /&gt;
[[File:Compact Linear Collider CLICpix2 C3PD 60.tif|alt=|thumb|280x280px|A silicon pixel detector prototype for CLIC: High-Voltage CMOS sensor (top) and a CLICpix2 readout chip (bottom) that are glued to each other.]]
The vertex and tracking system is located at the innermost region of CLICdet and aims to detect the position and momenta of particles with minimum adverse impact on their [[energy]] and [[trajectory]]. The vertex detector is cylindrical with three double layers of detector materials at increasing radii and has three segmented disks at each end in a spiral conﬁguration to aid air ﬂow cooling. These are assumed to be made of 25x25 µm2 silicon pixels of thickness 50&amp;nbsp;µm, and the aim is to have a single point resolution of 3&amp;nbsp;µm. The tracking system is made of [[silicon]] [[sensor]] modules expected to be 300&amp;nbsp;µm thick.&lt;ref name=Alipour_CERN-2017/&gt;

The calorimeters surround the vertex and tracking system and aim to measure the energy of particles via absorption. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) consists ~40 layers of silicon tungsten in a sandwich structure; the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) has 60 [[steel]] absorber plates with [[scintillation (physics)|scintillating]] material inserted in between.&lt;ref name="Alipour_CERN-2017" /&gt;

These inner CLICdet layers are enclosed in a superconducting solenoid magnet with a ﬁeld strength of 4 [[tesla (unit)|T]]. This magnetic ﬁeld bends charged particles, allowing for [[momentum]] and [[electric charge|charge]] measurements. The magnet is then surrounded by an [[iron]] yoke which would contain large area detectors for muon identiﬁcation.&lt;ref name="Alipour_CERN-2017" /&gt;

The detector also has a luminosity calorimeter (LumiCal) to measure the products of [[Bhabha scattering]] events; a beam calorimeter to complete the ECAL coverage down to 10 mrads polar angle; and an intratrain feedback system to counteract luminosity loss due to correct for relative beam-beam offsets.&lt;ref name="Alipour_CERN-2017" /&gt;
=== Power pulsing and cooling ===
[[File:CLIC gas cooling vertex.png|thumb|Gas-cooling vertex streamlines.|alt=|280x280px]]Strict requirements on the material budget for the vertex and tracking system does not allow the use of conventional [[liquid]] cooling systems for CLICdet. Therefore, it is proposed that a dry gas cooling system will be used for this inner region. Air gaps have been factored into the design of the detector to allow the ﬂow of the [[gas]], which will be air or [[Nitrogen]].&lt;ref name=Duarte-Ramos_Klempt_Nuiry_CLIC_CERN-2016&gt;

== Status ==
As of 2017, approximately two percent of the CERN annual budget is invested in the development of CLIC technologies. The ﬁrst stage of CLIC with a length of around {{cvt|11|km|0}} is currently estimated at a cost of six to seven billion CHF.&lt;ref name=Boland_CLIC_CERN-2016/&gt; CLIC is a global project of more than 70 institutes in more than 30 countries. It consists of two collaborations: the CLIC detector and physics collaboration (CLICdp), and the CLIC accelerator study. CLIC is currently in the development stage, conducting performance studies for accelerator parts and systems, detector technology and optimisation studies, and physics analysis. In parallel, the collaborations are working with the theory community to evaluate the physics potential of CLIC. The CLIC project has produced a Conceptual Design Report (CDR) in 2012 and is working to present the case for the CLIC concept for the next Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics in 2019-2020.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16129">'''Data-driven control systems''' are a broad family of [[Control theory|control systems]], in which the [[System identification|identification]] of the process model and/or the design of the controller are based entirely on ''experimental data'' collected from the plant &lt;ref&gt;Bazanella, A.S., Campestrini, L., Eckhard, D. (2012). Data-driven controller design: the &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; approach. Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-007-2300-9}}, 208 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In many control applications, trying to write a mathematical model of the plant is considered a hard task, requiring efforts and time to the process and control engineers. This problem is overcome by ''data-driven'' methods, which allow to fit a system model to the experimental data collected, choosing it in a specific models class. The control engineer can then exploit this model to design a proper controller for the system. However, it is still difficult to find a simple yet reliable model for a physical system, that includes only those dynamics of the system that are of interest for the control specifications. The ''direct'' data-driven methods allow to tune a controller, belonging to a given class, without the need of an identified model of the system. In this way, one can also simply weight process dynamics of interest inside the control cost function, and exclude those dynamics that are out of interest.

== Overview ==

The ''standard'' approach to control systems design is organized in two-steps: 
# Model identification aims at estimating a nominal model of the system &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} = G\left(q; \widehat{\theta}_N\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the unit-delay operator (for discrete-time transfer functions representation) and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}_N&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of parameters of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; identified on a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data. Then, validation consists in constructing the ''uncertainty set'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; that contains the true system &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; at a certain probability level.
# Controller design aims at finding a controller &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; achieving closed-loop stability and meeting the required performance with &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Typical objectives of [[System Identification|system identification]] are to have &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;, and to have &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; as small as possible. However, from an [[System identification#Identification for control|identification for control]] perspective, what really matters is the performance achieved by the controller, not the intrinsic quality of the model.

One way to deal with uncertainty is to design a controller that has an acceptable performance with all models in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, including &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is the main idea behind [[robust control]] design procedure, that aims at building frequency domain uncertainty descriptions of the process. However, being based on worst-case assumptions rather than on the idea of averaging out the noise, this approach typically leads to ''conservative'' uncertainty sets. Rather, data-driven techniques deal with uncertainty by working on experimental data, and avoiding excessive conservativism.

In the following, the main classifications of data-driven control systems are presented.

=== Indirect and direct methods ===
There are many methods available to control the systems. 
The fundamental distinction is between '''indirect''' and '''direct''' controller design methods. The former group of techniques is still retaining the standard two-step approach, ''i.e.'' first a model is identified, then a controller is tuned based on such model. The main issue in doing so is that the controller is computed from the estimated model &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; (according to the [[Stochastic control#Certainty equivalence|certainty equivalence]] principle), but in practice &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} \neq G_0&lt;/math&gt;. To overcome this problem, the idea behind the latter group of techniques is to map the experimental data ''directly'' onto the controller, without any model to be identified in between.

=== Iterative and noniterative methods ===

Another important distinction is between '''iterative''' and '''noniterative''' (or '''one-shot''') methods. In the former group, repeated iterations are needed to estimate the controller parameters, during which the [[Optimization_problem|optimization problem]] is performed based on the results of the previous iteration, and the estimation is expected to become more and more accurate at each iteration. This approach is also prone to on-line implementations (see below). In the latter group, the (optimal) controller parametrization is provided with a single optimization problem. This is particularly important for those systems in which iterations or repetitions of data collection experiments are limited or even not allowed (for example, due to economic aspects). In such cases, one should select a design technique capable of delivering a controller on a single data set. This approach is often implemented off-line (see below).

=== On-line and off-line methods ===

Since, on practical industrial applications, open-loop or closed-loop data are often available continuously, '''on-line''' data-driven techniques use those data to improve the quality of the identified model and/or the performance of the controller each time new information is collected on the plant. Instead, '''off-line''' approaches work on batch of data, which may be collected only once, or multiple times at a regular (but rather long) interval of time.

== Iterative feedback tuning ==

The iterative feedback tuning (IFT) method was introduced in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Hjalmarsson, H., Gevers, M., Gunnarsson, S., &amp; Lequin, O. (1998). Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications. IEEE control systems, 18(4), 26–41.&lt;/ref&gt;, starting from the observation that, in identification for control, each iteration is based on the (wrong) certainty equivalence principle.

IFT is a model-free technique for the direct iterative optimization of the parameters of a fixed-order controller; such parameters can be successively updated using information coming from standard (closed-loop) system operation.

Let &lt;math&gt;y^d&lt;/math&gt; be a desired output to the reference signal &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; the error between the achieved and desired response is &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\rho)=y(\rho)-y^d&lt;/math&gt;. The control design objective can be formulated as the minimization of the objective function:

:&lt;math&gt; J(\rho) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{t=1}^N E\left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)^2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Given the objective function to minimize, the ''quasi-Newton method'' can be applied, i.e. a gradient-based minimization using a gradient search of the type:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_{i+1} = \rho_i - \gamma_i R_i^{-1}  \frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}(\rho_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The value &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the step size, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate positive definite matrix and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of the gradient; the true value of the gradient is given by the following:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dJ}{d\rho} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained through the following three-step methodology:

# Normal Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as reference; collect N measurements of the output &lt;math&gt;y(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(1)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Gradient Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and 0 as reference &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; inject the signal &lt;math&gt;r-y^{(1)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt; such that it is summed to the control variable output by &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, going as input into the plant. Collect the output, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(2)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Take the following as gradient approximation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho) = \frac{\delta C}{\delta \rho} (\rho) y^{(2)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

A crucial factor for the convergence speed of the algorithm is the choice of &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; is small, a good choice is the approximation given by the Gauss–Newton direction:

: &lt;math&gt; R_i = \frac 1 N \sum_{t=1}^N \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i) \frac{\delta \widehat{y}^T}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i).&lt;/math&gt;

== Noniterative correlation-based tuning ==

Noniterative correlation-based tuning (nCbT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller&lt;ref&gt;van Heusden, K., Karimi, A. and Bonvin, D. (2011), Data-driven model reference control with asymptotically guaranteed stability. Int. J. Adapt. Control Signal Process., 25: 331–351. doi:10.1002/acs.1212&lt;/ref&gt;. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denotes an unknown LTI stable SISO plant, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined reference model and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined weighting function. An LTI fixed-order controller is indicated as &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)=\beta^T \rho&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \rho \in \mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of LTI basis functions. Finally, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal LTI controller of any structure, guaranteeing a closed-loop function &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; when applied to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal is to minimize the following objective function:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\rho)=\left\| F \bigg( \frac{ K^* G-K(\rho)G }{ (1+K^* G)^2 } \bigg) \right\|_2^2. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex approximation of the objective function obtained from a model reference problem, supposing that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ (1+K(\rho)G) } \approx \frac{1}{ (1+K^*G) }&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is stable and minimum-phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the scheme in figure.

[[File:Noniterative Correlation-based Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The idea is that, when ''G'' is stable and minimum phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The input signal &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; is supposed to be a persistently exciting input signal and &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be generated by a stable data-generation mechanism. The two signals are thus uncorrelated in an open-loop experiment; hence, the ideal error &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The control objective thus consists in finding &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated.

The vector of ''instrumental variables'' &lt;math&gt;\zeta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta(t)=[r_W (t+\ell_1 ),r_W (t+\ell_1-1),\ldots,r_W (t),\ldots,r_W (t-\ell_1) ]^T &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; is large enough and &lt;math&gt;r_W (t)=Wr(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate filter.

The correlation function is:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{N,\ell_1} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \zeta(t) \varepsilon(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

and the optimization problem becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho} = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} f_{N,\ell_1}^T f_{N,\ell_1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting with &lt;math&gt;\phi_r (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be demonstrated that, under some assumptions, if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is selected as:

:&lt;math&gt;W(e^{-j\omega}) = \frac{F(e^{-j\omega})(1-M(e^{-j\omega}))}{\phi_r (\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

then, the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N,\ell_1 \to \infty, \ell_1/N \to \infty} \widehat{\rho} = \rho^*.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability constraint ===

There is no guarantee that the controller &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J_{N,\ell_1}&lt;/math&gt; is stable. Instability may occur in the following cases:

* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is non-minimum phase, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; may lead to cancellations in the right-half complex plane.
* If &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; (even if stabilizing) is not achievable, &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be stabilizing.
* Due to measurement noise, even if &lt;math&gt;K^*=K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stabilizing, data-estimated &lt;math&gt;\widehat{K}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be so.

Consider a stabilizing controller &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; and the closed loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;M_s=\frac{K_s G}{1+K_s G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Define:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) := M_s - K(\rho) G (1-M_s) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\rho) := \left\| \Delta(\rho) \right\|_\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

:'''Theorem''' 
:''The controller &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes the plant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if

# &lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is stable
# &lt;math&gt;\exist \delta_N \in (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt; \delta (\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;''

Condition 1. is enforced when:

* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stable
* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; contains an integrator (it is canceled).

The model reference design with stability constraint becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_s = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J(\rho) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \text{s.t. } \delta(\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;

A '''convex data-driven estimation''' of &lt;math&gt;\delta(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained through the [[discrete Fourier transform]]. 

Define the following:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \widehat{R}_r (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) r(t) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2 \\[4pt]
&amp; \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) \varepsilon(t,\rho) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For '''stable minimum phase plants''', the following '''convex data-driven oprimization problem''' is given:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\rho} &amp; = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) \\[3pt]
&amp; \text{s.t.} \\[3pt]
&amp; \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \leq \delta_N \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_r (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \\[4pt]
\omega_k &amp; = \frac{2 \pi k}{2\ell_2+1}, \qquad k=0,\ldots,\ell_2+1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Virtual reference feedback tuning ==

Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

VRFT was first proposed &lt;ref&gt;Guardabassi, Guido O., and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Approximate feedback linearization of discrete-time non-linear systems using virtual input direct design."

The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)&lt;/math&gt; from the measured output signal &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model M and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference from the measured output signal y.]]

The virtual signals are &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)=M^{-1} y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; e_v (t)=r_v (t) - y(t). &lt;/math&gt;

The optimal controller is obtained from noiseless data by solving the following optimization problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho}_\infty = \underset{\rho}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \lim_{N \to \infty} J_{vr} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where the optimization function is given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; J_{vr}^N (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left(u(t)-K(\rho) e_v(t) \right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

In [[optics]], '''dispersion''' is the phenomenon in which the [[phase velocity]] of a wave depends on its frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Media having this common property may be termed ''dispersive media''. Sometimes the term '''''chromatic'' dispersion''' is used for specificity.
Although the term is used in the field of optics to describe [[light]] and other [[electromagnetic wave]]s, dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion such as [[acoustic dispersion]] in the case of sound and seismic waves, in [[gravity wave]]s (ocean waves), and for telecommunication signals along [[transmission line]]s (such as [[coaxial cable]]) or [[optical fiber]].

In optics, one important and familiar consequence of dispersion is the change in the angle of [[refraction]] of different colors of light,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proximion.com/about-dispersion Dispersion Compensation] Retrieved 25-08-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in the spectrum produced by a dispersive [[prism]] and in [[chromatic aberration]] of lenses. Design of compound [[achromatic lens]]es, in which chromatic aberration is largely cancelled, uses a quantification of a glass's dispersion given by its [[Abbe number]] ''V'', where ''lower'' Abbe numbers correspond to ''greater'' dispersion over the [[visible spectrum]]. In some applications such as telecommunications, the absolute phase of a wave is often not important but only the propagation of [[wave packet]]s or "pulses"; in that case one is interested only in variations of [[group velocity]] with frequency, so-called [[group velocity dispersion|group-velocity dispersion]]

==Examples==
The most familiar example of dispersion is probably a [[rainbow]], in which dispersion causes the spatial separation of a white [[light]] into components of different [[wavelengths]] (different [[color]]s). However, dispersion also has an effect in many other circumstances: for example, group velocity dispersion (GVD) causes [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulses]] to spread in [[optical fiber]]s, degrading signals over long distances; also, a cancellation between group-velocity dispersion and [[nonlinear]] effects leads to [[soliton]] waves.

==Material and waveguide dispersion==
Most often, chromatic dispersion refers to bulk material dispersion, that is,  the change in [[refractive index]] with optical frequency. However, in a [[waveguide]] there is also the phenomenon of ''waveguide dispersion'', in which case a wave's phase velocity in a structure depends on its frequency simply due to the structure's geometry. More generally, "waveguide" dispersion can occur for waves propagating through any inhomogeneous structure (e.g., a [[photonic crystal]]), whether or not the waves are confined to some region.{{dubious|date=October 2014}} In a waveguide, ''both'' types of dispersion will generally be present, although they are not strictly additive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} For example, in fiber optics the material and waveguide dispersion can effectively cancel each other out to produce a [[zero-dispersion wavelength]], important for fast [[fiber-optic communication]].

==Material dispersion in optics==
[[File:Mplwp dispersion curves.svg|right|thumb|320px|The variation of refractive index vs. vacuum wavelength for various glasses. The wavelengths of visible light are shaded in grey.]]
[[File:Spidergraph Dispersion.GIF|320px|thumb|Influences of selected glass component additions on the mean dispersion of a specific base glass (''n''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; valid for ''λ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;486&amp;nbsp;nm (blue), ''n''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; valid for ''λ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;656&amp;nbsp;nm (red))&lt;ref&gt;[http://glassproperties.com/dispersion/ Calculation of the Mean Dispersion of Glasses]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Material dispersion can be a desirable or undesirable effect in optical applications. The dispersion of light by glass prisms is used to construct [[spectrometer]]s and [[spectroradiometer]]s. [[Holographic]] gratings are also used, as they allow more accurate discrimination of wavelengths. However, in lenses, dispersion causes [[chromatic aberration]], an undesired effect that may degrade images in microscopes, telescopes, and photographic objectives.

The ''[[phase velocity]]'', ''v'', of a wave in a given uniform medium is given by
:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum and ''n'' is the [[refractive index]] of the medium.

In general, the refractive index is some function of the frequency ''f'' of the light, thus ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''(''f''), or alternatively, with respect to the wave's wavelength ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''(''λ''). The wavelength dependence of a material's refractive index is usually quantified by its [[Abbe number]] or its coefficients in an empirical formula such as the [[Cauchy's equation|Cauchy]] or [[Sellmeier equation]]s.

Because of the [[Kramers–Kronig relations]], the wavelength dependence of the real part of the refractive index is related to the material [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], described by the imaginary part of the refractive index (also called the [[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]]). In particular, for non-magnetic materials ([[permeability (electromagnetism)|''μ'']]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[magnetic constant|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]), the [[linear response function|susceptibility]] ''χ'' that appears in the Kramers–Kronig relations is the [[electric susceptibility]] ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.

The most commonly seen consequence of dispersion in optics is the separation of [[electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation .28light.29|white light]] into a [[optical spectrum|color spectrum]] by a [[triangular prism (optics)|prism]]. From [[Snell's law]] it can be seen that the angle of [[refraction]] of light in a prism depends on the refractive index of the prism material. Since that refractive index varies with wavelength, it follows that the angle that the light is refracted by will also vary with wavelength, causing an angular separation of the colors known as ''angular dispersion''.

For visible light, refraction indices ''n'' of most transparent materials (e.g., air, glasses) decrease with increasing wavelength ''λ'':
:&lt;math&gt;1 &lt; n(\lambda_{\rm red}) &lt; n(\lambda_{\rm yellow}) &lt; n(\lambda_{\rm blue})\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dn}{d \lambda} &lt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the medium is said to have ''normal dispersion''. Whereas, if the index increases with increasing wavelength (which is typically the case in the ultraviolet&lt;ref&gt;Born, M. and Wolf, E. (1980) "Principles of Optics, 6th ed." pg. 93. Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;), the medium is said to have ''anomalous dispersion''.

At the interface of such a material with air or vacuum (index of ~1), Snell's law predicts that light incident at an angle ''θ'' to the [[surface normal|normal]] will be refracted at an angle arcsin({{sfrac|sin ''θ''|''n''}}). Thus, blue light, with a higher refractive index, will be bent more strongly than red light, resulting in the well-known [[rainbow]] pattern.

==Group and phase velocity==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Speed of sound]] --&gt;
Another consequence of dispersion manifests itself as a temporal effect. The formula ''v'' = {{sfrac|''c''|''n''}} calculates the ''phase velocity'' of a wave; this is the [[velocity]] at which the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of any one frequency component of the wave will propagate. This is not the same as the ''[[group velocity]]'' of the wave, that is the rate at which changes in [[amplitude]] (known as the ''envelope'' of the wave) will propagate. For a homogeneous medium, the group velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is related to the phase velocity ''v'' by (here ''λ'' is the wavelength in vacuum, not in the medium):
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\rm g} = \frac{c} { n - \lambda \frac{dn}{d\lambda} } = \frac{v} { 1 - \frac{\lambda}{n} \frac{dn}{d\lambda} }.&lt;/math&gt;

The group velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is often thought of as the velocity at which energy or information is conveyed along the wave. In most cases this is true, and the group velocity can be thought of as the ''[[signal velocity]]'' of the waveform. In some unusual circumstances, called cases of anomalous dispersion, the rate of change of the index of refraction with respect to the wavelength changes sign (becoming negative), in which case it is possible for the group velocity to exceed the speed of light (''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''). Anomalous dispersion occurs, for instance, where the wavelength of the light is close to an [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] resonance of the medium. When the dispersion is anomalous, however, group velocity is no longer an indicator of signal velocity. Instead, a signal travels at the speed of the wavefront, which is ''c'' irrespective of the index of refraction.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerfeld, A. (1960). Chapter 2 in Brillouin, Léon ''Wave Propagation and Group Velocity''. Academic Press: San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, it has become possible to create gases in which the group velocity is not only larger than the speed of light, but even negative. In these cases, a pulse can appear to exit a medium before it enters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wang, L.J. |author2=Kuzmich, A. |author3= Dogariu, A. |title=Gain-assisted superluminal light propagation|journal=Nature|volume=406|page=277|year=2000|bibcode= 2000Natur.406..277W |doi=10.1038/35018520 |issue=6793 |pmid=10917523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in these cases, however, a signal travels at, or less than, the speed of light, as demonstrated by Stenner, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stenner, M. D. |author2=Gauthier, D. J. |author3= Neifeld, M. A. |title=The speed of information in a 'fast-light' optical medium|journal=Nature|volume=425 |year=2003|bibcode= 2003Natur.425..695S |doi= 10.1038/nature02016|issue=6959|pmid=14562097|pages=695–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group velocity itself is usually a function of the wave's frequency. This results in [[group velocity dispersion]] (GVD), which causes a short pulse of light to spread in time as a result of different frequency components of the pulse travelling at different velocities. GVD is often quantified as the ''[[group delay]] dispersion parameter'' (again, this formula is for a uniform medium only):
:&lt;math&gt;D = - \frac{\lambda}{c} \, \frac{d^2 n}{d \lambda^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

If ''D'' is greater than zero, the medium is said to have ''positive dispersion'' (anomalous dispersion). If ''D'' is less than zero, the medium has ''negative dispersion'' (normal dispersion). If a light pulse is propagated through a normally dispersive medium, the result is the shorter wavelength components travel slower than the longer wavelength components. The pulse therefore becomes ''positively [[chirp]]ed'', or ''up-chirped'', increasing in frequency with time. Conversely, if a pulse travels through an anomalously dispersive medium, high frequency components travel faster than the lower ones, and the pulse becomes ''negatively [[chirp]]ed'', or ''down-chirped'', decreasing in frequency with time.

The result of GVD, whether negative or positive, is ultimately temporal spreading of the pulse. This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems based on optical fiber, since if dispersion is too high, a group of pulses representing a bit-stream will spread in time and merge, rendering the bit-stream unintelligible. This limits the length of fiber that a signal can be sent down without regeneration. One possible answer to this problem is to send signals down the optical fibre at a wavelength where the GVD is zero (e.g., around 1.3–1.5&amp;nbsp;μm in [[silica]] [[fibres]]), so pulses at this wavelength suffer minimal spreading from dispersion. In practice, however, this approach causes more problems than it solves because zero GVD unacceptably amplifies other nonlinear effects (such as [[four wave mixing]]). Another possible option is to use [[soliton (optics)|soliton]] pulses in the regime of negative dispersion, a form of optical pulse which uses a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] effect to self-maintain its shape. Solitons have the practical problem, however, that they require a certain power level to be maintained in the pulse for the nonlinear effect to be of the correct strength. Instead, the solution that is currently used in practice is to perform dispersion compensation, typically by matching the fiber with another fiber of opposite-sign dispersion so that the dispersion effects cancel; such compensation is ultimately limited by nonlinear effects such as [[self-phase modulation]], which interact with dispersion to make it very difficult to undo.

Dispersion control is also important in [[laser]]s that produce [[ultrashort pulse|short pulses]]. The overall dispersion of the [[laser construction|optical resonator]] is a major factor in determining the duration of the pulses emitted by the laser. A pair of [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] can be arranged to produce net negative dispersion, which can be used to balance the usually positive dispersion of the laser medium. [[Diffraction grating]]s can also be used to produce dispersive effects; these are often used in high-power laser amplifier systems. Recently, an alternative to prisms and gratings has been developed: [[chirped mirror]]s. These dielectric mirrors are coated so that different wavelengths have different penetration lengths, and therefore different group delays. The coating layers can be tailored to achieve a net negative dispersion.

==In waveguides==
[[Waveguide]]s are highly dispersive due to their geometry (rather than just to their material composition). [[Optical fiber]]s are a sort of waveguide for optical frequencies (light) widely used in modern telecommunications systems. The rate at which data can be transported on a single fiber is limited by pulse broadening due to chromatic dispersion among other phenomena.

In general, for a waveguide mode with an [[angular frequency]] ''ω''(''β'') at a [[propagation constant]] ''β'' (so that the electromagnetic fields in the propagation direction ''z'' oscillate proportional to ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''(''βz''−''ωt'')&lt;/sup&gt;), the group-velocity [[dispersion parameter]] ''D'' is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Ramaswami, Rajiv and Sivarajan, Kumar N. (1998) ''Optical Networks: A Practical Perspective''. Academic Press: London.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D = -\frac{2\pi c}{\lambda^2} \frac{d^2 \beta}{d\omega^2} = \frac{2\pi c}{v_g^2 \lambda^2} \frac{dv_g}{d\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2{{pi}}''c''|''ω''}} is the vacuum wavelength and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''dω''|''dβ''}} is the group velocity. This formula generalizes the one in the previous section for homogeneous media, and includes both waveguide dispersion and material dispersion. The reason for defining the dispersion in this way is that |''D''| is the (asymptotic) temporal pulse spreading Δ''t'' per unit bandwidth
Δ''λ'' per unit distance travelled, commonly reported in [[picosecond|ps]]/[[nanometre|nm]]/[[kilometre|km]] for optical fibers.

In the case of [[multi-mode optical fiber]]s, so-called [[modal dispersion]] will also lead to pulse  broadening. Even in [[single-mode fiber]]s, pulse broadening can occur as a result of [[polarization mode dispersion]] (since there are still two polarization modes). These are ''not'' examples of chromatic dispersion as they are not dependent on the wavelength or [[Spectral linewidth|bandwidth]] of the pulses propagated.

==Higher-order dispersion over broad bandwidths==
When a broad range of frequencies (a broad bandwidth) is present in a single wavepacket, such as in an [[ultrashort pulse]] or a [[chirp]]ed pulse or other forms of [[spread spectrum]] transmission, it may not be accurate to approximate the dispersion by a constant over the entire bandwidth, and more complex calculations are required to compute effects such as pulse spreading.

In particular, the dispersion parameter ''D'' defined above is obtained from only one derivative of the group velocity. Higher derivatives are known as ''higher-order dispersion''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-photonics.com/chromatic_dispersion.html Chromatic Dispersion], ''Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology'' (Wiley, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are simply a [[Taylor series]] expansion of the [[dispersion relation]] ''β''(''ω'') of the medium or waveguide around some particular frequency. Their effects can be computed via numerical evaluation of [[Fourier transform]]s of the waveform, via integration of higher-order [[slowly varying envelope approximation]]s, by a [[split-step method]] (which can use the exact dispersion relation rather than a Taylor series), or by direct simulation of the full [[Maxwell's equations]] rather than an approximate envelope equation.

In the [[technical terminology]] of [[gemology]], ''dispersion'' is the difference in the refractive index of a material at the B and G (686.7&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] and 430.8&amp;nbsp;nm) or C and F (656.3&amp;nbsp;nm and 486.1&amp;nbsp;nm) [[Fraunhofer lines|Fraunhofer wavelengths]], and is meant to express the degree to which a prism cut from the [[gemstone]] demonstrates "fire".  Fire is a colloquial term used by gemologists to describe a gemstone's dispersive nature or lack thereof. Dispersion is a material property. The amount of fire demonstrated by a given gemstone is a function of the gemstone's facet angles, the polish quality, the lighting environment, the material's refractive index, the saturation of color, and the orientation of the viewer relative to the gemstone.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemsociety.org/article/gemstone-dispersion/ What is Gemstone Dispersion?] by International Gem Society (IGS).  Retrieved 03-09-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==In imaging==
In photographic and microscopic lenses, dispersion causes [[chromatic aberration]], which causes the different colors in the image not to overlap properly. Various techniques have been developed to counteract this, such as the use of [[achromat]]s, multielement lenses with glasses of different dispersion. They are constructed in such a way that the chromatic aberrations of the different parts cancel out.

==Pulsar emissions==
{{Split section|Dispersion measure|date=November 2015}}
[[Pulsar]]s are spinning neutron stars that emit [[pulse]]s at very regular intervals ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Astronomers believe that the pulses are emitted simultaneously over a wide range of frequencies. However, as observed on Earth, the components of each pulse emitted at higher radio frequencies arrive before those emitted at lower frequencies. This dispersion occurs because of the ionized component of the [[interstellar medium]], mainly the free electrons, which make the group velocity frequency dependent. The extra delay added at a frequency {{mvar|ν}} is
:&lt;math&gt;t = k_\mathrm{DM} \cdot \left(\frac{\mathrm{DM}}{\nu^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the dispersion constant ''k''&lt;sub&gt;DM&lt;/sub&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt; k_\mathrm{DM} = \frac{e^2}{2 \pi m_\mathrm{e}c} \simeq 4.149\, \mathrm{GHz}^2\,\mathrm{pc}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\,\mathrm{ms} ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Single-Dish Radio Astronomy: Techniques and Applications, ASP Conference Proceedings, Vol. 278. Edited by Snezana Stanimirovic, Daniel Altschuler, Paul Goldsmith, and Chris Salter. {{ISBN|1-58381-120-6}}. San Francisco: Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 2002, p. 251-269&lt;/ref&gt;

and the '''dispersion measure''' (DM) is the column density of free electrons ([[total electron content]]) — i.e. the number density of electrons ''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (electrons/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) integrated along the path traveled by the photon from the pulsar to the Earth — and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{DM} = \int_0^d{n_e\;dl}&lt;/math&gt;

with units of [[parsec]]s per cubic centimetre (1&amp;nbsp;pc/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 30.857&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, D.R., and Kramer, M., ''Handbook of Pulsar Astronomy'', vol. 4 of Cambridge Observing Handbooks for Research Astronomers, ([[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, U.K.; New York, U.S.A, 2005), 1st edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically for astronomical observations, this delay cannot be measured directly, since the emission time is unknown. What ''can'' be measured is the difference in arrival times at two different frequencies. The delay Δ''t'' between a high frequency {{mvar|ν}}&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt; and a low frequency {{mvar|ν}}&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt; component of a pulse will be
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = k_\mathrm{DM} \cdot \mathrm{DM} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\nu_{\mathrm{lo}}^2} - \frac{1}{\nu_{\mathrm{hi}}^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the above equation in terms of Δ''t'' allows one to determine the DM by measuring pulse arrival times at multiple frequencies. This in turn can be used to study the interstellar medium, as well as allow for observations of pulsars at different frequencies to be combined.

A '''dry thunderstorm''' or '''heat storm''' is a [[thunderstorm]] that produces thunder and lightning, but most or [[Virga|all of its precipitation evaporates]] before reaching the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/abq/?n=clifeature2010drythunderstorms |title=Dry thunderstorms |author=Albuquerque Office |work=Fire Weather Topics |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Dry lightning''' refers to lightning strikes occurring in this situation. Both are so common in the [[Western United States|American West]] that they are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=drycb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weather.about.com/od/typesofprecipitation/f/dry_storms.htm |title=What Is a Dry Thunderstorm? |author= |publisher=weather.[[about.com]] |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term is a technical [[misnomer]] since [[lightning]] itself is neither wet nor dry.&lt;ref name=drycb/&gt;

Dry thunderstorms occur essentially in dry conditions, and their lightning is a major cause of wildfires.&lt;ref name=NSSL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wfas.net/index.php/dry-lightning-experimental-products-97 | title = Dry Lightning | author= | work = Wild Fire Assessment System | publisher= US Forest Service | accessdate= December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of that, the [[National Weather Service]], and other agencies around the world, issue forecasts for its likelihood over large areas.&lt;ref name=NSSL&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/lightning/faq/ | title = Frequently Asked Questions About Lightning | work = Severe Weather 101 | publisher= NSSL |author= | accessdate= December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference | url= http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/65549.pdf | format= pdf | title= Forecasting Dry Lightning in the Western United States | author1= Miriam Rorig | author2= Sue Ferguson |author3= Steven McKay | conference = The 5th Symposium on Fire and Forest Meteorology and the 2nd International Wildland Fire Ecology and Fire Management Congress | location = Orlando, FL |date = 17 November 2003| accessdate= December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Where dry thunderstorms occur==
Dry thunderstorms generally occur in [[deserts]] or places where the lower layers of the atmosphere usually contain little [[water vapor]]. Any precipitation that falls from elevated thunderstorms can be entirely evaporated as it falls through the lower dry layers. They are common during the summer months across much of western North America and other arid areas.  The shaft of precipitation that can be seen falling from a cloud without reaching the ground is called "[[virga]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | url= http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JAM2482.1 | format= pdf | last1=Ferguson | first1= Sue A. | last2= Steven | first2= J.

A thunderstorm does not have to be completely dry to be considered dry; in many areas {{convert|0.1|in|mm}} is the threshold between a "wet" and "dry" thunderstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.srh.noaa.gov/abq/?n=clifeature2010drythunderstorms  | title = Dry thunderstorms | author = Albuquerque Office | work = Fire Weather Topics | publisher= National Weather Service | accessdate= December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==
Dry thunderstorms are notable for two reasons: they are the most common natural origin of wildland fires, and they can produce strong gusty surface winds that can fan flames.

===Dust storms===
{{main|Dust storm}}
Strong winds often develop around dry thunderstorms as the evaporating precipitation causes excessive cooling of the air beneath the storm, which increases its density and thereby its weight relative to the surrounding air. This cool air then descends rapidly and fans out upon impacting the ground, an event often described as a [[microburst#Dry microbursts|dry microburst]].  As the gusty winds expand outward from the storm, dry soil and sand are often picked up by the strong winds, creating dust and sand storms known as [[haboob]]s.

===Fires===

[[File:Lightning in Spring Creek, Nevada.JPG|thumb|left|Lightning, which is responsible for the majority of fires in the American West.]]
[[File:2011-08-04 20 00 00 Susie Fire in the Adobe Range west of Elko Nevada.jpg|thumb|A lightning-sparked wildfire in [[Nevada]].]]
In areas where trees or other vegetation are present, there is little to no rain that can prevent the lightning from causing them to catch fire. Storm winds also fan the [[Wildfire|fire]] and [[firestorm]], causing it to spread more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.californiagreensolutions.com/cgi-bin/gt/tpl.h,content=2241 | title= Dry lightning and dry thunderstorms cause the majority of wildfires in the Western US - including California fires. | website= www.californiagreensolutions.com | author= | publisher = California Green Solutions | date= 2006 | accessdate = December 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pyrocumulus cloud|Pyrocumulonimbus]] are cumuliform clouds that can form over a large fire and that are particularly dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Pyrocumulonimbus |title=Pyrocumulonimbus |work= AMS Glossary |accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the higher levels of the atmosphere are cooler, and the surface is thus warmed to extreme temperatures due to a wildfire, volcano, or other event, convection will occur, and produce clouds and lightning. They are similar to any cumulus cloud but ingest extra [[particulates]] from the fire. This increases the voltage difference between the base and the top of the cloud, helping to produce lightning.

'''Duplex sequencing''' is a [[Library (biology)|library]] preparation and analysis method for [[DNA sequencing|next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) platforms that employs random tagging of double stranded [[DNA]] to detect mutations with higher accuracy and lower error rate. This method uses [[Degenerate bases|degenerate molecular tags]] in addition to sequencing adapters to recognize reads originating from each strand of DNA. The generated sequencing reads then will be analyzed using two methods: single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) and Duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly. Duplex sequencing theoretically can detect mutations with frequencies as low as 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; that is more than 10,000 fold higher in accuracy compared to the conventional next-generation sequencing methods.&lt;ref name=ds2012&gt;M.

The estimated error rate of standard next-generation sequencing platforms is 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; per base call. With this error rate billions of base calls that are produced by NGS will results in millions of the errors. The errors are introduced during sample preparation and sequencing such as [[polymerase]] , sequencing and image analysis errors. While the NGS platforms error rate is admissible to some applications such as detection of [[Tumour heterogeneity|clonal variants]], it is a major limit for applications that require higher accuracy for detection of low frequency variants such as detection of intra-organismal [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]], [[Somatic evolution in cancer|subclonal variants]] in genetically [[Tumour heterogeneity|heterogeneous cancers]] or circulating tumor DNA.&lt;ref&gt;T.

The duplex sequencing method addresses this problem by taking advantage of complementary nature of two strands of DNA and confirming only variants that are present in both strands of DNA. Because the probability of two complementary errors arising at the same exact same location in both strands is exceedingly low, duplex sequencing increases the accuracy of sequencing significantly.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=miner /&gt;&lt;ref name=lou /&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;E.

== Experimental workflow==
Duplex sequencing tagged adapters can be used in combination with majority of NGS adapters. In the figures and workflow section of this article Illumina sequencing adapters are used as an example in accordance to the original published protocol.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;
[[File:Duplex sequencing library preparation procedure.png|thumb|upright=2.5|'''Figure 1)''' '''Duplex sequencing library preparation workflow:''' Two adapter oligos go through several steps (Annealing, Synthesis, dT-tailing) to generate double stranded unique tags with 3'-dT-overhangs. Then the duplex tag adapters ligate to the double stranded DNA templates. Finally Illumina sequencing adapters are inserted into the tagged-DNA fragments and form the final libraries containing DS adapters, Illumina sequencing adapters and template DNA.]]

=== Adapter annealing === 
Two oligonucleotides are used for this step (Figure 1: Adapter oligos). One of the oligonucleotides contains a 12 nucleotide single stranded random tag sequence followed by a fixed 5' nucleotide sequence (Black sequence in figure 1). In this step [[oligonucleotide]]s are [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|annealed]] in a complementary region by incubation at the required temporal condition.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

=== Adapter synthesis === 
The adapters that [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|annealed]] successfully are extended and synthesized by a [[DNA polymerase]] to complete a double stranded adapter containing complementary tags (Figure 1).&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

=== 3’-dT-tailing === 
The extended double stranded adapters are cleaved by [[Restriction enzyme|HpyCH4III]] at a specific [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: G–K|restriction site]] located at 3’ side of the tag sequence and will results in a 3’-dT overhang that will be ligated to the 3’-dA overhang on DNA libraries in adapter [[Ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]] step (Figure 1).&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

=== Library preparation ===
Double stranded DNA is [[DNA fragmentation|sheared]] using one of the methods: [[Sonication]], enzymatic digestion or nebulization. Fragments are size selected using Ampure XP beads. [[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|Gel]]-based size selection is not recommended for this method since it can cause melting of DNA double strands and DNA damage as the results of [[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|UV exposure]]. The size selected fragments of DNA are subjected to 3’-end-dA-tailing.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

=== Adapter ligation ===
In this step two tagged adapters are ligated from 3’-dT-tails to 3’-dA-tails on both sides of double stranded DNA library fragments. This process results in double stranded library fragments that contain two random tags (α and β) in each side that are reverse complement of each other (Figure 1 and 2). The "DNA:adapter" ratio is crucial in determining the success of ligation.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

=== Insertion of sequencing adapters to tagged libraries===
In the last step of duplex sequencing library preparation, Illumina sequencing adapters are added to the tagged double stranded libraries by PCR amplification using primers containing sequencing adapters. During PCR amplification both complementary strands of DNA are amplified and generate two types of PCR products. Product 1 derive from strand 1 which have a unique tag sequence (called α in the figure 2) next to the Illumina adapter 1 and product 2 that have a unique tag (called β in the figure 2) next to illumina adapter 1. (Please note that in each strand, tag α is the reverse complement of tag β and vice versa). The libraries containing duplex tags and Illumina adapters are sequenced using Illumina TruSeq system. Reads that are originating from each single strand of DNA form a group of reads (tag families) that are sharing the same tag. The detected families of reads will be used in next step for analyzing sequencing data.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

=== Considerations ===

====Efficiency of adapter ligation====
Adapter ligation efficiency is very important in a successful duplex sequencing. Extra amount of libraries or adapters can affect the DNA:adapter balance and therefore result in inefficient ligation and excess amount of primer dimers, respectively. Therefore, it is important to keep the molar concentration of DNA:adapter to the optimal ratio that is 0.05.&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

====Tag family size====
Efficiency of duplex sequencing depends on final number of DCSs which is directly related to number of reads in each family (family size). If the family size is too small then the DCS can not be assembled and if too many reads are sharing the same tag the data yield will be low. Family size is determined by the amount of DNA template for PCR amplification and dedicated sequencing lane fraction. The optimal tag family size is between 6 and 12 members. To obtain the optimal family size the amount of DNA template and dedicated sequencing lane fraction needs to be adjusted. The following formula takes into account the most important variables that can affect depth of coverage (N=40DG÷R) where "N" is number of reads, "D" is desired depth of coverage, "G" is size of DNA target in basepair and "R" is final read length.

== Computational workflow ==

=== Filtering and trimming === 
Each duplex sequencing read contains a fixed 5-nucleotide sequence (shown in figures in Black color) located [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]] of the 12-nucleotide tag sequence. The reads are filtered out if they do not have the expected 5-nucleotide sequence or have more than nine identical or ambiguous bases within each tag. The two 12-nucleotide tags at each end of reads are combined and moved to the read header. Two families of reads are formed that originate from the two strands of DNA. One family contains reads with αβ header originating from strand 1 and the second family contains reads with βα header originating from strand 2 (Figure 2). Then the reads are trimmed by removing the fixed 5 bp sequence and 4 error prone nucleotides located at the sites of ligation and end repair.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt; The remaining reads are assembled to [[consensus sequence]]s using single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) assembly and duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly.

===SSCS assembly=== 
Trimmed sequences from the previous step are [[Sequence alignment|aligned]] to the [[reference genome]] using [[List of sequence alignment software|Burrows-Wheeler aligner]] (BWA) and the unmapped reads are removed. The aligned reads that have the same 24 bp tag sequence and genomic region are detected and grouped together (Family αβ and βα in the figure 2). Each group represents a “tag family”. Tag families with lower than three members are removed from the analysis. To remove errors arise during PCR amplification or sequencing, mutations that are supported by less than 70% of the members (reads) are filtered out from the analysis. Then a consensus sequence is generated for each family using the identical sequences in each position of the remaining reads. The consensus sequence is called single strand consensus sequence (SSCS). The SSCS method increases the NGS accuracy to about 20 fold higher, however this method relies on the sequencing information from single strands of DNA and therefore is sensitive to the errors induced at the first round or before PCR amplification.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

=== DCS assembly ===
The reads from last step are realigned to the reference genome. In this method SSCS family pairs that have complementary tags will be grouped together (Family αβ and βα in figure 2). These reads originate from two complementary strands of DNA. High confidence sequences are selected based on the perfectly matched base calls of each family. The final sequence is called duplex consensus sequence (DCS). True mutations are those that match perfectly between complementary SSCSs. This step filter out remaining errors that raised during first round of PCR amplification or during sample preparation.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;

== Advantages ==

=== Decreasing error rate of sequencing ===
High error rate (0.01-0.001) of standard NGS platforms that introduced during sample preparation or sequencing is a major limitation for detection of variants present in small fraction of cells. Due to the duplex tagging system and use of information in both strands of DNA, duplex sequencing has significantly decreased the error rate of sequencing about 10 million fold using both SSCS and DCS method.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;

=== Increasing accuracy of variant calling ===
It is challenging to identify rare variants accurately using standard NGS methods with the mutations rate of (10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Errors that happen early during sample preparation can be detected as rare variants. An example of such errors is C&gt;A/G&gt;T [[transversion]] that is detected in low frequencies using deep sequencing or targeted capture data and arise as the result of DNA oxidation during sample preparation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Costello, T. J. Pugh, T. J. Fennell, et al. [http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/01/08/nar.gks1443 “Discovery and characterization of artifactual mutations in deep coverage targeted capture sequencing data due to oxidative DNA damage during sample preparation”]. Nucleic Acids Res., vol. 41, no. 6, pp. 1–12, 2013. {{PMID|23303777}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These types of false positive variants are filter out by duplex sequencing method since mutations need to be accurately matched in both strands of DNA to be validated as true mutations. Duplex sequencing can theoretically detect mutations with frequencies as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; compare to 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; rate of standard NGS methods.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ds2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;

=== Applicable to majority of NGS platforms ===
Another advantage of duplex sequencing is that it can be used in combination with majority of NGS platforms without making significant changes to the standard protocols.

==Limitations==

=== Cost  ===
Because duplex sequencing provide a significantly higher sequencing accuracy and uses information in both strands of DNA, this method needs a much higher sequencing depth and therefore is a costly approach. The high cost of duplex sequencing limits its application to targeted and amplicon sequencing at present time and will not be applicable for whole genome sequencing approaches. However, with decreasing cost of NGS, the application of duplex sequencing for larger DNA targets will be more feasible.

=== Practical application  ===
Duplex sequencing is a new method and its efficiency was studied in limited applications such as detecting [[point mutation]]s using targeted capture sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;M. W. Schmitt, E. J. Fox, M. J. Prindle, et al. [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n5/full/nmeth.3351.html “Sequencing small genomic targets with high efficiency and extreme accuracy”]. Nat Methods, vol. 12, no. 5, pp. 423–425, 2015. {{PMID|2584963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More studies need to be performed to expand application and feasibility of duplex sequencing to more complex samples with large number of mutations, indels and [[Copy-number variation|copy number variations]].

==Applications==

===Detection of variants with low frequencies===
Duplex sequencing and the significant increase of sequencing accuracy has important impacts on applications such as detection of rare human genetic variants, detection of subclonal mutations involve in mechanisms of resistance to therapy in genetically heterogeneous cancers, screening variants in circulating tumor DNA as a non-invasive biomarker and [[Prenatal diagnosis|prenatal screening]] for detection of genetic abnormalities in fetus.

=== Copy number detection===
Another suggested application for duplex sequencing is detection of DNA/RNA copy numbers by estimating the relative frequency of variants. A method for counting PCR template molecules with application to next-generation sequencing.&lt;ref name=ds2012 /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

An '''engineering drawing''', a type of [[technical drawing]], is used to fully and clearly define requirements for [[engineering|engineered]] items.

Engineering drawing (the activity) produces engineering drawings (the documents). More than merely the drawing of pictures, it is also a [[language]]—a graphical language that communicates ideas and information from one mind to another.&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_p1"&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|p=1}}.Viola

==Relationship to artistic drawing==

Engineering drawing and artistic  types of drawing, and either may be called simply "drawing" when the context is implicit. Engineering drawing shares some traits with artistic drawing in that both create pictures. But whereas the purpose of artistic drawing is to convey emotion or artistic sensitivity in some way (subjective impressions), the purpose of engineering drawing is to convey information (objective facts).&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_p1"/&gt; One of the corollaries that follow from this fact is that, whereas anyone can appreciate artistic drawing (even if each viewer has his own unique appreciation), engineering drawing requires some training to understand (like any language); but there is also a high degree of objective commonality in the interpretation (also like other languages).&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_p1"/&gt; In fact, engineering drawing has evolved into a language that is more precise and unambiguous than [[natural language]]s; in this sense it is closer to a [[programming language]] in its communication ability. Engineering drawing uses an extensive set of conventions to convey information very precisely, with very little ambiguity.

==Relationship to other technical drawing types==

The process of producing engineering drawings, and the skill of producing those, is often referred to as '''technical drawing''' or '''drafting''' ('''draughting''') although technical drawings are also required for disciplines that would not ordinarily be thought of as parts of engineering (such as [[architecture]], [[landscaping]], [[cabinetry|cabinet making]], and garment-making).

Persons employed in the trade of producing engineering drawings were called draftsmen (or draughtsmen) in the past.  Although these terms are still in use, the not
-gender-specific terms draftsperson and drafter are now more common.

==Cascading of conventions by speciality==

The various fields share many common conventions of drawing, while also having some field-specific conventions. For example, even within metalworking, there are some process-specific conventions to be learned—[[casting]], [[machining]], [[fabrication (metal)|fabricating]], and assembly all have some special drawing conventions, and within fabrication there is further division, including [[welding]], [[rivet]]ing, [[pipefitter|pipefitting]], and [[ironworker|erecting]]. Each of these trades has some details that only specialists will have memorized.

==Legal instruments==

An engineering drawing is a legal document (that is, a [[legal instrument]]), because it communicates all the needed information about "what is wanted" to the people who will expend resources turning the idea into a reality. It is thus a part of a [[contract]]; the [[purchase order]] and the drawing together, as well as any ancillary documents (engineering change orders [ECOs], called-out [[specification (technical standard)|specs]]), constitute the contract. Thus, if the resulting product is wrong, the worker or manufacturer are protected from [[Legal liability|liability]] as long as they have faithfully executed the instructions conveyed by the drawing. If those instructions were wrong, it is the fault of the engineer. Because manufacturing and construction are typically very expensive processes (involving large amounts of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[payroll]]), the question of liability for errors has great [[legal]] implications as each party tries to blame the other and assign the wasted cost to the other's responsibility. This is the biggest reason why the conventions of engineering drawing have evolved over the decades toward a very precise, unambiguous state.

==Standardization and disambiguation==

Engineering drawings specify requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated. Standards provide rules for their specification and interpretation. Standardization also aids [[internationalization]], because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing, and interpret it the same way. 

One major set of engineering drawing standards is [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] Y14.5 and Y14.5M (most recently revised in 2009). These apply widely in the United States, although [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8015:ed-2:v1:en ISO 8015 (Geometrical product specifications (GPS) — Fundamentals — Concepts, principles and rules)] is now also important. 

In 2011, a new revision of [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8015:ed-2:v1:en ISO 8015 (Geometrical product specifications (GPS) — Fundamentals — Concepts, principles and rules)] was published containing the Invocation Principle. This states that, "Once a portion of the ISO geometric product specification (GPS) system is invoked in a mechanical engineering product documentation, the entire ISO GPS system is invoked." It also goes on to state that marking a drawing "Tolerancing ISO 8015" is optional. The implication of this is that any drawing using ISO symbols can only be interpreted to ISO GPS rules. The only way not to invoke the ISO GPS system is to invoke a national or other standard. 

In Britain, [[BS 8888]] (Technical Product Specification) has undergone important updates in the 2010s.

==Media==

For centuries, until the post-World War II era, all engineering drawing was done manually by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate (e.g., [[vellum]], [[mylar]]). Since the advent of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade. Today most engineering drawing is done with CAD, but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared.

Some of the [[technical drawing tools|tools of manual drafting]] include pencils, pens and their ink, [[straightedge]]s, [[T-square]]s, [[French curve]]s, triangles, [[ruler]]s, [[protractor]]s, [[caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]], [[compass (drafting)|compasses]], scales, erasers, and tacks or push pins. ([[Slide rule]]s used to number among the supplies, too, but nowadays even manual drafting, when it occurs, benefits from a pocket [[calculator]] or its onscreen equivalent.) And of course the tools also include drawing boards (drafting boards) or tables. The English idiom "to go back to the drawing board", which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether, was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing. [[Drafting machine]]s are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards, straightedges, [[pantograph]]s, and other tools into one integrated drawing environment. CAD provides their virtual equivalents.

Producing drawings usually involves creating an original that is then reproduced, generating multiple copies to be distributed to the shop floor, vendors, company archives, and so on. The classic reproduction methods involved blue and white appearances (whether [[blueprint|white-on-blue]] or [[whiteprint|blue-on-white]]), which is why engineering drawings were long called, and even today are still often called, "[[blueprint]]s" or "[[whiteprint|bluelines]]", even though those terms are [[anachronism|anachronistic]] from a literal perspective, since most copies of engineering drawings today are made by more modern methods (often [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] or [[laser printer|laser]] printing) that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper.  The more generic term "print" is now in common usage in the U.S. to mean any paper copy of an engineering drawing. In the case of CAD drawings, the original is the CAD file, and the [[printout]]s of that file are the "prints".

==Relationship to model-based definition (MBD/DPD)==

For centuries, engineering drawing was the sole method of transferring information from design into manufacture. In recent decades another method has arisen, called [[model-based definition]] (MBD) or digital product definition (DPD). In MBD, the information captured by the CAD software app is fed automatically into a CAM app ([[computer-aided manufacturing]]), which (with or without postprocessing apps) creates code in other languages such as [[G-code]] to be executed by a CNC machine tool ([[numerical control|computer numerical control]]), [[3D printing|3D printer]], or (increasingly) a hybrid machine tool that uses both. Thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing. In MBD, the [[data set|dataset]], not a drawing, is the legal instrument. The term "technical data package" (TDP) is now used to refer to the ''complete package of information'' (in one medium or another) that communicates information from design to production (such as 3D-model datasets, engineering drawings, engineering change orders (ECOs), [[specification (technical standard)|spec]] revisions and addenda, and so on). However, even in the MBD era, where theoretically production could happen without any drawings or humans at all, it is still the case that drawings and humans are involved. It still takes CAD/CAM programmers, CNC setup workers, and CNC operators to do manufacturing, as well as other people such as quality assurance staff (inspectors) and logistics staff (for materials handling, shipping-and-receiving, and [[front office]] functions). These workers often use drawings in the course of their work that have been produced by rendering and plotting (printing) from the MBD dataset. 
When proper procedures are being followed, a clear chain of precedence is always documented, such that when a person looks at a drawing, s/he is told by a note thereon that this drawing is not the governing instrument (because the MBD dataset is). In these cases, the drawing is still a useful document, although legally it is classified as "for reference only", meaning that if any controversies or discrepancies arise, it is the MBD dataset, not the drawing, that governs.

== Systems of dimensioning and tolerancing ==

Almost all engineering drawings (except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches) communicate not only geometry (shape and location) but also dimensions and [[engineering tolerance|tolerances]] for those characteristics. Several systems of dimensioning and tolerancing have evolved. The simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points (such as an object's length or width, or hole center locations). Since the advent of well-developed [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable manufacture]], these distances have been accompanied by tolerances of the plus-or-minus or min-and-max-limit types. ''Coordinate dimensioning'' involves defining all points, lines, planes, and profiles in terms of Cartesian coordinates, with a common origin. Coordinate dimensioning was the sole best option until the post-World War II era saw the development of [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] (GD&amp;T), which departs from the limitations of coordinate dimensioning (e.g., rectangular-only tolerance zones, tolerance stacking) to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions (that is, both form [shapes/locations] and sizes).

== Common features ==
Drawings convey the following critical information:

* ''Geometry'' – the shape of the object; represented as views; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles, such as front, top, side, etc.
* ''Dimensions'' – the size of the object is captured in accepted units.
* ''[[Tolerance (engineering)|Tolerances]]'' – the allowable variations for each dimension.
* ''Material'' – represents what the item is made of.
* ''Finish'' – specifies the surface quality of the item, functional or cosmetic. For example, a mass-marketed product usually requires a much higher surface quality than, say, a component that goes inside industrial machinery.

A variety of line styles graphically represent physical objects. Types of ''lines'' include the following:
* ''visible'' – are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle.
* ''hidden'' – are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible.
* ''center'' – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features.
* ''cutting plane'' – are thin, medium-dashed lines, or thick alternately long- and double short-dashed that may be used to define sections for [[cross section (geometry)|section views]].
* ''section'' – are thin lines in a pattern (pattern determined by the material being "cut" or "sectioned") used to indicate surfaces in section views resulting from "cutting". Section lines are commonly referred to as "cross-hatching".
* ''phantom'' – (not shown) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly.  E.g. billet ends that may be used for testing, or the machined product that is the focus of a tooling drawing.

Lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter.
* '''Type A''' lines show the outline of the feature of an object. They are the thickest lines on a drawing and done with a pencil softer than HB.
* '''Type B''' lines are dimension lines and are used for dimensioning, projecting, extending, or leaders. A harder pencil should be used, such as a 2H pencil.
* '''Type C''' lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown. These are freehand drawn and only for short breaks. 2H pencil
* '''Type D''' lines are similar to Type C, except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks. 2H pencil
* '''Type E''' lines indicate hidden outlines of internal features of an object. These are dotted lines. 2H pencil
* '''Type F''' lines are Type F''[typo]'' lines, except these are used for drawings in electrotechnology. 2H pencil
* '''Type G''' lines are used for centre lines. These are dotted lines, but a long line of 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm, then a 1 mm gap, then a small line of 2&amp;nbsp;mm. 2H pencil
* '''Type H''' lines are the same as type G, except that every second long line is thicker. These indicate the cutting plane of an object. 2H pencil 
* '''Type k''' lines indicate the alternate positions of an object and the line taken by that object. These are drawn with a long line of 10-20&amp;nbsp;mm, then a small gap, then a small line of 2&amp;nbsp;mm, then a gap, then another small line. 2H pencil.

===Multiple views and projections===

[[File:Engineering drawing isometric.svg|thumb|right|Isometric view of the object shown in the engineering drawing [[#Example of an engineering drawing|below]].]]
In most cases, a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features, and several views are used. Types of ''views'' include the following:

==== Multiview projection ====
A ''[[multiview projection]]'' is a type of [[orthographic projection]] that shows the object as it looks from the front, right, left, top, bottom, or back (e.g. the ''primary views''), and is typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either [[Multiview projection|first-angle or third-angle projection]]. The origin and vector direction of the projectors (also called projection lines) differs, as explained below. 
* In ''first-angle projection'', the parallel projectors originate as if radiated ''from behind the viewer'' and pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane ''behind'' it. The 3D object is projected into 2D "paper" space as if you were looking at a [[radiograph]] of the object: the top view is under the front view, the right view is at the left of the front view. First-angle projection is the [[ISO 128|ISO standard]] and is primarily used in Europe.
* In ''third-angle projection'', the parallel projectors originate as if radiated ''from the far side of the object'' and pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane ''in front of'' it. The views of the 3D object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object, and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing.&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_pp99-105"&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|pp=99–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top; and the features closest to the front of the 3D object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing. Third-angle projection is primarily used in the United States and Canada, where it is the default projection system according to [[ASME]] standard ASME Y14.3M.

Until the late 19th century, first-angle projection was the norm in North America as well as Europe;&lt;ref name="French1918p78"&gt;{{Harvnb|French|1918}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6R5DAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 78].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_pp111-114"&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|pp=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but circa the 1890s, third-angle projection spread throughout the North American engineering and manufacturing communities to the point of becoming a widely followed convention,&lt;ref name="French1918p78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_pp111-114"/&gt; and it was an ASA standard by the 1950s.&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_pp111-114"/&gt; Circa World War I, British practice was frequently mixing the use of both projection methods.&lt;ref name="French1918p78"/&gt;

As shown above, the determination of what surface constitutes the front, back, top, and bottom varies depending on the projection method used.

Not all views are necessarily used.&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_pp97-114"&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|pp=97–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally only as many views are used as are necessary to convey all needed information clearly and economically.&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_pp108-111"&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|pp=108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front, top, and right-side views are commonly considered the core group of views included by default,&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_p102"&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  but any combination of views may be used depending on the needs of the particular design. In addition to the six principal views (front, back, top, bottom, right side, left side), any auxiliary views or sections may be included as serve the purposes of part definition and its communication. View lines or section lines (lines with arrows marked "A-A", "B-B", etc.) define the direction and location of viewing or sectioning. Sometimes a note tells the reader in which zone(s) of the drawing to find the view or section.

==== Auxiliary views ====
An ''auxiliary view'' is an orthographic view that is projected into any plane other than one of the six ''primary views''.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoline, Gary R. ''Introduction to Graphics Communications for Engineers (4th Ed.).'' New York, NY. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  These views are typically used when an object contains some sort of inclined plane.  Using the auxiliary view allows for that inclined plane (and any other significant features) to be projected in their true size and shape.  The true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the Line of Sight (LOS) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced.
It is shown like a three-dimensional object. Auxiliary views tend to make use of [[axonometric projection]]. When existing all by themselves, auxiliary views are sometimes known as ''pictorials''.

==== Isometric projection ====
An [[isometric projection]] shows the object from angles in which the scales along each axis of the object are equal. Isometric projection corresponds to rotation of the object by ± 45&amp;deg; about the vertical axis, followed by rotation of approximately ± 35.264&amp;deg; [= arcsin(tan(30°))] about the horizontal axis starting from an orthographic projection view. "Isometric" comes from the Greek for "same measure". One of the things that makes isometric drawings so attractive is the ease with which 60&amp;deg; angles can be constructed with only a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]].

Isometric projection is a type of [[axonometric projection]]. The other two types of axonometric projection are:
* [[Dimetric projection]]
* [[Trimetric projection]]

==== Oblique projection ====
An [[oblique projection]] is a simple type of graphical projection used for producing pictorial, two-dimensional [[image]]s of three-dimensional objects: 
* it projects an image by intersecting parallel rays (projectors)
* from the three-dimensional source object with the drawing surface (projection plan).
In both oblique projection and orthographic projection, parallel lines of the source object produce parallel lines in the projected image.

==== Perspective projection ====
[[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] is an approximate representation on a flat surface, of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are drawn:
* Smaller as their distance from the observer increases
* Foreshortened: the size of an object's dimensions along the line of sight are relatively shorter than dimensions across the line of sight.

==== Section Views ====
Projected views (either Auxiliary or Multiview) which show a cross section of the source object along the specified cut plane.  These views are commonly used to show internal features with more clarity than may be available using regular projections or hidden lines.  In assembly drawings, hardware components (e.g. nuts, screws, washers) are typically not sectioned.

=== Scale ===
{{Main|Architect's scale|Engineer's scale|Metric scale}}
Plans are usually "scale drawings", meaning that the plans are drawn at specific [[ratio]] relative to the actual size of the place or object. Various scales may be used for different drawings in a set. For example, a floor plan may be drawn at 1:50 (1:48 or {{frac|4}}″ = 1′ 0″) whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:25 (1:24 or {{frac|2}}″ = 1′ 0″). Site plans are often drawn at 1:200 or 1:100.

Scale is a nuanced subject in the use of engineering drawings. On one hand, it is a general principle of engineering drawings that they are projected using standardized, mathematically certain projection methods and rules. Thus, great effort is put into having an engineering drawing accurately depict size, shape, form, [[aspect ratio]]s between features, and so on. And yet, on the other hand, there is another general principle of engineering drawing that nearly diametrically opposes all this effort and intent—that is, the principle that ''users are not to scale the drawing to infer a dimension not labeled.'' This stern admonition is often repeated on drawings, via a boilerplate note in the title block telling the user, "DO NOT SCALE DRAWING."

The explanation for why these two nearly opposite principles can coexist is as follows. The first principle—that drawings will be made so carefully and accurately—serves the prime goal of why engineering drawing even exists, which is successfully communicating part definition and acceptance criteria—including "what the part should look like if you've made it correctly."  The service of this goal is what creates a drawing that one even ''could'' scale and get an accurate dimension thereby. And thus the great temptation to do so, when a dimension is wanted but was not labeled. The second principle—that even though scaling the drawing ''will'' usually work, one should nevertheless ''never'' do it—serves several goals, such as enforcing total clarity regarding who has authority to discern design intent, and preventing erroneous scaling of a drawing that was never drawn to scale to begin with (which is typically labeled "drawing not to scale" or "scale: NTS"). When a user is forbidden from scaling the drawing, s/he must turn instead to the engineer (for the answers that the scaling would seek), and s/he will never erroneously scale something that is inherently unable to be accurately scaled.

But in some ways, the advent of the [[computer-aided design|CAD]] and [[model-based definition|MBD]] era challenges these assumptions that were formed many decades ago. When part definition is defined mathematically via a solid model, the assertion that one cannot interrogate the model—the direct analog of "scaling the drawing"—becomes ridiculous; because when part definition is defined this way, it is not ''possible'' for a drawing or model to be "not to scale". A 2D pencil drawing can be inaccurately foreshortened and skewed (and thus not to scale), yet still be a completely valid part definition as long as the labeled dimensions are the only dimensions used, and no scaling of the drawing by the user occurs. This is because what the drawing and labels convey is in reality a ''symbol'' of what is wanted, rather than a true ''replica'' of it. (For example, a sketch of a hole that is clearly not round still accurately defines the part as having a true round hole, as long as the label says "10mm DIA", because the "DIA" implicitly but objectively tells the user that the skewed drawn circle is a symbol ''representing'' a perfect circle.) But if a mathematical model—essentially, a vector graphic—is declared to be the official definition of the part, then any amount of "scaling the drawing" can make sense; there may still be an error in the model, in the sense that what was ''intended'' is not ''depicted'' (modeled); but there can be no error of the "not to scale" type—because the mathematical vectors and curves are replicas, not symbols, of the part features.

Even in dealing with 2D drawings, the manufacturing world has changed since the days when people paid attention to the scale ratio claimed on the print, or counted on its accuracy. In the past, prints were plotted on a plotter to exact scale ratios, and the user could know that a line on the drawing 15mm long corresponded to a 30mm part dimension because the drawing said "1:2" in the "scale" box of the title block. Today, in the era of ubiquitous desktop printing, where original drawings or scaled prints are often scanned on a scanner and saved as a PDF file, which is then printed at any percent magnification that the user deems handy (such as "fit to paper size"), users have pretty much given up caring what scale ratio is claimed in the "scale" box of the title block. Which, under the rule of "do not scale drawing", never really did that much for them anyway.

=== Showing dimensions ===

=== Sizes of drawings ===
{{Main|Paper size}}
[[File:A size illustration.svg|thumb|ISO paper sizes]]
[[File:ANSI_size_illustration.svg|thumb|ANSI paper sizes]]

Sizes of drawings typically comply with either of two different standards, [[ISO standard|ISO]] (World Standard) or [[ANSI/ASME Y14.1]] (American).

The metric drawing sizes correspond to international [[paper size]]s. These developed further refinements in the second half of the twentieth century, when [[photocopying]] became cheap. Engineering drawings could be readily doubled (or halved) in size and put on the next larger (or, respectively, smaller) size of paper with no waste of space. And the metric [[technical pen]]s were chosen in sizes so that one could add detail or drafting changes with a pen width changing by approximately a factor of the [[square root of 2]]. A full set of pens would have the following nib sizes: 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm. However, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) called for four pen widths and set a colour code for each: 0.25 (white), 0.35 (yellow), 0.5 (brown), 0.7 (blue); these nibs produced lines that related to various text character heights and the ISO paper sizes.

All ISO paper sizes have the same aspect ratio, one to the square root of 2, meaning that a document designed for any given size can be enlarged or reduced to any other size and will fit perfectly. Given this ease of changing sizes, it is of course common to copy or print a given document on different sizes of paper, especially within a series, e.g. a drawing on A3 may be enlarged to A2 or reduced to A4.

The U.S. customary "A-size" corresponds to "letter" size, and "B-size" corresponds to "ledger" or "tabloid" size. There were also once British paper sizes, which went by names rather than alphanumeric designations.

[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) [[ANSI/ASME Y14.1]], Y14.2, Y14.3, and Y14.5 are commonly referenced standards in the U.S.

=== Technical lettering ===
[[Technical lettering]] is the process of forming letters, numerals, and other [[character (computing)|characters]] in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for an object. With the goals of [[legibility]] and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a [[sans-serif|Gothic sans-serif]] script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of [[machine]]s. ISO Lettering templates, designed for use with technical pens and pencils, and to suit ISO paper sizes, produce lettering characters to an international standard.  The stroke thickness is related to the character height (for example, 2.5mm high characters would have a stroke thickness - pen nib size - of 0.25mm, 3.5 would use a 0.35mm pen and so forth). The ISO character set (font) has a seriffed one, a barred seven, an open four, six, and nine, and a round topped three, that improves legibility when, for example, an A0 drawing has been reduced to A1 or even A3 (and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed &amp;c). When CAD drawings became more popular, especially using US American software, such as AutoCAD, the nearest font to this ISO standard font was Romantic Simplex (RomanS) - a proprietary shx font) with a manually adjusted width factor (over ride) to make it look as near to the ISO lettering for the drawing board. However, with the closed four, and arced six and nine, romans.shx typeface could be difficult to read in reductions. In more recent revisions of software packages, the [[TrueType]] font ISOCPEUR reliably reproduces the original drawing board lettering stencil style, however, many drawings have switched to the ubiquitous Arial.ttf.

==Conventional parts (areas)==

===Title block===
The title block (T/B, TB) is an area of the drawing that conveys [[header (computing)|header]]-type information about the drawing, such as: 
* Drawing title (hence the name "title block")
* Drawing number
* [[Part number]](s)
* Name of the design activity (corporation, government agency, etc.)
* Identifying code of the design activity (such as a [[Commercial and Government Entity|CAGE code]])
* Address of the design activity (such as city, state/province, country)
* Measurement units of the drawing (for example, inches, millimeters)
* Default tolerances for dimension callouts where no tolerance is specified
* Boilerplate callouts of general [[specification (technical standard)|specs]]
* [[Intellectual property]] rights warning

Traditional locations for the title block are the bottom right (most commonly) or the top right or center.

===Revisions block===
The revisions block (rev block) is a tabulated list of the revisions (versions) of the drawing, documenting the [[revision control]].

Traditional locations for the revisions block are the top right (most commonly) or adjoining the title block in some way.

===Next assembly===
The next assembly block, often also referred to as "where used" or sometimes "effectivity block", is a list of higher assemblies where the product on the current drawing is used.  This block is commonly found adjacent to the title block.

===Notes list===
The notes list provides notes to the user of the drawing, conveying any information that the callouts within the field of the drawing did not. It may include general notes, flagnotes, or a mixture of both.

Traditional locations for the notes list are anywhere along the edges of the field of the drawing.

====General notes====
General notes (G/N, GN) apply generally to the contents of the drawing, as opposed to applying only to certain part numbers or certain surfaces or features.

====Flagnotes====
Flagnotes or flag&amp;nbsp;notes (FL, F/N) are notes that apply only where a flagged callout points, such as to particular surfaces, features, or part numbers. Typically the callout includes a flag icon. Some companies call such notes "delta notes", and the note number is enclosed inside a triangular symbol (similar to [[delta (letter)|capital letter delta]], Δ). "FL5" (flagnote 5) and "D5" (delta note 5) are typical ways to abbreviate in [[ASCII]]-only contexts.

===Field of the drawing===
The field of the drawing (F/D, FD) is the main body or main area of the drawing, excluding the title block, rev block, P/L and so on

===List of materials, bill of materials, parts list===
The list of materials (L/M, LM, LoM), bill of materials (B/M, BM, BoM), or parts list (P/L, PL) is a (usually tabular) list of the materials used to make a part, and/or the parts used to make an assembly. It may contain instructions for heat treatment, finishing, and other processes, for each part number. Sometimes such LoMs or PLs are separate documents from the drawing itself.

Traditional locations for the LoM/BoM are above the title block, or in a separate document.

===Parameter tabulations===
Some drawings call out dimensions with parameter names (that is, variables, such a "A", "B", "C"), then tabulate rows of parameter values for each part number.

Traditional locations for parameter tables, when such tables are used, are floating near the edges of the field of the drawing, either near the title block or elsewhere along the edges of the field.

===Views and sections===
Each view or section is a separate set of projections, occupying a contiguous portion of the field of the drawing. Usually views and sections are called out with cross-references to specific zones of the field.

===Zones===
Often a drawing is divided into zones by a grid, with zone labels along the margins, such as A,B,C,D up the sides and 1,2,3,4,5,6 along the top and bottom. Names of zones are thus, for example, A5, D2, or B1. This feature greatly eases discussion of, and reference to, particular areas of the drawing.

==Abbreviations and symbols==
{{main|Engineering drawing abbreviations and symbols}}
As in many technical fields, a wide array of abbreviations and symbols have been developed in engineering drawing during the 20th and 21st centuries. For example, [[cold rolled steel]] is often abbreviated as CRS, and [[diameter]] is often abbreviated as [[Engineering drawing abbreviations and symbols|DIA, D, or ⌀]].

With the advent of computer generated drawings for manufacturing and machining, many symbols have fallen out of common use. This poses a problem when attempting to interpret an older hand-drawn document that contains obscure elements that cannot be readily referenced in standard teaching text or control documents such as AMSE and ANSI standards. For example, AMSE Y14.5M 1994 excludes a few elements that convey critical information as contained in older US Navy drawings and aircraft manufacturing drawings of World War 2 vintage. Researching the intent and meaning of some symbols can prove difficult.

== Example ==
[[File:Mech draw 1.svg|thumb|200px|Example mechanical drawing]]
Here is an example of an engineering drawing (an isometric view of the same object is shown above). The different line types are colored for clarity.

*Black = object line and hatching
*Red = hidden line
*Blue = center line of piece or opening
*Magenta = phantom line or cutting plane line

Sectional views are indicated by the direction of arrows,as in the example right side.

==History==
[[Technical drawing]] has existed since ancient times, and formidable technical drawings were done in renaissance times, such as the [[science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci|drawings of Leonardo da Vinci]], but modern engineering drawing, with its precise conventions of [[orthographic projection]] and [[scale (ratio)|scale]], arose in [[France]] at a time when the [[Industrial Revolution]] was in its infancy. [[L. T. C. Rolt]]'s biography of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]&lt;ref name="Rolt1957pp29-30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rolt|1957|pp=29–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; says of his father, [[Marc Isambard Brunel]], that "It seems fairly certain that Marc's drawings of his [[Portsmouth Block Mills|block-making machinery]] [in 1799] made a contribution to British engineering technique much greater than the machines they represented. For it is safe to assume that he had mastered the art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing. It had been evolved by [[Gaspard Monge]] of [[Charleville-Mézières|Mezieres]] in [[1765 in France|1765]] but had remained a [[secrecy#Military secrecy|military secret]] until [[1794 in France|1794]] and was therefore unknown in England."&lt;ref name="Rolt1957pp29-30"/&gt;

'''Gelifluction''', very similar to [[solifluction]], is the seasonal freeze-thaw action upon waterlogging [[topsoil]]s which induces downslope movement. Gelifluction is prominent in [[periglacial]] regions where snow falls during six to eight months of the year. In spring, the snow and ice melt, and the landscape is effectively inundated with half a year's worth of rainfall in the space of a couple of days. The top soil becomes waterlogged, and [[Fluid|flows like a liquid]]. Because the soil now a fluid, gelifluction is a form of mass movement that can occur on slopes with a slope angle of less than half a degree.

==Landforms==
The most distinctive landforms created by gelifluction include gelifluction lobes and gelifluction benches. The former refer to tongue-shaped deposits of geliflucted material orientated downslope that tend to form on slopes of between 10° and 20°, whereas the latter refer to terrace-like deposits forming on gentler slopes with a long axis running parallel to the slope contour. Gelifluction lobes can be further subdivided into either stone-banked or turf-banked lobes depending on vegetation cover.

A lobe is usually measured in terms of its front (riser) and its length upslope (tread); gelifluction lobes typically have risers of up to {{convert|5|m}} and treads of up to {{convert|50|m}}.

A '''genetic predisposition''' is a [[genetics|genetic]] characteristic which influences the possible [[phenotypic]] development of an individual organism within a species or population under the influence of [[natural environment|environmental]] conditions. In medicine, '''[[genetic susceptibility]]''' to a [[disease]] refers to a genetic predisposition to a health problem,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/predisposition What does it mean to have a genetic predisposition to a disease?], US Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt; which may eventually be triggered by particular environmental or lifestyle factors, such as [[tobacco smoking]] or [[Dieting|diet]].  [[Genetic test]]ing is able to identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to certain diseases.

==Behavior==

[[Instinct|Predisposition]] is the capacity we are born with to learn things such as language and concept of self.  Negative environmental influences may block the predisposition (ability) we have to do some things.  [[ethology|Behaviors]] displayed by animals can be influenced by genetic predispositions. Genetic predisposition towards certain human behaviors is [[Ethology|scientifically investigated]] by attempts to identify patterns of human behavior that seem to be invariant over long periods of time and in very different cultures.

For example, philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has proposed that humans are genetically predisposed to have a [[theory of mind]] because there has been [[evolution]]ary selection for the human ability to adopt the [[intentional stance]].{{Ref|stance}} The ''intentional stance'' is a useful behavioral strategy by which humans assume that others have [[mind]]s like their own. This assumption allows you to predict the behavior of others based on personal knowledge of what you would do.

In 1951, [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Donald Prell]] published an experiment in which [[twins|identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins]], ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism.  It is described in detail in an article published in the ''[[Journal of Mental Science]]''. in which Eysenck and Prell concluded that, "The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic Genetic predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Mental Health'', July 1951, Vol. XCVII, "The Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study", H. J. Eysenck and D. B. Prell, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Osborne Wilson|E. O. Wilson's]] [[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis|book on sociobiology]] and his book [[Consilience (book)|Consilience]] discuss the idea of genetic predisposition to behaviors

The field of [[evolutionary psychology]] explores the idea that certain behaviors have been selected for during the course of evolution.

==Genetic discrimination in health insurance==
{{main|Genetic discrimination}}
The [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]], which was signed into law by President Bush on May 21, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genome.gov/24519851&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits discrimination in employment and health insurance based on genetic information.

It is one of the brightest [[gamma ray]] sources found in the Milky Way, producing massive amounts of [[photon]] pairs at 511 keV, which usually indicates the annihilation of an electron-positron pair. The Great Annihilator also has a radio source counterpart that emits jets approximately three light-years long. These jets are probably synchrotron emissions from [[Pair production|positron-electron pairs]] streaming out at high velocities from the source of antimatter.

[[File:Kittenberger Kálmán1920.png|thumb|Kálmán Kittenberger in 1920]]

'''Kálmán Kittenberger''' ([[Léva]], October 10, 1881 - [[Nagymaros]], January 4, 1958) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] traveller, [[natural history|natural historian]], [[biologist]] and collector. He was born in [[Léva]], now in [[Slovakia]] (''Levice'').

He made six travels to [[Africa]], the first time in 1902, where he was sent by the [[Hungarian Royal Society]] in [[Budapest]]. He spent altogether ten and a half years in Africa. During his journeys he faced financial difficulties as he received no sponsorship, but he was still able to grant 60,000 items to the biological collections of the Hungarian National Museum, including 300 new animal species. (Almost 40 of them were named after Kittenberger, including ''[[Pachyonomastus kittenbergeri]]'') Part of that collection was annihilated by a fire in 1956.

Three locations in the United States were used as landing sites for the [[Space Shuttle]] system. Each site included runways of sufficient length to provide adequate distance for the slowing-down of a returning spacecraft. The prime landing site was the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida, a purpose-built landing strip. Landings also occurred at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California, and one took place at [[White Sands Space Harbor]] in New Mexico. No space shuttle landed on a dry lakebed runway after 1991. 

The first international site was Cartago,Valle in Colombia (CTA)

Various international landing sites were also available in the event of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) scenario, as well as other sites in the United States and Canada in case of an East Coast Abort Landing (ECAL) situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/shutref/sts/aborts/tal.html |title=HSF – The Shuttle |publisher=Spaceflight.nasa.gov |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space shuttle landings were intended to regularly take place at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California for Department of Defense missions launched from the site, but none occurred due to the cancellation of all launches from Vandenberg.

[[File:shuttlelandingstrip.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle Landing Facility]] at Kennedy Space Center, April 2001]]
The Shuttle Landing Facility at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida has a single {{convert|15000|ft|m|adj=on}} concrete runway, 15/33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/facilities/slf.html |title=Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) |publisher=Science.ksc.nasa.gov |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designated Runway 15 or 33, depending on the direction of use. The first landing at the SLF was for mission [[STS-41B]] in 1984; landings were suspended at the site following brake damage and a blown tire during the [[STS-51D]] landing in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51D.html |title=NASA – STS-51D |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resumed in 1990. 78 space shuttle missions landed at Kennedy Space Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kennedy History Quiz |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/quiz_page.html#23 |website=nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Edwards Air Force Base ==
[[File:STS-4 landing.jpg|thumb|[[STS-4]] lands on Edwards AFB runway 22.]]
[[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California was the site of the first space shuttle landing, and became a back-up site to the prime landing location, the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at the Kennedy Space Center. Several runways are arrayed on the dry lakebed at [[Rogers Dry Lake#Edwards Air Force Base|Rogers Dry Lake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/KEDW |title=KEDW – Edwards Air Force Base |publisher=AirNav |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also concrete runways. Space shuttle landings on the lake bed took place on Runways 05/23, 15/33 and 17/35. Of the concrete strips, the main Runway 04/22 was utilized. During the renovation of 04/22, a temporary runway (with the same designation) was constructed parallel to it and used for one landing ([[STS-126]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/21995/1231/ |title=Endeavour, STS-126 crew lands on temp California runway |publisher=iTWire |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=20 October 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 54 space shuttle missions, as well as all five free flights of [[Space Shuttle Enterprise]], landed on Edwards Air Force Base runways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dryden Supported Many Aspects of Space Shuttle Missions |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/drydens_shuttle_support.html |website=nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[White Sands Space Harbor]] at [[White Sands Test Facility]] in New Mexico was an emergency landing site for the space shuttle and was used as a backup when the runways at Edwards Air Force Base and the Kennedy Space Center were unavailable.  Two {{convert|35000|ft|m}} runways and a {{convert|12800|ft|m|adj=on}} runway were available for landings on the dry lake bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/spaceharbor/Capabilities.html |title=NASA – Capabilities |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=3 June 2008 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One mission, [[STS-3]], used Runway 17 for a landing due to flooding at its originally planned landing site, Edwards Air Force Base.

== Transoceanic Abort Landing Sites ==
In the event of an abort during launch, NASA had several international locations designated as Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) sites.  The sites included [[Lajes Field|Lajes Air Base]] in Terceira island, Azores, Portugal, [[Zaragoza Airport|Zaragoza Air Base]] in Spain, [[Morón Air Base]] in Spain, and [[Istres-Le Tubé Air Base|Istres Air Base]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/landing_sites.html |title=NASA – Roster of Runways Ready to Bring a Shuttle Home |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All sites have runways of sufficient length to support the landing of a space shuttle, and included personnel from NASA as well as equipment to aid a space shuttle landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/nasafact/tal.htm |title=John F.

[[RAF Fairford]] was the only Transoceanic Abort Landing site for NASA's Space Shuttle in the UK. As well as having a sufficiently long runway for a shuttle landing (the runway is 3&amp;nbsp;km long), Fairford also had NASA-trained fire and medical crews stationed on the base.&lt;ref name="BBCG"&gt;{{cite news|title=RAF Fairford on standby for Space Shuttle landing|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/gloucestershire/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9158000/9158818.stm|accessdate=19 January 2011|newspaper=BBC Gloucestershire|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== East Coast Abort Landing Sites ==
In certain launch abort situations where the mission profile supports a trajectory for such a landing, runways on the East Coast of the United States and Canada could have been used for an East Coast Abort Landing (ECAL) situation.  The following sites could have been used for an ECAL:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Shuttle Landing and Rollout Training at the VerticalMotion Simulator|url=http://www.aviationsystemsdivision.arc.nasa.gov/publications/2008/AF2008096.pdf|publisher=NASA Aviation Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miami International Airport]], Miami, Florida; [[Plattsburgh International Airport]], Plattsburgh, New York, [[Francis S.

This is a collection of lists of countries by average [[life expectancy]] at birth.

==Methodology==
Life expectancy equals the average number of years a person born in a given country is expected to live if mortality rates at each age were to remain steady in the future. The life expectancy is shown separately for males and females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-[[Sovereign state|sovereign entities]] are also included in this list.

The figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including ongoing wars, obesity, and HIV infections.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 71.5 years (68 years and 4 months for males and 72 years and 8 months for females) over the period 2010–2015 according to United Nations World Population Prospects 2015 Revision,&lt;ref name="WPP2010"/&gt; or 69 years (67 years for males and 71.1 years for females) for 2016 according to ''[[The World Factbook]]''.&lt;ref name=cia2012&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Fact-book Life Expectancy|publisher= Cia.gov|date=2012|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2015 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) data, women on average live longer than men in all major regions and in all individual countries except for [[Mali]] and [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]].&lt;ref name="WPP2010" /&gt;

The countries with the lowest overall life expectancies per the WHO are Sierra Leone, the Central African Republic, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Lesotho]], [[Somalia]], [[Eswatini]], [[Angola]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]], [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Mozambique]]. Of those countries, only Lesotho, Eswatini, and Mozambique in 2011 were suffering from an [[HIV prevalence]] rate of greater than 12 percent in the 15–49 age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Prevalence of HIV, total (% of population ages 15–49) | url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing life expectancies from birth across countries can be problematic. There are differing definitions of live birth vs stillbirth even among more developed countries and less developed countries often have poor reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/6/07-043471/en/|title=WHO - Long-term trends in fetal mortality: implications for developing countries|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of mental disorders as defined by the DSM and ICD'''.

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) is the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s standard reference for [[psychiatry]] which includes over 450 different definitions of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Psychiatric Association. 2013. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) published by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the international standard system for classifying all medical diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/|title=International Classification of Diseases (ICD)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|deadurl=no|archivedate=12 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212190115/http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a section on [[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|mental and behavioral disorders]].

The diagnostic criteria and information in the DSM and ICD are revised and updated with each new version. This list contains conditions which are currently recognised as mental disorders as defined by these two systems. There is disagreement in various fields of [[Mental health professional|mental health care]], including the field of [[psychiatry]], over the definitions and criteria used to delineate mental disorders. Of concern to some professionals is whether certain mental disorders should be classified as '[[Mental disorder|mental illness]]es'  or whether they may be better described as [[neurological disorder]]s, or in other ways.

'''Marine debris''', also known as '''marine litter''', is human-created [[waste]] that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a [[lake]], [[sea]], [[ocean]], or [[waterway]]. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[gyre]]s and on [[coast]]lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9807/28/toxic.seabirds/|title=Pollution invades small Pacific island|author=Gary Strieker|date=28 July 1998|accessdate=1 April 2008|publisher=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231062708/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9807/28/toxic.seabirds/|archivedate=31 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequently washing aground, when it is known as ''beach litter'' or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ''ocean dumping''. Naturally occurring debris, such as [[driftwood]], are also present.

With the increasing use of [[plastic]], human influence has become an issue as many types of plastics do not [[Biodegradation|biodegrade]]. Waterborne plastic poses a serious threat to [[fish]], [[seabird]]s, [[marine reptile]]s, and [[marine mammal]]s, as well as to boats and coasts.&lt;ref name="Facts22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/marinedebris101|title=Facts about marine debris|publisher=US NOAA|accessdate=10 April 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213110801/http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/marinedebris101/|archivedate=13 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into storm drains and waterways and wind-blown landfill waste all contribute to this problem.

In efforts to prevent and mediate marine debris and pollutants, laws and policies have been adopted internationally. Depending on relevance to the issues and various levels of contribution, some countries have introduced more specified protection policies.

A wide variety of man-made objects can become marine debris; [[plastic bag]]s, [[balloon]]s, [[buoy]]s, [[rope]], [[medical waste]], [[glass]] and [[plastic bottles]], cigarette stubs, [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]]s, [[beverage can]]s, [[polystyrene]], [[ghost net|lost fishing line and nets]], and various wastes from [[cruise ship pollution|cruise ships]] and [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore. [[Six pack rings]], in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990716.html |title=Should you cut up six-pack rings so they don't choke sea birds? |date=16 July 1999 |author=Cecil Adams |publisher=The Straight Dope |accessdate=11 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006061820/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990716.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US military used ocean dumping for unused weapons and bombs, including ordinary bombs, [[UXO]], landmines and chemical weapons from at least 1919 until 1970.&lt;ref name=wbgh&gt;{{cite news|author1=Edgar B.

===Plastic===

8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in the world's oceans each year.

Plastic waste has reached all the world's oceans. This [[plastic pollution#Effects on animals|plastic pollution]] harms an estimated 100,000 [[sea turtle]]s and marine mammals and 1,000,000 sea creatures each year.&lt;ref name="STRP Ban Plastic Bags"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaturtles.org/article.php?id=1751 |title=A Ban on Plastic Bags Will Save the Lives of California's Endangered Leatherback Sea Turtles |year=2010 |publisher=Sea Turtle Restoration Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128000648/http://seaturtles.org/article.php?id=1751 |archivedate=28 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger plastics (called "macroplastics") such as [[plastic shopping bag]]s can clog the digestive tracts of larger animals when consumed by them&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter/publications/docs/anl_oview.pdf |format=PDF |title=Marine Litter: An analytical overview |accessdate=1 August 2008 |year=2005 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070717141400/http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter/publications/docs/anl_oview.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can cause starvation through restricting the movement of food, or by filling the stomach and tricking the animal into thinking it is full. [[Microplastics]] on the other hand harm smaller marine life. For example, [[pelagic]] plastic pieces in the center of our ocean’s gyres outnumber live marine plankton, and are passed up the food chain to reach all marine life.&lt;ref name="Moore et al, 2007"&gt;C.J.

[[Plastic particle water pollution|Nurdle]]s, also known as "mermaids' tears", are plastic pellets, typically under five millimetres in diameter, that are a major component of marine debris. They are a raw material in plastics manufacturing, and enter the [[natural environment]] when spilled. [[physical weathering|Weathering]] produces ever smaller pieces. Nurdles strongly resemble [[fish eggs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6218698.stm |title=Plastics 'poisoning world's seas' |accessdate=1 April 2008 |date=7 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News |first=Maggie |last=Ayre |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224090306/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6218698.stm |archivedate=24 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sea debris===
Litter, made from diverse materials that are denser than surface water (such as [[glass]]es, metals and some plastics), have been found to spread over the floor of seas and open oceans, where it can become entangled in [[coral]]s and interfere with other [[Benthos|sea-floor life]], or even become buried under sediment, making [[Marine salvage|clean-up]] extremely difficult, especially due to the wide area of its dispersal compared to [[shipwrecks]]. Research performed by [[MBARI]] found items including plastic bags [[Bathyal zone|below 2000m depth]] off the west coast of North America and around Hawaii.&lt;ref name="MBARI News Release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbari.org/news/news_releases/2013/deep-debris/deep-debris-release.html |title=MBARI News Release: MBARI research shows where trash accumulates in the deep sea |year=2013 |publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute |accessdate=7 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707055536/http://www.mbari.org/news/news_releases/2013/deep-debris/deep-debris-release.html |archivedate=7 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once waterborne, debris becomes mobile. Flotsam can be blown by the wind, or follow the flow of [[ocean current]]s, often ending up in the middle of [[oceanic gyre]]s where currents are weakest. The [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]] is one such example of this, comprising a vast region of the North [[Pacific Ocean]] rich with anthropogenic wastes.

The oceans may contain as much as one hundred million [[ton]]s of plastic.&lt;ref name=Algalita/&gt;  It is estimated that each garbage patch in the ocean have up to one million tons of trash swirling around in them, sometimes extending down to around one hundred feet below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Matsumura, Satsuki, and Keiichi Nasu.

Over 40% of oceans are classified as subtropical gyres, a fourth of the planets surface area has become an accumulator of floating plastic debris.

Plastics were found as microfibres in core samples drilled from sediments at the bottom of the deep ocean.  The cause of such widespread deep sea deposition has yet to be determined.

Not all [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] artifacts placed in the oceans are harmful. Iron and concrete structures typically do little damage to the environment because they generally sink to the bottom and become immobile, and at shallow depths they can even provide scaffolding for [[artificial reef]]s. Ships and subway cars have been deliberately sunk for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://192.5.14.110/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1377/MR1377.ch5.pdf |work=Disposal Options for Ships |title=Chapter 5: Reefing |accessdate=3 May 2008 |date=2 August 2006 |author1=Ron Hess |author2=Denis Rushworth |author3=Michael Hynes |author4=John Peters |publisher=Rand Corporation |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629110318/http://192.5.14.110/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1377/MR1377.ch5.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debris removal==
[[File:DC WASA Marine Debris Skimmer.jpg|thumb|Skimmer boat used to remove floating debris and trash from the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Anacostia River|Anacostia]] rivers]]

Techniques for collecting and removing marine (or riverine) debris include the use of debris skimmer boats ''(pictured)''. Devices such as these can be used where floating debris presents a danger to navigation. For example, the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] removes 90 tons of "drifting material" from [[San Francisco Bay]] every month. The Corps has been doing this work since 1942, when a [[seaplane]] carrying Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] collided with a piece of floating debris and sank, costing the life of its pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/newsrelease/newsrelease_11_07_07.html |title=Debris collection onsite after Bay Bridge struck |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=7 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109084709/http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/newsrelease/newsrelease_11_07_07.html |archivedate=9 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once debris becomes "beach litter", collection by hand and specialized [[beach cleaner|beach-cleaning machines]] are used to gather the debris.

Elsewhere, "trash traps" are installed on small rivers to capture waterborne debris before it reaches the sea. For example, [[South Australia]]'s [[Adelaide]] operates a number of such traps, known as "trash racks" or "gross pollutant traps" on the [[Torrens River]], which flows (during the wet season) into [[Gulf St Vincent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/ProjectsTaskforce/TrashRacks/tabid/544/Default.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719020149/http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/ProjectsTaskforce/TrashRacks/tabid/544/Default.aspx|dead-url=yes|archivedate=19 July 2008|title=Trash Racks|publisher=Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In lakes or near the coast, manual removal can also be used. [[Project AWARE]] for example promotes the idea of letting dive clubs clean up litter, for example as a diving exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectaware.org/project/10Tips|title=10 Tips for Divers to Protect the Ocean Planet|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923111851/http://www.projectaware.org/project/10Tips|archivedate=23 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the sea, the removal of artificial debris (i.e. plastics) is still in its infancy. However some projects have been started which used ships with nets (Kaisei and New Horizon) to catch some plastics, primarily for research purposes. Another method to gather artificial litter has been proposed by [[Boyan Slat]]. He suggested using platforms with arms to gather the debris, situated inside the current of gyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=MarineDebris.Info |url=http://marinedebris.info/wiki/great-pacific-garbage-patch |title=Methods for collecting plastic litter at sea |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024154340/http://marinedebris.info/wiki/great-pacific-garbage-patch |archive-date=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is that removing marine debris from our oceans can potentially cause more harm than good. Cleaning up micro-plastics could also accidentally take out plankton, which are the main lower level food group for the marine food chain and over half of the photosynthesis on earth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One of the most efficient and cost effective ways to help reduce the amount of plastic entering our oceans is to not participate in using single use plastics, avoid plastic bottled drinks such as water bottles, use reusable shopping bags, and to buy products with reusable packaging.&lt;ref&gt;Wabnitz, C., &amp; Nichols, W. J. (2010). Editorial: Plastic pollution: An ocean emergency. ''Marine Turtle Newsletter,'' (129), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership===
[[Property law]], [[admiralty law]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]] may be of relevance when [[lost, mislaid, and abandoned property]] is found at sea. [[Marine salvage|Salvage law]] rewards salvors for risking life and property to rescue the property of another from peril. On land the distinction between deliberate and accidental loss led to the concept of a "[[treasure trove]]". In the [[United Kingdom]], shipwrecked goods should be reported to a [[Receiver of Wreck]], and if identifiable, they should be returned to their rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6287047.stm |title=Can you keep ship-wrecked goods? |accessdate=29 May 2008 |date=22 January 2007 |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123152554/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6287047.stm |archivedate=23 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
A large number of groups and individuals are active in preventing or educating about marine debris. For example, [[5 Gyres]] is an organization aimed at reducing plastics pollution in the oceans, and was one of two organizations that recently researched the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. [[Heal the Bay]] is another organization, focusing on protecting [[California]]'s [[Santa Monica Bay]], by sponsoring beach cleanup programs along with other activities. [[Marina DeBris]] is an artist focusing most of her recent work on educating people about beach trash.

Forty-eight plastics manufacturers from 25 countries, are members of the Global Plastic Associations for solutions on Marine Litter, have made the pledge to help prevent marine debris and to encourage recycling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mitigation ===
[[File:How_long_until_it's_gone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The decomposition times of marine debris]]

Marine debris is a problem created by all of us, not only those in coastal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chow|first=Lorraine|date=29 June 2016|title=80% Of Ocean Plastic Comes From Land-Based Sources, New Report Finds.|url=http://www.ecowatch.com/80-of-ocean-plastic-comes-from-land-based-sources-new-report-finds-1891173457.html.|journal=EcoWatch|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean debris can come from as far away as Nebraska. The places that see the most damage are often not the places that produce the pollution. For ocean pollution, much of the trash may come from inland states, where people may never see the ocean and thus may never put any thought into protecting it. The problem continues to grow in tandem with plastics usage and disposal. Steps can be taken to prevent the movement of inland plastics into the oceans.

Plastic debris from inland states come from two main sources: ordinary litter and materials from open dumps and landfills that blow or wash away to inland waterways and wastewater outflows. The refuse finds its way from inland waterways, rivers, streams and lakes to the ocean. Though ocean and coastal area cleanups are important, it is crucial to address plastic waste that originates from inland and landlocked states.&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, J. H. (2015). Managing Marine Plastic Pollution. ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', ''123''(4), A90-A93. doi:10.1289/ehp.123-A90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceanicsociety.org/blog/1720/7-ways-to-reduce-ocean-plastic-pollution-todayStrategies|title=7 Ways To Reduce Ocean Plastic Pollution Today|website=www.oceanicsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330075852/https://www.oceanicsociety.org/blog/1720/7-ways-to-reduce-ocean-plastic-pollution-todayStrategies|archivedate=30 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the systems level, there are various ways to reduce the amount of debris entering our waterways:
* Improve waste transportation to and from sites by utilizing closed container storage and shipping
* Restrict open waste facilities near waterways
* Promote the use of [[Refuse-derived fuel]]s. Used plastic with low residual value often do not get recycled and are more likely to leak into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;''Stemming the tide: Land-based strategies for a plastic-free ocean'' (pp. 1-48, Rep.). (2015). McKinsey Center for Business and Environment.&lt;/ref&gt; However, turning these unwanted plastics that would otherwise stay in landfills into refuse-derived fuels allows for further use; they can be used as supplement fuels at power plants
* Improve recovery rates for plastic (in 2012, the United States generated 11.46 million tons of plastic waste, of which only 6.7% was recovered&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: Facts and Figures for 2012 [fact sheet]. Washington, DC:U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adapt [[Extended producer responsibility|Extended Producer Responsibility]] strategies to make producers responsible for product management when products and their packaging become waste; encourage reusable product design to minimize negative impacts on the environment&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Jennifer, and Christopher Bosso. “Extended Producer Responsibility in the United States.” Journal of Industrial Ecology, vol. 17, no. 2, 2013, pp. 175–185., doi:10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00572.x.&lt;/ref&gt;
As consumers, there are things we can do to help reduce the amount of plastic entering our waterways:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
[[File:7_Swaps.jpg|thumb|7 simple single-use swaps people can make to save trash.]]
* Reduce usage of single-use plastics such as plastic bags, straws, water bottles, utensils and coffee cups by replacing them with reusable products such as reusable bags, metal straws, reusable water bottles, bamboo toothbrushes and reusable coffee cups
* Avoid microbeads, which are found in face scrubs, toothpastes and body washes
* Participate in a river or lake beach clean up
* Support municipality bans and other legislation regulating single-use plastics and plastic waste 
* Continue to recycle, recycle, recycle
Though the awareness of inland ocean conservation debris mitigation seems to be small compared to coastal states, some organizations in the United States are already working to improve this. The Colorado Ocean Coalition was formed in 2011 with the goal of impressing upon inland citizens that they don’t need to see the ocean to care about its health. It has since grown beyond one state and now forms the [https://inlandoceancoalition.org Inland Ocean Coalition], with the mission of promoting knowledge and awareness of how inland states contribute to pollution of the ocean, aiming to shatter the ‘out of sight, out of mind’ mentality that often applies in this region.

“Those who live among mountains, rivers and inland cities have a direct impact on the cycle of life in the ocean,” reads the [https://inlandoceancoalition.org IOCO] website. "The changes we need to make to address the largest threats facing our seas—lowering carbon emissions, reducing trash and pollution, eating sustainable seafood, safeguarding watersheds, promoting marine protected areas (MPAs)—can happen from anywhere in the world.”

This organization has chapters in many inland US states and promotes programs like watershed cleanups, youth-centered education, and decreasing the use of plastic.

=== Plastic-to-fuel conversion strategy ===

[[The Clean Oceans Project|The Clean Oceans Project (TCOP)]] promotes conversion of the plastic waste into valuable liquid fuels, including [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[kerosene]], using plastic-to-fuel conversion technology developed by Blest Co. Ltd., a Japanese [[environmental engineering]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosko |first=Sarah |title=Mid-Ocean Plastics Cleanup Schemes: Too Little Too Late? |url=http://www.emagazine.com/blog/mid-ocean-plastics-cleanup-schemes-too-little-too-late |publisher=E-The Environmental Magazine |accessdate=25 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044741/http://www.emagazine.com/blog/mid-ocean-plastics-cleanup-schemes-too-little-too-late |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jimholm&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Holm: The Clean Oceans Project|url=http://tedxgramercy.com/talk?a96d952bade720720be27c4bc50018fe|publisher=TEDxGramercy|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210180721/http://tedxgramercy.com/talk?a96d952bade720720be27c4bc50018fe|archivedate=10 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamel|first=Jessi|title=From Trash to Fuel|url=http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/santa-cruz-environmental-news/2392-from-trash-to-fuel.html|publisher=Santa Cruz Good Times|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425003518/http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/santa-cruz-environmental-news/2392-from-trash-to-fuel.html|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Amy E.|title=Santa Cruz nonprofit hopes to make fuel from ocean-based plastic|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19658573|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425003927/http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19658573|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCOP plans to educate local communities and create a financial [[incentive]] for them to [[recycle]] plastic, keep their shorelines clean, and minimize plastic waste.&lt;ref name = jimholm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Response|url=http://thecleanoceansproject.com/?page_id=18|publisher=The Clean Oceans Project|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425021325/http://thecleanoceansproject.com/?page_id=18|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="994">'''Material physics''' is the use of [[physics]] to describe the physical properties of materials. It is a synthesis of [[physical sciences]] such as [[chemistry]], [[solid mechanics]], [[solid state physics]], and [[materials science]]. Materials physics is considered a subset of [[condensed matter physics]] and applies fundamental condensed matter concepts to complex multiphase media, including materials of technological interest.

Current fields that materials physicists work in include electronic, optical, and magnetic materials, novel materials and structures, quantum phenomena in materials, nonequilibrium physics, and soft condensed matter physics. New experimental and computational tools are constantly improving how materials systems are modeled and studied and are also fields when materials physicists work in.

'''Old Weather''' is an online weather data project that currently invites members of the public to assist in digitising weather observations recorded in US log books dating from the mid-19th  century onwards. It is an example of [[citizen science]] that enlists members of the public to help in scientific research. It contributes to the [[Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.met-acre.org/Home/ACRE_G2.png?attredirects=0&lt;/ref&gt; Data collected by Old Weather has been used by at least five different climate reanalysis projects, including [[HURDAT]], [[Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA)|SODA]] and [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts|ECMWF]].&lt;ref name="bro4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.oldweather.org/index.php?topic=3620.0|author=Philip Brohan|title=People using our results|date= 1 March 2013|publisher=Oldweather.org|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, the project was awarded the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] IBM Award for Meteorological Innovation that Matters.&lt;ref name="RMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmets.org/rmets-award-winners-2012|author=|title=2012 Award Winners|year=2013|publisher=[[Royal Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Old Weather is a [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] project and is a collaboration between researchers at many institutions, including the [[University of Oxford]], [[Oxford Martin School]], ACRE (International Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth), Naval-History.Net of [[Penarth]], [[Jisc]] which encourages UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies, the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Maritime Greenwich]], London, and the [[UK National Archives]], [[Kew]], London.

==Importance of volunteers==
In the past, [[computer program]]s have proved unable to read [[handwriting]] reliably.
However, it may be worth exploring the current status&lt;ref&gt;http://transcriptorium.eu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://read.transkribus.eu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.himanis.org&lt;/ref&gt;
of automatic and computer-assisted transcription&lt;ref&gt;http://transcriptorium.eu/demots/htr&lt;/ref&gt;
and probabilistic indexing&lt;ref&gt;http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/himanis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://prhlt-carabela.prhlt.upv.es/tso&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://prhlt-carabela.prhlt.upv.es/bentham&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://transcriptorium.eu/demots/KWSdemos&lt;/ref&gt;
technologies for handwritten text images—also called Handwriting Text Recognition (HTR), Computer Assisted Transcription of Text Images (CATTI) and Keyword Spotting (KWS), respectively).

In any case, the task is much better performed by the [[human brain]] and the results transferred to a digital form. 
In the site's tutorial, would-be [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s are shown how to digitise a weather record. Further instructions on how to transcribe the logs are available on the associated Old Weather forum.
It is intended that the pages of the logs are digitised by at least three people. The results will be used to make climate model projections and an improved database of weather extremes.

==USRC, USCG and USS log books==
Currently, the [[logbook|log book]]s of 2 US vessels are available, each of which have been scanned page by page, and the logs of another 21 vessels have been completed. 
More log books will be added at intervals.
The transcriber notes the following from the log books: date, location (or voyage) and weather records, usually consisting of wind direction and strength, weather conditions, cloud type and/or amount of clear sky, barometric pressure and temperature readings. Other log entries, such as refueling figures and sightings of sea-ice, ships, people, landmarks or animals may also be recorded, as well as interesting events.

==Progress==

===Phases I &amp; II===
Phase I was launched in October 2010&lt;ref name="phase1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rachel Saslow|date=2010-10-18|title=British scientists seek help extracting weather data from WW1 naval records|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2011-11-12|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/18/AR2010101804491.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC staff|date=2010-10-13|title=WW1 ships to chart past climate|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2011-11-12|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11532534}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all the available Royal Navy logs from that phase and from Phase II have now been completed. By July 23, 2012,
officially, 16,400 volunteers had transcribed the weather data from 1,090,745 pages&lt;ref name="bro2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oldweather.org/2012/09/05/theres-a-green-one-and-a-pink-one-and-a-blue-one-and-a-yellow-one/|author=Philip Brohan|title=Theres a green one and a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one|year=2012|publisher=Oldweather.org|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the log books of 302 ships. These phases of the  project have generated 1.6 million weather observations.&lt;ref name="bro1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oldweather.org/2012/07/23/one-million-six-hundred-thousand-new-observations/|author=Philip Brohan|title=One million six hundred thousand new observations|year=2012|publisher=Oldweather.org|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase III===
Phase III, consisting of logs from US ships voyaging in the Arctic and worldwide from the mid-1800s onwards, was launched in October 2012 and is now in progress.&lt;ref name="phase3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Simpson (Reuters)|year=2012|title=US Looks to Old Arctic Ship Logs for Climate Change Clues|publisher=ScientificAmerican.com|accessdate=2011-11-12|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=us-looks-to-old-arctic-ship-logs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/retrieving-the-weather-of-the-past/|author=Justin Gillis|title=Retrieving the weather of the past|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=5 November 2012|date=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase IV===
Currently, the scope of the project is being extended to include Arctic voyages and expeditions.  Satellite imagery of this region goes back only to the 1950s, but it was explored for 100 years before that (for example the [[Franklin Expedition]]).

==Results==
Initial results of Phase I will be published after data collection is complete and conclusions can be made.

Indeed, the readings are still being assessed at a very broad level. But the distribution of temperature by latitude and wind force by latitude have been plotted for 120,000 results for which three readings have been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Philip Brohan|date=3 February 2011|url= http://forum.oldweather.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=rnierle2hlfkbg72dk0eus3317&amp;topic=1155.0|title=Stanley to Archangel, and all points in between|publisher=Oldweather.org|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security and political considerations==
Because [[climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climatechange/ |title=Climate change |publisher=Met Office |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a very [[political issue]], interested parties could try to corrupt the data by, say, entering [[temperature]] figures that are too high or too low. Because three sets of records for each data point will be entered, any set from a digitiser showing a marked deviation from the other records should be easily checkable and eliminated. Large-scale [[fraud]] is unlikely because the data is entered one log page at a time, and so is immune to a [[spam (electronic)|spam]] type of attack. Collaborative projects such as [[Linux]] and [[Wikipedia]] have for the most part been able to rely on the [[transparency (behavior)|transparent]] [[honesty]] of those taking part.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Accidental errors==
Accidental errors, such as reading '4's for '7's are possible, but often context will sort this out. A temperature of 40&amp;nbsp;°F is unlikely to be correct for a latitude in the tropics and may safely be assumed to be 70&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref name="acacia"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Zooniverse|date=2010-10-27|title=First fruits:Weather records from HMS Acacia|publisher=Oldweather.org|accessdate=2011-11-12|url=http://blogs.zooniverse.org/oldweather/2010/10/first-fruits-weather-records-from-hms-acacia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pioneer P-1''' was a failed mission in the [[Pioneer program]]. The [[spacecraft]] was a 1-meter diameter sphere, with a propulsion module. It was launched on September 24, 1959 on an [[Atlas rocket|Atlas C-Able]] launcher. It was to carry a TV camera and a magnetic field sensor. It was to be [[spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]], and was known as a 'paddlewheel' spacecraft. The Atlas-Able launch vehicle was destroyed in an explosion on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral during a pre-launch static test. The payload of P-1 spacecraft and Able IV space engine was not present on the launch vehicle when it exploded, and the payload was later used in the P-3 mission.&lt;ref&gt;Gunter's Space Page - information on [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/pioneer_p1.htm Pioneer P-1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "U.S. Moon Rocket Blows Up in Test", Sept 25, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pygmy hippopotamus''' (''Choeropsis liberiensis'' or ''Hexaprotodon liberiensis'') is a small [[Hippopotamidae|hippopotamid]] which is native to the forests and swamps of [[West Africa]], primarily in [[Liberia]], with small populations in [[Sierra Leone]], [[Guinea]], and [[Ivory Coast]].

The pygmy hippo is reclusive and [[nocturnal]]. It is one of only two extant species in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Hippopotamidae]], the other being its much larger relative, the common [[hippopotamus]] (''Hippopotamus amphibius'') or Nile hippopotamus. The pygmy hippopotamus displays many terrestrial [[adaptation]]s, but like the hippo, it is semiaquatic and relies on water to keep its skin moist and its body temperature cool. Behaviors such as mating and giving birth may occur in water or on land. The pygmy hippo is herbivorous, feeding on ferns, [[dicotyledons|broad-leaved plants]], [[grass]]es, and [[fruit]]s it finds in the forests.

A rare [[nocturnal]] forest creature, the pygmy hippopotamus is a difficult animal to study in the wild.
Pygmy hippos were unknown outside West Africa until the 19th century. Introduced to zoos in the early 20th century, they breed well in captivity and the vast majority of research is derived from zoo specimens.&lt;ref name="Stroman 1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stroman|first1=H. R.|last2=Slaughter|first2=L. M.|title=The care and breeding of the Pygmy hippopotamus (''Choeropsis liberiensis'') in captivity|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|date=January 1972|volume=12|issue=1|pages=126–131|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1090.1972.tb02296.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survival of the species in captivity is more assured than in the wild; the [[World Conservation Union]] estimates that fewer than 3,000 pygmy hippos remain in the wild.&lt;ref name="Redlist"/&gt;

Pygmy hippos are primarily threatened by loss of habitat, as forests are logged and converted to farm land, and are also vulnerable to [[poaching]], hunting for [[bushmeat]], natural predators, and war. Pygmy hippos are among the species [[Environmental issues in Liberia|illegally hunted for food in Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Anne Look"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/article/370590.html|title=Poaching in Liberia's Forests Threatens Rare Animals|work=[[Voice of America]]|first=Anne|last=Look|date= 8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy and origins ==
Nomenclature of the pygmy hippopotamus reflects that of the [[Hippopotamus#Taxonomy and origins|hippopotamus]]. The plural form is pygmy hippopotami (''hippopotamuses'' is also accepted as a [[English plural|plural]] form by the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]], or ''pygmy hippos'' for short). A male pygmy hippopotamus is known as a ''bull'', a female as a ''cow'', and a baby as a ''calf''.  A group of hippopotami is known as a ''herd'' or a ''bloat''.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of animal names]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pygmy Hippopotamus Skull.jpg|thumb|Skull]]
The pygmy hippopotamus is a member of the family [[Hippopotamidae]] where it is classified as a member of either the [[genus]] ''Choeropsis'' ("resembling a [[Pig|hog]]") or, the genus ''[[Hexaprotodon]]'' ("six front teeth"). Members of Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as '''hippopotamids'''. Sometimes the sub-family '''Hippopotaminae''' is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotami and [[anthracotheres]] in the superfamily ''Anthracotheroidea'' or ''Hippopotamoidea''.

A sister species of the pygmy hippopotamus may have been the little-studied [[Malagasy Hippopotamus#C. madagascariensis|Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus]] (''Hexaprotodon madagascariensis'' or ''Hippopotamus madagascariensis''), one of three recently extinct [[Malagasy Hippopotamus|species from Madagascar]]. ''C. madagascariensis'' was the same size as ''C. liberiensis'' and shared its terrestrial behavior, inhabiting the forested highlands of Madagascar, rather than open rivers. It is believed to have gone extinct within the last 500 years.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Harris, J.M. | year = 1991 | pages = 31–85 | title = Family Hippopotamidae | journal = Koobi Fora Research Project.

The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the genus of the pygmy hippopotamus has changed as understanding of the animal has developed.&lt;ref name="Redlist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Linnean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; [[Samuel G. Morton]] initially classified the animal as ''Hippopotamus minor'', but later determined it was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, and labeled it ''Choeropsis''. In 1977, [[Shirley C. Coryndon]] proposed that the pygmy hippopotamus was closely related to ''Hexaprotodon'', a genus that consisted of prehistoric hippos mostly native to Asia.&lt;ref name=Coryndon/&gt;

This assertion was widely accepted,&lt;ref name="Redlist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Linnean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; until Boisserie asserted in 2005 that the pygmy hippopotamus was not a member of ''Hexaprotodon'', after a thorough examination of the phylogeny of Hippopotamidae. He suggested instead that the pygmy hippopotamus was a distinct genus, and returned the animal to ''Choeropsis''.&lt;ref name="Linnean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cetartiodactyla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"/&gt; All agree that the modern pygmy hippopotamus, be it ''H. liberiensis'' or ''C. liberiensis'', is the only extant member of its genus.&lt;ref name="Linnean"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boisserie |first=Jean-Renaud |year=2005 |title=The phylogeny and taxonomy of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia: Artiodactyla): a review based on morphology and cladistic analysis |journal=[[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]] |volume= 143 |pages= 1–26 | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00138.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coryndon&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Shirley C.|last=Coryndon| title = The taxonomy and nomenclature of the Hippopotamidae (Mammalia, Artiodactyla) and a description of two new fossil species | year = 1977 | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | journal = Proceedings of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen | pages = 61–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nigerian subspecies ===
A distinct subspecies of pygmy hippopotamus existed in Nigeria until at least the 20th century, though the validity of this has been questioned.&lt;ref name="Redlist"/&gt; The existence of the subspecies, makes ''Choeropsis liberiensis liberiensis'' (or ''Hexaprotodon liberiensis liberiensis'' under the old classification) the full [[trinomen|trinomial nomenclature]] for the Liberian pygmy hippopotamus. The Nigerian pygmy hippopotamus was never studied in the wild and never captured. All research and all zoo specimens are the Liberian subspecies. The Nigerian subspecies is classified as ''C. liberiensis heslopi''.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

The Nigerian pygmy hippopotamus ranged in the [[Niger River|Niger River Delta]], especially near [[Port Harcourt]], but no reliable reports exist after the collection of the museum specimens secured by I. R. P. Heslop, a British colonial officer, in the early 1940s. It is probably extinct.&lt;ref name="Redlist"/&gt; The subspecies is separated by over {{convert|1800|km|mi|abbr=on}} and the [[Dahomey Gap]], a region of savanna that divides the forest regions of West Africa. The subspecies is named after I. R. P. Heslop, who claimed in 1945 to have shot a pygmy hippo in the Niger Delta region and collected several skulls. He estimated that perhaps no more than 30 pygmy hippos remained in the region.&lt;ref name=Action&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/pphsg/APchap3-3.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20080105044155/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/pphsg/APchap3-3.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2008-01-05 | title = Pigs, Peccaries and Hippos Status Survey and Action Plan | year = 1993 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | work = [[World Conservation Union]] status survey | author = Eltringham, S. Keith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heslop reportedly sent four pygmy hippopotamus skulls he collected to the British Museum of Natural History in London. These specimens were not subjected to taxonomic evaluation, however, until 1969 when G. B. Corbet classified the skulls as belonging to a separate subspecies based on consistent variations in the proportions of the skulls.&lt;ref name=Corbet&gt;{{Cite journal| title = The taxonomic status of the pygmy hippopotamus, Choeropsis liberiensis, from the Niger Delta | author = Corbet, G. B. | journal = [[Journal of Zoology]] | year = 1969 | volume = 158 | pages = 387–394| doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1969.tb02156.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigerian pygmy hippos were seen or shot in [[Rivers State]], [[Imo State]] and [[Bayelsa State]], [[Nigeria]]. While some local populations are aware that the species once existed, its history in the region is poorly documented.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

=== Evolution ===
{{main|Hippopotamus#Evolution}}
[[File:Anthracotherium magnum.jpg|thumb|[[Anthracothere]]s like ''[[Anthracotherium]]'' resembled pygmy hippos and are among their likely ancestors]]
The evolution of the pygmy hippopotamus is most often studied in the context of its larger cousin. Both species were long believed to be most closely related to the family [[Suidae]] ([[pig]]s and hogs) or Tayassuidae ([[peccaries]]), but research within the last 10 years has determined that pygmy hippos and hippos are most closely related to [[cetacea]]ns ([[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s). Hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls around {{mya|60|mya}}.&lt;ref name="ScienceNews"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Scientists find missing link between the dolphin, whale and its closest relative, the hippo |date=2005-01-25 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |url=http://www.sciencenewsdaily.org/story-2806.html |work=Science News Daily |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304214747/http://www.sciencenewsdaily.org/story-2806.html |archivedate=2007-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = More DNA support for a Cetacea/Hippopotamidae clade: the blood-clotting protein gene gamma-fibrinogen | author = Gatesy, J | journal = [[Molecular Biology and Evolution]] | volume = 14 | pages = 537–543 | pmid = 9159931 | issue = 5 | date=1 May 1997 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This hypothesized ancestor likely split into two branches about six million years later.&lt;ref name="Genomes"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Analyses of mitochondrial genomes strongly support a hippopotamus-whale clade | volume = 265 | issue = 1412 | year = 1998 | pages = 2251–5 | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] | author = Ursing, B.M. |author2=U. Arnason  | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1998.0567 | pmid = 9881471 | pmc = 1689531}}&lt;/ref&gt; One branch would [[Evolution of cetaceans|evolve into cetaceans]], the other branch became the [[anthracotheriidae|anthracotheres]], a large family of four-legged beasts, whose earliest member, from the Late [[Eocene]], would have resembled narrow hippopotami with comparatively small and thin heads.&lt;ref name="Cetartiodactyla"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boisserie |first=Jean-Renaud |author2= Fabrice Lihoreau |author3=Michel Brunet |date=February 2005|title= The position of Hippopotamidae within Cetartiodactyla|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume= 102 |issue= 5|pages= 1537–1541|doi= 10.1073/pnas.0409518102|pmid= 15677331 |pmc=547867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippopotamids are deeply nested within the family [[Anthracotheriidae]]. The oldest known hippopotamid is the genus ''[[Kenyapotamus]]'', which lived in Africa from {{mya|16|8|mya}}. ''Kenyapotamus'' is known only through fragmentary fossils, but was similar in size to ''C. liberiensis''.&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Boisserie | first=Jean-Renaud | author2=Fabrice Lihoreau |author3=Michel Brunet |date=March 2005 |title=Origins of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia, Cetartiodactyla): towards resolution |journal=[[Zoologica Scripta]] |volume= 34|issue= 2|pages=119–143 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-6409.2005.00183.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hippopotamidae are believed to have evolved in Africa, and while at one point the species spread across Asia and Europe, no hippopotami have ever been discovered in the Americas. Starting {{mya|7.5|1.8|mya}} the ''[[Archaeopotamus]]'', likely ancestors to the genus ''Hippopotamus'' and ''[[Hexaprotodon]]'', lived in Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Linnean"/&gt;

While the fossil record of hippos is still poorly understood, the lineages of the two modern genera, ''Hippopotamus'' and ''Choeropsis'', may have diverged as far back as {{mya|8|mya}}. The ancestral form of the pygmy hippopotamus may be the genus ''Saotherium''. ''Saotherium'' and ''Choeropsis'' are significantly more [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] than ''Hippopotamus'' and ''Hexaprotodon'', and thus more closely resemble the ancestral species of hippos.&lt;ref name="Linnean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"/&gt;

=== Extinct pygmy and dwarf hippos ===
Several species of small hippopotamids have also become extinct in the Mediterranean in the late [[Pleistocene]] or early [[Holocene]]. Though these species are sometimes known as "pygmy hippopotami" they are not believed to be closely related to ''C. liberiensis''. These include the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|Cretan dwarf hippopotamus]] (''Hippopotamus creutzburgi''), the Sicilian hippopotamus (''[[Hippopotamus pentlandi]]''), the Maltese hippopotamus (''[[Hippopotamus melitensis]]'') and the [[Cyprus Dwarf Hippopotamus|Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus]] (''Hippopotamus minor'').&lt;ref name="Taxonomy of Pleistocene"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petronio |first=C. |year=1995 |title=Note on the taxonomy of Pleistocene hippopotamuses |journal=Ibex |volume=3 |pages=53–55 |url=http://www.mountainecology.org/IBEX3/pdf/Art_Capitolo1/note_taxonomy_pleistocene.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912012236/http://www.mountainecology.org/IBEX3/pdf/Art_Capitolo1/note_taxonomy_pleistocene.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These species, though comparable in size to the pygmy hippopotamus, are considered dwarf hippopotamuses, rather than pygmies. They are likely descended from a full-sized species of [[European Hippopotamus|European hippopotamus]], and reached their small size through the evolutionary process of [[insular dwarfism]] which is common on islands; the ancestors of pygmy hippopotami were also small and thus there was never a dwarfing process.&lt;ref name="Taxonomy of Pleistocene"/&gt; There were also several species of pygmy hippo on the island of Madagascar (see [[Malagasy Hippopotamus|Malagasy hippopotamus]]).

== Description ==
[[File:ZooPygmyHippo.jpg|thumb|Resting at [[Louisville Zoo]]. The skull of a pygmy hippo has less pronounced [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] and [[nostril]]s than a common hippopotamus.]]

Pygmy hippos share the same general form as a hippopotamus. They have a graviportal skeleton, with four stubby legs and four toes on each foot, supporting a portly frame. The pygmy hippo, however, is only half as tall as the hippopotamus and weighs less than 1/4 as much as its larger cousin. Adult pygmy hippos stand about {{convert|75|–|100|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, are {{convert|150|–|175|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in length and weigh {{convert|180|–|275|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Macdonald, D. 2001"&gt;{{Cite book |author = Macdonald, D. |year =2001 |title =The New Encyclopedia of Mammals |publisher =Oxford University Press, Oxford |isbn =0198508239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their lifespan in captivity ranges from 30 to 55 years, though it is unlikely that they live this long in the wild.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National Zoo on pygmy hippos"/&gt;

The skin is greenish-black or brown, shading to a creamy gray on the lower body. Their skin is very similar to the common hippo's, with a thin [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] over a [[dermis]] that is several centimeters thick. Pygmy hippos have the same unusual [[secretion]] as common hippos, that gives a pinkish tinge to their bodies, and is sometimes described as "blood sweat" though the secretion is neither [[sweat]] nor [[blood]]. This substance, [[hipposudoric acid]], is believed to have antiseptic and [[sunscreen]]ing properties. The skin of hippos dries out quickly and cracks, which is why both species spend so much time in water.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

The skeleton of ''C. liberiensis'' is more [[wikt:gracile|gracile]] than that of the common hippopotamus, meaning their bones are proportionally thinner. The common hippo's spine is parallel with the ground; the pygmy hippo's back slopes forward, a likely [[adaptation]] to pass more easily through dense forest vegetation. Proportionally, the pygmy hippo's legs and neck are longer and its head smaller.&lt;ref name="National Zoo on pygmy hippos"/&gt;

[[File:Zwergflusspferd - Pygmy Hippopotamus - Hexaprotodon liberiensis.jpg|thumb|Nuzzling couple at the [[Duisburg Zoo]] in Germany]]
The [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] and [[nostril]]s of a pygmy hippo are much less pronounced, an adaptation from spending less time in deep water (where pronounced orbits and nostrils help the common hippo breathe and see). The feet of pygmy hippos are narrower, but the toes are more spread out and have less webbing, to assist in walking on the forest floor.&lt;ref name="National Zoo on pygmy hippos"/&gt;

Despite adaptations to a more terrestrial life than the common hippopotamus, pygmy hippos are still more aquatic than all other [[even-toed ungulate]]s. The ears and nostrils of pygmy hippos have strong muscular valves to aid submerging underwater, and the skin physiology is dependent on the availability of water.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;

== Behavior ==
[[File:Pygmyhippopotamus-uenozoo2008.ogv|thumb|(video) Bathing in the [[Ueno Zoo]], [[Tokyo]]]]
[[File:Pygmy hippos, Singapore Zoo.JPG|thumb|Two dive in water at [[Singapore Zoo]]]]
The behavior of the pygmy hippo differs from the common hippo in many ways. Much of its behavior is more similar to that of a [[tapir]], though this is an effect of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; While the common hippopotamus is gregarious, pygmy hippos live either alone or in small groups, typically a mated pair or a mother and calf. Pygmy hippos tend to ignore each other rather than fight when they meet. Field studies have estimated that male pygmy hippos range over {{convert|1.85|km2|acre|abbr=on}}, while the range of a female is {{convert|0.4|to(-)|0.6|km2|acre|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

Pygmy hippos spend most of the day hidden in rivers. They will rest in the same spot for several days in a row, before moving to a new spot. At least some pygmy hippos make use of dens or [[burrow]]s that form in river banks. It is unknown if the pygmy hippos help create these dens, or how common it is to use them. Though a pygmy hippo has never been observed burrowing, other artiodactyls, such as [[warthog]]s, are burrowers.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

=== Diet ===
Like the common hippopotamus, the pygmy hippo emerges from the water at dusk to feed. It relies on game trails to travel through dense forest vegetation. It marks trails by vigorously waving its tail while defecating to further spread its feces. The pygmy hippo spends about six hours a day foraging for food.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

[[File:Pigmy Hippo 037.jpg|thumb|right|Eating a vegetable]]
Pygmy hippos are [[herbivore|herbivorous]]. They do not eat aquatic vegetation to a significant extent and rarely eat grass because it is uncommon in the thick forests they inhabit. The bulk of a pygmy hippo's diet consists of [[fern]]s, [[dicotyledons|broad-leaved plants]] and [[fruit]]s that have fallen to the forest floor. The wide variety of plants pygmy hippos have been observed eating suggests that they will eat any plants available. This diet is of higher quality than that of the common hippopotamus.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Pygmy Hippopotamus with the young.jpg|thumb|Baby stands near its parent at a zoo in [[Jihlava]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
A study of breeding behavior in the wild has never been conducted; the artificial conditions of captivity may cause the observed behavior of pygmy hippos in zoos to differ from natural conditions. Sexual maturity for the pygmy hippopotamus occurs between three and five years of age.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; The youngest reported age for giving birth is a pygmy hippo in the [[Zoo Basel]], [[Switzerland]] which bore a calf at three years and three months.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt; The [[oestrus cycle]] of a female pygmy hippo lasts an average of 35.5 days, with the oestrus itself lasting between 24–48&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="Redlist"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Distort/&gt;

Pygmy hippos consort for mating, but the duration of the relationship is unknown. In zoos they breed as monogamous pairs. Copulation can take place on land or in the water, and a pair will mate one to four times during an oestrus period. In captivity, pygmy hippos have been conceived and born in all months of the year.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; The gestation period ranges from 190–210 days, and usually a single young is born, though twins are known to occur.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

The common hippopotamus gives birth and mates only in the water, but pygmy hippos mate and give birth on both land and water. Young pygmy hippos can swim almost immediately. At birth, pygmy hippos weigh 4.5–6.2&amp;nbsp;kg (9.9–13.7&amp;nbsp;lb) with males weighing about 0.25&amp;nbsp;kg (0.55&amp;nbsp;lb) more than females. Pygmy hippos are fully [[wean]]ed between six and eight months of age; before weaning they do not accompany their mother when she leaves the water to forage, but instead hide in the water by themselves. The mother returns to the hiding spot about three times a day and calls out for the calf to suckle. Suckling occurs with the mother lying on her side.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[File:Pygmy hippopotamus pair.jpg|thumb|Pair at the Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy]]
The greatest threat to the remaining pygmy hippopotamus population in the wild is loss of habitat. The forests in which pygmy hippos live have been subject to logging, settling and conversion to agriculture, with little efforts made to make logging sustainable. As forests shrink, the populations become more fragmented, leading to less genetic diversity in the potential mating pool.&lt;ref name="Redlist"/&gt;

Pygmy hippos are among the species [[Environmental issues in Liberia|illegally hunted for food in Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Anne Look"/&gt; Their meat is said to be of excellent quality, like that of a wild boar; unlike those of the common hippo, the pygmy hippo's teeth have no value.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; The effects of West Africa's civil strife on the pygmy hippopotamus are unknown, but unlikely to be positive.&lt;ref name="Redlist"/&gt; The pygmy hippopotamus can be killed by [[leopard]]s, [[Pythonidae|pythons]] and [[crocodile]]s. How often this occurs is unknown.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;

''C. liberiensis'' was identified as one of the top-10 "focal species" in 2007 by the [[EDGE Species|Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered]] (EDGE) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Protection for 'weirdest' species | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6263331.stm | date = 2007-01-16 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | work = [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some populations inhabit protected areas, such as the [[Gola West|Gola Forest Reserve]] in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsierraleone.org/Attractions/Nature-and-Wildlife/Gola-Forest-Reserve.html|title=Gola Forest Reserve|author=Administrator|work=Visit Sierra Leone|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308113317/http://www.visitsierraleone.org/Attractions/Nature-and-Wildlife/Gola-Forest-Reserve.html|archivedate=2010-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and folklore ==
[[File:Pygmy hippopotamus hungry.jpg|thumb|left|Pair at the Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy]]
While the common hippopotamus was known to Europeans since [[classical antiquity]], the pygmy hippopotamus was unknown outside its range in West Africa until the 19th century. Due to their nocturnal, forested existence, they were poorly known within their range as well. In Liberia the animal was traditionally known as a ''water cow''.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;

Early field reports of the animal misidentified it as a [[wild hog]]. Several skulls of the species were sent to the American natural scientist [[Samuel G. Morton]], during his residency in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]]. Morton first described the species in 1843. The first complete specimens were collected as part of a comprehensive investigation of Liberian fauna in the 1870s and 1880s by Dr. [[Johann Büttikofer]]. The specimens were taken to the [[Natural History Museum, Leiden|Natural History Museum]] in [[Leiden]], The [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;

The first pygmy hippo was brought to Europe in 1873 after being captured in Sierra Leone by a member of the British Colonial Service but died shortly after arrival. Pygmy hippos were successfully introduced to Europe in 1911. They were first shipped to Germany and then to the [[Bronx Zoo]] in [[New York City]] where they also thrived.&lt;ref name="The Hippos"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;Robinson, Phillip T. [http://moray.ml.duke.edu/projects/hippos/Pygmy_Text.doc River Horses and Water Cows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326091218/http://moray.ml.duke.edu/projects/hippos/Pygmy_Text.doc |date=2009-03-26 }}.

In 1927, [[Harvey Firestone]] of [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone Tires]] presented [[Billy (pygmy hippo)|Billy the pygmy hippo]] to U.S. President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. Coolidge donated Billy to the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo in Washington, D.C.]] According to the zoo, Billy is a common ancestor to most pygmy hippos in U.S. zoos today.&lt;ref name="National Zoo on pygmy hippos" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tale&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = [[Quaternary International]] | volume = 117 | year = 2004 | pages = 119–123 | title = The hippo’s tale: how the anatomy and physiology of Late Neogene Hexaprotodon shed light on Late Neogene environmental change | author = Jablonski, Nina G. | doi = 10.1016/S1040-6182(03)00121-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several folktales have been collected about the pygmy hippopotamus. One tale says that pygmy hippos carry a shining diamond in their mouths to help travel through thick forests at night; by day the pygmy hippo has a secret hiding place for the diamond, but if a hunter catches a pygmy hippo at night the diamond can be taken. Villagers sometimes believed that baby pygmy hippos do not nurse but rather lick secretions off the skin of the mother.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;

:''For the Constable of Wallingford Castle, see [[Richard of Wallingford (constable)|Richard of Wallingford]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard of Wallingford, abbot and mathematician is not to be confused with the later [[Richard of Wallingford (constable)|Richard of Wallingford]], constable of [[Wallingford Castle]], and supporter of [[Wat Tyler]] in the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]].&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Richard of Wallingford''' (1292–1336) was an English mathematician, astronomer, horologist, and cleric who made major contributions to [[astronomy]] and [[horology]] while serving as [[abbot]] of [[St Albans Abbey]] in Hertfordshire.

==Biography==
Richard was born, the son of a [[blacksmith]], at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in Berkshire (now [[Oxfordshire]]) in England in 1292. When he was [[orphan]]ed he was taken to [[William de Kirkeby]] the [[Prior]] of [[Wallingford Priory|Holy Trinity Priory]]. Richard subsequently spent 6 years studying at [[Oxford University]] before becoming a monk at St Albans. He later studied for 9 more years at Oxford. In 1327 he became [[abbot of St Albans]].

Richard of Wallingford is best known for the [[astronomical clock]] he designed, while he was abbot, which is described in the ''Tractatus Horologii Astronomici'' (1327). The clock was completed about 20 years after Richard's death by William of Walsham but was apparently destroyed during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[English Reformation|reformation]] and the [[dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution]] of [[St Albans Abbey]] in 1539. His clock almost certainly was the most complex [[clock]] mechanism in existence at the time in the [[British isles]], and one of the most sophisticated ones anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woods|Thomas E. Woods Jr.]], ''How the Catholic Church Built the Western Civilization'', page 36 https://books.google.com.br/books?id=jYvmAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=how%20the%20catholic%20church%20built%20western%20civilization&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;The only other clocklike mechanism of comparable complexity that is documented in the 14th century is the [[astrarium]] by [[Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio|Giovanni de Dondi]]. It gave not just the hours and minutes of the day, but also the tide's ebb and flow as well as the motions of the sun and moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Durant | first = Will | title = The Reformation | series = [[The Story of Civilization]] | volume = 6 | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 1957 | page = 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the 14th-century literary evidence still surviving in the 20th century, several scholars of [[horological]] history have tried to build recreations of Richard of Wallingford's clock.  The best known of these was built by Haward Horological and for many years was displayed at the Time Museum (now defunct) in [[Rockford, Illinois]]; one was built by Eric Watson and is now in the [[Wallingford Museum]], and one built in 1988 is located at [[St Albans Cathedral]].

Richard also designed and constructed calculation devices: a [[torquetum]], the ''[[Rectangulus]]'', and an [[equatorium]], which he called ''Albion''. The Albion could be used for astronomical calculations such as [[moon|lunar]], [[sun|solar]] and [[planet]]ary [[longitude]]s and could predict [[eclipse]]s, and was capable of doing this without relying on a set of tables that had to be copied out.&lt;ref&gt;Hannam, James. God's philosophers: how the medieval world laid the foundations of modern science. Icon Books Ltd, 2009, 156&lt;/ref&gt; This is described in the ''Tractatus Albionis''. He published other works on [[trigonometry]], celestial coordinates, astrology, and various religious works.

Richard suffered from what was then thought to be [[leprosy]] (although it might have been [[scrofula]] or [[tuberculosis]]) which he apparently contracted when he went to have his position as abbot of St Albans Abbey confirmed by the Pope at [[Avignon]]. He died at [[St Albans]] in 1336.

'''Steven Weinberg''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|ForMemRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|aɪ|n|b|ɜr|ɡ}}; born May 3, 1933) is an American [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] [[physicist]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate in Physics]] for his contributions with [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon Glashow]] to the [[Electroweak interaction|unification]] of the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] interaction between elementary particles.

He holds the Josey Regental Chair in Science at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he is a member of the Physics and Astronomy Departments. His research on [[elementary particle]]s and [[physical cosmology]] has been honored with numerous prizes and awards, including in 1979 the Nobel Prize in Physics and in 1991 the [[National Medal of Science]]. In 2004 he received the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (American Philosophical Society)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] of the [[American Philosophical Society]], with a citation that said he is "considered by many to be the preeminent theoretical physicist alive in the world today." He has been elected to the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] and Britain's [[Royal Society]], as well as to the American Philosophical Society and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Weinberg's articles on various subjects occasionally appear in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' and other periodicals. He has served as consultant at the [[U. S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], President of the Philosophical Society of Texas, and member of the Board of Editors of ''Daedalus'' magazine, the Council of Scholars of the [[Library of Congress]], the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] group of defense consultants, and many other boards and committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5146.html|title=American Institute of Physics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Education and early life==
Steven Weinberg was born in 1933 in New York City. His parents were Jewish &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Scientists Win Nobel Prize|url=https://www.jta.org/1979/10/16/archive/three-scientists-two-jewish-and-one-moslem-win-nobel-prize|website=jta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infogeist.dk/html/egaagymnasium/infogeist-eg12i-fy/eg11iphysicsc/topic_1-8.html|title=Muster Mark’s Quarks|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725212618/http://www.infogeist.dk/html/egaagymnasium/infogeist-eg12i-fy/eg11iphysicsc/topic_1-8.html|archivedate=July 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=nobelbio&gt;{{Cite web |title= Steven Weinberg – Biographical |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/weinberg-bio.html |website= nobelprize.org |accessdate= 25 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the same graduating class as [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon Glashow]], whose own research, independent of Weinberg's, would result in their (and [[Abdus Salam]]) sharing the 1979 Nobel in Physics (see below).

Weinberg received his bachelor's degree from [[Cornell University]] in 1954. He then went to the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in Copenhagen where he started his graduate studies and research. After one year, Weinberg moved to [[Princeton University]] where he earned his PhD degree in [[physics]] in 1957, for research supervised by  [[Sam Treiman]].&lt;ref name=mathgene/&gt;

==Career and research==
After completing his PhD, Weinberg worked as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] at [[Columbia University]] (1957–1959) and [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1959) and then he was promoted to faculty at Berkeley (1960–1966). He did research in a variety of topics of particle physics, such as the high energy behavior of [[quantum field theory]], [[symmetry breaking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/32522|title=From BCS to the LHC - CERN Courier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pion]] scattering, infrared photons and [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;A partial list of this work is: {{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Phys.

Rev.|volume=133|pages=B1318–B1332|year=1964|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.133.B1318|title=Feynman Rules ''for Any'' spin|issue=5B|bibcode = 1964PhRv..133.1318W }}; {{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Phys.

Both textbooks are among the most influential texts in the scientific community in their subjects.

In 1966, Weinberg left Berkeley and accepted a lecturer position at Harvard. In 1967 he was a visiting professor at MIT. It was in that year at MIT that Weinberg proposed his model of unification of electromagnetism and of nuclear weak forces (such as those involved in [[beta-decay]] and [[kaon]]-decay),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=19|pages=1264–1266|url=http://astrophysics.fic.uni.lodz.pl/100yrs/pdf/12/066.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112142352/http://astrophysics.fic.uni.lodz.pl/100yrs/pdf/12/066.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-01-12|year=1967|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.19.1264|title=A Model of Leptons|issue=21|bibcode=1967PhRvL..19.1264W}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the masses of the force-carriers of the weak part of the interaction being explained by [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. One of its fundamental aspects was the prediction of the existence of the [[Higgs boson]].  Weinberg's model, now known as the [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak unification]] theory, had the same symmetry structure as that proposed by Glashow in 1961: hence both models included the then-unknown weak interaction mechanism between [[leptons]], known as [[neutral current]] and mediated by the [[Z boson]]. The 1973 experimental discovery of weak neutral currents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haidt, D.|journal=CERN Courier|title=The discovery of the weak neutral currents|year=2004}}[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29168]&lt;/ref&gt; (mediated by this Z boson) was one verification of the electroweak unification.
The paper by Weinberg in which he presented this theory is one of the most cited works ever in high energy physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[INSPIRE-HEP]]: [http://inspirehep.net/info/hep/stats/topcites/2015/alltime.html Top Cited Articles of All Time (2015 edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his 1967 seminal work on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, Steven Weinberg continued his work in many aspects of particle physics, quantum field theory, gravity, [[supersymmetry]], [[superstrings]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], as well as a theory called [[Technicolor (physics)|Technicolor]].

In the years after 1967, the full [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle theory was developed through the work of many contributors.  In it, the weak and electromagnetic interactions already unified by the work of Weinberg, [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], are made consistent with a theory of the strong interactions between quarks, in one overarching theory. In 1973 Weinberg proposed a modification of the Standard Model which did not contain that model's fundamental Higgs boson.

Weinberg became Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Harvard University in 1973.

In 1979 he pioneered the modern view on the [[renormalization]] aspect of quantum field theory that considers all quantum field theories as [[effective field theory|effective field theories]] and changed the viewpoint of previous work (including his own in his 1967 paper) that a sensible quantum field theory must be renormalizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Physica|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(79)90223-1|pages=327|year=1979|title=Phenomenological Lagrangians|volume=96|bibcode = 1979PhyA...96..327W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach allowed the development of effective theory of quantum gravity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donoghue, J. F. |journal=Phys. Rev. D|volume=50|pages=3874|year=1994|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.50.3874|title=General relativity as an effective field theory: The leading quantum corrections|issue=6|arxiv = gr-qc/9405057 |bibcode = 1994PhRvD..50.3874D }}&lt;/ref&gt; low energy QCD, heavy quark effective field theory and other developments, and it is a topic of considerable interest in current research.

In 1979, some six years after the experimental discovery of the neutral currents – i.e. the discovery of the inferred existence of the [[Z boson]] – but following the 1978 experimental discovery of the theory's predicted amount of parity violation due to Z bosons' mixing with electromagnetic interactions, Weinberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, together with [[Sheldon Glashow]], and [[Abdus Salam]] who had independently proposed a theory of electroweak unification based on spontaneous symmetry breaking.

In 1982 Weinberg moved to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as the Jack S. Josey-Welch Foundation Regents Chair in Science and founded the ''Theory Group'' of the Physics Department.

There is current (2008) interest in Weinberg's 1976 proposal of the existence of new strong interactions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Phys. Rev. D|volume=13|pages=974–996|year=1976|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.13.974|title=Implications of dynamical symmetry breaking|issue=4|bibcode = 1976PhRvD..13..974W }}&lt;/ref&gt; – a proposal dubbed "[[Technicolor (physics)|Technicolor]]" by [[Leonard Susskind]] – because of its chance of being observed in the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] as an explanation of the [[hierarchy problem]].&lt;ref name=lnc&gt;{{YouTube|Zl4W3DYTIKw|Steven Weinberg on LHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Weinberg is frequently among the top scientists with highest research effect indices, such as the [[h-index]] and the creativity index.&lt;ref&gt;In 2006 Weinberg had the second highest creativity index among physicists [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2006/aug/17/worlds-most-creative-physicist-revealed World's most creative physicist revealed]. physicsworld.com (June 17, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Physics Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg, December, 2014.jpg|thumb|Steven Weinberg in December, 2014]]

===Other contributions===
Besides his scientific research, Steven Weinberg has been a prominent public spokesman for science, testifying before Congress in support of the [[Superconducting Super Collider]], writing articles for the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/authors/201 Articles by Steven Weinberg]. New York Review of Books. Nybooks.com. Retrieved on 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and giving various lectures on the larger meaning of science. His books on science written for the public combine the typical scientific popularization with what is traditionally considered [[history of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] of science and [[atheism]].

Weinberg was a major participant in what is known as the [[Science Wars]], standing with [[Paul R. Gross]], [[Norman Levitt]], [[Alan Sokal]], [[Lewis Wolpert]], and [[Richard Dawkins]], on the side arguing for the hard [[Scientific realism|realism]] of science and scientific knowledge and against the [[Social constructionism|constructionism]] proposed by such social scientists as [[Stanley Aronowitz]], [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[David Bloor]], David Edge, [[Harry Collins]], [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], and [[Bruno Latour]].

Although still teaching physics, he has, in recent years, turned his hand to the history of science, efforts that culminated in ''To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science'' (2015).&lt;ref name = "Wein NYRB Eye"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/17/eye-present-whig-history-science/|title = Eye on the Present—The Whig History of Science|last = Weinberg|first = Steven |journal = The New York Review of Books|access-date = 9 February 2016|volume = 62 |number= 20 |pages = 82, 84 |year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hostile review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Shapin |first= Stephen |date= 13 February 2015 |title= Why Scientists Shouldn't Write History |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-to-explain-the-world-by-steven-weinberg-1423863226 |website= wsj.com |accessdate= 11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Wall Street Journal by [[Steven Shapin]] attracted a number of commentaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Bouterse |first= Jeroen |date= 31 May 2015 |title= Weinberg, Whiggism, and the World in History of Science |url= http://www.shellsandpebbles.com/2015/05/31/weinberg-whiggism-and-the-world-in-history-of-science/ |website= Shells and Pebbles |accessdate= 11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a response by Weinberg,&lt;ref name = "Wein NYRB Eye"/&gt; and an exchange of views between Weinberg and [[Arthur Silverstein]] in the ''NYRB'' in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Silverstein |first1= Arthur |last2= Weinberg |first2= Steven |year= 2016 |title= The Whig History of Science: An Exchange |url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/02/25/the-whig-history-of-science-an-exchange/ |journal= The New York Review of Books |volume= 63 |number= 3 |accessdate= 11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he became a default figurehead for faculty and students opposed to a new law that allowed the carrying of concealed guns in UT classrooms. Weinberg announced that he would be prohibiting guns from his classes, and said he would stand by his decision to violate university regulations in this matter even if faced with a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nobel Laureate Becomes Reluctant Anti-Gun Leader, by Madlin Mekelburg|url = https://www.texastribune.org/2016/01/26/nobel-something/|website = The Texas Tribune|access-date = 9 February 2016|first = Madlin|last = Mekelburg|date = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Weinberg married [[Louise Weinberg]] in 1954 and has one daughter, Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=nobelbio/&gt;

===Politics===
Weinberg is also known for his support of [[Israel]]. He wrote an essay titled "Zionism and Its Cultural Adversaries" to explain his views on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theinfidels.org/zunb-stevenweinberg.htm | title=Steven Weinberg | publisher=The Infidels | accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg has canceled trips to universities in the United Kingdom because of British [[boycotts directed towards Israel]]. He has explained:

:Given the history of the attacks on Israel and the oppressiveness and aggressiveness of other countries in the Middle East and elsewhere, boycotting Israel indicated a [[moral blindness]] for which it is hard to find any explanation other than [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3404128,00.html | title=Nobel laureate cancels London trip due to anti-Semitism | accessdate=2007-06-01 |date=May 24, 2007 | work=[[YNet News]] Jewish Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on religion===
Weinberg is an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg stated his views on religion in 1999:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Frederick Douglass]] told in his Narrative how his condition as a slave became worse when his master underwent a religious conversion that allowed him to justify slavery as the punishment of the children of Ham. [[Mark Twain]] described his mother as a genuinely good person, whose soft heart pitied even Satan, but who had no doubt about the legitimacy of slavery, because in years of living in [[antebellum South|antebellum]] Missouri she had never heard any sermon opposing slavery, but only countless sermons preaching that slavery was God's will. With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion.&lt;ref name="Steven Weinberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/essay_weinberg.cfm

[[File:Tachyon04s.gif|thumb|250px|Because a tachyon would always travel faster-than-light, it would not be possible to see it approaching. After a tachyon has passed nearby, an observer would be able to see two images of it, appearing and departing in opposite directions. The black line is the shock wave of [[Cherenkov radiation]], shown only in one moment of time. This double image effect is most prominent for an observer located directly in the path of a superluminal object (in this example a sphere, shown in grey). The right hand bluish shape is the image formed by the blue-doppler shifted light arriving at the observer — who is located at the apex of the black Cherenkov lines — from the sphere as it approaches. The left-hand reddish image is formed from red-shifted light that leaves the sphere after it passes the observer. Because the object arrives before the light, the observer sees nothing until the sphere starts to pass the observer, after which the image-as-seen-by-the-observer splits into two—one of the arriving sphere (to the right) and one of the departing sphere (to the left).]]

A '''tachyon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|k|i|ɒ|n}}) or '''tachyonic particle''' is a hypothetical [[particle]] that always travels [[faster-than-light|faster than light]]. Most physicists believe that faster-than-light particles cannot exist because they are not consistent with the known laws of physics.&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tipler/&gt; If such particles did exist, they could be used to build a [[tachyonic antitelephone]] and send signals faster than light, which (according to [[special relativity]]) would lead to violations of [[causality (physics)|causality]].&lt;ref name=Tipler/&gt; No experimental evidence for the existence of such particles has been found.

The possibility of particles moving faster-than-light was first proposed by O. M. P. Bilaniuk, V. K. Deshpande, and [[George Sudarshan|E. C. G. Sudarshan]] in 1962, although the term they used for it was "meta-particle".&lt;ref name=sudarshan62/&gt; In the 1967 paper that coined the term,&lt;ref name="Feinberg67"/&gt; [[Gerald Feinberg]] proposed that tachyonic particles could be quanta of a [[Quantum field theory|quantum field]] with imaginary mass. However, it was soon realized that excitations of such [[Tachyonic field|imaginary mass fields]] do ''not'' under any circumstances propagate faster than light,&lt;ref name="susskind"/&gt; and instead the imaginary mass gives rise to an instability known as [[tachyon condensation]].&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt; Nevertheless, in modern physics the term "tachyon" often&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sen/&gt; refers to imaginary mass fields rather than to faster-than-light particles. Such fields have come to play a [[Tachyonic field#Importance in physics|significant role in modern physics]].

The term comes from the {{lang-el|[[Wiktionary:ταχύ|ταχύ]]}}, ''tachy'', meaning "rapid". The complementary particle types are called [[massless particle|luxons]] (which always move at the [[speed of light]]) and [[bradyons]] (which always move slower than light); both of these particle types are known to exist.

== Tachyons in relativity theory ==
In [[special relativity]], a faster-than-light particle would have [[space-like]] [[four-momentum]],&lt;ref name=Feinberg67 /&gt; in contrast to ordinary particles that have [[time-like]] [[four-momentum]]. Although in some theories the mass of tachyons is regarded as [[imaginary number|imaginary]], in some modern formulations the mass is considered real,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Recami|first=E.|date=2007-10-16|title=Classical tachyons and possible applications|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02724327|journal=Rivista del Nuovo Cimento|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1–178|doi=10.1007/BF02724327|issn=1826-9850|bibcode=1986NCimR...9e...1R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vieira|first=R.

Moreover, since tachyons are constrained to the [[spacelike]] portion of the energy–momentum graph, they could not slow down to subluminal speeds.&lt;ref name="Feinberg67"/&gt;

=== Mass ===
{{main|Mass#Tachyonic particles and imaginary (complex) mass|Tachyonic field}}
In a [[Lorentz invariant]] theory, the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles (sometimes called "[[bradyon]]s" in discussions of tachyons) must also apply to tachyons. In particular the [[energy–momentum relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = (pc)^2+ (mc^2)^2 \;&lt;/math&gt;
(where '''p''' is the relativistic [[momentum]] of the bradyon and '''m''' is its [[rest mass]]) should still apply, along with the formula for the total energy of a particle:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
This equation shows that the total energy of a particle (bradyon or tachyon) contains a contribution from its rest mass (the "rest mass–energy") and a contribution from its motion, the kinetic energy.
When ''v'' is larger than ''c'', the denominator in the equation for the energy is [[imaginary number|"imaginary"]], as the value under the [[square root|radical]] is negative. Because the total [[energy]] must be [[real number|real]],{{Dubious |Mass |reason=If we can allow the mass to be imaginary, why does the energy have to be real?? |date=August 2015}} the numerator must ''also'' be imaginary: i.e. the [[rest mass]] '''m''' must be imaginary, as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number.

In some modern formulations of the theory, the mass of tachyons is regarded as real.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Speed ===
One curious effect is that, unlike ordinary particles, the speed of a tachyon ''increases'' as its energy decreases. In particular, &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; approaches zero when &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity. (For ordinary [[Bradyon|bradyonic matter]], ''E'' increases with increasing speed, becoming arbitrarily large as ''v'' approaches ''c'', the [[speed of light]]). Therefore, just as bradyons are forbidden to break the light-speed barrier, so too are tachyons forbidden from slowing down to below ''c'', because infinite energy is required to reach the barrier from either above or below

As noted by [[Einstein]], [[Richard Chace Tolman|Tolman]], and others, [[special relativity]] implies that faster-than-light particles, if they existed, [[Tachyonic antitelephone|could be used to communicate backwards in time]].&lt;ref name=Benford/&gt;

=== Neutrinos ===
In 1985, Chodos proposed that [[neutrino]]s can have a tachyonic nature.&lt;ref name=Chodos/&gt; The possibility of standard model particles moving at superluminal speeds can be modeled using [[Lorentz invariance]] violating terms, for example in the [[Standard-Model Extension]].&lt;ref name=Colladay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

=== Cherenkov radiation ===
A tachyon with an electric charge would lose energy as [[Čerenkov radiation|Cherenkov radiation]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;—just as ordinary charged particles do when they exceed the local speed of light in a medium (other than a hard vacuum). A charged tachyon traveling in a vacuum, therefore, undergoes a constant [[proper time]] acceleration and, by necessity, its [[worldline]] forms a [[hyperbola]] in space-time. However reducing a tachyon's energy ''increases'' its speed, so that the single hyperbola formed is of ''two'' oppositely charged tachyons with opposite momenta (same magnitude, opposite sign) which annihilate each other when they simultaneously reach infinite speed at the same place in space. (At infinite speed, the two tachyons have no energy each and finite momentum of opposite direction, so no conservation laws are violated in their mutual annihilation. The time of annihilation is frame dependent.)

Even an electrically neutral tachyon would be expected to lose energy via gravitational [[Cherenkov radiation]], because it has a gravitational mass, and therefore increase in speed as it travels, as described above. If the tachyon interacts with any other particles, it can also radiate Cherenkov energy into those particles. Neutrinos interact with the other particles of the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]], and Andrew Cohen and [[Sheldon Glashow]] recently used this to argue that the [[faster-than-light neutrino anomaly]] cannot be explained by making neutrinos propagate faster than light, and must instead be due to an error in the experiment.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen, Andrew G. |author2=Glashow, Sheldon L. |last-author-amp=yes|title= Pair Creation Constrains Superluminal Neutrino Propagation | journal= Phys.

=== Causality ===
[[causality (physics)|Causality]] is a fundamental principle of physics. If tachyons can transmit information faster than light, then according to relativity they violate causality, leading to logical paradoxes of the [[Grandfather paradox|"kill your own grandfather"]] type. This is often illustrated with thought experiments such as the [[Tachyonic antitelephone|"tachyon telephone paradox"]]&lt;ref name=Benford/&gt; or "logically pernicious self-inhibitor."&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald/&gt;

The problem can be understood in terms of the [[relativity of simultaneity]] in special relativity, which says that different [[inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frames]] will disagree on whether two events at different locations happened "at the same time" or not, and they can also disagree on the order of the two events (technically, these disagreements occur when the [[Spacetime#Spacetime intervals|spacetime interval]] between the events is 'space-like', meaning that neither event lies in the future [[light cone]] of the other).&lt;ref name="Jarrell"&gt;
{{cite web
 |last1=Mark |first1=J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one of the two events represents the sending of a signal from one location and the second event represents the reception of the same signal at another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity ensures that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event.&lt;ref name="Jarrell"/&gt; However, in the case of a hypothetical signal moving faster than light, there would always be some frames in which the signal was received before it was sent so that the signal could be said to have moved backward in time. Because one of the two fundamental [[postulates of special relativity]] says that the laws of physics should work the same way in every inertial frame, if it is possible for signals to move backward in time in any one frame, it must be possible in all frames. This means that if observer A sends a signal to observer B which moves faster than light in A's frame but backwards in time in B's frame, and then B sends a reply which moves faster than light in B's frame but backwards in time in A's frame, it could work out that A receives the reply before sending the original signal, challenging causality in ''every'' frame and opening the door to severe logical paradoxes.&lt;ref name=Gron/&gt; Mathematical details can be found in the [[tachyonic antitelephone]] article, and an illustration of such a scenario using [[Minkowski diagram|spacetime diagrams]] can be found in ''Baker, R. (2003)''&lt;ref&gt;.

==== Reinterpretation principle ====
The '''reinterpretation principle'''&lt;ref name="Feinberg67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sudarshan62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gron/&gt; asserts that a tachyon sent ''back'' in time can always be ''reinterpreted'' as a tachyon traveling ''forward'' in time, because observers cannot distinguish between the emission and absorption of tachyons. The attempt to ''detect'' a tachyon ''from'' the future (and violate causality) would actually ''create'' the same tachyon and send it ''forward'' in time (which is causal).

However, this principle is not widely accepted as resolving the paradoxes.&lt;ref name=Benford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gron/&gt;&lt;ref name=Recami/&gt; Instead, what would be required to avoid paradoxes is that unlike any known particle, tachyons do not interact in any way and can never be detected or observed, because otherwise a tachyon beam could be modulated and used to create an anti-telephone&lt;ref name=Benford/&gt; or a "logically pernicious self-inhibitor".&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald/&gt; All forms of energy are believed to interact at least gravitationally, and many authors state that superluminal propagation in Lorentz invariant theories always leads to causal paradoxes.&lt;ref name=Barcelo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arkani/&gt;

== Fundamental models ==
In modern physics, all fundamental particles are regarded as excitations of [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]]. There are several distinct ways in which tachyonic particles could be embedded into a field theory.

=== Fields with imaginary mass ===
{{main|Tachyonic field}}
In the paper that coined the term "tachyon", Gerald Feinberg studied Lorentz invariant quantum fields with imaginary mass.&lt;ref name="Feinberg67" /&gt; Because the [[group velocity]] for such a field is superluminal, naively it appears that its excitations propagate faster than light. However, it was quickly understood that the superluminal group velocity does not correspond to the speed of propagation of any localized excitation (like a particle). Instead, the [[negative mass]] represents an instability to [[tachyon condensation]], and all excitations of the field propagate subluminally and are consistent with [[Causality (physics)|causality]].&lt;ref name="susskind"/&gt; Despite having no faster-than-light propagation, such fields are referred to simply as "tachyons" in many sources.&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kutasov/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOVA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibbons/&gt;

[[Tachyonic field]]s play an important role in modern physics. Perhaps the most famous is the [[Higgs boson]] of the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model of particle physics]], which has an imaginary mass in its uncondensed phase. In general, the phenomenon of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], which is closely related to tachyon condensation, plays an important role in many aspects of theoretical physics, including the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory|Ginzburg–Landau]] and [[BCS theory|BCS]] theories of superconductivity. Another example of a tachyonic field is the tachyon of [[bosonic string theory]].&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOVA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Polchinski, ''String Theory'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tachyons are predicted by bosonic string theory and also the [[Super Virasoro algebra|Neveu-Schwarz]] (NS) and NS-NS sectors, which are respectively the open bosonic sector and closed bosonic sector, of [[superstring theory|RNS Superstring theory]] prior to the [[GSO projection]]. However such tachyons are not possible due to the Sen conjecture, also known as tachyon condensation. This resulted in the necessity for the GSO projection.

=== Lorentz-violating theories ===
In theories that do not respect [[Lorentz invariance]], the speed of light is not (necessarily) a barrier, and particles can travel faster than the speed of light without infinite energy or causal paradoxes.&lt;ref name=Barcelo/&gt; A class of field theories of that type is the so-called [[Standard-Model Extension|Standard Model extensions]]. However, the experimental evidence for Lorentz invariance is extremely good, so such theories are very tightly constrained.&lt;ref name=Glashow2&gt;{{cite journal|
      author         = Glashow, Sheldon Lee|
      title          = Atmospheric neutrino constraints on Lorentz violation|
      date           = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

=== Fields with non-canonical kinetic term ===
By modifying the kinetic energy of the field, it is possible to produce Lorentz invariant field theories with excitations that propagate superluminally.&lt;ref name="susskind" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Arkani/&gt; However, such theories, in general, do not have a well-defined [[Cauchy problem]] (for reasons related to the issues of causality discussed above), and are probably inconsistent quantum mechanically.

== History ==
The term "tachyon" was coined by [[Gerald Feinberg]] in a 1967 paper titled "Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles".&lt;ref name="Feinberg67"/&gt; He had been inspired by the science-fiction story "Beep" by [[James Blish]].&lt;ref&gt;"He told me years later that he had begun thinking about tachyons because he was inspired by James Blish's [1954] short story, "Beep". In it, a faster-than-light communicator plays a crucial role in a future society but has an annoying final ''beep'' at the end of every message. The communicator necessarily allows sending of signals backward in time, even when that's not your intention. Eventually, the characters discover that all future messages are compressed into that ''beep'', so the future is known, more or less by accident. Feinberg had set out to see if such a gadget was theoretically possible." pg276 of [[Gregory Benford]]'s [http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#old-legends "Old Legends"]&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg studied the kinematics of such particles according to [[special relativity]]. In his paper he also introduced [[Tachyonic field|fields with imaginary mass]] (now also referred to as "tachyons") in an attempt to understand the microphysical origin such particles might have.

The first hypothesis regarding faster-than-light particles is sometimes attributed to German physicist [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] in 1904,&lt;ref name=Sommerfeld/&gt; and more recent discussions happened in 1962&lt;ref name="sudarshan62"/&gt; and 1969.&lt;ref name="sudarshan69"/&gt;

In September 2011, it was reported that a [[tau neutrino]] had traveled faster than the speed of light in a major release by CERN; however, later updates from CERN on the OPERA project indicate that the faster-than-light readings were resultant from "a faulty element of the experiment's fibre optic timing system".&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Tachyons in fiction}}
Tachyons have appeared in many works of fiction. They have been used as a standby mechanism upon which many science fiction authors rely to establish [[faster-than-light]] communication, with or without reference to causality issues. The word ''tachyon'' has become widely recognized to such an extent that it can impart a science-fictional connotation even if the subject in question has no particular relation to superluminal travel (a form of [[technobabble]], akin to ''[[positronic brain]]'').

'''VA (Public &amp; Science)''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "'''[[:sv:Vetenskap_&amp;_Allmänhet|Vetenskap &amp; Allmänhet]]"''') is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] non-profit [[civil society]] organisation that works to promote dialogue and openness between researchers and the public.

The organisation was founded in 2002 and is based in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

VA's members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://v-a.se/member-organisations/|title=Member organisations - Vetenskap &amp; Allmänhet|work=Vetenskap &amp; Allmänhet|access-date=2018-03-08|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; consist of some 80 organisations, authorities, universities, companies and associations. In addition, it has a number of individual members. The organisation is funded through membership fees, project grants and a grant from the Swedish Ministry of Education and Research.

'''VA's main aims:'''
# Increase collaboration between researchers and the public.
# Increase knowledge and dialogue about:
#* Public perceptions of research and research needs
#* Prerequisites for research, research methods and results
#* Methods for science communication
# Be a leading knowledge hub for public engagement and science communication
# Strengthen all aspects of engagement with society; democratic, cultural as well as for the benefit and education of society

VA carries out surveys&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://v-a.se/english-portal/projects/studies/the-public/|title=The public - Vetenskap &amp; Allmänhet|work=Vetenskap &amp; Allmänhet|access-date=2018-03-08|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies with the aim of increasing knowledge about the relationships between science and society at large. This includes an annual barometer into the Swedish public's general attitudes towards science and researchers, as well as more specific studies on how opinion-forming groups in society view and use research, how researchers interact with [[society]], and [[Methodology|methods]] for dialogue on [[science]] and [[research]].

VA also arranges many events and activities aimed at stimulating dialogue between researchers and the public in new ways and in novel arenas. VA is the Swedish national co-ordinator for the [[science festival]] [http://ec.europa.eu/research/researchersnight/index_en.htm  European Researchers’ Night]. The first Researchers' Night was run in [[Sweden]] in September 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/research/researchersineurope/news/article_3191_en.htm | title = Stockholm ‘erupts’ with activity for European Researchers’ Night | accessdate = 2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 events were run in 29 cities in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://forskarfredag.se/europeanresearchersnight2017/|title=A night of wonder, curiosity and fun: European Researchers’ Night 2017|last=|first=|date=|work=|accessdate=2018-03-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
VA also organises the  [http://www.forskargrandprix.se/ Researchers' Grand Prix] , a science communication competition for researchers and  [http://v-a.se/in-english/projects/activity-projects/researchers%E2%80%99-night/mass-experiments/  mass experiments in schools], a [[citizen science]] initiative that engages pupils in real research. Other activities include [[Science Cafe|Science Cafés]]. VA also participates in societal debate via traditional as well as social media.

VA is currently a partner in three EU-funded [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Horizon 2020]] projects SciShops: ''[http://www.orion-openscience.eu/ ORION], Open Responsible research and Innovation to further Outstanding Knowledge'', is aimed at fostering [[Responsible Research and Innovation|RRI]] and [[open science]] in research performing and research funding organisations. ''[http://www.scishops.eu SciShops]'' will expand the ecosystem of [[Science shop|Science Shops]] in Europe and ''BLOOM'' is aimed at raising public awareness and interest in the [[Biobased economy|bioeconomy]] through dialogue and co-creation activities.

VA is a member of EUSEA  [http://www.eusea.info/ (European Science Events Association)], ECSA ([https://ecsa.citizen-science.net/ European Citizen Science Association]) and the [http://www.livingknowledge.org/ Living Knowledge] network.
