'''Animal transporters''' are used to [[Livestock transportation|transport livestock]] or [[Transportation of animals|non-livestock animals]] over long distances. They could be specially-modified vehicles, [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]], ships or aircraft containers. While some animal transporters like horse trailers only carry a few animals, modern ships engaged in [[live export]] can carry tens of thousands.

The [[Animal Transportation Association]] campaigns for humane transporting of animals as do many other animal welfare organisations.

'''Atomistix A/S''' was a software company developing tools for [[Molecular modelling|atomic scale modelling]]. It was headquartered in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, with a subsidiary for Asia Pacific in [[Singapore]] and for the Americas in [[California]]. In September 2008 '''Atomistix A/S''' went bankrupt, but in December 2008 the newly founded company '''QuantumWise''' announced&lt;ref&gt;http://quantumwise.com/component/content/article/6-announcement-from-the-ceo&lt;/ref&gt; that they had acquired all assets from the Atomistix estate and would continue the development and marketing of the products [[Atomistix ToolKit]] and [[Atomistix Virtual NanoLab]].

== History ==

The company was founded in October 2003 by Dr. Kurt Stokbro, Dr. Jeremy Taylor and Dr. Thomas Magnussen. Dr. Stokbro and Dr. Taylor are co-authors on the article [1] introducing the electron transport method and program TranSIESTA (based on the [[SIESTA (computer program)|SIESTA]] program [2]) for academic research. This method, and methods used in Dr. Taylor Ph.D. research, was the starting point for Atomistix first product, TranSIESTA-C. The C refers to the program being written in the [[C programming language]] as opposed to [[Fortran]] in which TranSIESTA was written. This code had been completely reengineered and further developed into the commercial products marketed by the company today.
    
Since the very beginning the company had been working in close collaboration with the Nano-Science Center at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] of Copenhagen University, to enhance the product development, and had instituted cooperations with leading nanotechnology centers, experts and private companies around the world.

== Business ==

The management team consisted of:
*Børge Witthøft, President and [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO).
*Dr. Jeremy Taylor, Co-founder and [[Chief Technical Officer]] (CTO).
*Klaus Melchior, [[Chief Operating Officer]] (COO) and [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO).
*Niels Nielsen, [[Vice President]] (VP) Sales and Marketing.
 
== Products ==

Atomistix A/S provided the following products:

*[[Atomistix ToolKit]] (ATK)
*[[Atomistix Virtual NanoLab]] (VNL)

Legacy Products:
*IView
*TranSIESTA-C

These products represented a package of integrated software modules for quantum chemistry modelling, providing a user-friendly [[Graphical user interface|graphical interface interaction]] to complex computational methods.

From the usability point of view, the setup of the computation is done through [[Atomistix Virtual NanoLab]], a [[Interface metaphor|metaphoric interface]], mimicking ''[[in silico]]'' the approach of an experiment in a real laboratory. The underlying computational engine is the [[Atomistix ToolKit]] (ATK) which is the next generation of TranSIESTA-C. ATK also has a [[Python language|Python]] based interface [[NanoLanguage]] and a text file interface.

The methods used in the software products are based primarily on [[density functional theory]] (DFT) and [[non-equilibrium Green's function]] (NEGF) techniques and also all the underlying [[quantum mechanics]].

The '''autographic''' system for [[roll film]] was launched by [[Kodak]] in 1914, and allowed the photographer to add written information on the film at the time of exposure. 

The system was patented by [[Henry Jacques Gaisman]], inventor and safety razor manufacturer. [[George Eastman]] purchased the rights for US$300,000. It consisted of a tissue-like carbon paper sandwiched between the film and the paper backing. Text was entered using a metal stylus, and would appear in the margin of the processed print. The system was never very popular, and was discontinued in 1932.

Kodak's autographic films had "A" as the first part of the film size designation. Thus, standard 122 film would be labeled "122" and autographic 122 would be "A122".  Autographic roll film sizes were A116, A118, A120, A122, A123, A126, A127, and A130.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Bacon and Hams''''' is a 1917 book by George J. Nicholls, a member of the [[Institute of Certificated Grocers]].{{efn|name=IGD|now the [http://www.igd.com/Who-we-are/History-of-IGD/ Institute of Grocery Distribution]}} The book details the then-modern [[bacon]] and [[ham]] industry beginning with the use of the pig breeds, meat processing and the distribution and pricing of cuts with a focus on the United Kingdom. The meat processing aspects focus on the popular Wiltshire cut of the time, but also includes American cuts as well. The book was described, with approbation, by the [[Saskatchewan]] Overseas Livestock Marketing Commission, as an "admirable and important treatise".&lt;ref name="sask" /&gt; Despite having entered the public domain, the book is rare and collectible and generated interest for its "unparalleled" anatomical details of pigs found in its fold-out pages.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

A modern review called it a "paean to the pig".&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

== Author ==
[[File:BaconAndHams_1917_FancyDress.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|"The Author in Fancy Dress as a Side of Bacon, designed by himself, which took the First Prize of Forty Guineas at the [[Covent Garden]] Fancy Dress Ball, April 1894."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;]]
According to the title page of the book, George J. Nicholls was the director of George Bowles, Nicholls &amp; Company. He was also a Trustee, Member of Council, Chairman of Finance Committee, and honorary Examiner to the Institute of Certificated Grocers.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; He was also a member of the Home and Foreign Produce Exchange and Chairman of Committee of the Wholesale Produce Merchants' Association in London.&lt;ref name="Nicholls"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bacon and Hams |publisher=Richard Clay &amp; Sons |last=Nicholls |first=George J. |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholls followed in the footsteps of his father in the provision trade and hoped that two of his three sons would continue the family tradition.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt;
The book features a [[Photographic studio|studio photograph]] of its author in [[fancy dress]] as a side of bacon.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term bacon in this book does not refer to the sliced and pre-packaged bacon that is ubiquitous in American markets, but instead the cured whole side of the pig.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Furthermore, the differences between bacon in the United States and in the United Kingdom are quite pronounced, and the book refers only to cuts common in the United Kingdom. The cut that is used to produce "American bacon" is a cut referred to as "streaky bacon" in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Paupered"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thepauperedchef.com/2010/04/a-guide-to-bacon-styles-and-how-to-make-proper-british-rashers.html |title=A Guide to Bacon Styles, and How to Make Proper British Rashers |publisher=The Paupered Chef |date=April 21, 2010 | accessdate=10 November 2014 |last=Royer |first=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bacon consumed in the United Kingdom is known as [[back bacon]] and consists of both [[pork belly]] and [[pork loin]] in a single cut.&lt;ref name="EBS"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.englishbreakfastsociety.com/back-bacon.html |title=Traditional British Back Bacon |publisher=English Breakfast Society |date=4 January 2014 |accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dbmc"&gt;{{Cite journal |publisher=[[Danish Bacon|Danish Bacon Company]] |url= http://www.dbmc.co.uk/downloads/DBMC_Info-stats_2005.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060130095012/http://www.dbmc.co.uk/downloads/DBMC_Info-stats_2005.pdf |format=PDF |title=Information and Statistics 2005 |date=30 March 2005 |accessdate=11 November 2014 |archivedate=January 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wiltshire cut was a way to divide up the meat, and was marketed to consumers in still further cuts.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt;

== Content ==
This book's target audience is not the common consumer of pig meat, but the grocer who would sell the products to the masses. The goal of the book was to aid in the proper handling, selling and profiting from the business of selling [[pork]]. Furthermore, Nicholls noted that this book would come to fill a need for the students who would be taking the Institute of Certificated Grocer exams.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt;

The book is divided into nine chapters with seven appendices.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components of pork in comparison to [[beef]].&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom at the time were the [[Large White pig|Large White Yorkshire]], the [[Middle White]], the [[Tamworth pig|Tamworth]], the [[Berkshire pig|Berkshire]], the [[Lincolnshire curly-coated pig|Lincolnshire Curly-Coated]] and the [[Large Black pig|Large Black]].&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to [[Robert Bakewell (agriculturalist)|Robert Bakewell]] and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid fattening and providing a long side.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; Though also credited for the breeding of the [[Small White pig]], Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed.&lt;ref name="Bakewell 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.le.ac.uk/el/newdishley/animals.html |title=Bakewell's Animals |publisher=Centre for English Local History at the University of Leicester |accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakewell 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ans.iastate.edu/history/faculty/bakewell/bakewell.html |title=Robert Bakewell |publisher=Iowa State University |accessdate=10 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123061120/http://www.ans.iastate.edu/history/faculty/bakewell/bakewell.html |archivedate=November 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt;

The third chapter details the industry outside the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; The fourth chapter discusses the current practices of the bacon factory, including the stages in which the pigs are received, killed, branded and processed.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; The usage of the entire carcass is covered, from the blood to the fat and hair of the pig. Chapter five details the distribution and wholesale centers of the industry and the terms and regulations used.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; Chapter six details the selection and grading of the cuts, beginning with the most popular Wiltshire cut.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; Chapter seven and eight details the retail distribution of the bacon, and dividing the Wiltshire cut into different cuts and pricing.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; Chapter nine concludes with the retail distribution of the American and Canadian cuts.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; The book includes fold-out anatomical charts that were popular during the time.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Arnold |first=Dave |title=Bacon and Hams (1917): Our First Book Review |work=Cooking Issues |publisher=French Culinary Institute |date=1 December 2009 |url= http://www.cookingissues.com/2009/12/01/pigplatei/ |accessdate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Blankets, sheets, table cloths, curtains, towels, tapestries, and rugs are all large pieces of soft cloth; the initial definition was therefore too broad.  Narrowed it by incorporating the information in the other sentences about a blanket's function.</comment>

[[File:Lautrec in bed 1893.jpg|thumb|right|''The Bed'' by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] depicts two people under a blanket]] 
A '''blanket''' is a piece of soft [[textile|cloth]] large enough either to cover or to enfold a great portion of the user's body, usually when [[sleep]]ing or otherwise at rest, thereby trapping radiant bodily heat that otherwise would be lost through [[Convection|convection]], and so keeping the body warm. 

== Etymology ==
The term arose from the generalization of a specific fabric called Blanket fabric, a heavily [[nap (textile)|napped]] woolen weave pioneered by Thomas Blanket (Blanquette), a Flemish weaver who lived in [[Bristol]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1901/03/24/archives/origin-of-blanket.html | work=The New York Times | title=Origin of Blanket | date=24 March 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1787694 |title=Factors in the Development of the Cotswold Woollen Industry | volume=90 | pages=349–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier usage of the term is possible through its derivation from the French word for white, blanc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podictionary.com/?p=2754 |title=blanket |publisher=Podictionary |date= |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=blanket |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: blanket |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

[[File:Monet dejeunersurlherbe.jpg|thumb|''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe'', (right section) by [[Claude Monet]]]]
Many types of blanket material, such as [[wool]], are used because they are thicker and have more substantial fabric to them, but [[cotton]] can also be used for light blankets. Wool blankets are warmer and also relatively slow to burn compared to cotton. The most common types of blankets are woven acrylic, knitted polyester, mink, cotton, fleece and wool. Blankets also come with exotic crafting and exotic material such as crocheted afghan or a silk covering. The term blanket is often interchanged with [[comforter]], [[quilt]], and [[duvet]], as they all have similar uses.

== Uses==
Blankets have been used by militaries for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o817K419OEUC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Blankets+have+been+used+by+military+for+many+centuries&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp7POEpNzUAhUB_mMKHQqmDJ8Q6AEIQjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Blankets%20have%20been%20used%20by%20military%20for%20many%20centuries&amp;f=false|title=Fashion: A Canadian Perspective|last=Palmer|first=Alexandra|date=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802085900|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most militaries have blankets as compulsory for sleeping quarters in preference to [[duvets]]. Militaries are some of the biggest single consumers of woolen blankets. Military blankets tend to be coarse grey with a high level of [[Wool measurement|microns]], usually over 20. Suppliers include [[J. E. Ashworth &amp; Sons]] and [[Faribault Woolen Mills]] who made half of all blankets in America at one time.

Throw blankets are smaller blankets, often in decorative colors and patterns, that can be used for extra warmth and decoration on the outside of bed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Blankets are sometimes used as [[comfort object]]s by small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymRNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%C2%A0Blankets+are+sometimes+used+as+comfort+objects+by+small+children.&amp;dq=%C2%A0Blankets+are+sometimes+used+as+comfort+objects+by+small+children.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH-NuzpdzUAhUJ_mMKHTp4CMQQ6AEIQDAE|title=I Read where I Am: Exploring New Information Cultures|last=Gerritzen|first=Mieke|last2=Lovink|first2=Geert|last3=Kampman|first3=Minke|date=2011|publisher=Graphic Design Museum|isbn=9789078088554|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Blankets may be spread on the ground for a [[picnic]] or where people want to sit in a grassy or muddy area without soiling their clothing. Temporary blankets have been designed for this purpose.

[[File:BLEVE.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Flames subsequent to a flammable liquid BLEVE from a [[tank truck|tanker]]. BLEVEs do not necessarily involve fire.]]

A '''boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion''' ('''BLEVE''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|l|ɛ|v|iː}} {{Respell|BLEV|ee}}) is an [[explosion]] caused by the rupture of a vessel containing a [[pressure|pressurized]] [[liquid]] that has reached temperatures above its [[boiling point]].&lt;ref name="Kletz"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
There are three characteristics of liquids which are relevant to the discussion of a BLEVE:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

# If a liquid in a sealed container is boiled, the pressure inside the container increases. As the liquid changes to a gas it expands - this expansion in a vented container would cause the gas and liquid to take up more space. In a sealed container the gas and liquid are not able to take up more space and so the pressure rises. Pressurized vessels containing liquids can reach an equilibrium where the liquid stops boiling and the pressure stops rising. This occurs when no more heat is being added to the system, either because it has reached ambient temperature, or because a steady-state equilibrium has been reached between the heat received from the heat source and the heat lost to the environment, or because it has had a heat source removed (in this latter case both the temperature and the pressure will fall if heat is allowed to leave the system).
# The boiling temperature of a liquid is dependent on pressure - high pressures will yield high boiling temperatures, and low pressures will yield low boiling temperatures. A common simple experiment is to place a cup of water in a vacuum chamber, and then reduce the pressure in the chamber until the water boils. By reducing the pressure the water will boil even at room temperature. This works both ways - if the pressure is increased beyond normal atmospheric pressures, the boiling of hot water could be suppressed far beyond normal temperatures. The [[Radiator (engine cooling)|cooling system]] of a modern internal combustion engine is a common example.
# When a liquid boils it turns into a gas. The resulting gas takes up far more space than the liquid did.

Typically, a BLEVE  starts with a container of liquid which is held above its normal, atmospheric-pressure boiling temperature. Many substances normally stored as liquids, such as [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[propane]], and other similar [[industrial gas]]es have boiling temperatures, at atmospheric pressure, far below room temperature. In the case of water, a BLEVE could occur if a pressurized chamber of water is heated far beyond the standard {{convert|100|C|F}}. That container, because the boiling water pressurizes it, is capable of holding ''liquid'' water at very high temperatures.

If the pressurized vessel, containing liquid at high temperature (which may be room temperature, depending on the substance) ruptures, the pressure which prevents the liquid from boiling is lost. If the rupture is catastrophic, where the vessel is immediately incapable of holding any pressure at all, then there suddenly exists a large mass of liquid which is at very high temperature and very low pressure. This causes a portion of the liquid to "instantaneously" boil, which in turn causes an extremely rapid expansion. Depending on temperatures, pressures and the substance involved, that expansion may be so rapid that it can be classified as an explosion, fully capable of inflicting severe damage on its surroundings.

===Water example===

For example, a tank of pressurized liquid water held at {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}} might be pressurized to {{convert|1.7|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} above atmospheric ("gauge") pressure. If the tank containing the water were to rupture, there would for a brief moment exist a volume of liquid water which would be at:
* atmospheric pressure
* a temperature of {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}}. 
At atmospheric pressure the boiling point of water is {{convert|100|C|F}} - liquid water at atmospheric pressure does not exist at temperatures higher than {{convert|100|C|F}}. At that moment, the water would boil and turn to vapor explosively, and the {{convert|204.4|C|F|sigfig=3}} liquid water turned to gas would take up significantly more volume (~1,600-fold) than it did as liquid, causing a vapor explosion. Such explosions can happen when the superheated water of a [[steam engine]] escapes through a crack in a boiler, causing a [[boiler explosion]].

===BLEVEs without chemical reactions===

A BLEVE need not be a chemical explosion—nor does there need to be a fire—however if a flammable substance is subject to a BLEVE it may also be subject to intense heating, either from an external source of heat which may have caused the vessel to rupture in the first place or from an internal source of localized heating such as [[skin friction]]. This heating can cause a flammable substance to [[Combustion|ignite]], adding a [[secondary explosion]] caused by the primary BLEVE. While blast effects of any BLEVE can be  devastating, a flammable substance such as propane can add significantly to the danger.

[[File:Bleve explosion.svg|center|500px]]
While the term BLEVE is most often used to describe the results of a container of flammable liquid rupturing due to fire, a BLEVE can occur even with a non-[[flammable]] substance such as water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspect-ny.com/plumbing/Water_Heater_Relief_Valves.htm |title=Temperature Pressure Relief Valves on Water Heaters: test, inspect, replace, repair guide |publisher=Inspect-ny.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[liquid nitrogen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safteng.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1040:liquid-nitrogen-bleve-demo-vid-1 Liquid nitrogen BLEVE demo]&lt;/ref&gt; [[liquid helium]] or other [[refrigerant]]s or [[cryogen]]s, and therefore is not usually considered a type of [[chemical explosive|chemical explosion]]. Note that in the case of liquefied gasses, BLEVEs can also be hazardous because of rapid cooling due to the absorption of the enthalpy of vaporization (e.g. frostbites), or because of possible asphyxiation if a large volume of gas is produced and not rapidly dispersed (e.g. inside a building, or in a trough in the case of heavier-than-air gasses), or because of the toxicity of the gasses produced. 

==Fires==
BLEVEs can be caused by an external fire near the storage vessel causing heating of the contents and pressure build-up. While tanks are often designed to withstand great pressure, constant heating can cause the metal to weaken and eventually fail. If the tank is being heated in an area where there is no liquid, it may rupture faster without the liquid to absorb the heat. Gas containers are usually equipped with [[relief valve]]s that vent off excess pressure, but the tank can still fail if the pressure is not released quickly enough.&lt;ref name="Kletz" /&gt; Relief valves are sized to release pressure fast enough to prevent the pressure from increasing beyond the strength of the vessel, but not so fast as to be the cause of an explosion. An appropriately sized relief valve will allow the liquid inside to boil slowly, maintaining a constant pressure in the vessel until all the liquid has boiled and the vessel empties.

If the substance involved is flammable, it is likely that the resulting cloud of the substance will ignite after the BLEVE has occurred, forming a fireball and possibly a [[fuel-air explosive|fuel-air explosion]], also termed a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). If the materials are [[toxicity|toxic]], a large area will be [[contaminated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemelab.ucsd.edu/processdesign/safety/safety-notes.pdf |title=Chemical Process Safety |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720075455/http://chemelab.ucsd.edu/processdesign/safety/safety-notes.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
The term "BLEVE" was coined by three researchers at [[Factory Mutual]], in the analysis of an accident there in 1957 involving a chemical reactor vessel. Anthony Santos was one of the Factory Mutual chemical engineers who coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;David F. Peterson, [http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-155/issue-4/features/bleve-facts-risk-factors-and-fallacies.html BLEVE: Facts, Risk Factors, and Fallacies], Fire Engineering magazine (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1959, the [[Kansas City Fire Department]] suffered its second largest loss of life in the line of duty, when a 25,000 gallon (95,000 liter) gasoline tank exploded during a fire on [[Southwest Boulevard (Kansas City)|Southwest Boulevard]], killing five firefighters. {{citation needed span|This was the first time the term ''BLEVE'' was used to describe the explosion of a burning fuel tank.|date=January 2013}}

The '''CALS Table Model''' is a standard for representing tables in SGML/XML.{{Examples|date=January 2013}} It was developed as part of the [[CALS (DOD)|CALS DOD initiative]].

==History and Rationale==

The CALS Table Model was developed by the [[CALS (DOD)|CALS]] Industry Steering Group ''Electronic Publishing Committee'' (EPC).

The EPC subcommittee, of which Harvey Bingham was co-chair and a major contributor, designed the CALS Table Model in 1989-1990.  The EPC was made up of industry and military service representatives. Some represented traditional military document printing agencies. Others represented electronic publishing organizations. [[SGML]] itself was new. At that time, the CALS intent for all their technical manuals was to use that DTD to achieve system-neutral interchange of content and structure.

Its basis was a minimal description and example of a table from the prior [[Mil-M-38784B]] specification for producing technical manuals. The incomplete specification of the semantics associated with the table model allowed too much freedom for vendor interpretation, and resulted in problems with interchange. SGML-Open (now [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]) surveyed the implementing vendors to identify differences, as the initial step toward reaching a common interpretation. The next step was an updated CALS Table Model [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] and semantics. Both are now available from 
''OASIS''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/tablemodels.php&lt;/ref&gt;

As implementations of the CALS Table Model were developed, a number of ambiguities and omissions were detected and reported to the EPC committee.  The differences in interpretation had led to serious interoperability problems. To resolve these differences, 
OASIS identified a subset of the full CALS table model that had a high probability of successful interoperability among the OASIS vendor products. This subset is 
the Exchange Table Model DTD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/tr9503.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;table frame="none"&gt;

A '''changing bag''' is a photographic bag specifically designed to be light-proof while in use. It is required for certain applications involving [[photosensitive]] materials when a [[darkroom]] is not available, like in the field. Common usages include removing [[photographic film|film]] from its canister to put it into a [[developing tank]], or loading and unloading sheet film holders. They are also commonly found on the set of a [[film]], where the [[clapper loader]] may need one if shooting on location or far away from a darkroom.

==Usage==
It is handy to use when a [[darkroom]] is not available as is often the case in field shooting.  It is also used in commercial photo processing labs, often to change [[photographic paper|paper]].

==Description==
A changing bag has two sleeves at one end for both the user's arms, and a zipper (often more than one, for double layered changing bags) to insert the tools and film needed. There are several sizes available, from smaller ones for many [[photography|still photography]] applications to larger bags used in large-format still photography or film making, which may need to hold both a [[camera magazine|magazine]] and a can of [[film stock]] which each have a 1000-foot capacity. Larger changing bag sizes are also available as "changing tents", where the top of the bag can be held in a dome-like configuration through the use of two curved rods.

'''Clarence Francis Hiskey''' (1912&amp;ndash;1998), born '''Clarence Szczechowski''', was a Soviet espionage agent in the United States.  He became active in the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) when he attended graduate school at the [[University of Wisconsin]].  He became a professor of chemistry at the [[University of Tennessee]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]]. For a time, Hiskey worked at the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the [[University of Chicago]] [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], part of the [[Manhattan Project]].  He was the father of [[Nicholas Sand]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/us/nicholas-sand-chemist-who-sought-to-bring-lsd-to-the-world-dies-at-75.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F05%2F12%2Fus%2Fnicholas-sand-chemist-who-sought-to-bring-lsd-to-the-world-dies-at-75.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metallurgical Laboratory==
Hiskey joined the Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory in September 1943. 
In May 1944, a  message sent by New York KGB to Moscow [[Venona project]] was intercepted and decrypted. The message contained information reporting that [[Bernard Schuster]], member of the CPUSA secret apparatus, working for Soviet intelligence, had traveled to Chicago on the KGB's instructions. The message recorded Schuster's description of those he had come in contact with, including [[Rose Olsen]], and stating Olsen had been meeting with Hiskey on the instructions of the organization.  In July, it appears [[Joseph Katz]] had been assigned to the Hiskey case.

On 28 April 1944, Army counter-intelligence (G-2) observed  a meeting between Clarence Hiskey and Soviet Military Intelligence ([[GRU]]) officer [[Arthur Adams (spy)|Arthur Adams]].  Hiskey was removed from the Manhattan Project by drafting him into the Army, and stationing him in Canada for the duration of the conflict.  While en route, Army counter-intelligence officers secretly searched Hiskey's luggage and found seven pages of classified notes taken from the Chicago Metallurgical Lab. When the officers subsequently performed a follow up search, the notes were no longer with Hiskey.

==Investigations==
In 1948, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) established that Hiskey was an active member of the CPUSA and had attempted to recruit other scientists to pass secret atomic data to Soviet intelligence.  Congressional investigators concluded: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It became obvious that Hiskey had for some time been supplying Adams with secret information regarding atomic research.  Immediately after seeing Adams, Hiskey flew to Cleveland, Ohio, where he contacted [[John Hitchcock Chapin]].  Chapin, through the urging of Clarence Hiskey, agreed to take over Hiskey's contacts with Adams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapin admitted to investigators that Hiskey had told him that Adams was indeed a Soviet agent. Edward Manning was another Chicago Met Lab employee Hiskey attempted to recruit.

In testimony before HUAC and [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]], Hiskey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his Communist associations and espionage, and in 1950, he was cited for [[contempt of Congress]].  Hiskey resigned his position as associate professor of analytical chemistry on the faculty of [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]] and joined the [[International Biotechnical Corporation]], later becoming director of analytical research for [[Endo Laboratories]].

==McCarthy==
In June 1953, Hiskey was subpoenaed to testify before the [[Senate Subcommittee on Investigations]].  In a closed door session, Hiskey was interrogated by Sen. [[Joseph McCarthy]]:

:Sen. McCarthy: "Were you engaged in atomic energy espionage?"

:Mr. Hiskey: "I refuse to answer that question."

Then after some discussion of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]],

:Sen. McCarthy: "That is about as definite proof as we can get here that you were an espionage agent, because if you were not, you would simply say no. That would not incriminate you. The only time it would incriminate you would be if you were an espionage agent. So when you refuse to answer on the ground it would incriminate you, that is telling us you were an agent."

:Mr. Hiskey: "I don't think you understand the whole purpose of the Fifth Amendment, Senator. That amendment was put into the Constitution to protect the innocent man from just this kind of star chamber proceeding you are carrying on."

The proceeding closed with,

:Ray Cohn: "There is one other question. Can you tell us any names of any Communists working on the Manhattan project?"

:Mr. Hiskey: "I refuse to answer that question."

:Sen. McCarthy: "On the grounds of self-incrimination."

:Mr. Hiskey: "On the grounds it may tend to incriminate me."

The subcommittee did not call Hiskey to testify in public.

The recommendations on May 27, 1954 of the Personnel Security Board of the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] investigation into [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], director of the [[Manhattan Project]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], stated Oppenheimer had been found in the company of "Joseph W. Weinberg and Clarence Hiskey, who were alleged to be members of the Communist Party and to have engaged in espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union."  Oppenheimer's [[security clearance]] was revoked the following month.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, KGB Archives were made accessible to historian [[Allen Weinstein]] and a former KGB officer [[Alexander Vassiliev]].  The identification of Hiskey as a Soviet agent cover named RAMSAY which occurs in the [[Venona]] papers, corroborated Hiskey's covert relationship with Soviet intelligence.

'''Cybermanufacturing''' is a concept derived from [[cyber-physical system]]s (CPS) that refers to a modern [[manufacturing]] system that offers an information-transparent environment to facilitate [[asset management]], provide reconfigurability, and maintain [[productivity]]. Compared with conventional experience-based management systems, cybermanufacturing provides an evidence-based environment to keep equipment users aware of networked asset status, and transfer raw data into possible risks and actionable information. Driving technologies include design of cyber-physical systems, combination of engineering [[domain knowledge]] and computer sciences, as well as information technologies. Among them, [[mobile application]]s for manufacturing is an area of specific interest to industries and academia.&lt;ref name="NSF_CyberManufacturing"&gt;{{cite web|title=EAGER/Cybermanufacturing Systems: Fleet-Sourced Cyber Manufacturing Applications for Improved Transparency and Resilience of Manufacturing Assets and Systems|url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1550433&amp;HistoricalAwards=false|publisher=National Science Foundation (NSF)|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
The idea of cyber manufacturing stems from the fact that Internet-enabled services have added business value in economic sectors such as retail, music, consumer products, transportation, and healthcare. However, compared to existing Internet-enabled sectors, manufacturing assets are less connected and less accessible in real-time. Besides, current manufacturing enterprises make decisions following a top-down approach: from overall equipment effectiveness to assignment of production requirements, without considering the condition of machines. This will usually lead to inconsistency in operation management due to lack of linkage between factories, possible overstock in spare part inventory, as well as unexpected machine downtime. 
Such situation calls for connectivity between machines as a foundation, and analytics on top of that as a necessity to translate raw data into information that actually facilitates user [[decision making]]. Expected functionalities of cybermanufacturing systems include machine connectivity and data acquisition, machine health prognostics, fleet-based asset management, and manufacturing reconfigurability.

==Technology==
[[File:CPS for Manufacturing.png|400px|right]]
Several technologies are involved in developing cyber-manufacturing solutions. The following is a short description of these technologies and their involvement in cyber-manufacturing. 
*'''[[Cyber-physical system]]''' is the foundation of cyber-manufacturing. Tools and methods within CPS enables possibility of reaching cyber-manufacturing goals. For example, the recently proposed “5C”&lt;ref name=CPS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Bagheri|first2=Behrad|last3=Kao|first3=Hung-An|title=A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems|journal=Manufacturing Letters|date=January 2015|volume=3|pages=18–23|doi=10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; architecture for implementing cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, utilizes cyber-twins to overcome geographical boundaries of local models and enable a comprehensive [[:wikt:fleet|fleet]]-based monitoring and prognostics of the manufacturing enterprise. 
*'''[[Big Data]] Analytics''' is the other significant technology participating in design and development of cyber-manufacturing systems. Connected machines in every industry raise the issue of proper data handling and processing and cyber-manufacturing is not an exemption. Customized developments in [[cloud computing]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[predictive analytics]] are applicable in cyber-manufacturing.

==Development==
In 2013 the Office of Naval Research in the US Military has issued a proposal solicitation subjected for cyber-manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber-enabled Manufacturing Systems for Direct Digital Manufacturing (CeMS-DDM)|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/~/media/Files/Funding-Announcements/BAA/2014/14-004.ashx|publisher=The US Navy, Office of Naval Research|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2015, the US [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) has awarded a research project for developing cyber-manufacturing system to the [http://www.imscenter.net/ Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems] (IMS) at the [[University of Cincinnati]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31010">[[File:Design Museum Copenhagen 2011 Danish modern chairs.jpg|thumb|300px|Selection of Danish Modern chairs, Danish Design Museum, Copenhagen]]

'''Danish modern''' is a style of [[minimalism|minimalist]] furniture and housewares from [[Denmark]] associated with the [[Danish design]] movement. In the 1920s, [[Kaare Klint]] embraced the principles of [[Bauhaus]] modernism in furniture design, creating clean, pure lines based on an understanding of classical furniture craftsmanship coupled with careful research into materials, proportions and the requirements of the human body. With designers such as [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[Hans Wegner]] and associated cabinetmakers, Danish furniture thrived from the 1940s through the 1960s. Adopting mass-production techniques and concentrating on form rather than just function, [[Finn Juhl]] contributed to the style's success. Danish housewares adopting a similar minimalist design such as cutlery and trays of teak and stainless steel and dinnerware such as those produced in Denmark for Dansk in its early years, expanded the Danish modern aesthetic beyond furniture.

==Background==
[[File:Grundtvigskirken-stole-2005.jpg|Church Chair (1936)|thumb|left|130px|Kaare Klint: Church Chair (1936)]]

Between the two world wars, [[Kaare Klint]] exerted a strong influence on Danish furniture making. Appointed head of the Furniture Department at the Architecture School of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], he encouraged his students to take an analytical approach, adapting design to modern-day needs. Adopting the [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] trend of abandoning ornamentation in favour of form, he nonetheless maintained the warmth and beauty inherent in traditional Danish cabinet making, as well as high-quality craftsmanship and materials.&lt;ref name=Hollingsworth&gt;Andrew Hollingsworth, ''Danish Modern'', Gibbs Smith, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of modern Danish furniture owes much to the collaboration between architects and cabinetmakers. Cabinetmaker [[A. J. Iversen]], who had successfully exhibited furniture from designs by architect Kay Gottlob at the [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts|Paris World Exhibition]] in 1925, was instrumental in fostering further partnerships. In 1927, with a view to encouraging innovation and stimulating public interest, the Danish Cabinetmakers Guild organized a furniture exhibition in Copenhagen which was to be held every year until 1967. It fostered collaboration between cabinetmakers and designers, creating a number of lasting partnerships including those between Rudolph Rasmussen and Kaare Klint, A. J. Iversen and Ole Wanscher, and Erhard Rasmussen and Børge Mogensen. From 1933, collaboration was reinforced as a result of the annual competition for new types of furniture, arranged each year prior to the exhibition.&lt;ref name=Hollingsworth1&gt;Hollingsworth, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Erik Andresen, ''Dansk møbelindustri 1870-1950'', 1996, Århus: Systime, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the postwar years, Danish designers and architects believed that design could be used to improve people's lives. Particular attention was given to creating affordable furniture and household objects that were both functional and elegant. Fruitful cooperation ensued, combining Danish craftsmanship with innovative design. Initially, the furniture was handmade, but recognizing that their work would sell better if prices were reduced, the designers soon turned to factory production.  Interest in Danish Modern in the United States began when [[Edgar Kaufmann, Jr.]] from the [[Museum of Modern Art]] purchased some items for the [[Fallingwater]] home designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name=lifescript&gt;[http://www.lifescript.com/Life/Timeout/At-home/Danish_Modern_Design_For_Todays_Lifestyles.aspx  Kat DeLong, "Danish Modern Design For Today's Lifestyles"], ''Lifescript'', 2 June 2008.

The scarcity of materials after the [[World War II|Second World War]] encouraged the use of plywood. In the late 1940s, the development of new techniques led to the mass production of bent plywood designs by [[Hans Wegner]] and [[Børge Mogensen]], both of whom produced chairs with a teak plywood seat and back on a beech frame. In 1951, [[Arne Jacobsen]] went even further with his sculptural [[Ant (chair)|Ant Chair]] with a one-piece plywood seat and back, bent in both directions. Collapsible chairs dating from the 1930s include Kaare Klint's Safari Chair and propeller stools which were also developed by [[Poul Kjærholm]] and [[Jørgen Gammelgaard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/exhibitions/ "Exhibition"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

==Main contributors==
;[[Kaare Klint]] (1888—1954):
As a result of the furniture school he founded at the Royal Academy in 1924, Klint had a strong influence on Danish furniture, shaping designers such as Kjærholm and Mogensen. His carefully researched designs are based on functionality, proportions in line with the human body, craftsmanship and the use of high quality materials. Notable examples of his work include the Propeller Stool (1927), the Safari Chair and the Deck Chair (both 1933), and the Church Chair (1936).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/kaare-klint/ "Kaare Klint"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

;[[Poul Henningsen]] (1894–1967):
Poul Henningsen, an architect, with a strong belief in the functionalist way of thinking, was an important participant in the Danish Modern school, not for furniture but for lighting design. His attempt to prevent the blinding glare from the electric lamp bulb succeeded in 1926 with a three-shade lamp, known as the PH lamp. The curvature of the shades allowed his hanging lamp to illuminate both the table and the rest of the room. He went on to design many similar lamps, some with frosted glass, including desk lamps, chandeliers and wall-mounted fixtures. Though he died in 1967, many of his designs have remained popular to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/poul-henningsen/ "Poul Henningsen"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

;[[Mogens Lassen]] (1901–1987):
In addition to his architectural work, [[Mogens Lassen|Lassen]] was also a keen furniture designer. Influenced both by [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], he developed a unique approach to Functionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bylassen.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=66&amp;lang=en "Mogens Lassen"], ''By Lassen''. {{Da icon}} Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his fine craftsmanship and his search for simplicity, his steel-based furniture from the 1930s added a new dimension to the modernist movement. His later designs in wood still form part of classical Danish Modern, especially his three-legged stool&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101115075146/http://www.galerie-mobler.com/designer-scandinave/mogens-lassen---------_47 "Mogens Lassen"], ''galerie møbler''. {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and folding Egyptian coffee table (1940) originally produced by A.

;[[Arne Jacobsen]] (1902–1971):
Graduating from the Royal Academy in 1924, Jacobsen quickly demonstrated his mastery of both architecture and furniture design. With the completion of his [[Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, Copenhagen|Royal Hotel in Copenhagen]] and all its internal fittings and furniture in 1960, his talents became widely recognized, especially as a result of the chairs called the [[Egg chair|Egg]] and the Swan, now international icons. His stackable, three-legged Ant Chair (1952) with a one-piece plywood seat and back and its four-legged counterpart, the [[Model 3107 chair|7 Chair]] (1955), were particularly popular with worldwide sales in the millions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/arne-jacobsen/ "Arne Jacobsen"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

;[[Ole Wanscher]] (1903–1985):
Inspired by Kaare Klint under whom he had studied, Wanscher later followed in his footsteps as professor of the Royal Academy's furniture school. Particularly interested in 18th-century English furniture and in early Egyptian furniture, one of his most successful pieces was his delicately designed Egyptian Stool (1960) crafted from luxurious materials. Another successful item was his  Colonial Chair in Brazilian rosewood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/ole-wanscher/ "Ole Wanscher"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

;[[Finn Juhl]] (1912–1989):
Though he studied architecture at the Royal Academy, Juhl was a self-taught designer as far as furniture was concerned. In the late 1930s, he created furniture for himself but from 1945 he became recognized for his expressively sculptural designs, placing emphasis on form rather than function, so breaking tradition with the Klint school. His successful interior design work at the [[United Nations Headquarters|UN Headquarters]] in New York spread the notion of Danish Modern far and wide, paving the way for the international participation of his Danish colleagues. Two key pieces of furniture, in which the seat and backrest are separated from the wooden frame, are his 45-Chair, with its elegant armrests, and his Chieftain Chair (1949).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/finn-juhl/ "Finn Juhl"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

;[[Børge Mogensen]] (1914–1972):
After studying under Kaare Klint at the Copenhagen School of Arts and Crafts and at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Mogensen adopted Klint's approach to simple, functional furniture design. Taking an almost scientific approach to an item's functionality, most of his furniture is characterized by strong, simple lines and was designed for industrial production. Notable items include his oak-framed Hunting Chair (1950) with a strong leather back and seat, his light, open Spokeback Sofa (1945), and the low robust Spanish Chair (1959).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/boerge-mogensen/ "Børge Mogensen"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

;[[Hans Wegner]] (1914–2007):

Best known as ‘[https://danishmodernla.com/product/category/new_arrivals?designer=1 the Master of the Chairs],' Wegner created fascinating furniture with clean, organic and aesthetic lines, balanced by a minimalist and composed aspect. He was a modernist with emphasis on the practicality and elegance of each piece he crafted. He believed the versatility and usability of his designs were as vital for him as the looks of them.After graduating in architecture in 1938, he worked in Arne Jacobsen and Eric Møller's office before establishing his own office in 1943. Striving for functionality as well as beauty, he became the most prolific Danish designer, producing over 500 different chairs. His Round Chair (technically Model 500) in 1949 was called "the world's most beautiful chair" before being labelled simply "The Chair" after Nixon and Kennedy used it in a 1960 televised debate. His Wishbone Chair, also 1949, with a Y-shaped back split and a curved back, was inspired by a Chinese child's chair he had seen. A work of simplicity and comfort, it is still made today by the Danish firm Carl Hansen &amp; Son. Wegner's designs can now be found in several of the world's top design museums including New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/hans-wegner/ "Hans Wegner"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

;[[Grete Jalk]] (1920–2006):
After training as a cabinetmaker, she studied at the [[Danish Design School]] in 1946, while receiving additional instruction from [[Kaare Klint]] at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy]]'s Furniture School. Inspired by [[Alvar Aalto]]'s laminated bent-plywood furniture and [[Charles and Ray Eames|Charles Eames]]' moulded plywood designs, she began to develop her own boldly curved models in the 1950s. In 1963, she won a [[Daily Mirror]] competition with her "He Chair" and "She Chair". With the help of furniture manufacturer Poul Jeppesen, she went on to design simpler models with clear, comfortable lines, which became popular both in Denmark and the United States thanks to their competitive prices. Jalk also edited the Danish design magazine ''Mobilia'' and compiled an authoritative four-volume work on Danish furniture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/688/origin/170/ Søren Sass, "Grete Jalk (1920 - 2006)"], ''Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon''. {{Da icon}} Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobedre.dk/designere/klassiske-designere/grete-jalk Signe Brogaard, "Grete Jalk"], ''Bo Bedre''. {{Da icon}} Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Verner Panton]] (1926–1998):
On graduating from the Royal Academy in 1951, [[Verner Panton|Panton]] worked briefly with Arne Jacobsen. During the 1960s, he designed furniture, lamps and textiles with an imaginative combination of innovative materials, playful shapes and bold colours. Among his earliest designs were the Bachelor Chair and Tivoli Chair (1955), both produced by Fritz Hansen, but he is remembered above all for his [[Panton Chair]] (1960), the world's first one-piece moulded plastic chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/verner-panton/ "Verner Panton"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

;[[Poul Kjærholm]] (1929–1980):
In addition to an academic career at the School of Arts and Crafts and at the Institute of Design at the Royal Academy, Kjærholm always took full account of the importance of place a piece of furniture had in surrounding architectural space. Functionality took second place to his artistic approach which was centred on elegantly clean lines and attention to detail. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he worked essentially with steel, combining it with wood, leather, cane or marble. Kjærhom developed a close understanding with the cabinetmaker E. Kold Christensen who produced most of his designs. Today a wide selection of his furniture is produced by [[Fritz Hansen]]. Kjærholm's work can be seen in New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/poul-kjærholm/ "Poul Kjærholm"], ''Danish-furniture.com''.

;[[Jens Risom]] (1916–2016):
Often credited with having introduced Danish Modern design to America, Risom was a graduate of [[Copenhagen School of Industrial Arts and Design]]. He emigrated to the United States in 1939 to study American design, working first as a textile designer and later as a freelance furniture designer. In 1941 he joined [[Hans Knoll]] at the [[Hans Knoll Furniture Company]], and together they toured the country promoting Risom's designs.  A true [[minimalism|minimalist]], Risom worked mainly in wood because it was cheap, and one of his most successful pieces, Knoll Chair #654 (which is still being manufactured)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1994 Reintroducing the 666 and 654 Chairs|url=http://www.knoll.com/search-results?searchtext=chair%20654&amp;newTab=discover&amp;parent=1347382602231|website=Knoll|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made with a seat of nylon webbing that had been discarded by the army.

A number of Danish textile designers worked closely with furniture designers to help shape the look of Danish modernism, for example by creating textiles for cushions, sofas, and beds. These include [[Lis Ahlmann]] and [[Vibeke Klint]], among others.

==The American market==
From the beginning of the 1950s, American manufacturers obtained licenses for the mass production of Danish designs while maintaining high standards of craftsmanship. Later, the designs were altered to suit American tastes and American parts were introduced to reduce costs. When [[Sears]] and [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] entered the market, the Danes countered by producing new designs based on new materials. Sales peaked around 1963, but when American manufacturers introduced moulded plastic and wood-grained Formica as cheaper substitutes, they started to decline in favour of Mediterranean designs which became popular in 1966.&lt;ref name=lifescript/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/bestliftchair/docs/jetset_-_designs_for_modern_living_ Sandy McLendon, "The Modern Mama Had Scandinavian Modern"], ''Jetset''. Retrieved 28 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There has however been a resurgence of interest in recent years. While the mass-produced works of Wegner, Juhl and Jacobsen are still in demand, collectors are increasingly turning to limited production items from these and the other designers. In the United States, while prices have increased, they are still at reasonable levels compared to similar items of new furniture. Licensed manufacturers have started reissuing key designs, while others have used Danish Modern for inspiration.&lt;ref name=Hollingsworth10&gt;Hollingsworth, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Danish furniture industry==
[[File:Danish Design Center chairs.jpg|thumb|Danish Modern chairs at the [[Danish Design Centre|Danish Design Center]] in Copenhagen]]
Employing some 15,000 people, each year Denmark's 400 furniture companies produce goods worth around DKK 13 billion (€1.75 billion). A highly productive sector, over 80% of the furniture produced is sold abroad making furniture Denmark's fifth most-important export industry. Most of the items produced are for the home, but many are designed for the workplace. In addition to its classic designs, Danish designer furniture benefits from a new generation of innovative players. As a result, Denmark has maintained its place as the world's leading furniture producer in relation to the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425114428/http://www.danishfurniture.dk/Default.aspx?ID=48 "Danish furniture industry in short"], ''Møbel+Interiør brancheforening''.

A number of firms continue to be active in producing both classic Danish Modern designs and in introducing variants designed by a new generation of artists. They include [[Fritz Hansen|Republic of Fritz Hansen]], Fredericia Furniture,  Carl Hansen &amp; Søn and Normann Copenhagen, all of whom exhibited at the 2011 ''Salone Internazionale del Mobile'' in Milan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/Business-Lounge/Focus-Denmark/Articles/HatchedFromTheEgg.htm Jeppe Villadsen, "Hatched from The Egg"], ''Denmark.dk''.

'''[http://www.dharmacon.com Dharmacon Inc.]''', now known as '''Dharmacon, a [https://www.horizondiscovery.com/ Horizon Discovery] Group company''', was founded in 1995 by Stephen Scaringe as '''Dharmacon Research''' to develop and commercialize a new technology for [[RNA]] [[oligonucleotide synthesis]].  The original Dharmacon focus and vision was to develop 2'-ACE [[RNA]] technology as the standard for RNA synthesis and to advance RNA oligo-dependent applications and technologies.  When [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) emerged in the late 1990s, Dharmacon was poised to provide [[RNAi]]-related products to the multitude of academic and industry researchers. Dharmacon has become an important resource for those investigating the mechanisms of [[siRNA]] (small interfering RNA)-induced [[gene knockdown]] and applying the specificity and potency of [[RNAi]] to human biotherapeutics. Dharmacon's expertise in [[bioinformatics]], RNA biology, and synthesis chemistry has allowed it to develop a complete line of products for the [[RNAi]] researcher.

In November 2002, Dharmacon Research, Inc. officially changed its name to Dharmacon, Inc., to reflect the increasing capabilities and future growth potential of the company, as it had advanced beyond research and development and into whole solutions for RNA oligo-dependent applications and technologies. In March 2004, Dharmacon became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Fisher Scientific]] International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmacon.com/company/pressrelease.aspx?id=34= Acquisition of Dharmacon, Inc. by Fisher Scientific]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}, press release, February 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2006, [[Fisher Scientific]] International, Inc. merged with [[Thermo Electron]] Corporation to become [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.thermofisher.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=89145&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=929319&amp;highlight= Merger of Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific Completed, Forming Thermo Fisher Scientific] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120722153658/http://ir.thermofisher.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=89145&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=929319&amp;highlight= |date=2012-07-22 }}, press release, November 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 the websites for the companies formerly known as Dharmacon, Open Biosystems, [[Fermentas]], Finnzymes, and ABgene were merged, creating the new Thermo Scientific Life Sciences Research eCommerce site.

In April 2013, Thermo Fisher Scientific reached an agreement to buy [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.thermofisher.com/press-release/corporate/thermo-fisher-scientific-acquire-life-technologies-corporation Thermo Fisher Scientific to Acquire Life Technologies Corporation | Thermo Fisher Scientific eNews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation received conditional approval from the European Commission in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.thermofisher.com/press-release/corporate/thermo-fisher-scientific-receives-clearance-european-commission-its-acquisit Thermo Fisher Scientific Receives Clearance from the European Commission for its Acquisition of Life Technologies | Thermo Fisher Scientific eNews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The conditional requirement was the divestment of Thermo Fisher Scientific's cell culture (sera and media), magnetic beads and Dharmacon gene modulation businesses for antitrust reasons.

In early January 2014, [[GE Healthcare]] reached an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific to acquire the cell culture, magnetic bead and Dharmacon gene modulation businesses for 1.05 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140106005856/en/GE-Expand-Life-Sciences-Acquisition-Strategic-Assets#.Uyyxj6hdV8E GE To Expand in Life Sciences with Acquisition of Strategic Assets from Thermo Fisher Scientific | Business Wire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The acquisition of Dharmacon is viewed as complementary to GE Healthcare's drug discovery research technologies.

In the fall of 2014, GE Healthcare announced it had reached a licensing agreement with the [[Broad Institute|Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard]] granting access to CRISPR-Cas9 intellectual property.  Under the agreement, GE Healthcare is able to incorporate the patented technologies, and develop and launch additional complementary gene editing reagents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/ge-healthcare-life-sciences-sigma-aldrich-license-crispr-cas9-patents/81250664/ CRISPR-Cas9 IP licensed to GE]&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in October 2014, GE Healthcare Dharmacon launched its first CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering products under the “Edit-R” brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41355/title/Dharmacon--Edit-R--Gene-Engineering-System/ Dharmacon™ Edit-R™ Gene Engineering System | The Scientist Magazine®&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, GE Healthcare Dharmacon launched synthetic crRNA and lentiviral sgRNA pre-designed with a functionally validated algorithm against entire human, mouse and rat genomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biospace.com/News/ge-healthcare-dharmacon-advances-crispr-cas9-gene/386001 GE Healthcare Dharmacon Advances CRISPR Cas9 Gene Engineering Technology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, UK firm Horizon Discovery reached an agreement to acquire Dharmacon from GE Healthcare for a total consideration of $85 million. The acquisition is expected to complement Horizon's portfolio of gene editing products and engineered cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.genomeweb.com/gene-silencinggene-editing/cowen-initiates-coverage-horizon-discovery-outperform|title=Cowen Initiates Coverage of Horizon Discovery at Outperform|work=GenomeWeb|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrical Resistance Heating''' (ERH) is an intensive in situ [[environmental remediation]] method that uses the flow of [[alternating current]] electricity to heat soil and groundwater and evaporate contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Thomas, et al. "[http://www.thermalrs.com/images/news/upload/pdf/1430247810-ERH_Rem_Jour_Spring_2007.pdf New advancements for in situ treatment using electrical resistance heating]." Remediation journal 17.2 (2007): 51-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric current is passed through a targeted soil volume between subsurface electrode elements. The resistance to electrical flow that exists in the soil causes the formation of heat; resulting in an increase in temperature until the boiling point of water at depth is reached.  After reaching this temperature, further energy input causes a phase change, forming steam and removing volatile contaminants. ERH is typically more cost effective when used for treating contaminant source areas....

== History ==

Three-phase heating (see Technology below) was originally created to enhance [[Petroleum extraction|oil recovery]].  This design was patented in 1976 by Bill Pritchett of ARCO.  The patent has expired and is now available for public use.

Six-phase heating (see Technology below) was created and patented for the US Department of Energy (DOE) in the 1980s for use on DOE sites as well as commercial applications.

== Technology ==
Electrical resistance heating is used by the environmental restoration industry for remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater.  ERH consists of constructing electrodes in the ground, applying alternating current (AC) electricity to the electrodes and heating the subsurface to temperatures that promote the evaporation of contaminants.  Volatilized contaminants are captured by a subsurface vapor recovery system and conveyed to the surface along with recovered air and steam.  Similar to [[Soil vapor extraction]], the air, steam and volatilized contaminants are then treated at the surface to separate water, air and the contaminants.  Treatment of the various streams depends on local regulations and the amount of contaminant.

Some low volatility organic contaminants have a short [[hydrolysis]] half life.  For contaminants like these, i.e. [[1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane]] and [[1,1,1-trichloroethane]], hydrolysis can be the primary form of remediation.  As the subsurface is heated the hydrolysis [[half life]] of the contaminant will decrease as described by the [[Arrhenius equation]].  This results in a rapid degradation of the contaminant.  The hydrolysis [[by-product]] may be remediated by conventional ERH, however the majority of the mass of the primary contaminant will not be recovered but rather will degrade to a by-product.

There are predominantly two electrical load arrangements for ERH: three-phase and six-phase.  Three-phase heating consists of electrodes in a repeating triangular or delta pattern.  Adjacent electrodes are of a different electrical [[Polyphase system|phase]] so electricity conducts between them as shown in Figure 1.  The contaminated area is depicted by the green shape while the electrodes are depicted by the numbered circles.

[[Image:Three Phase Figure.GIF|thumb|432px|Fig 1. Typical three-phase ERH arrangement]]

Six-phase heating consists of six electrodes in a hexagonal pattern with a neutral electrode in the center of the array.  The six-phase arrays are outlined in blue in Figure 2 below.  Once again the contaminated area is depicted by the green shape while the electrodes are depicted by the numbered circles.  In a six-phase heating pattern there can be hot spots and cold spots depending on the phases that are next to each other.  For this reason, six-phase heating typically works best on small circular areas that are less than 65 feet in diameter. 
     
[[Image:Six Phase Figure.GIF|thumb|432px|Fig 2. Typical six-phase ERH arrangement]]

ERH is typically most effective on [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs).  The chlorinated compounds [[perchloroethylene]], [[trichloroethylene]], and cis- or trans- 1,2-dichloroethylene are contaminants that are easily remediated with ERH.  The table shows contaminants that can be remediated with ERH along with their respective boiling points.  Less volatile contaminants like xylene or diesel can also be remediated with ERH but energy requirements increase as the volatility decreases.

Electrode spacing and operating time can be adjusted to balance the overall remediation cost with the desired cleanup time.  A typical remediation may consist of electrodes spaced 15 to 20 feet apart with operating times usually less than a year.  The design and cost of an ERH remediation system depends on a number of factors, primarily the volume of soil/groundwater to be treated, the type of contamination, and the treatment goals. The physical and chemical properties of the target compounds are governed by laws that make heated remediations advantageous over most conventional methods. The electrical energy usage required for heating the subsurface and volatilizing the contaminants can account for 5 to 40% of the overall remediation cost.

There are several laws that govern an ERH remediation.  Dalton’s law governs the boiling point of a relatively insoluble contaminant.  Raoult’s law governs the boiling point of mutually soluble co-contaminants and Henry’s law governs the ratio of the contaminant in the vapor phase to the contaminant in the liquid phase.

===Dalton's law===
For mutually insoluble compounds, [[Dalton's law]] states that the partial pressure of a non aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)  is equal to its vapor pressure, and that the [[DNAPL|NAPL]] in contact with water will boil when the vapor pressure of water plus the vapor pressure of the VOC is equal to ambient pressure.  When a VOC-steam bubble is formed the composition of the bubble is proportional to the composite’s respective vapor pressures.
 
===Raoult's law===
For mutually soluble compounds, [[Raoult's law]] states that the partial pressure of a compound is equal to its vapor pressure times its mole fraction.  This means that mutually soluble contaminants will volatilize slower than if there was only one compound present.  
 
===Henry's law===
[[Henry's law]] describes the tendency of a compound to join air in the vapor phase or dissolve in water.  The Henry’s Law constant, sometimes called coefficient, is specific to each compound and depends on the system temperature. The constant is used to predict the amount of contaminant what will remain in the vapor phase (or transfer to the liquid phase), upon exiting the condenser.

== Recent Innovations in ERH ==

Significant ERH technological advancements have occurred over the last five years. Three areas of focus have been: bedrock remediation, 1,4-dioxane and other emerging contaminants, and controlled low temperature heat to enhance other remedial or natural processes.

===Bedrock Treatment===
ERH has been used for over 15 years for treatment of unconsolidated soils in both the vadose and saturated zones. Recent advancements and results show that ERH can be an effective treatment method for [[bedrock]]. At an ERH site, the primary electrical current path is on the thin layer of water immediately adjacent to the soil or rock grains. Little current is carried by the water in the pore volume. It is not the pore fluid that dominates the electrical conductivity; it is the grain wetting fluid that dominates the electrical conductivity. Sedimentary rock will typically possess the thin layer of water required for current flow. This means ERH can effectively be used for treatment of sedimentary bedrock, which typically has significant primary porosity. 
 
===1,4-Dioxane===
[[1,4-dioxane]] is a recently-identified contaminant of concern. The regulatory criteria for 1,4-dioxane is constantly changing as more is learned about this contaminant. 1,4-dioxane has a high solubility in water and a low Henry's Law constant which combine to present complex challenges associated with remediation. At ambient conditions, the physical properties of 1,4-dioxane indicate [[air stripping]] is not an efficient treatment mechanism. Recent ERH remediation results indicate that ERH creates conditions favorable for treatment. ERH remediation involves steam stripping, which historically had not been investigated for 1,4-dioxane. At ERH sites, steam stripping was observed to effectively transfer 1,4-dioxane to the vapor phase for subsequent treatment. 99.8% reductions (or greater) in 1,4-dioxane concentrations in groundwater have been documented on recent ERH remediation. Monitoring of the above grade treatment streams indicates that 95% of 1,4-dioxane remained in the vapor stream after removal from the subsurface. Furthermore, granular [[activated carbon]] has proven to be an effective 1,4-dioxane vapor treatment method.
 
===Controlled Low Temperature Heating===
Volatilization is the primary removal mechanism on most ERH sites. However, ERH can also be used to enhance other processes, some naturally occurring, to reduce the cost for treatment of a plume. ERH can be used to provide controlled low temperature heating for projects with remediation processes that do not involve steam stripping. "Low temperature heating" refers to the targeting of a subsurface temperature that is less than the boiling point of water. Examples of low temperature ERH include heat-enhanced [[bioremediation]], heating the subsurface to temperatures above the solubility of dissolved gasses to induce VOC stripping (most notably carbon dioxide ebullition), heat enhanced in situ [[in situ chemical oxidation|chemical oxidation]] (especially for persulfate activation), and heat-enhanced reduction (such as with iron-catalyzed reactions). ERH low-temperature heating can also be used to hydrolyze chlorinated alkanes in-situ at sub-boiling temperatures where hydrochloric acid released during hydrolysis further reacts with subsurface carbonates and bicarbonates to produce carbon dioxide for subsurface stripping of VOCs.

Using low temperature heating coupled with bioremediation, chemical oxidation, or dechlorination will result in increased reaction rates. This can significantly reduce the time required for these remediation processes as compared to a remediation at ambient temperature. In addition, a low temperature option does not require the use of the above grade treatment system for recovered vapors, as boiling temperatures will not be reached. This means less above grade infrastructure and lower overall cost.

When heat is combined with multi-phase extraction, the elevated temperatures will reduce the viscosity and surface tension of the recovered fluids which makes removal faster and easier. This is the original purpose for the development of ERH - to enhance oil recovery (see {{section link||History}} above).

== Weaknesses ==

*Weaknesses of ERH include heat losses on small sites.  Treatment volumes that have a large surface area but are thin with respect to depth will have significant heat losses which makes ERH less efficient.  The minimum treatment interval for efficient ERH remediation is approximately 10 vertical feet.
*Co-contaminants like oil or grease make remediation more difficult.  Oil and grease cause a Raoult’s Law effect which requires more energy to remove the contaminants.
*Peat or high organic carbon in the subsurface will preferentially adsorb VOCs due to [[van der Waals force|van der Waals]] forces.  This preferential adsorption will increase the amount of energy required to remove the VOCs from the subsurface.
*Fuel sites are less-commonly treated by ERH because other less-expensive remediation technologies are available and because fuel sites are usually thin (resulting in significant heat losses).
*Sites within landfills are also challenging because metallic debris can distort the electric current paths. ERH is more uniform in natural soil or rock.

== Strengths ==

*ERH is adaptable to all soil types and sedimentary bedrock.  ERH is also effective in both the vadose and saturated zones.  Certain [[Lithology|lithologies]] can limit traditional methods of remediation by preventing a reliable removal/destruction pathway for the contamination of concern. Because electricity can and does travel through any lithology that contains some water, ERH can be effective in any soil type. By forming buoyant steam bubbles during the heating process, ERH creates a carrier gas that transports the contamination of concern up and out of any soil type. ERH is not capable of desiccating the subsurface.  In order for the subsurface to conduct electricity, there must be water present in the subsurface.  Conductivity will cease before the subsurface is desiccated.
*ERH is commonly applied under active buildings or manufacturing facilities.  Electrodes can be installed above grade within a fenced area or below grade to allow for unrestricted surface access to the treatment area.
*Although principally used for contaminant source areas, ERH can be used to achieve low remedial goals such as maximum contaminant levels, [[Maximum Contaminant Level|MCLs]], for drinking water.
*After ERH treatment, elevated subsurface temperatures will slowly cool over a period of months or years and return to ambient.  This period with elevated temperatures is an important part of the remediation process.  The elevated temperatures will enhance [[Bioremediation]], [[hydrolysis]] and iron reductive dehalogenation.

[[File:M1-A1 Abrams Fire.jpg|thumb|240px|A [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]] tank firing its main gun]]

'''Firepower''' is the military capability to direct force at an enemy. (It is not to be confused with the concept of [[rate of fire]], which describes the cycling of the firing mechanism in a [[weapon system]].) Firepower involves the whole range of potential [[weapon]]s. The concept is generally taught as one of the three key principles of [[modern warfare]] wherein the enemy forces are destroyed or have their will to fight negated by sufficient and preferably overwhelming use of force as a result of [[combat operations]].

Through the ages firepower has come to mean offensive power applied from a distance, thus involving [[ranged weapon]]s as opposed to one-on-one [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. ''Firepower'' is thus something employed to keep enemy forces at a range where they can be [[defeat in detail|defeated in detail]] or sapped of the will to continue. In the field of [[naval artillery]], the [[List of broadsides of major World War II ships|weight of a broadside]] was long used{{by whom?|date=June 2015}} as a [[figure of merit]] of a [[warship]]'s firepower.

==History==
The earliest forms of [[warfare]] that might be called ''firepower'' were the [[Sling (weapon)|slinger]]s of ancient armies (a notable example being the biblical story of [[David]]), and [[archery|archers]]. Eventually, the feared [[Hun]]s employed the [[Hun bow|composite bow]] and light [[cavalry tactics]] to shower arrows on the enemy forces, a tactic that also appeared in a less mobile form in Britain, with its famed [[longbowmen]], used during the various Anglo-French conflicts collectively known as the [[Hundred Years' War]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Battle of Crécy]] is often thought of as the beginning of the "age of firepower" in the west, where missile weapons enabled a small force to defeat a numerically superior enemy without the need for single combat. Firepower was later used to dramatic effect in a similar fashion during the [[Battle of Agincourt]].

===Later examples===
Firepower of military units large and small has steadily increased since the introduction of firearms, with technical improvements that have, with some exceptions, diminished the effectiveness of [[fortification]]. Such improvements made [[close order formation]] useless for middle to late 19th century infantry, and the use of [[machine gun]]s early in the 20th stymied [[frontal assault]]s. [[Military uniform]]s changed from gaudy to drab, making soldiers less visible to the increasing firepower. At sea, improved [[naval artillery]] ended the use of [[prize crew]]s, and [[naval aviation]] brought an end to heavily armored [[battleship]]s. 

The use of firepower in achieving military objectives became one of several conflicting schools of military thought, or doctrines. The [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] used massed artillery to help win an Allied victory, but dramatic improvements in siege weapon technology had also gone hand in hand with [[small unit tactics|small scale infantry tactics]].&lt;ref&gt;Berton, Pierre ''Vimy''. See also Morton, Desmond ''When Your Number's Up'' for a discussion of combined arms tactics in the First World War.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operation Desert Storm]] also relied on massed firepower as did the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], but firepower was integrated with advances in small-unit training.

[[Small arms]], such as the [[M249 SAW]], have been employed on a squad level to provide an overwhelming volume of fire in relatively close quarters situations (within 100-300 yds). The idea is that a large volume of accurate  [[suppressive fire]] will immobilize the enemy, degrading their ability to perform. In addition, grenade launchers such as the [[M79 grenade launcher|M79]], and particularly those that can be underslung on an assault rifle, such as the [[M203]] or [[M320]], are used to provide units with a disproportionate amount of firepower. These weapons are useful in situations where a unit is outnumbered and needs to respond immediately with fire superiority, such as in an ambush by forces not similarly equipped.

A '''hat box''' (also  commonly '''hatbox''' and sometimes '''hat bucket''' or '''hat tin''')and occasionally referred to as a bandbox, is a container for storing and transporting headgear, protecting it from damage and dust. A more generic term for a box used to carry garments, including headgear, is a bandbox. Typically, a hat box is deep and round in shape, although it may also be boxlike and used as an item of luggage for transporting a variety of hats.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Brooks Picken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks Picken|first1=Mary|title=A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion: Historic and Modern|date=2010|publisher=Dover Publications|location=United States|isbn=0486402940|pages=170|edition=1999|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbOI4TCcnbQC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=mary+brooks+picken+%2B+mushroom+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=adtoisLpHA&amp;sig=jClnmxD0kdUnA2o22BwdvMRZAYU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fuLHVKrJAo3jaObbgPgF&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20brooks%20picken%20%2B%20mushroom%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hat Tin.jpg|thumb|left|Hat boxes may be made of a variety of materials, including metal]]

The hat box became a popular item in the 19th century – matching the popularity of hats for both day and evening wear – and accessories were produced to assist with both storage and cleaning.&lt;ref name="Vam Top hat box"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top hat|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O78909/top-hat-dunlap-co/|website=vam.ac.uk|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[milliner]]s often packaged designs they sold in cardboard hat boxes, more robust designs were produced for travelling. Some designs were made to store more than one hat – including designs that could store both a daytime [[top hat]] and a collapsible version for evenings, known as a [[gibus]].&lt;ref name="BBC history of the world"/&gt; They might also include storage space for items such as a hat brush.&lt;ref name="Vam Top hat box"/&gt;

Designs became quite large during the Victorian era. A letter to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1844 warned travellers that [[London and Blackwall Railway|Blackwall Railway]]'s porters had charged a [[Penny|1d]] to carry a hat box onto the train and a further 6d for transporting it to the London terminus, with the traveller himself paying only 4d for the journey. He recommended that travellers with luggage should go by steamboat.&lt;ref name="The Times 18720"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blackwall Railway: To the Editor of The Times|issue=18720|publisher=The Times|date=20 September 1844|ref=pg.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clearleft}}
==Design variations==
While traditionally hat boxes are circular or square in shape, some versions may follow the shape of the hat. New York Historical Society archives include a crescent shaped cardboard design thought to be from the early to mid 19th century and attributed to the New York City hatmaker Elisha Bloomer; Canadian archives include a tin design curved to match the [[Tricorne|tricorne-style]] military hat worn by [[Isaac Brock]] and dating from 1812.&lt;ref name="Our Ontario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Historical Society"&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum collections: Luce Center|url=http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/hat-box-2|website=nyhistory.org|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Impinj, Inc.''' is a manufacturer of [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) devices and software. The company was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in [[Seattle]], Washington. The company was started based on the research done at the [[California Institute of Technology]] by [[Carver Mead]] and Chris Diorio.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/business/18edge.html?_r=1|title=The Route From Research to Start-Up|first=James|last=Flanigan|publisher=''New York Times''|date=2007-01-18|accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impinj currently produces [[RFID#EPC Gen2|EPC Class 1, Gen 2]] passive UHF RFID chips, RFID readers, RFID reader chips, and RFID antennas, and software applications for encoding chips, and gathering [[business intelligence]] on RFID systems.

==History==
Impinj was founded in 2000 based on the research of Carver Mead and his student Chris Diorio. The name Impinj stands for "Impact-ionized Hot-electron Injection".&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/06/26/0626adviser.html |title=Carver's Clones | first=George | last=Glider | publisher=''Forbes'' | date=2002-06-26 | accessdate=2010-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, Impinj became the first company to introduce products based on the [[EPCglobal]] UHF Gen 2 standard.&lt;ref name="RFID Journal"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/1482/1/1 | title=Impinj Announces Gen 2 Tags, Reader | first=Mary Catherine|last=O'Connor | first2=Mark | last2=Roberti | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2005-04-04 | accessdate=2010-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIO Insight"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Supply-Chain-Management-and-Logistics/Impinj-Launches-Industrys-First-RFID-Gen-2-System/ | title=Impinj Launches Industry's First RFID Gen 2 System | first=Jacqueline|last=Emigh|publisher=''CIO Insight'' | date=2005-04-04 | accessdate=2010-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Bear Stearns]] reported in 2006 that [[Wal-Mart]] issued contracts to Impinj and [[Alien Technology]], including them as significant suppliers for a total 15,000 RFID readers needed for Wal-Mart stores and distribution centers. The report invited speculation but was not confirmed.&lt;ref name="Supply Chain Digest – Wal-Mart"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.scdigest.com/assets/NewsViews/06-04-13-3.cfm?cid=83&amp;ctype=content | title=RFID News: Wal-Mart, Albertson's, Sign RFID Reader Deals, Bear Sterns Reports | last=SCDigest Editorial Staff | publisher=''Supply Chain Digest'' | date=2006-04-13 | accessdate=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, Impinj created new partnerships in Asia. In February, Impinj signed an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement with the [[Hong Kong]] based company Convergence Systems Limited (subsidiary of the [[Chung Nam Group of Companies]]).&lt;ref name="Convergence Systems Limited"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://convergence.com.hk/news_details.php?id=7 | title=Impinj and Convergence Systems Limited announce OEM licensing agreement for RFID readers | last=SCDigest Editorial Staff | publisher=''Supply Chain Digest'' | date=2006-04-13 | accessdate=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December, Impinj partnered with Korean company LS Industrial Systems (part of [[LS Group]]) to create RFID solutions targeting the Korean market.&lt;ref name="LS Industrial Systems"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.morerfid.com/details.php?subdetail=Report&amp;action=details&amp;report_id=2465&amp;display=RFID |title=LS Industrial Systems and Impinj Partner to Deliver High-Performance Radio Frequency Identification Solutions in Korea | last=SCDigest Editorial Staff | publisher=''Supply Chain Digest'' | date=2006-04-13 | accessdate=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Impinj sold its non-volatile memory business to [[Virage Logic]].&lt;ref name="EE Times2"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4077768/Virage-buys-Impinj-s-memory-IP-business | title=Virage buys Impinj's memory IP business | first=Mark | last=LaPedus | publisher=''EE Times'' | date=2008-06-30 | accessdate=2011-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2008, Impinj acquired the [[Intel]] RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip. Impinj renamed the chip Indy R1000.&lt;ref name="EE Times"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=SDOIJ0AQU3CHZQE1GHPSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=208808307 | title=Impinj acquires Intel's RFID reader chip unit | first=Laurie | last=Sullivan | publisher=''EE Times'' | date=2008-07-10 | accessdate=2010-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/brierdudley/2008043306_brier10.html | title=Intel bet its chips on Impinj growth | first=Brier | last=Dudley | publisher=''Seattle Times'' | date=2008-07-10 | accessdate=2010-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chips will be used in Intel's Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, which will be released in the second half of 2012.&lt;ref name="Impinj Unveils Monza X-2K and X-8K Dura Chips for Electronics Market"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfid24-7.com/2012/05/23/impinj-unveils-monza-x-2k-and-x-8k-dura-chips-for-electronics-market/ | title=Impinj Unveils Monza X-2K and X-8K Dura Chips for Electronics Market | publisher=''RFID24-7'' | date=2012-05-23 | accessdate=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RFID products==

===Monza RFID tag chips===
Introduced in April 2005, Monza tag chips were the first UHF Gen 2 RFID tag chips.&lt;ref name="RFID Gazette"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidgazette.org/2005/11/monza_rfid_chip.html | title=Monza RFID Chips from Impinj, Inc. | publisher=''RFID Gazette'' | date=2005-11-30 | accessdate=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon their introduction, it was announced that Impinj would be selling 50 million Monza tag chips that year. These 50 million chips were sold to nine different companies, including competitors Alien Technology and [[Texas Instruments]].&lt;ref name="EE Times 2"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4055310/Alien-Technology-Impinj-ink-RFID-supply-deal | title=Alien Technology, Impinj ink RFID supply deal | publisher=''EE Times" | date=2005-09-08 | accessdate=2010-08-11
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RFID Gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFID Journal – Monza Sales"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/1855/1/1/ | title=Impinj to Ship 50M Gen 2 Chips in 2005 | first=Mary Catherine|last=O'Connor | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2005-09-08 | accessdate=2010-08-11
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Impinj introduced its Monza 4 tag chips with increased read and write capabilities and more memory options.&lt;ref name="RFID24-7"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfid24-7.com/articles/022210.shtml | title=Impinj unveils Monza® 4 family of tags; enhanced functionality to drive market  | publisher=''RFID24-7" | date=2010-02-23 | accessdate=2011-02-04
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2011, Impinj released their new Monza 5 chips which are designed to speed item-level encoding, with fewer errors.  The Monza 5 can boost encoding speeds by up to 220 percent compared with other RFID technology on the market.&lt;ref name="RFID Journal M5 STP"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/8341 | title=Impinj Launches Products to Speed Item-Level Encoding | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2011-04-05 | accessdate=2011-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Announced in April 2012,&lt;ref name="Impinj Unveils Monza X-2K and X-8K Dura Chips for Electronics Market"/&gt; Impinj's Monza X tag chips are intended for such applications as theft deterrence and wireless device configuration.  When embedded in an electronic device (such as a laptop PC), the device processor or an RFID reader can write to or read data from that device through a Monza X chip, even when the device is powered off.&lt;ref name="A New Tool for Electronics Companies"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/9572 | title=A New Tool for Electronics Companies | first=Jill|last=Gambon | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2012-06-01 | accessdate=07-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Impinj developed the Monza X chips through a partnership with Intel that began in 2005.&lt;ref name="A New Tool for Electronics Companies"/&gt;
Impinj created the Monza X-2K and Monza X-8K Dura chips&lt;ref name="Intel_s_Path_to_RFID"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.impinj.com/Applications/Case_Studies/Intel_s_Path_to_RFID.aspx | title=Intel and the Future of Consumer Electronics | publisher=''Impinj: Applications'' | accessdate=07-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with lockable memory blocks and two independent antennas, which allow the chips to be read by both near field and long range readers.&lt;ref name="A New Tool for Electronics Companies"/&gt;
Intel will be using the Monza X chips in Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, to be released in the second half of 2012.&lt;ref name="Impinj Unveils Monza X-2K and X-8K Dura Chips for Electronics Market"/&gt;

===Speedway RFID readers===
Speedway is a registered trademark of Impinj. Speedway products include Speedway Revolution RFID Reader and Speedway xPortal RFID reader.

The Speedway RFID reader was first introduced in 2005 as the first RFID reader sold by Impinj. Designed to meet the RFID Gen 2 standards, Speedway was one of Impinj's GrandPrix products alongside Monza.&lt;ref name="RFID Journal"/&gt;

The Speedway Revolution RFID reader was introduced in 2009. The Speedway Revolution is 80% smaller than the original Speedway RFID reader, measuring 6.75 x 5.5 x 1&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name="Satellite Technology"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://satellite.tmcnet.com/topics/satellite/articles/62080-impinj-releases-speedway-revolution-reader-deliver-new-standards.htm | title=Impinj Releases Speedway Revolution Reader to Deliver New Standards in RFID Reader Performance | publisher=''Satellite Spotlight'' | date=2009-08-13 | accessdate=2010-08-11

===Indy RFID reader chips===
In 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip which Impinj renamed Indy R1000.&lt;ref name="EE Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Seattle Times" /&gt; By combining many electrical components on one microchip, RFID reader chips can minimize size and costs of RFID readers.&lt;ref name="RFID Journal Intel"&gt;
 {{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/4184 | title=Impinj Acquires Intel's UHF RFID Reader Chip Operation | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2008-07-10 | accessdate=2011-04-13
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, 40 to 50 manufacturers had developed readers using the R1000 chip.&lt;ref name="RFID Journal Intel" /&gt;
In 2009, Impinj unveiled the Indy R2000 reader chip, with increased performance designed for use in high-end readers for more challenging applications.&lt;ref name="RFID Journal R2000"&gt;
 {{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/4847/1 | title=Impinj Adds New Products, Agreements to Its Portfolio | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2009-05-04 | accessdate=2011-04-13
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Impinj further expander their reader chip portfolio by introducing the Indy R500 reader chip, a lower cost chip for applications that don't require high performance.&lt;ref name="RFID Journal R500"&gt;
 {{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/7764/1 | title=Impinj Introduces New, Lower-Cost UHF Reader Chip | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2010-07-29 | accessdate=2011-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===STP Source Tagging Platform===
In 2011, Impinj announced its STP Source Tagging Platform, a combination of a reader and firmware designed for mass encoding of RFID tags.&lt;ref name= "RFID Journal STP"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/8341/  | title=Impinj Launches Products to Speed Item-Level Encoding | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2011-04-05 | accessdate=2011-04-14
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform consists of two systems: bulk encoding for tags already attached to items, or in-line encoding before tags are applied to products.  The STP platform is capable of encoding 1100 tags per minute in the bulk system, and up to 1750 tags per minute using the in-line system.&lt;ref name=" RFID Journal STP" /&gt; In 2012, Impinj announced a version 2 release of the STP platform that will enable brand owners and service bureaus to achieve encoding speeds up to 7,500 tags per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.impinj.com/News_and_Events/Press_Releases/2012/RFID_Chipmakers_Align_on_Industry-wide_Serialization_Schema.aspx  | title=RFID Chipmakers Align on Industry-wide Serialization Schema | publisher=''Impinj'' | date=2012-04-02 | accessdate=2012-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Store Performance Simulator===
Impinj's Store Performance Simulator (SPS), released in June 2012, is a "Web-based analysis tool"&lt;ref name="Impinj Releases RFID Store Performance Simulator"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/9610/ | title=Impinj Releases RFID Store Performance Simulator | first=Mark |last=Roberti | publisher=''RFID Journal'' | date=2012-06-13 | accessdate=2012-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
designed to show retailers how RFID can increase the accuracy of their inventory and positively impact profitability.&lt;ref name="Impinj Releases RFID Store Performance Simulator"/&gt;
A retailer can use SPS's 25 inputs to reflect their particular store and simulate various "what-if" scenarios,&lt;ref name="Impinj Debuts Store Performance Simulator"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfid24-7.com/2012/06/13/impinj-debuts-store-performance-simulator/ | title=Impinj Debuts Store Performance Simulator | publisher=''RFID24-7'' | date=2012-06-13 | accessdate=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1355">An '''integrated standby instrument system''' (ISIS) is an electronic aircraft instrument intended to serve as backup in case of failures in a [[glass cockpit]] instrument system, and thus is designed to operate as reliably and independently as possible from the aircraft's main instrument system, with provisions for backup power, and embedded sensors when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ISIS is designed to combine the functions of separate equivalent mechanical instruments that had previously been included as backup in such cockpits, including [[altimeter]], [[airspeed indicator]], and [[attitude indicator]]. More sophisticated integrated standby systems can include additional functions, such as the [[Rockwell Collins]] Pro Line 21 flight deck fitted to the [[Cessna Citation Excel|Cessna Citation XLS+]], which features a standby navigation display and engine gauges.

Will King founded Knowledge &amp; Merchandising Inc., Ltd. (KMI) the company which owned the King of Shaves brand in 1993.

In 2009, The King of Shaves Company Ltd. was demerged from KMI,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.growingbusiness.co.uk/king-of-shaves-gears-up-for-global-expansion.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memerycrystal.com/Articles/23-06-2009/Memery-Crystal-Advises-New-Client-King-of-Shaves-on-Demerger-from-Knowledge-and-Merchandising-Inc.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714071659/http://www.memerycrystal.com/Articles/23-06-2009/Memery-Crystal-Advises-New-Client-King-of-Shaves-on-Demerger-from-Knowledge-and-Merchandising-Inc.aspx |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company appointed Atul Sharma as CFO and Chris Outram&lt;ref&gt;http://www.occstrategy.com/node/389&lt;/ref&gt; as Non-Executive Chairman of both The King of Shaves Company Ltd. and KMI (now KMI Brands Ltd).

Since 2009, King of Shaves has used a business model similar to that used by Coca-Cola, with a central office controlling research and development, whilst production and point of sale is localised to a specific market.&lt;ref name="model"/&gt; The success of this model has varied. Though in 2009 the company's merchandise was stocked in at least 7 separate countries, from 2007 the turnover went from £13.9 million, to £25 million in 2008, to £10 million by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/markets/article.html?in_article_id=440580&amp;in_page_id=3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/entrepreneur/article2993268.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=On track for top entrepreneurs prize | first=Diana | last=Bentley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bridge | first = Rachel | title = For CEOs, it can be good to talk; THINK TANK | newspaper = The Sunday Telegraph | location = London | pages = 8 | date = 9 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2009, the company announced a "Shaving Bond" issue of up to five thousand £1,000 non-transferable and non-convertible bonds, which was reported in the press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article6557672.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Business big shot Will King King of Shaves | date=23 June 2009 | first=Jenny | last=Booth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Business/King-Of-Shaves-Tries-To-Raise-5-Million-Pounds-By-Issuing-Bonds-To-Customers/Article/200906415315203?lpos=Business_First_Buisness_Article_Teaser_Region_2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15315203_King_Of_Shaves_Tries_To_Raise_5_Million_Pounds_By_Issuing_Bonds_To_Customers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/investing/article.html?in_article_id=487867&amp;in_page_id=166&amp;position=moretopstories&lt;/ref&gt; and described by Will King as being an "innovative way to potentially raise money from up to 5,000 brand enthusiasts". The issue was overseen by FSA regulated accountancy firm [[BDO Stoy Hayward]] with legal advice provided by Memery Crystal LLP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memerycrystal.com/uploaded/Articles/other%20files/Website%20-%20The%20Lawyer%20-%20King%20of%20Shaves.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714072108/http://www.memerycrystal.com/uploaded/Articles/other%20files/Website%20-%20The%20Lawyer%20-%20King%20of%20Shaves.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 The King of Shaves Company signed a multi-year agreement with Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc, owner of Remington branded electrical grooming products, to exclusively distribute King of Shaves products in the USA and Canada. The distribution agreement was dissolved in 2012 after 'breaches of contract' by Spectrum Brands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bridge | first = Sarah | title = King of Shaves reaches fresh US deal | newspaper = Mail on Sunday | location = London | date = 2 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2014 it was announced that Will King would be stepping down as CEO, with Andy Hill appointed as the new CEO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/news/article_page/Will_King_exits_King_of_Shaves/102851&lt;/ref&gt;

==Razors and blades==

King of Shaves launched a 4-blade razor (call the Azor) in the UK in late 2008. They launched a 5-blade razor (called the Azor 5) in the UK in early 2011. The cartridges featured blades manufactured by Kai Industries in Japan (a shareholder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8699942/King-of-Shaves-cuts-Japan-deal.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=James | last=Quinn | title=King of Shaves cuts Japan deal | date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in King of Shaves). The Azor 5 was discontinued in early 2014 and was replaced by the Hyperglide system razor. All the razors have been designed and manufactured in the UK, with cartridges developed in collaboration with Kai.

==Mergers and acquisitions==&lt;!--linked above--&gt;
In March 2008 KMI acquired the issued share capital of Floraroma Ltd., which owns women's toiletries brands including Phil Smith, Delicious Beauty, Dead Sea Source, Little Me, Derma-Mum and Floracologie. In October 2009, KMI acquired the Naked skincare brand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kmibrands.com/news/kmi_gets_a_new_look?from_page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In 2009 the company offered [[savings bond]]s with 6%pa interest rate to consumers. These savings bonds rely on the company's growth in order to fund the returns. This scheme was not covered by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]] and at the time of application consumers were unable to get reports on how well the company was performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|author = JAMES CONEY
|title = WARNING OVER RISKY 'SHAVING BOND'
|quote = But despite being advertised as a savings bond, this scheme actually invests in the King of Shaves company; specifically for the company's marketing. It is NOT a savings account. Essentially, the Shaving Bond is a corporate bond -- but one issued for a non-listed company. Whether you get a return depends on the health of this firm. Your money is locked away for three years. Every six months the company says it will pay you 3pc 'interest' -- which you will have to declare to the taxman.

|quote = In the offer literature, there are risk warnings but no information on the history of the company, no profit and loss account, no balance sheet, and no details on how the bonds would rank in the event of a winding-up. The company has no track record, having only recently been demerged from a larger business. According to Mr King, it hasn't even yet been decided how much bank finance should be apportioned to the new business.  Alas, no rational investor could possibly invest in the bonds on the basis of such sparse data. The upside may be a chunky 6 per cent income (for comparison, mainstream bank three-year bonds now yield about 4 per cent), but the downside is that investors are locked in for three years. They could also lose every neck-stinging penny if King of Shaves were to fail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11283">An '''engineering society''' is a [[professional organization]] for [[engineer]]s of various [[Fields of engineering|disciplines]]. Some are umbrella type organizations which accept many different disciplines, while others are discipline-specific. Many award professional designations, such as [[European Engineer]], [[professional engineer]], [[chartered engineer]], [[incorporated engineer]] or similar. There are also many student-run engineering societies, commonly at universities or technical colleges.

'''Mechanical engineering''' is the discipline that applies [[engineering]], [[Branches of physics|physics]], [[engineering mathematics]], and [[materials science]] principles to [[design]], analyze, manufacture, and maintain [[mechanical system]]s.  It is one of the oldest and broadest of the [[List of engineering branches|engineering disciplines]].

The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including [[mechanics]], [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[materials science]], [[structural analysis]], and [[electricity]].  In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM), and [[product life cycle management]] to design and analyze [[manufacturing plants]], [[industrial equipment]] and [[industrial machinery|machinery]], [[HVAC|heating and cooling systems]], [[transport]] systems, [[aircraft]], [[watercraft]], [[robotics]], [[medical devices]], [[weapons]], and others.  It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of [[machine]]ry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mechanical engineering "mechanical engineering"]. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved: 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mechanical%20engineering "mechanical engineering"]. Webster dictionary. Retrieved: 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world.  In the 19th century, developments in [[physics]] led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as [[composite material|composites]], [[mechatronics]], and [[nanotechnology]].  It also overlaps with [[aerospace engineering]], [[metallurgical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts.  Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of [[biomedical engineering]], specifically with [[biomechanics]], [[transport phenomena]], [[biomechatronics]], [[bionanotechnology]], and modeling of biological systems.

==History==
The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient and medieval societies. In [[ancient Greece]], the works of [[Archimedes]] (287–212 BC) influenced mechanics in the Western tradition and [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD) created the first steam engine ([[Aeolipile]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263417/Heron-of-Alexandria "Heron of Alexandria"]. Encyclopædia Britannica 2010 - Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed: 9 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[History of China#Han Dynasty|China]], [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 AD) improved a [[water clock]] and invented a [[seismometer]], and [[Ma Jun]] (200–265 AD) invented a chariot with [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.  The medieval Chinese horologist and engineer [[Su Song]] (1020–1101 AD) incorporated an [[escapement]] mechanism into his [[astronomical]] [[clock tower]] two centuries before escapement devices were found in medieval European clocks. He also invented the world's first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- More sources needed --&gt;

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (7th to 15th century), [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Muslim inventors]] made remarkable contributions in the field of mechanical technology. [[Al-Jazari]], who was one of them, wrote his famous ''Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'' in 1206 and presented many mechanical designs.

During the 17th century, important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in [[England]].  Sir [[Isaac Newton]] formulated [[Newton's Laws of Motion]] and developed [[Calculus]], the mathematical basis of physics. Newton was reluctant to publish his works for years, but he was finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues, such as Sir [[Edmond Halley]], much to the benefit of all mankind. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] is also credited with creating Calculus during this time period.

During the early 19th century industrial revolution, [[machine tool]]s were developed in England, [[Germany]], and [[Scotland]]. This allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering. They brought with them manufacturing machines and the engines to power them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105842/engineering Engineering] – Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 6 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The first British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]], thirty years after the civil engineers formed the first such professional society [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Buchanan. The [[Economy|Economic]] History Review, New Series, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Feb. 1985), pp. 42–60.&lt;/ref&gt; On the European continent, Johann von Zimmermann (1820–1901) founded the first factory for grinding machines in [[Chemnitz]], Germany in 1848.

In the United States, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) was formed in 1880, becoming the third such professional engineering society, after the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (1852) and the [[American Institute of Mining Engineers]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;[http://anniversary.asme.org/history.shtml ASME history] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223145123/http://anniversary.asme.org/history.shtml |date=23 February 2011 }}, accessed 6 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first schools in the United States to offer an engineering education were the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1817, an institution now known as [[Norwich University]] in 1819, and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1825. Education in mechanical engineering has historically been based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/en/engineer.html The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001, engineering], accessed 6 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|right|[[Archimedes' screw]] was operated by hand and could efficiently raise water, as the animated red ball demonstrates.]]

Degrees in mechanical engineering are offered at various universities worldwide. Mechanical engineering programs typically take four to five years of study and result in a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (B.Eng. or B.E.), [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc. or B.S.), Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.), [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech.), Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (B.M.E.), or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (B.A.Sc.) degree, in or with emphasis in mechanical engineering. In Spain, Portugal and most of South America, where neither B.Sc. nor B.Tech. programs have been adopted, the formal name for the degree is "Mechanical Engineer", and the course work is based on five or six years of training. In Italy the course work is based on five years of education, and training, but in order to qualify as an Engineer one has to pass a state exam at the end of the course. In Greece, the coursework is based on a five-year curriculum and the requirement of a 'Diploma' Thesis, which upon completion a 'Diploma' is awarded rather than a B.Sc.

In [[Australia]], mechanical engineering degrees are awarded as Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical) or similar nomenclature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechanical Engineering|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/csem/disciplines/mecheng/|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are an increasing number of specialisations. The degree takes four years of full-time study to achieve. To ensure quality in engineering degrees, [[Engineers Australia]] accredits engineering degrees awarded by Australian universities in accordance with the global [[Washington Accord]]. Before the degree can be awarded, the student must complete at least 3 months of on the job work experience in an engineering firm.  Similar systems are also present in South Africa and are overseen by the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA).

In the United States, most [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] mechanical engineering programs are [[School accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) to ensure similar course requirements and standards among universities. The ABET web site lists 302 accredited mechanical engineering programs as of 11 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://main.abet.org/aps/Accreditedprogramsearch.aspx ABET searchable database of accredited engineering programs], Accessed 11 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical engineering programs in Canada are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/acc_programs_1.cfm Accredited engineering programs in Canada by the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510053751/http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/acc_programs_1.cfm |date=10 May 2007 }}, Accessed 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and most other countries offering engineering degrees have similar accreditation societies.

In India, to become an engineer, one needs to have an engineering degree like a B.Tech or B.E, have a diploma in engineering, or by completing a course in an engineering trade like fitter from the [[Industrial Training Institute]] (ITIs) to receive a "ITI Trade Certificate" and also pass the All India Trade Test (AITT) with an engineering trade conducted by the National Council of Vocational Training (NCVT) by which one is awarded a "National Trade Certificate".  A similar system is used in Nepal.

Some mechanical engineers go on to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]], [[Master of Technology]], [[Master of Science]], [[Master of Engineering Management]] (M.Eng.Mgt. or M.E.M.), a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in engineering (Eng.D. or Ph.D.) or an [[engineer's degree]]. The master's and engineer's degrees may or may not include [[research]]. The Doctor of Philosophy includes a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-me.mit.edu/GradProgram/GradDegrees.htm Types of post-graduate degrees offered at MIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616010925/http://www-me.mit.edu/GradProgram/GradDegrees.htm |date=16 June 2006 }} - Accessed 19 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Engineer's degree exists at a few institutions at an intermediate level between the master's degree and the doctorate.

===Coursework===
Standards set by each country's accreditation society are intended to provide uniformity in fundamental subject [[material]], promote competence among graduating engineers, and to maintain confidence in the engineering profession as a whole.  Engineering programs in the U.S., for example, are required by ABET to show that their students can "work professionally in both thermal and mechanical systems areas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/Linked%20Documents-UPDATE/Criteria%20and%20PP/E001%2008-09%20EAC%20Criteria%2011-30-07.pdf 2008-2009 ABET Criteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228132456/http://www.abet.org/Linked%20Documents-UPDATE/Criteria%20and%20PP/E001%2008-09%20EAC%20Criteria%2011-30-07.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- A more general source would help here to cover non-US universities --&gt; The specific courses required to graduate, however, may differ from program to program. Universities and [[Institute of technology|Institutes of technology]] will often combine multiple subjects into a single class or split a subject into multiple classes, depending on the faculty available and the university's major area(s) of research.

The fundamental subjects of mechanical engineering usually include:
* [[Mathematics]] (in particular, [[calculus]], [[differential equations]], and [[linear algebra]])
* Basic physical sciences (including physics and [[chemistry]])
* [[Statics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]
* [[Strength of materials]] and [[solid mechanics]]
* [[Materials engineering]], [[Composite material|Composites]]
* [[Thermodynamics]], [[heat transfer]], [[energy conversion]], and [[HVAC]]
* [[Fuels]], [[combustion]], [[Internal combustion engine]]
* [[Fluid mechanics]] (including [[fluid statics]] and [[fluid dynamics]])
* [[Mechanism (engineering)|Mechanism]] and [[Machine (mechanical)|Machine]] design (including [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]])
* [[Instrumentation]] and [[measurement]]
* [[Manufacturing engineering]], technology, or processes
* [[Vibration]], [[control theory]] and [[control engineering]]
* [[Hydraulics]], and [[pneumatics]]
* [[Mechatronics]], and [[robotics]]
* [[Engineering design]] and [[product design]]
* [[Engineering drawing|Drafting]], [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.me.utulsa.edu/Undergraduate.html University of Tulsa Required ME Courses – Undergraduate Majors and Minors] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804111337/http://www.me.utulsa.edu/Undergraduate.html |date=4 August 2012 }}.

Accessed: 19 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical engineers are also expected to understand and be able to apply basic concepts from chemistry, physics, [[chemical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]]. All mechanical engineering programs include multiple semesters of mathematical classes including [[calculus]], and advanced mathematical concepts including [[differential equations]], [[partial differential equations]], [[linear algebra]], [[abstract algebra]], and [[differential geometry]], among others.

In addition to the core mechanical engineering curriculum, many mechanical engineering programs offer more specialized programs and classes, such as [[control systems]], [[robotics]], [[transport]] and [[logistics]], [[cryogenics]], [[fuel]] technology, [[automotive engineering]], [[biomechanics]], [[vibration]], [[optics]] and others, if a separate department does not exist for these subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m2a.html Mechanical Engineering courses], MIT. Accessed 14 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most mechanical engineering programs also require varying amounts of research or community projects to gain practical problem-solving experience. In the United States it is common for mechanical engineering students to complete one or more [[internship]]s while studying, though this is not typically mandated by the university. [[Cooperative education]] is another option.

===License and regulation===
Engineers may seek [[licensing|license]] by a state, provincial, or national government. The purpose of this process is to ensure that engineers possess the necessary technical knowledge, real-world experience, and knowledge of the local legal system to practice engineering at a professional level. Once certified, the engineer is given the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Bangladesh and South Africa), [[Chartered Engineer]] (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Zimbabwe), ''Chartered Professional Engineer'' (in Australia and New Zealand) or ''European Engineer'' (much of the European Union).

In the U.S., to become a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), an engineer must pass the comprehensive FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) exam, work a minimum of 4 years as an ''Engineering Intern (EI)'' or ''Engineer-in-Training (EIT)'', and pass the "Principles and Practice" or PE (Practicing Engineer or Professional Engineer) exams.  The requirements and steps of this process are set forth by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES), a composed of engineering and land surveying licensing boards representing all U.S. states and territories.

In the UK, current graduates require a [[BEng]] plus an appropriate master's degree or an integrated [[MEng]] degree, a minimum of 4 years post graduate on the job competency development, and a peer reviewed project report in the candidates specialty area in order to become a Chartered Mechanical Engineer (CEng, MIMechE) through the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]. CEng MIMechE can also be obtained via an examination route administered by the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In most developed countries, certain engineering tasks, such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, and chemical plants, must be approved by a [[professional engineer]] or a [[chartered engineer]]. "Only a licensed engineer, for instance, may prepare, sign, seal and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or to seal engineering work for public and private clients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Why Get Licensed? |work= National Society of Professional Engineers |url= http://www.nspe.org/Licensure/WhyGetLicensed/index.html |accessdate= 6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement can be written into state and provincial legislation, such as in the Canadian provinces, for example the Ontario or Quebec's Engineer Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineers Act |work=Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) |url=http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html |accessdate=24 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005184956/http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html |archivedate=5 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, such as Australia, and the UK, no such legislation exists; however, practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] independent of legislation, that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codes of Ethics and Conduct |work=Online Ethics Center |url=http://onlineethics.org/codes/ |accessdate=24 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081942/http://onlineethics.org/codes/ |archivedate=19 June 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job duties ==
Mechanical engineers research, design, develop, build, and test mechanical and thermal devices, including tools, engines, and machines.

Mechanical engineers typically do the following:
* Analyze problems to see how mechanical and thermal devices might help solve the problem.
* Design or redesign mechanical and thermal devices using analysis and computer-aided design.
* Develop and test prototypes of devices they design.
* Analyze the test results and change the design as needed.
* Oversee the manufacturing process for the device.

Mechanical engineers design and oversee the manufacturing of many products ranging from medical devices to new batteries.  They also design power-producing machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines as well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and air-conditioning systems.

Like other engineers, mechanical engineers use computers to help create and analyze designs, run simulations and test how a machine is likely to work.

==Salaries and workforce statistics==
The total number of engineers employed in the U.S. in 2015 was roughly 1.6 million. Of these, 278,340 were mechanical engineers (17.28%), the largest discipline by size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#17-0000 |title=May 2015 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics | accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the median annual income of mechanical engineers in the U.S. workforce was $80,580. The median income was highest when working for the government ($92,030), and lowest in education ($57,090).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172141.htm Occupational Employment and Wages, 17-2141 Mechanical Engineers].

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, December 17, 2015.

==Modern tools==
[[File:cad crank.jpg|thumb|250px|An oblique view of a four-cylinder inline crankshaft with pistons]]

Many mechanical engineering companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) programs into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D [[solid modeling]] [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.

Other CAE programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM).

Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian flows]].

As mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in [[mechatronics]], [[multidisciplinary design optimization]] (MDO) is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.  MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems.

==Subdisciplines==
The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section.

===Mechanics===
[[File:Mohrs circle.svg|thumb|250px|[[Mohr's circle]], a common tool to study [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] in a [[mechanical element]]]]
{{main|Mechanics}}

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of [[force]]s and their effect upon [[matter]]. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both [[Elastic Deformation|elastic]] and [[Plastic Deformation|plastic]]) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or [[Stress (physics)|stresses]]. Subdisciplines of mechanics include
* [[Statics]], the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies
* [[dynamics (mechanics)|Dynamics]] the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations).
* [[Mechanics of materials]], the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress
* [[Fluid mechanics]], the study of how fluids react to forces&lt;ref&gt;Note: fluid mechanics can be further split into fluid statics and fluid dynamics, and is itself a subdiscipline of continuum mechanics. The application of fluid mechanics in engineering is called [[hydraulics]] and [[pneumatics]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kinematics]], the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion.  Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]].
* [[Continuum mechanics]], a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than [[wikt:discrete|discrete]])

Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the [[piston]]s and [[cam]]s as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see [[HVAC]]), or to design the [[intake]] system for the engine.

===Mechatronics and robotics===
[[File:FMS1 small.JPG|thumb|Training FMS with learning robot [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]], workbench CNC Mill and CNC Lathe]]
{{main|Mechatronics|Robotics}}

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics.  It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, [[electrical engineering]] and [[software engineering]] that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems.  In this way, machines can be automated through the use of [[electric motor]]s, [[servomechanism|servo-mechanisms]], and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to [[bit]]s. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in [[industrial engineering]]. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ [[assembly lines]] of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run [[Lights out (manufacturing)|by themselves]]. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, [[space exploration]], and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

===Structural analysis===
{{main|Structural analysis|Failure analysis}}

Structural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes: static failure, and fatigue failure. ''Static structural failure'' occurs when, upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed [[plastic deformation|plastically]], depending on the criterion for failure. ''Fatigue failure'' occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading and unloading cycles. Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack on the surface of the object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to cause [[ultimate failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/bohr/mse209/chapter8.htm|title=Chapter 8. Failure|website=www.virginia.edu|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure is not simply defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the perforated top sections of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.

Structural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has occurred, or when designing to prevent failure. Engineers often use online documents and books such as those published by ASM&lt;ref&gt;[http://asmcommunity.asminternational.org/portal/site/asm/ ASM International's site many documents, such as the ''ASM Handbook'' series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901014247/http://asmcommunity.asminternational.org/portal/site/asm/ |date=2007-09-01 }}. [[ASM International (society)|ASM International]].&lt;/ref&gt; to aid them in determining the type of failure and possible causes.

Once theory is applied to a mechanical design, physical testing is often performed to verify calculated results. Structural analysis may be used in an office when designing parts, in the field to analyze failed parts, or in laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests.

===Thermodynamics and thermo-science===
{{main|Thermodynamics}}

[[Thermodynamics]] is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a [[physical system|system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/thermo.html|title=Thermodynamics|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy ([[enthalpy]]) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of [[heat transfer]], [[thermofluids]], and [[energy conversion]]. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design [[engine]]s and [[power plant]]s, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, [[heat exchanger]]s, [[heat sink]]s, [[radiator]]s, [[refrigeration]], [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthubengineering.com/thermodynamics/38344-thermodynamics-integral-part-of-our-life/|title=Applications of Thermodynamics Laws. Carnot, Stirling, Ericsson, Diesel cycles|website=Brighthub Engineering|access-date=2018-09-09|date=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and drafting===
[[File:Mech 2 3D.png|thumb|right|A CAD model of a [[mechanical seal|mechanical double seal]] ]]
{{main|Technical drawing|CNC}}

[[Technical drawing|Drafting]] or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for [[manufacture|manufacturing]] parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solidworks.com/product/solidworks-3d-cad|title=SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD|website=SOLIDWORKS|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09|date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of [[Numerical control#CNC arrives|computer numerically controlled]] (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist [[thermal spray|spray coatings]], surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) and [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD).

==Areas of research==
Mechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient machines and mechanical systems. Some technologies at the cutting edge of mechanical engineering are listed below (see also [[exploratory engineering]]).

===Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)===
Micron-scale mechanical components such as springs, gears, fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as silicon, glass and polymers like [[SU8]]. Examples of [[MEMS]] components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors, modern cell phones, gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications.

===Friction stir welding (FSW)===
{{main|Friction stir welding}}

Friction stir welding, a new type of [[welding]], was discovered in 1991 by [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI).  The innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins materials previously un-weldable, including several [[aluminum]] [[alloy]]s.  It plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets.  Current uses of this technology to date include welding the seams of the aluminum main Space Shuttle external tank, Orion Crew Vehicle test article, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket, armor plating for amphibious assault ships, and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niar.wichita.edu/media/pdf/nationalpublication/Nov2-06.pdf|title=Advances in Friction Stir Welding for Aerospace Applications|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/08/sbir/phase1/SBIR-08-1-A1.02-9322.html?solicitationId=SBIR_08_P1 Proposal Number: 08-1 A1.02-9322] – NASA 2008 SBIR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntefsw.com/military_applications.htm|title=Military Applications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composites===
[[File:Kohlenstofffasermatte.jpg|thumb|Composite cloth consisting of woven carbon fiber]]
{{main|Composite material}}

Composites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately. Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing (and, subsequently, finding applications for) stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce [[weight]], susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors. Carbon fiber reinforced composites, for instance, have been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods.

===Mechatronics===
[[Mechatronics]] is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, [[electronic engineering]], and software engineering. The discipline of mechatronics began as a way to combine mechanical principles with electrical engineering. Mechatronic concepts are used in the majority of electro-mechanical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/what-is-mechatronics-technology|title=What is Mechatronics Technology?|website=www.ecpi.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical electro-mechanical sensors used in mechatronics are strain gauges, thermocouples, and pressure transducers.

===Nanotechnology===
{{main|Nanotechnology}}

At the smallest scales, mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnology—one speculative goal of which is to create a [[molecular assembler]] to build molecules and materials via [[mechanosynthesis]]. For now that goal remains within [[exploratory engineering]].  Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters,&lt;ref&gt;Nilsen, Kyle. (2011) [http://soar.wichita.edu/dspace/handle/10057/3997 "Development of Low Pressure Filter Testing Vessel and Analysis of Electrospun Nanofiber Membranes for Water Treatment"]&lt;/ref&gt; nanofilms,&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanical Characterization of Aluminium Nanofilms'', Microelectronic Engineering, Volume 88, Issue 5, May 2011, pp. 844–847.&lt;/ref&gt; and nanostructures,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cise.columbia.edu/nsec/ Columbia University and National Science Foundation, Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

===Finite element analysis===
{{main|Finite element analysis}}

Finite Element Analysis is a computational tool used to estimate stress, strain, and deflection of solid bodies. It uses a mesh setup with user-defined sizes to measure physical quantities at a node. The more nodes there are, the higher the precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://user.engineering.uiowa.edu/~bme083/lecture/lecture04_020303.pdf|title=Introduction to Finite Element Analysis (FEA) |last=Xia|first=Ting|date=Feb 3, 2003|website=UIOWA Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Sep 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field is not new, as the basis of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Finite Element Method (FEM) dates back to 1941.  But the evolution of computers has made FEA/FEM a viable option for analysis of structural problems. Many commercial codes such as [[NASTRAN]], [[ANSYS]], and [[ABAQUS]] are widely used in industry for research and the design of components. Some 3D modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules.  In the recent times, cloud simulation platforms like [[SimScale]] are becoming more common.

Other techniques such as finite difference method (FDM) and finite-volume method (FVM) are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer, fluid flows, fluid surface interaction, etc.

===Biomechanics===
{{main|Biomechanics}}

Biomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems, such as [[human]]s, [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref&gt;R. McNeill Alexander (2005) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S09609822050090120 "Mechanics of animal movement"], [[Current Biology]] Volume 15, Issue 16, 23 August 2005, pp. R616–R619.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomechanics also aids in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans. Biomechanics is closely related to [[engineering]], because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyze biological systems. Some simple applications of [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] and/or [[materials science]]s can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems.

In the past decade, reverse engineering of materials found in nature such as bone matter has gained funding in academia. The structure of bone matter is optimized for its purpose of bearing a large amount of compressive stress per unit weight. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tensile strength of bone along and across the grain|journal = Journal of Applied Physiology|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 355–360|last=Dempster|first=Coleman|date=August 15, 1960|doi=10.1152/jappl.1961.16.2.355|pmid = 13721810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to replace crude steel with bio-material for structural design.

Over the past decade the [[Finite element method]] (FEM) has also entered the Biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of Biomechanics. FEM has since then established itself as an alternative to [[in vivo]] surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia. The main advantage of Computational Biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;Tsouknidas, A., Savvakis, S., Asaniotis, Y., Anagnostidis, K., Lontos, A., Michailidis, N. (2013) The effect of kyphoplasty parameters on the dynamic load transfer within the lumbar spine considering the response of a bio-realistic spine segment. Clinical Biomechanics 28 (9–10), pp. 949–955.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led FE modelling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g. [[Biospine|BioSpine]]).

===Computational fluid dynamics===
{{main|Computational fluid dynamics}}

Computational fluid dynamics, usually abbreviated as CFD, is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simscale.com/docs/content/simwiki/cfd/whatiscfd.html|title=What is CFD {{!}} Computational Fluid Dynamics? — SimScale Documentation|website=www.simscale.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests.

===Acoustical engineering===
{{main|Acoustical engineering}}

Acoustical engineering is one of many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical engineering is the study of [[Sound]] and [[Vibration]]. These engineers work effectively to reduce [[noise pollution]] in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of unwanted noise. The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. Acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learn.org/articles/What_is_the_Job_Description_of_an_Acoustic_Engineer.html|title=What is the Job Description of an Acoustic Engineer?|work=learn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
[[Manufacturing engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]] and [[automotive engineering]] are grouped with mechanical engineering at times. A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of a few specialized classes.

'''Medical equipment''' (also known as '''armamentarium'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ar·ma·men·tar·i·um|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/armamentarium|publisher=www.thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is designed to aid in the [[diagnosis]], monitoring or treatment of [[medical condition]]s.

==Types==
There are several basic types:
* [[medical diagnosis|Diagnostic]] equipment includes [[medical imaging]] machines, used to aid in diagnosis. Examples are [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] and [[MRI]] machines, [[positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[computed tomography|CT]] scanners, and [[x-ray machine]]s.
* Treatment equipment includes [[infusion pump]]s, medical [[laser]]s and [[LASIK]] surgical machines.
* [[Life support]] equipment is used to ''maintain'' a patient's bodily function.  This includes [[medical ventilator]]s, [[incubator (neonatal)|incubator]]s, [[anaesthetic machine]]s, [[heart-lung machines]], [[ECMO]], and [[dialysis machine]]s.
* [[Medical monitors]] allow medical staff to measure a patient's medical state. Monitors may measure patient vital signs and other parameters including [[ECG]], [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], and [[blood pressure]].
* Medical laboratory equipment automates or helps analyze [[blood]], [[urine]], [[gene]]s, and [[blood gas monitor|dissolved gas]]es in the blood.
* Diagnostic Medical Equipment may also be used in the home for certain purposes, e.g. for the control of [[diabetes]] mellitus
* Therapeutic: physical therapy machines like [[Continuous passive motion|continuous passive range of motion (CPM) machines]]

A [[biomedical equipment technician]] ([[BMET]]) is a vital component of the healthcare delivery system. Employed primarily by hospitals, BMETs are the people responsible for maintaining a facility's medical equipment. BMET mainly act as an interface between doctor and equipment.

[[Image:Monjolo.JPG|right|thumb|300px|'''Monjolo''' in [[Caldas Novas]], [[Goiás]].]]
A '''Monjolo''' is a primitive hydraulic machine, used for the processing and grinding of grains. It was introduced in Brazil by the Portuguese during the colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistagloborural.globo.com/GloboRural/0,6993,EEC1689831-4528,00.html ''Monjolo'' Equipamento rústico para moagem de grãos custa 200 reais, economiza energia, funciona bem e tem vida longa por Gustavo Laredo - Revista Globo Rural]&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used to peel and grind dry beans, resulting in a thicker flour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historiadaagua.ana.gov.br ''A História do Uso da Água no Brasil: Do descobrimento ao Século XX'', um projeto da Agência Nacional de Águas, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is formed by a wooden beam suspended so that the part that supports the [[pestle]] is larger than the other, which ends with a trough. A spout fills the trough with the water, thus raising the pestle. When the trough is full, it lowers the trough, and when the trough spills the water, the beam falls, causing the pestle to hit the [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]]. As such, the monjolo is an important tool for agricultural facilitation.

It is common for rural people to seek to live near a river or stream as a source of water. The monjolo is considered one of the most useful machines for planters of multiple crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/4modos/sd-monjolo.html ''O Monjolo e o Pilão'' por Angelo João Zucconi, editor do projeto TerraBrasileira.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25485">'''Nanochemistry''' is the combination of [[chemistry]] and [[Nanotechnology|nanoscience]]. Nanochemistry is associated with [[synthetic chemistry|synthesis]] of building blocks which are dependent on size, surface, shape and defect properties. Nanochemistry is being used in chemical, materials and physical, science as well as engineering, biological and medical applications. Nanochemistry and other [[Nanotechnology|nanoscience]] fields have the same core concepts but the usages of those concepts are different.

The [[Nano-|nano]] prefix was given to nanochemistry when scientists observed the odd changes on materials when they were in nanometer-scale size. Several chemical modification on nanometer scaled structures, approves effects of being size dependent.

Nanochemistry can be characterized by concepts of size, shape, self-assembly, defects and bio-nano; So the synthesis of any new nano-construct is associated with all these concepts. Nano-construct synthesis is dependent on how the surface, size and shape will lead to self-assembly of the building blocks into the functional structures; they probably have functional defects and might be useful for electronic, [[Photonics|photonic]], medical or [[Bioanalysis|bioanalytical]] problems.

[[Silicon dioxide|Silica]], [[gold]], [[polydimethylsiloxane]], [[cadmium selenide]], [[iron oxide]] and [[carbon]] are materials that show the transformative power of nanochemistry.  Nanochemistry can make the most effective contrast agent of [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] out of [[iron oxide|iron oxide (rust)]] which has the ability of detecting cancers and even killing them at their initial stages. [[Silica|Silica (glass)]] can be used to bend or stop light in its tracks. [[Developing country|Developing countries]] also use [[silicone]] to make the circuits for the fluids to attain developed world's [[pathogen]] detection abilities. Carbon has been used in different shapes and forms and it will become a better choice for electronic materials.

Overall, nanochemistry is not related to the [[Atom|atomic structure]] of compounds. Rather, it is about different ways to transform materials into solutions to solve problems. [[Chemistry]] mainly deals with [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of atoms in the periodic table however nanochemistry brought other degrees of freedom that controls material's behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Concepts of Nanochemistry.|last=Cademartiri|first=Ludovico|last2=Ozin|first2=Geoffrey|publisher=Wiley VCH|year=2009|isbn=978-3527325979|location=Germany|pages=4–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanochemical methods can be used to create carbon nanomaterials such as [[carbon nanotube]]s (CNT), [[graphene]] and [[fullerene]]s which have gained attention in recent years due to their remarkable mechanical and electrical properties.

== Nanotopography ==
[[Nanotopography]] refers to the specific surface features which appear on the nanoscale. In industry, applications of nanotopography typically encompass electrics and artificially produced surface features. However, natural surface features are also included in this definition, such as molecular-level cell interactions and the textured organs of animals and plants. These nanotopographical features in nature serve distinctive purposes that aid in regulation and function of the biotic organism, as nanotopographical features are extremely sensitive in cells.

== Nanolithography ==
[[Nanolithography]] is the process by which nanotopographical etchings are artificially produced on a surface. Many practical applications make use of nanolithography, including [[semiconductor chip]]s in computers. There are many types of nanolithography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanolithography Overview - Definition and Various Nanolithography Techniques|url=http://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1736|website=AZO Nano}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include:

*[[Photolithography]]
*[[Electron-beam lithography|Electron beam lithography (EBL)]]
*[[X-ray lithography]]
*[[Extreme ultraviolet lithography|Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL)]]
*[[Contact lithography|Light coupling nanolithography (LCM)]]
*[[Scanning probe microscope |Scanning probe microscope lithography (SPM)]]
*[[Nanoimprint lithography]]
*[[Dip-Pen nanolithography]]
*[[Soft lithography]]

Each nanolithography technique has varying factors of resolution, time consumption, and cost. There are three basic methods used by nanolithography. One involves using a resist material which acts as a "mask" to cover and protect the areas of the surface that are intended to be smooth. The uncovered portions can now be etched away, with the protective material acting as a stencil. The second method involves directly carving the desired pattern. Etching may involve using a beam of [[quantum particles]], such as electrons or light, or chemical methods such as [[oxidation]] or [[Self-assembled monolayer|SAM's (self-assembled monolayers)]]. The third method places the desired pattern directly on the surface, producing a final product that is ultimately a few nanometers thicker than the original surface. In order to visualize the surface to be fabricated, the surface must be visualized by a nano-resolution microscope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Nanolithography? - How Nanolithography Works?|url=http://wifinotes.com/nanotechnology/what-is-nanolithography.html|website=Wifi Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include the [[Scanning probe microscopy|scanning probe microscope (SPM)]] and the [[atomic force microscope|atomic force microscope (AFM)]]. Both microscopes can also be engaged in processing the final product.

=== SAM's ===
One of the methods of nanolithography is use of self-assembled monolayers (SAM) which develops soft methodology. SAMs are long chain alkanethiolates that are self-assembled on gold surfaces making a well-ordered monolayer films. The advantage of this method is to create a high quality structure with lateral dimensions of 5&amp;nbsp;nm to 500&amp;nbsp;nm. In this methodology a patterned elastomer made of [[Polydimethylsiloxane|polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)]] as a mask is usually used. In order to make a PDMS stamp, the first step is to coat a thin layer of photoresist onto a silicon wafer. The next step is to expose the layer with UV light, and the exposed photoresist is washed away with developer. In order to reduce the thickness of the prepolymer, the patterned master is treated with perfluoroalkyltrichlorosilane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nanochemistry: A Chemical Approach to Nanochemistry|last=Ozin,|first=Geoffery A|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=9781847558954|location=|pages=59–62|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These PDMS elastomers are used to print micron and submicron design chemical inks on both planar and curved surfaces for different purposes.

== Applications ==

=== Medicine ===
One highly researched application of nanochemistry is medicine. A simple skin-care product using the technology of nanochemistry is [[sunscreen]]. Sunscreen contains [[nanoparticles]] of [[zinc oxide]] and [[titanium dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uses of nanoparticles of titanium(IV) oxide (titanium dioxide, TiO2)|url=http://www.docbrown.info/page03/nanochem03.htm|website=Doc Brown's Chemistry Revision Notes NANOCHEMISTRY}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nanochemicals protect the skin against harmful [[UV light]] by absorbing or reflecting the light and prevent the skin from retaining full damage by [[photoexcitation]] of [[electrons]] in the nanoparticle. Effectively, the excitation of the particle blocks skin cells from [[DNA damage]].

==== Drug delivery ====
Emerging methods of drug delivery involving nanotechnological methods can be advantageous by improving increased bodily response, specific targeting, and efficient, non-toxic metabolism. Many nanotechnological methods and materials can be functionalized for drug delivery. Ideal materials employ a controlled-activation nanomaterial to carry a drug cargo into the body. [[Mesoporous silica|Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN)]] have been increasing in research popularity due to its large surface area and flexibility for various individual modifications while demonstrating high resolution performance under imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bharti|first1=Charu|title=Mesoporous silica nanoparticles in target drug delivery system: A review|pmc=4522861|pmid=26258053|doi=10.4103/2230-973X.160844|volume=5|journal=Int J Pharm Investig|pages=124–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activation methods greatly vary across nanoscale drug delivery molecules, but the most commonly used activation method uses specific wavelengths of light to release the cargo. Nanovalve-controlled cargo release uses low intensity light and plasmonic heating to release the cargo in a variation of MSN containing gold molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanovalve-Controlled Cargo Release Activated by Plasmonic Heating|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja301880x|website=American Chemical Society|publisher=Journal of the American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-photon activated photo-transducer (2-NPT) uses near [[Infrared|IR]] wavelengths of light to induce breaking of a [[disulfide bond]] to release the cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zink|first1=Jeffrey|title=Photo-redox activated drug delivery systems operating under two photon excitation in the near-IR|url=http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/schwartz/schwartz_pubs/Nanoscale_6_4652_2014.pdf|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[nanodiamond]]s have demonstrated potential in drug delivery due to non-toxicity, spontaneous absorption through the skin, and ability to enter the [[blood-brain barrier]].

==== Tissue engineering ====
Because cells are very sensitive to nanotopographical features, optimization of surfaces in [[tissue engineering]] has pushed the frontiers towards implantation. Under the appropriate conditions, a carefully crafted 3-dimensional [[Tissue engineering#Scaffolds|scaffold]] is used to direct cell seeds towards artificial organ growth. The 3-D scaffold incorporates various nanoscale factors that control the environment for optimal and appropriate functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langer|first1=Robert|title=Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery and Tissue Engineering: From Discovery to Applications|pmc=2935937|pmid=20726522|doi=10.1021/nl102184c|volume=10|journal=Nano Lett|pages=3223–30|bibcode=2010NanoL..10.3223S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scaffold is an analog of the ''in vivo'' [[extracellular matrix]] ''in vitro'', allowing for successful artificial organ growth by providing the necessary, complex biological factors ''in vitro''. Additional advantages include the possibility of cell expression manipulation, adhesion, and drug delivery.

==== Wounds ====
For abrasions and wounds, nanochemistry has demonstrated applications in improving the healing process. [[Electrospinning]] is a [[polymerization]] method used biologically in tissue engineering, but can be functionalized for wound dressing as well as drug delivery. This produces [[nanofibers]] which encourage [[cell proliferation]], [[antibacterial]] properties, and controlled environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kingshott|first1=Peter|title=Electrospun nanofibers as dressings for chronic wound care|url=http://www.nicast.com/uploadimages/Electrospun_nanofibers_as_dressings_for_chronic%20wound%20care%20advances_challenges_and_future_prospects.pdf|website=Materials Views|publisher=Macromolecular Bioscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties have been created in macroscale; however, nanoscale versions may show improved efficiency due to nanotopographical features. Targeted interfaces between nanofibers and wounds have higher surface area interactions and are advantageously ''in vivo''.

There is evidence certain [[nanoparticles of silver]] are useful to inhibit some [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiang|first=Dong-xi |author2=Qian Chen |author3=Lin Pang |author4=Cong-long Zheng|date=17 September 2011|title=Inhibitory effects of silver nanoparticles on H1N1 influenza A virus in vitro|journal=Journal of Virological Methods|issn=0166-0934|doi=10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.09.003 |volume=178 |pages=137–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New developments in nanochemistry provide a variety of [[nanostructure]] materials with significant properties that are highly controlable. Some of the application of these nanostructure materials include SAMs and [[lithography]], use of [[nanowire]]s in sensors, and nanoenzymes.

=== Electrics ===

==== Nanowire compositions ====

Scientist also devised a large number of [[nanowire]] compositions with controlled length, diameter, doping, and surface structure by using vapor and solution phase strategies. These oriented single crystals are being used in [[semiconductor]] nanowire devices such as [[diodes]], [[transistors]], [[logic circuits]], [[lasers]] and sensors. Since nanowires have one dimensional structure meaning large surface to volume ratio, the diffusion resistance decreases. In addition, their efficiency in electron transport which is due to the quantum confinement effect, make their electrical properties be influenced by minor perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selenoprotein and Mimics|last=Liu|first=Junqiu|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=978-3-642-22236-8|location=|pages=289–302|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, use of these nanowires in [[nanosensor]] elements increases the sensitivity in electrode response. As mentioned above, one dimensionality and chemical flexibility of the semiconductor nanowires make them applicable in nanolasers. Peidong Yang and his co-workers have done some research on room-temperature ultraviolet nanowire nanolasers in which the significant properties of these nanolasers have been mentioned. They have concluded that using short wavelength nanolasers have applications in different fields such as optical computing, information storage, and microanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Michael|year=2001|title=Room Temperature Ultraviolet Nanowire Nanolasers|url=|journal=Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalysis ===

==== Nanoenzymes (or Nanozymes) ====

Nanostructure materials mainly used in nanoparticle-based enzymes have drawn attraction due to the specific properties they show. Very small size of these nanoenzymes (or nanozymes) (1–100&amp;nbsp;nm) have provided them unique optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties. Moreover, the control of surface functionality of nano particles and predictable nanostructure of these small sized enzymes have made them to create a complex structure on their surface which in turn meet the needs of specific applications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aravamudhan|first=Shyam|year=|title=Development of Micro/Nanosensor elements and packaging techniques for oceanography|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

=== Nanodiamonds ===

==== Synthesis ====
Fluorescent nanoparticles have broad applications, but their use into macroscopic arrays allows them to be used efficiently in applications of [[plasmonics]], [[photonics]] and [[quantum]] communications that makes them highly sought after. While there are many methods in assembling nanoparticles array, especially [[gold nanoparticles]], they tend to be weakly bonded to their substrate so it can’t be used for wet chemistry processing steps or [[lithography]]. Nanodiamonds allow for a greater variability in access that can subsequently be used to couple plasmonic waveguides to realize quantum [[Plasmonic Circuitry|plasmonics circuitry]].

[[Nanodiamond]]s can be synthesized by employing nanoscale carbonaceous seeds that are fabricated by a single step using a mask-free electron beam induced position technique to add amine groups to self-assemble nanodiamonds into arrays. The presence of dangling bonds at the nanodiamond surface allows them to be functionalized with a variety of [[ligands]]. The surfaces of these nanodiamonds are terminated with [[carboxylic acid]] groups, enabling their attachment to amine-terminated surfaces through carbodiimide coupling chemistry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kianinia|first=Mehran|last2=Shimoni|first2=Olga|last3=Bendavid|first3=Avi|last4=Schell|first4=Andreas W.|last5=Randolph|first5=Steven J.|last6=Toth|first6=Milos|last7=Aharonovich|first7=Igor|last8=Lobo|first8=Charlene J.|date=2016-01-01|title=Robust, directed assembly of fluorescent nanodiamonds|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/nr/c6nr05419f|journal=Nanoscale|language=en|volume=8|issue=42|doi=10.1039/C6NR05419F|pages=18032–18037|arxiv=1605.05016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process gives a high yield do that this method relies on covalent bonding between the [[amine]] and carboxyl functional groups on amorphous carbon and nanodiamond surfaces in the presence of EDC. Thus unlike gold nanoparticle they can withstand processing and treatment, for many device applications.

==== Fluorescent (nitrogen vacancy) ====
[[Fluorescent]] properties in nanodiamonds arise from the presence of [[Nitrogen-vacancy center|nitrogen vacancy]] (NV) centers, nitrogen atom next to a vacancy.  NV centres can be created by irradiating nanodiamond with high-energy particles (electrons, protons, helium ions), followed by vacuum-annealing at 600–800&amp;nbsp;°C. Irradiation forms vaccines in the diamond structure while vacuum-annealing migrates these vacancies, which will get trapped by nitrogen atoms within the nanodiamond. This process produces two types of NV centers. Two types of NV centers are formed—neutral (NV0) and negatively charged (NV–)—and these have different emission spectra. The NV– centre is of particular interest because it has an ''S'' = 1 spin ground state that can be spin-polarized by optical pumping and manipulated using electron paramagnetic resonance.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemistry.illinois.edu/research/inorganic/seminar_abstracts/2014-2015/Hinman-jj-abstract.pdf|title=Fluorescent Diamonds|last=Hinman|first=Jordan|date=October 28, 2014|website=University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorescent nanodiamonds combine the advantages of semiconductor [[quantum dots]] (small size, high photostability, bright multicolor fluorescence) with biocompatibility, non-toxicity and rich surface chemistry, which means that they have the potential to revolutionize ''in vivo'' imaging application.

==== Drug-delivery and biological compatibility ====
Nanodiamonds have the ability to self-assemble and a wide range of small molecules, proteins antibodies, therapeutics and nucleic acids can bind to its surface allow for drug delivery, protein-mimicking and surgical implants. Other potential biomedical applications are the use of nanodiamonds as a support for solid-phase peptide synthesis and as sorbents for detoxification and separation and fluorescent nanodiamonds for biomedical imaging. Nanodiamonds are capable of biocompatibility, the ability to carry a broad range of therapeutics, dispersibility in water and scalability and thee potential for targeted therapy all properties needed for a drug delivery platform. The small size, stable core, rich surface chemistry, ability to self-assemble and low [[cytotoxicity]] of nanodiamonds have led to suggestions that they could be used to mimic [[globular protein]]s. Nanodiamonds have been mostly studied as potential injectable therapeutic agents for generalized drug delivery, but it has also been shown that films of parylene nanodiamond composites can be used for localized sustained release of drugs over periods ranging from two days to one month.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mochalin|first=Vadym N.|last2=Shenderova|first2=Olga|last3=Ho|first3=Dean|last4=Gogotsi|first4=Yury|date=2012-01-01|title=The properties and applications of nanodiamonds|url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v7/n1/full/nnano.2011.209.html|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=11–23|doi=10.1038/nnano.2011.209|issn=1748-3387|bibcode=2012NatNa...7...11M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nanometer-size clusters ===
Monodispurse, nanometer-size clusters (also known as [[nanoclusters]]) are synthetically grown crystals whose size and structure influence their properties through the effects of [[quantum confinement]]. One method of growing these crystals is through inverse micellar cages in non aqueous solvents.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/other/sand95-2141.pdf|title=Fundamental Science of Nanometer-Size Clusters|last=Wilcoxon|first=J.P.|date=October 1995|website=|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted on the optical properties of MoS&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; nanoclusters compared them to their bulk crystal counterparts and analyzed their absorbance spectra. The analysis reveals that size dependence of the absorbance spectrum by bulk crystals is continuous, whereas the absorbance spectrum of nanoclusters takes on discrete energy levels. This indicates a shift from solid-like to molecular-like behavior which occurs at a reported cluster size of 4.5 – 3.0&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Interest in the magnetic properties of nanoclusters exists due to their potential use in [[magnetic recording]], magnetic fluids, [[permanent magnets]], and [[catalysis]]. Analysis of [[Iron|Fe]] clusters shows behavior consistent with [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[Superparamagnetism|superparamagnetic]] behavior due to strong magnetic interactions within clusters.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Dielectric properties of nanoclusters are also a subject interest due to their possible applications in catalysis, [[photocatalysis]], microcapacitors, [[microelectronics]], and [[nonlinear optics]].

=== Notable researchers ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
There are several researchers in nanochemistry that have been credited with development of the field. [[Geoffrey Ozin|Geoffrey A. Ozin]], from the University of Toronto, is known as one of the "founding fathers of Nanochemistry" due to his four and a half decades of research on this subject. This research includes the study of Matrix isolation laser Raman spectroscopy, naked metal clusters chemistry and [[photochemistry]], nanoporous materials, hybrid [[nanomaterials]], mesoscopic materials, and ultrathin inorganic [[nanowire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nanochemistry Views|last=Ozin|first=Geoffrey|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another chemist who is also viewed as one of nanochemistry's pioneers is [[Charles M. Lieber]] at Harvard University. He is known for his contributions in the development of nano-scale technologies, particularly in the field of biology and medicine. The technologies include nanowires, a new class of quasi-one dimensional materials that have demonstrated superior electrical, optical, mechanical, and thermal properties and can be used potentially as biological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nanowires and Nanobelts: Materials, Properties, and Devices: Volume 2: Nanowires and Nanobelts of Functional Materials|last=Lin Wang|first=Zhong|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=|location=Spring Street, New York, NY 10013, USA|pages=ix|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research under Lieber has delved into the use of nanowires for the purpose of mapping brain activity.

Shimon Weiss, a professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], is known for his research of fluorescent semiconductior nanocrystals, a subclass of [[quantum dot]]s, for the purpose of biological labeling. [[Paul Alivisatos]], from the University of California Berkley, is also notable for his research on the fabrication and use of [[nanocrystal]]s. This research has the potential to develop insight into the mechanisms of small scale particles such as the process of nucleation, cation exchange, and branching. A notable application of these crystals is the development of quantum dots.

[[Peidong Yang]], another researcher from the University of California, Berkley, is also notable for his contributions to the development of 1-dimensional nanostructures. Currently, the Yang group has active research projects in the areas of nanowire photonics, nanowire-based solar cells, nanowires for solar to fuel conversion, nanowire thermoelectrics, nanowire-cell interface, nanocrystal catalysis, nanotube nanofluidics, and [[plasmonics]].

A '''naval mine''' is a self-contained [[explosive]] device placed in water to damage or destroy [[surface ship]]s or [[submarine]]s. Unlike [[depth charge]]s, mines are deposited and left to wait until they are triggered by the approach of, or contact with, any vessel. Naval mines can be used offensively, to hamper enemy shipping movements or lock vessels into a [[harbour]]; or defensively, to protect friendly vessels and create "safe" zones.

==Description==
Mines can be laid in many ways: by purpose-built [[minelayer]]s, refitted ships, submarines, or [[aircraft]]—and even by dropping them into a [[harbour]] by hand. They can be inexpensive: some variants can cost as little as [[United States dollar|US$]]2000, though more sophisticated mines can cost millions of dollars, be equipped with several kinds of sensors, and deliver a [[warhead]] by [[rocket]] or [[torpedo]].

Their flexibility and cost-effectiveness make mines attractive to the less powerful belligerent in [[asymmetric warfare]]. The cost of producing and laying a mine is usually between 0.5% and 10% of the cost of removing it, and it can take up to 200 times as long to clear a minefield as to lay it. Parts of some [[World War II]] naval minefields still exist because they are too extensive and expensive to clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Paul O'Mahony   | title = Swedish navy locates German WWII mines | newspaper = The Local Europe AB | page =   |  date = 16 June 2009 | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20090616/20102 | accessdate = 8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for some of these 1940s-era mines to remain dangerous for many years to come.

Mines have been employed as offensive or defensive weapons in rivers, lakes, estuaries, seas, and oceans, but they can also be used as tools of [[psychological warfare]].&lt;!--Tom Clancy once wrote (in ''Submarine'', IIRC), it doesn't take actual mines to make a minefield, just a press release: just because minesweepers don't find any doesn't mean there aren't any...--&gt; Offensive mines are placed in enemy waters, outside harbours and across important shipping routes with the aim of sinking both merchant and military vessels. Defensive minefields safeguard key stretches of coast from enemy ships and submarines, forcing them into more easily defended areas, or keeping them away from sensitive ones.

Minefields designed for psychological effect are usually placed on [[trade route]]s and are used to stop shipping from reaching an enemy nation. They are often spread thinly, to create an impression of minefields existing across large areas. A single mine inserted strategically on a shipping route can stop maritime movements for days while the entire area is swept.

[[International law]] requires nations to declare when they mine an area, to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines. The warnings do not have to be specific; for example, during World War II, Britain declared simply that it had mined the English Channel, [[North Sea]] and French coast.

In 1812 Russian engineer [[Pavel Shilling]] exploded an underwater mine using an [[electrical circuit]]. In 1854, during the unsuccessful attempt of the Anglo-French fleet to seize the [[Kronshtadt|Kronstadt]] fortress, British steamships HMS ''Merlin'' (9 June 1855, the first successful mining in history), [[HMS Vulture (1843)|HMS ''Vulture'']] and HMS ''Firefly'' suffered damage due to the underwater explosions of Russian naval mines. Russian naval specialists set more than 1500 naval mines, or ''infernal machines'', designed by [[Moritz von Jacobi]] and by [[Immanuel Nobel]],&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Jacobi mine]] was designed by German-born, Russian engineer Jacobi, in 1853. The mine was tied to the sea bottom by an anchor. A cable connected it to a [[galvanic cell]] which powered it from the shore, the power of its explosive charge was equal to {{convert|14|kg}} of [[black powder]]. In the summer of 1853, the production of the mine was approved by the Committee for Mines of the [[Ministry of War of the Russian Empire]]. In 1854, 60 Jacobi mines were laid in the vicinity of the Forts Pavel and [[Fort Alexander (Saint Petersburg)|Alexander]] ([[Kronstadt]]), to deter the [[British Baltic Fleet]] from attacking them. It gradually phased out its direct competitor the [[Nobel mine]] on the insistence of Admiral [[Fyodor Litke]]. The Nobel mines were bought from Swedish industrialist [[Immanuel Nobel]] who had entered into [[collusion]] with Russian head of navy [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov]]. Despite their high cost (100 [[Russian ruble]]s) the Nobel mines proved to be faulty, exploding while being laid, failing to explode or detaching from their wires and drifting uncontrollably, at least 70 of them were subsequently disarmed by the British. In 1855, 301 more Jacobi mines were laid around Krostadt and [[Lisy Nos]]. British ships did not dare to approach them.{{sfn|Tarle|1944|pp=44–45}}

In the 19th century, mines were called [[torpedo]]es, a name probably conferred by [[Robert Fulton]] after the [[torpedo fish]], which gives powerful [[electric shock]]s. A [[spar torpedo]] was a mine attached to a long pole and detonated when the ship carrying it rammed another one and withdrew a safe distance. The submarine {{ship||H. L. Hunley|submarine|2}} used one to sink {{USS|Housatonic|1861|6}} on 17 February 1864. A [[Harvey torpedo]] was a type of floating mine towed alongside a ship and was briefly in service in the [[Royal Navy]] in the 1870s. Other "torpedoes" were attached to ships or propelled themselves. One such weapon called the [[Whitehead torpedo]] after its inventor, caused the word "torpedo" to apply to self-propelled underwater missiles as well as to static devices. These mobile devices were also known as "fish torpedos".

The [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865 also saw the successful use of mines. The first ship sunk by a mine, {{USS|Cairo}}, foundered in 1862 in the [[Yazoo River]]. [[Rear Admiral]] [[David Farragut]]'s famous/apocryphal command during the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] in 1864, "[[Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!]]" refers to a minefield laid at [[Mobile, Alabama]].

After 1865 the United States adopted the mine as its primary weapon for [[Seacoast defense in the United States|coastal defense]]. In the decade following 1868, Major [[Henry Larcom Abbot]] carried out a lengthy set of experiments to design and test [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|moored mines]] that could be exploded on contact or be detonated at will as enemy shipping passed near them. This initial development of mines in the United States took place under the purview of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], which trained officers and men in their use at the [[U.S. Army Engineer School|Engineer School of Application]] at Willets Point, New York (later named [[Fort Totten (Queens)|Fort Totten]]). In 1901 underwater minefields became the responsibility of the US Army's Artillery Corps, and in 1907 this was a founding responsibility of the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdsg.org/coast-artillery-submarine-mine-defenses/|title=Coast Artillery: Submarine Mine Defenses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Imperial Russian Navy]], a pioneer in mine warfare, successfully deployed mines against the [[Ottoman Navy]] during both the Crimean War and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)]].&lt;ref name= Kowner&gt;{{cite book | last = Kowner| first = Rotem|authorlink=Rotem Kowner| year = 2006 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | location = {{ISBN|0-8108-4927-5}} }} page 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major use of mines was during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905. Two mines blew up when the {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1894|2}} struck them near [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]], sending the holed vessel to the bottom and killing the fleet commander, Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]], and most of his crew in the process. The toll inflicted by mines was not confined to the Russians, however. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] lost two battleships, four cruisers, two destroyers and a torpedo-boat to offensively laid mines during the war. Most famously, on May 15, 1904, the Russian [[minelayer]] [[Amur-class minelayer (1898)|''Amur'']] planted a 50-mine minefield off [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]] and succeeded in sinking the Japanese battleships {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hatsuse||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yashima||2}}.

Following the end of the Russo-Japanese War, several nations attempted to have mines banned as weapons of war at the [[Hague Peace Conference (1907)]].&lt;ref name= Kowner/&gt;

Many early mines were fragile and dangerous to handle, as they contained glass containers filled with [[nitroglycerin]] or mechanical devices that activated a blast upon tipping. Several mine-laying ships were destroyed when their cargo exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwideinvention.com/articles/details/312/naval-mine-contained-explosive-device-placed-in-water-to-destroy-ships-or-submarines.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103144718/http://www.worldwideinvention.com/articles/details/312/Naval-mine-contained-explosive-device-placed-in-water-to-destroy-ships-or-submarines.html |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around the start of the 20th century, submarine mines played a major role in the [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|defense of U.S. harbors]] against enemy attack as part of the [[Board of Fortifications|Endicott and Taft Programs]]. The mines employed were controlled mines, anchored to the bottoms of the harbors and detonated under control from large mine [[casemate]]s on shore.

During [[World War I]], mines were used extensively to defend coasts, coastal shipping, ports and naval bases around the globe. The Germans laid mines in shipping lanes to sink merchant and naval vessels serving Britain. The Allies targeted the German U-boats in the Strait of Dover and the Hebrides. In an attempt to seal up the northern exits of the North Sea, the Allies developed the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]]. During a period of five months from June 1918 almost 70,000 mines were laid spanning the North Sea's northern exits. The total number of mines laid in the North Sea, the British East Coast, Straits of Dover, and Heligoland Bight is estimated at 190,000 and the total number during the whole of WWI was 235,000 sea mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaclimate.com/5/pdf/5_14.pdf|title=Climate Change &amp; Naval War—A Scientific Assessment 2005—Trafford on demand publishing, Canada/UK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908115540/https://www.seaclimate.com/5/pdf/5_14.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearing the barrage after the war took 82 ships and five months, working around the clock.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also during World War I, that the naval mine sunk its largest vessel ever, the British [[hospital ship]], HMHS ''[[HMHS Britannic|Britannic]]'', which was the sister ship of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''.

===World War II===
[[File:L L sweeping gear.jpg|thumb|The towed, electric cables of ''Double-L'', magnetic–mine sweeping gear being deployed behind a Royal Navy minesweeper]]
During [[World War II]], the [[U-boat]] fleet, which dominated much of the battle of the Atlantic, was small at the beginning of the war and much of the early action by German forces involved mining [[convoy]] routes and ports around Britain. German submarines also operated in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and along the U.S. coast.

Initially, contact mines—requiring a ship to physically strike a mine to detonate it—were employed, usually tethered at the end of a cable just below the surface of the water. Contact mines usually blew a hole in ships' hulls. By the beginning of World War II, most nations had developed mines that could be dropped from aircraft and floated on the surface, making it possible to lay them in enemy harbours. The use of dredging and nets was effective against this type of mine, but this consumed valuable time and resources, and required harbours to be closed.

Later, some ships survived mine blasts, limping into port with buckled plates and broken backs. This appeared to be due to a new type of mine, detecting ships by their proximity to the mine (an influence mine) and detonating at a distance, causing damage with the shock wave of the explosion. Ships that had successfully run the gauntlet&lt;!-- properly gantlet, not gauntlet --&gt; of the Atlantic crossing were sometimes destroyed entering freshly cleared British harbours. More shipping was being lost than could be replaced, and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] ordered the intact recovery of one of these new mines to be of the highest priority.

The British experienced a stroke of luck in November 1939 when a German mine was dropped from an aircraft onto the mud flats off [[Shoeburyness]] during low tide. Additionally, the land belonged to the army and a base with men and workshops was at hand. Experts were dispatched from [[HMS Vernon]] to investigate the mine. They had some idea that the mines could use magnetic sensors, so everyone removed all metal, including their buttons, and made tools of non-magnetic [[brass]]. They disarmed the mine and rushed it to labs at HMS Vernon, where scientists discovered a new type of arming mechanism. A large ferrous object passing through the Earth's [[magnetic field]] will concentrate the field through it; the mine's detector was designed to trigger as a ship passed over, when its magnetic field was concentrated as measured by the mine. The mechanism had an adjustable sensitivity, calibrated in [[Gauss (unit)|milligauss]]. (As it turned out, the German firing mechanism was overly sensitive, making sweeping easier.)&lt;ref&gt;''The Wizard War''.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. began adding delay counters to their magnetic mines in June 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Parillo, Mark P. ''Japanese Merchant Marine in World War Two'' (Annapolis, Md. : Naval Institute Press, 1993), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dwi wellington front.jpg|thumb|A [[Vickers Wellington]] fitted with a ''DWI'', magnetic mine exploder, [[Ismailia]], Egypt]]
From this data, methods were developed to clear the mines. Early methods included the use of large electromagnets dragged behind ships or below low-flying aircraft (a number of older bombers like the [[Vickers Wellington]] were used for this). Both of these methods had the disadvantage of "sweeping" only a small strip. A better solution was found in the "Double-L Sweep"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodeveCA.net/CFGoodeve/cfg_bio.html#sweep|title= The Double-L Sweep—Biography of Sir Charles Goodeve}}&lt;/ref&gt; using electrical cables dragged behind ships that passed large pulses of current through the seawater. This induced a large magnetic field and swept the entire area between the two ships. The older methods continued to be used in smaller areas. The [[Suez Canal]] continued to be swept by aircraft, for instance. Wartime Japanese sweep methods, by contrast, never advanced much past 1930s standards, and failed entirely to keep up with new American mines,&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.200"&gt;Parillo, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; clearing no more than 15% of all the mines laid in Japan's coastal waters.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.200"/&gt; Moreover, IJN's minesweeping force was far too small with 350 ships, and 20,000 men.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.201"&gt;Parillo, p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--RN ''lost'' that many 'sweepers for the duration!--&gt;

While these methods were useful for clearing mines from local ports, they were of little or no use for enemy-controlled areas. These were typically visited by warships, and the majority of the fleet then underwent a massive [[Degaussing#Ships.27 hulls|degaussing]] process, where their hulls had a slight "south" bias induced into them which offset the concentration effect almost to zero.

Initially, major warships and large troopships had a copper ''degaussing coil'' fitted around the perimeter of the hull, energized by the ship's electrical system whenever in suspected magnetic-mined waters. Some of the first to be so fitted were the [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] and the liners {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}. This was felt to be impracticable for the myriad of smaller warships and merchant vessels, mainly because the ships lacked the generating capacity to energise such a coil. It was found that "wiping" a current-carrying cable up and down a ship's hull&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodeveCA.net/CFGoodeve/cfg_bio.html#wipe|title= Wiping—Biography of Sir Charles Goodeve}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily cancelled the ships' magnetic signature sufficiently to nullify the threat. This started in late 1939, and by 1940 merchant vessels and the smaller British warships were largely immune for a few months at a time until they once again built up a field. Many of the boats that sailed to [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]] were degaussed in a marathon four-day effort by degaussing stations.

The Allies deployed acoustic mines, against which even wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed ships (in particular [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s) remained vulnerable.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.200"/&gt; Japan developed sonic generators to sweep these; the gear was not ready by war's end.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.200"/&gt; The primary method Japan used was small air-delivered bombs. This was profligate and ineffectual; used against acoustic mines at [[Penang]], 200 bombs were needed to detonate just 13 mines.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.200"/&gt;

The Germans had also developed a pressure-activated mine and planned to deploy it as well, but they saved it for later use when it became clear the British had defeated the magnetic system. The U.S. also deployed these, adding "counters" which would allow a variable number of ships to pass unharmed before detonating.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.200"/&gt; This made them a great deal harder to sweep.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.200"/&gt; Japan's antiquated sweep methods, lifting mines in nets, accidentally proved useful against these mines; it remained too slow and hazardous to be truly effective, especially in light of the high numbers being laid.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.201"/&gt;

Mining campaigns could have devastating consequences. The U.S. effort against Japan, for instance, closed major ports, such as [[Hiroshima]], for days,&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.201"/&gt; and by the end of the Pacific War had cut the amount of freight passing through [[Kobe]]–[[Yokohama]] by 90%.&lt;ref name="Parillo, p.201"/&gt;

When the war ended, more than 25,000 U.S.-laid mines were still in place, and the Navy proved unable to sweep them all, limiting efforts to critical areas.&lt;ref name="Gilbert, p.5"&gt;Gilbert, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; After sweeping for almost a year, in May 1946, the Navy abandoned the effort with 13,000 mines still unswept.&lt;ref name="Gilbert, p.5"/&gt; Over the next thirty years, more than 500 minesweepers (of a variety of types) were damaged or sunk clearing them.&lt;ref name="Gilbert, p.5"/&gt;

===Cold War era===
[[File:Ffg58minedamage2.jpg|thumb|In 1988, an Iranian M-08 mine made a {{convert|25|ft|m|0|adj=on}} hole in the hull of the frigate {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}}, forcing the ship to seek temporary repairs in a [[dry dock]] in [[Dubai|Dubai, UAE]].]]
Since [[World War II]], mines have damaged 14 [[United States Navy]] ships, whereas air and missile attacks have damaged four. During the [[Korean War]], mines laid by North Korean forces caused 70% of the casualties suffered by U.S. naval vessels and caused 4 sinkings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/m/mine-warfare.html |title=Mine Warfare |first=Edward J. |last=Marolda |publisher=U.S. Naval History &amp; Heritage Command |date=2003-08-26 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] from 1980 to 1988, the belligerents mined several areas of the [[Persian Gulf]] and nearby waters. On 24 July 1987, the supertanker [[Bridgeton incident|''SS'' Bridgeton was mined]] by Iran near Farsi Island. On 14 April 1988, {{USS|Samuel B.

== Types ==
[[File:Types of Naval mine 001.svg|thumb|Types of naval mines: A-underwater, B-bottom, SS-submarine. 1-drifting mine, 2-drifting mine, 3-moored mine, 4-moored mine (short wire), 5-bottom mines, 6-torpedo mine/CAPTOR mine, 7-rising mine]]
Naval mines may be classified into three major groups; contact, remote and influence mines.

=== Contact mines ===
The earliest mines were usually of this type. They are still used today, as they are extremely low cost compared to any other anti-ship weapon and are effective, both as a psychological weapon and as a method to sink enemy ships. Contact mines need to be touched by the target before they detonate, limiting the damage to the direct effects of the explosion and usually affecting only the vessel that triggers them.

Early mines had mechanical mechanisms to detonate them, but these were superseded in the 1870s by the "Hertz horn" (or "chemical horn"), which was found to work reliably even after the mine had been in the sea for several years. The mine's upper half is studded with hollow lead protuberances, each containing a glass vial filled with [[sulfuric acid]]. When a ship's hull crushes the metal horn, it cracks the vial inside it, allowing the acid to run down a tube and into a [[lead–acid battery]] which until then contained no acid electrolyte. This energizes the battery, which detonates the explosive.&lt;ref name="hartshorn.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartshorn.us/Navy/navy-mines-01.htm |title=Moored-contact |first=Derick S. |last=Hartshorn |publisher=Mineman Memories |date=2010-04-17 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier forms of the detonator employed a vial of sulfuric acid surrounded by a mixture of [[potassium perchlorate]] and sugar. When the vial was crushed, the acid ignited the perchlorate-sugar mix, and the resulting flame ignited the gunpowder charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Russian Rockefellers: the Saga of the Nobel Family and the Russian Oil Industry |last=Tolf |first=Robert W. |year=1982 |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |isbn=978-0-8179-6581-5 |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial period of World War I, the Royal Navy used contact mines in the English Channel and later in large areas of the North Sea to hinder patrols by German submarines. Later, the American antenna mine was widely used because submarines could be at any depth from the surface to the seabed. This type of mine had a copper wire attached to a buoy that floated above the explosive charge which was weighted to the seabed with a steel cable. If a submarine's steel hull touched the copper wire, the slight voltage change caused by contact between two dissimilar metals was amplified{{clarify|reason=amplified by what?|date=December 2015}} and detonated the explosives.&lt;ref name="hartshorn.us"/&gt;

==== Limpet mines ====
{{Main|Limpet mine}}
Limpet mines are a special form of contact mine that are manually attached to the target by magnets and remain in place. They are named because of the similarity to the [[limpet]], a [[mollusk]].

====Moored contact mines====
[[Image:Mine (AWM 304925).jpg|thumb|A German contact mine laid in [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|Australian waters]] during World War II]]

Generally, this mine type is set to float just below the surface of the water or as deep as five meters. A steel cable connecting the mine to an anchor on the seabed prevents it from drifting away. The explosive and detonating mechanism is contained in a buoyant metal or plastic shell. The depth below the surface at which the mine floats can be set so that only deep draft vessels such as aircraft carriers, battleships or large cargo ships are at risk, saving the mine from being used on a less valuable target. In [[littoral]] waters it is important to ensure that the mine does not become visible when the sea level falls at low tide, so the cable length is adjusted to take account of tides. During WWII there were mines that could be moored in 300m-deep water (Example: The  [http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/USNavyMuseum/MinesTorpedoesDepthCharges/pages/10Mk6MooredMine.htm U.S. Mark 6]).

Floating mines typically have a mass of around 200&amp;nbsp;kg, including 80&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives e.g. [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[Minol (explosive)|minol]] or [[amatol]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==== Drifting contact mines ====
Drifting mines were occasionally used during World War I and World War II. However, they were more feared than effective. Sometimes floating mines break from their moorings and become drifting mines; modern mines are designed to deactivate in this event. After several years at sea, the deactivation mechanism might not function as intended and the mines may remain live. [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Jellicoe]]'s British fleet did not pursue and destroy the outnumbered German High Seas Fleet when it turned away at the [[Battle of Jutland]] because he thought they were leading him into a trap: he believed it possible that the Germans were either leaving floating mines in their wake, or were drawing him towards submarines, although neither of these was the case.

After World War I the drifting contact mine was banned, but was occasionally used during World War II. The drifting mines were much harder to remove than tethered mines after the war, and they caused about the same damage to both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.strausscenter.org/hormuz/mines.html|title=Mines - Hormuz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill promoted "[[Operation Royal Marine]]" in 1940 and again in 1944 where floating mines were put into the [[Rhine]] in France to float down the river, becoming active after a time calculated to be long enough to reach German territory.

===Remotely controlled mines===
Frequently used in combination with coastal artillery and hydrophones, [[controlled mines]] (or command detonation mines) can be in place in peacetime, which is a huge advantage in blocking important shipping routes. The mines can usually be turned into "normal" mines with a switch (which prevents the enemy from simply capturing the controlling station and deactivating the mines), detonated on a signal or be allowed to detonate on their own. The earliest ones were developed around 1812 by [[Robert Fulton]]. The first remotely controlled mines were moored mines used in the American Civil War, detonated electrically from shore. They were considered superior to contact mines because they did not put friendly shipping at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=19kDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA813&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sXYNTvyADIGLsAK8pbSRCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true  "How Mines Help Guard America's Harbors"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern examples usually weigh {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives (TNT or hexatonal).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Influence mines===
[[File:Luftmine (LM).jpg|thumb|upright|German parachute-retarded magnetic mine. Dropped by [[Luftwaffe]] bomber during WWII and landed on the ground. Fuze mechanisms are visible]]
These mines are triggered by the influence of a ship or submarine, rather than direct contact. Such mines incorporate [[Electronics|electronic]] sensors designed to detect the presence of a vessel and [[detonate]] when it comes within the [[explosion|blast]] range of the [[warhead]]. The fuzes on such mines may incorporate one or more of the following sensors: [[magnetic]], passive [[Acoustic signature|acoustic]] or water [[pressure]] displacement caused by the proximity of a vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld001.htm |title=Title Slide |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 1 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;

First used during WWI, their use became more general in WWII. The sophistication of influence mine fuzes has increased considerably over the years as first [[transistor]]s and then [[microprocessor]]s have been incorporated into designs. Simple magnetic sensors have been superseded by total-field [[magnetometer]]s. Whereas early magnetic mine fuzes would respond only to changes in a single component of a target vessel's magnetic field, a total field magnetometer responds to changes in the magnitude of the total background field (thus enabling it to better detect even degaussed ships). Similarly, the original broadband [[hydrophone]]s of 1940s acoustic mines (which operate on the integrated volume of all frequencies) have been replaced by narrow-band sensors which are much more sensitive and selective. Mines can now be programmed to listen for highly specific [[acoustic signature]]s (e.g. a [[gas turbine]] powerplant or [[cavitation]] sounds from a particular design of [[Screw propeller|propeller]]) and ignore all others. The sophistication of modern electronic mine fuzes incorporating these [[digital signal processing]] capabilities makes it much more difficult to detonate the mine with [[electronic countermeasures]] because several sensors working together (e.g. magnetic, passive acoustic and water pressure) allow it to ignore signals which are not recognised as being the unique signature of an intended target vessel.&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld017.htm |title=World War II |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 17 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern influence mines such as the [[Stonefish (mine)|BAE Stonefish]] are [[embedded computer system|computerised]], with all the programmability this implies, such as the ability to quickly load new [[acoustic signature]]s into fuzes, or program them to detect a single, highly distinctive target signature. In this way, a mine with a passive acoustic fuze can be programmed to ignore all friendly vessels and small enemy vessels, only detonating when a very large enemy target passes over it. Alternatively, the mine can be programmed specifically to ignore all surface vessels regardless of size and exclusively target submarines.

Even as far back as WWII it was possible to incorporate a "ship counter" function in mine fuzes. This might set the mine to ignore the first two ships passing over it (which could be minesweepers deliberately trying to trigger mines) but detonate when the third ship passes overhead, which could be a high-value target such as an [[aircraft carrier]] or [[oil tanker]]. Even though modern mines are generally powered by a long life [[lithium battery]], it is important to conserve power because they may need to remain active for months or even years. For this reason, most influence mines are designed to remain in a semi-dormant state until an unpowered (e.g. deflection of a [[mu-metal]] [[magnetic compass|needle]]) or low-powered sensor detects the possible presence of a vessel, at which point the mine fuze powers up fully and the passive acoustic sensors will begin to operate for some minutes. It is possible to program computerised mines to delay activation for days or weeks after being laid. Similarly, they can be programmed to [[self-destruct]] or render themselves safe after a preset period of time. Generally, the more sophisticated the mine design, the more likely it is to have some form of [[anti-handling device]] to hinder clearance by divers or remotely piloted submersibles.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld031.htm |title=Mechanism |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 31 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moored mines====
The moored mine is the backbone of modern mine systems. They are deployed where water is too deep for bottom mines. They can use several kinds of instruments to detect an enemy, usually a combination of acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors, or more sophisticated optical shadows or electro potential sensors. These cost many times more than contact mines. Moored mines are effective against most kinds of ships. As they are cheaper than other anti-ship weapons they can be deployed in large numbers, making them useful [[area denial]] or "channelizing" weapons.
Moored mines usually have lifetimes of more than 10 years, and some almost unlimited. These mines usually weigh {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives ([[RDX]]). In excess of {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives the mine becomes inefficient, as it becomes too large to handle and the extra explosives add little to the mine's effectiveness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Bottom mines====
Bottom mines are used when the water is no more than {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep or when mining for submarines down to around {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. They are much harder to detect and sweep, and can carry a much larger warhead than a moored mine. Bottom mines commonly utilize multiple types of sensors, which are less sensitive to sweeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld033.htm|title=Influence Mines |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 33 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;

These mines usually weigh between {{convert|150|and|1500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including between {{convert|125|and|1,400|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld040.htm|title=Russian UDM-E Bottom Cylindrical |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 40 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unusual mines===
Several specialized mines have been developed for other purposes than the common minefield.

====Bouquet mine====
The bouquet mine is a single anchor attached to several floating mines. It is designed so that when one mine is swept or detonated, another takes its place. It is a very sensitive construction and lacks reliability.

====Anti-sweep mine====
The anti-sweep mine is a very small mine (40&amp;nbsp;kg warhead) with as small a floating device as possible. When the wire of a mine sweep hits the mine, it sinks, letting the sweep wire drag along the anchoring wire of the mine until the sweep hits the mine. That detonates the mine and cuts the sweeping wire. They are very cheap and usually used in combination with other mines in a minefield to make sweeping more difficult. One type is the Mark 23 used by the United States during World War II.

====Oscillating mine====
The mine is hydrostatically controlled to maintain a pre-set depth below the water's surface independently of the rise and fall of the tide.

====Ascending mine====
The ascending mine is a floating distance mine that may cut its mooring or in some other way float higher when it detects a target. It lets a single floating mine cover a much larger depth range.

====Homing mines====
[[Image:Mark 60 CAPTOR-DF-ST-90-11649.JPEG|thumb|A CAPTOR mine being loaded onto a [[B-52 Stratofortress]] at [[Loring Air Force Base]]]]These are mines containing a moving weapon as a warhead, either a torpedo or a [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]].

[[Rocket mine]]: a Russian invention, the rocket mine is a bottom distance mine that fires a homing high-speed rocket (not torpedo) upwards towards the target. It is intended to allow a bottom mine to attack surface ships as well as submarines from a greater depth. One type is the [[Te-1 rocket propelled mine]].

[[Torpedo mine]]: the torpedo mine is a self-propelled variety, able to lie in wait for a target and then pursue it e.g. the [[Mark 60 CAPTOR]]. Generally, torpedo mines incorporate [[embedded computer system|computerised]] acoustic and magnetic fuzes. The U.S. Mark 24 "mine", code-named [[Mark 24 Mine|Fido]], was actually an [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] [[homing torpedo]]. The mine designation was disinformation to conceal its function.

====Mobile mine====
The mine is propelled to its intended position by propulsion equipment such as a torpedo. After reaching its destination, it sinks to the seabed and operates like a standard mine. It differs from the homing mine in that its mobile stage is before it lays in wait, rather than as part of the attacking phase.

One such design is the Mk 67 submarine launched mobile mine&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/mk-67.htm MK 67 Submarine-Laid Mobile Mine (SLMM)]. Fas.org. Retrieved on 2010-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; (which is based on a [[Mark 37 torpedo]]) are capable of travelling as far as 10 miles through or into a channel, harbor, shallow water area and other zones which would normally be inaccessible to craft laying the device. After reaching the target area they sink to the sea bed and act like conventionally laid influence mines.

====Nuclear mine====
During the Cold War a test was conducted with naval mine fitted with tactical nuclear warheads for the "Baker" shot of [[Operation Crossroads]]. This weapon was experimental and never went into production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalminewarfare.com/ |title=Australian Mine Warfare |first=Cameron |last=Stewart |work=Naval Mine Warfare |publisher=Naval Mine Warfare |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some reports that North Korea may be developing a nuclear mine &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jon Rabiroff |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-military-enters-new-generation-of-sea-mine-warfare-1.143170 |title=U.S. military enters new generation of sea mine warfare – News |publisher=Stripes |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seabed Arms Control Treaty]] prohibits the placement of nuclear weapons on the seabed beyond a 12-mile coast zone.

====Daisy-chained mine====
This comprises two moored, floating contact mines which are tethered together by a length of steel cable or chain. Typically, each mine is situated approximately {{convert|60|ft|m}} away from its neighbour, and each floats a few metres below the surface of the ocean. When the target ship hits the steel cable, the mines on either side are drawn down the side of the ship's hull, exploding on contact. In this manner it is almost impossible for target ships to pass safely between two individually moored mines. Daisy-chained mines are a very simple concept which was used during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Dummy mine====
Plastic drums filled with sand or concrete are periodically rolled off the side of ships as real mines are laid in large mine-fields. These inexpensive false targets (designed to be of a similar shape and size as genuine mines) are intended to slow down the process of mine clearance: a mine-hunter is forced to investigate each suspicious sonar contact on the sea bed, whether it is real or not. Often a maker of naval mines will provide both training and dummy versions of their mines.&lt;ref name="MN103-MANTA Sea Mines"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716034740/http://www.sei-spa.com/mantaing.html |url=http://www.sei-spa.com/mantaing.html |title=MN103-MANTA Sea Mines |publisher=Sei Spa |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically several methods were used to lay mines. During WWI and WWII, the Germans used [[U-boat]]s to lay mines around the UK. In WWII, aircraft came into favour for mine laying with one of the largest examples being the mining of the Japanese sea routes in [[Operation Starvation]].

Laying a minefield is a relatively fast process with specialized ships, which is today the most common method. These minelayers can carry several thousand mines{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and manoeuvre with high precision. The mines are dropped at predefined intervals into the water behind the ship. Each mine is recorded for later clearing, but it is not unusual for these records to be lost together with the ships. Therefore, many countries demand that all mining operations be planned on land and records kept so that the mines can later be recovered more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinodefence.com/navy/support/wolei.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809221420/http://www.sinodefence.com/navy/support/wolei.asp |title=Type 918 (Wolei Class) Minelayer |archivedate=2010-08-09 |work=Naval Forces: Vessels |publisher=SinoDefence.com |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods to lay minefields include:

*Converted merchant ships – rolled or slid down ramps
*Aircraft – descent to the water is slowed by a parachute
*Submarines – launched from [[torpedo]] tubes or deployed from specialized mine racks on the sides of the submarine
*Combat boats – rolled off the side of the boat
*Camouflaged boats – masquerading as fishing boats
*Dropping from the shore – typically smaller, shallow-water mines
*Attack divers – smaller shallow-water mines

In some cases, mines are automatically activated upon contact with the water. In others, a safety [[lanyard]] is pulled (one end attached to the rail of a ship, aircraft or torpedo tube) which starts an automatic timer countdown before the arming process is complete. Typically, the automatic safety-arming process takes some minutes to complete. This allows the people laying the mines sufficient time to move out of its activation and blast zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnance.org/Mines.htm |title=Aircraft-Laid Mines |work=Mines |publisher=The Ordnance Shop |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerial mining in World War II===

====Germany====
In the 1930s, Germany had experimented with the laying of mines by aircraft. It became a crucial element in their overall mining strategy. Aircraft had the advantage of speed, and they would never get caught in their own minefields. German mines held a large {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} explosive charge. From April to June 1940, the Luftwaffe laid 1,000 mines in British waters. Soviet ports were mined, as was the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy route to Murmansk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Development of Mine Warfare: A Most Murderous and Barbarous Conduct |last=Youngblood |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=0-275-98419-2 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Heinkel He 115]] could carry two medium or one large mine while the [[Heinkel He 59]], [[Dornier Do 18]], [[Junkers Ju 88]] and [[Heinkel He 111]] could carry more.

====Soviet Union====
The USSR was relatively ineffective in its use of naval mines in WWII in comparison with its record in previous wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mine Warfare At Sea |last=Levie |first=Howard S. |year=1992 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-7923-1526-X |page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small mines were developed for use in rivers and lakes, and special mines for shallow water. A very large chemical mine was designed to sink through ice with the aid of a melting compound. Special aerial mine designs finally arrived in 1943–1944, the [[AMD-500]] and [[AMD-1000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusnavy.com/history/io7.htm |title=Rusnavy.com. '&amp;#39;The Soviet Navy at the Outbreak and During the Great Patriotic War: Introduction'&amp;#39; |publisher=Rusnavy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Soviet Naval Aviation]] torpedo bombers were pressed into the role of aerial mining in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]], including [[Ilyushin DB-3]]s, [[Ilyushin Il-4|Il-4]]s and [[Lend Lease]] [[A-20 Havoc|Douglas Boston III]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.j-aircraft.com/research/George_Mellinger/soviet_order_of_battle.htm |title=George Mellinger.

====United Kingdom====
In September 1939, the UK announced the placement of extensive defensive minefields in waters surrounding the Home Islands. Offensive aerial mining operations began in April 1940 when 38 mines were laid at each of these locations: the [[Elbe River]], the port of [[Lübeck]] and the German naval base at [[Kiel]]. In the next 20 months, mines delivered by aircraft sank or damaged 164 Axis ships with the loss of 94 aircraft. By comparison, direct aerial attacks on Axis shipping had sunk or damaged 105 vessels at a cost of 373 aircraft lost. The advantage of aerial mining became clear, and the UK prepared for it. A total of 48,000 aerial mines were laid by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Development of Mine Warfare: A Most Murderous and Barbarous Conduct |last=Youngblood |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=0-275-98419-2 |pages=129–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The United States' early aerial mining efforts used smaller aircraft unable to carry many mines. Using [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers, the US Navy mounted a direct aerial mining attack on enemy shipping in [[Palau]] on 30 March 1944 in concert with simultaneous conventional bombing and strafing attacks. The dropping of 78 mines stopped 32 Japanese ships from escaping [[Koror]] harbor; the combined operation sank or damaged 36 ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/pwrh/peleliu/appa.htm National Park Service. ''Peleliu''. Appendices.]&lt;/ref&gt; Two Avengers were lost, and their crews were recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Development of Mine Warfare: A Most Murderous and Barbarous Conduct |last=Youngblood |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=0-275-98419-2 |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mines brought port usage to a halt for 20 days; further mine laying in the area contributed to the Japanese abandoning Palau as a base.&lt;ref name="Diane"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mines Away!: The Significance of US Army Air Forces Minelaying in World War II |year=1992 |publisher=Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1942, American mining experts such as Naval Ordnance Laboratory scientist Dr. Ellis A. Johnson, CDR USNR, suggested massive aerial mining operations against Japan's "outer zone" (Korea and northern China) as well as the "inner zone", their [[Japanese Archipelago|home islands]]. First, aerial mines would have to be developed further and manufactured in large numbers. Second, laying the mines would require a sizable air group. The [[US Army Air Forces]] had the carrying capacity but considered mining to be the navy's job. The US Navy lacked suitable aircraft. Johnson set about convincing General [[Curtis LeMay]] of the efficacy of heavy bombers laying aerial mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spying Without Spies: Origins of America's Secret Nuclear Surveillance System |last=Ziegler |first=Charles A. |year=1995 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=0-275-95049-2 |page=118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, [[B-24 Liberator]]s, [[PBY Catalina]]s and other bomber aircraft took part in localized mining operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]] and the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India (CBI)]] theaters, beginning with a successful attack on the [[Yangon River]] in February 1943. Aerial minelaying operations involved a coalition of British, Australian and American aircrews, with the RAF and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) carrying out 60% of the sorties and the USAAF and US Navy covering 40%. Both British and American mines were used. Japanese merchant shipping suffered tremendous losses, while Japanese mine sweeping forces were spread too thin attending to far-flung ports and extensive coastlines. Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]], who directed nearly all RAAF mining operations in CBI, heartily endorsed aerial mining, writing in July 1944 that "aerial mining operations were of the order of 100 times as destructive to the enemy as an equal number of bombing missions against land targets."&lt;ref name="Diane"/&gt;

In March 1945, Operation Starvation began in earnest, using 160 of LeMay's B-29 Superfortress bombers to attack Japan's inner zone. Almost half of the mines were the US-built Mark 25 model, carrying 1250&amp;nbsp;lbs of explosives and weighing about 2,000&amp;nbsp;lbs. Other mines used included the smaller 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb Mark 26.&lt;ref name="Diane"/&gt; Fifteen B-29s were lost while 293 Japanese merchant ships were sunk or damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/USSBS/USSBS.pdf |title=The United States Strategic Bombing Surveys (European War) (Pacific War) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030825163637/http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/USSBS/USSBS.pdf |archivedate=2003-08-25 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve thousand aerial mines were laid, a significant barrier to Japan's access to outside resources. Prince [[Fumimaro Konoe]] said after the war that the aerial mining by B-29s had been "equally as effective as the B-29 attacks on Japanese industry at the closing stages of the war when all food supplies and critical material were prevented from reaching the Japanese home islands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Development of Mine Warfare: A Most Murderous and Barbarous Conduct |last=Youngblood |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=0-275-98419-2 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War)|United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War)]] concluded that it would have been more efficient to combine the United States's effective [[Pacific War#Submarine warfare|anti-shipping submarine effort]] with land- and carrier-based air power to strike harder against merchant shipping and begin a more extensive aerial mining campaign earlier in the war. Survey analysts projected that this would have starved Japan, forcing an earlier end to the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anesi.com/ussbs01.htm |title=United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Summary Report (Pacific War). July 1, 1946 |publisher=Anesi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Dr. Johnson looked at the Japan inner zone shipping results, comparing the total economic cost of submarine-delivered mines versus air-dropped mines and found that, though 1 in 12 submarine mines connected with the enemy as opposed to 1 in 21 for aircraft mines, the aerial mining operation was about ten times less expensive per enemy ton sunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mine Warfare At Sea |last=Levie |first=Howard S. |year=1992 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-7923-1526-X |page=89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clearing WWII aerial mines====
Between 600,000 and 1,000,000 naval mines of all types were laid in WWII. Advancing military forces worked to clear mines from newly-taken areas, but extensive minefields remained in place after the war. Air-dropped mines had an additional problem for mine sweeping operations: they were not meticulously charted. In Japan, much of the B-29 mine-laying work had been performed at high altitude, with the drifting on the wind of mines carried by parachute adding a randomizing factor to their placement. Generalized danger areas were identified, with only the quantity of mines given in detail. Mines used in Operation Starvation were supposed to be self-sterilizing, but the circuit did not always work. Clearing the mines from Japanese waters took so many years that the task was eventually given to the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Development of Mine Warfare: A Most Murderous and Barbarous Conduct |last=Youngblood |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=0-275-98419-2 |page=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of clearing all types of naval mines, the Royal Navy employed German crews and minesweepers from June 1945 to January 1948,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janmaat.de/m_gesch0.htm German Mine Sweeping Administration (GMSA)] (in German), accessed: 9 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; organised in the [[German Mine Sweeping Administration]] (GMSA), which consisted of 27,000 members of the former ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and 300 vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8Uczn3-3F34C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 Google book review: ''German Seaman 1939–45''] Page: 41, author: Gordon Williamson, John White, publisher: Osprey Publishing, accessed: 9 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Mine clearing was not always successful: a number of ships were damaged or sunk by mines after the war. Two such examples were the [[liberty ship]]s ''Pierre Gibault'' which was scrapped after hitting a mine in a previously cleared area off the Greek island of [[Kythira]] in June 1945,&lt;ref&gt;Elphick, Peter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4_V-uphhRPsC&amp;pg=PA309 ''Liberty'', p. 309.]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nathaniel Bacon'' which hit a minefield off [[Civitavecchia]], Italy in December 1945, caught fire, was beached, and broke in two.&lt;ref&gt;Elphick, Peter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4_V-uphhRPsC&amp;pg=PA108 ''Liberty'', p. 108.] A third example is the liberty ship ''Robert Dale Owen'', renamed ''Kalliopi'', which broke in three and sank in the North [[Adriatic Sea]] after hitting a mine in December 1947. (Elphick, p. 402.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damage==

The damage that may be caused by a mine depends on the "[[shock factor]] value", a combination of the initial strength of the explosion and of the distance between the target and the detonation. When taken in reference to ship hull plating, the term "Hull Shock Factor" (HSF) is used, while keel damage is termed "Keel Shock Factor" (KSF). If the explosion is directly underneath the keel, then HSF is equal to KSF, but explosions that are not directly underneath the ship will have a lower value of KSF.&lt;ref name=Reid1996/&gt;

===Direct damage===
Usually only created by contact mines, direct damage is a hole blown in the ship. Among the crew, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] wounds are the most common form of damage. Flooding typically occurs in one or two main watertight compartments, which can sink smaller ships or disable larger ones. Contact mine damage often occurs at or close to the waterline near the bow,&lt;ref name=Reid1996/&gt; but depending on circumstances a ship could be hit anywhere on its outer hull surface (the {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}} mine attack being a good example of a contact mine detonating amidships and underneath the ship).

===Bubble jet effect===
The bubble jet effect occurs when a mine or torpedo detonates in the water a short distance away from the targeted ship. The explosion creates a bubble in the water, and due to the difference in pressure, the bubble will collapse from the bottom. The bubble is buoyant, and so it rises towards the surface. If the bubble reaches the surface as it collapses, it can create a pillar of water that can go over a hundred meters into the air (a "columnar plume"). If conditions are right and the bubble collapses onto the ship's hull, the damage to the ship can be extremely serious; the collapsing bubble forms a high-energy jet that can break a metre-wide hole straight through the ship, flooding one or more compartments, and is capable of breaking smaller ships apart. The crew in the areas hit by the pillar are usually killed instantly. Other damage is usually limited.&lt;ref name=Reid1996/&gt;

The [[Baengnyeong incident]], in which the [[ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772)|ROKS ''Cheonan'']] broke in half and sank off the coast South Korea in 2010, was caused by the bubble jet effect, according to an international investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/20_05_10jigreport.pdf|title=Investigation Result on the Sinking of ROKS "Cheonan" by The Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=27 January 2014|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/world/asia/26korea.html|title=South Korea Cites Attack in Ship Sinking|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 April 2010|accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Choe | last=Sang-Hun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shock effect===
If the mine detonates at a distance from the ship, the change in water pressure causes the ship to resonate. This is frequently the most deadly type of explosion, if it is strong enough.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The whole ship is dangerously shaken and everything on board is tossed around. Engines rip from their beds, cables from their holders, etc.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}. A badly shaken ship usually sinks quickly, with hundreds, or even thousands{{examples|date=March 2016}} of small leaks all over the ship and no way to power the pumps. The crew fare no better, as the violent shaking tosses them around.&lt;ref name=Reid1996&gt;Department of Defence. Defence Science and Technology Organisation. Warren D.

Ship Structures and Materials Division, Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory. Retrieved March 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This shaking is powerful enough to cause disabling injury to knees and other joints in the body, particularly if the affected person stands on surfaces connected directly to the hull (such as steel decks).

The resulting gas cavitation and [[shock-front]]-differential over the width of the human body is sufficient to stun or kill [[Frogman|divers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cudahy, E  |author2=Parvin, S  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Effects of Underwater Blast on Divers. |journal=US Naval Submarine Medical Research Lab Technical Report |volume=NSMRL-1218 |year=2001 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7518 |accessdate=2009-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countermeasures ==
Weapons are frequently a few steps ahead of countermeasures, and mines are no exception. In this field the British, with their large seagoing navy, have had the bulk of world experience, and most anti-mine developments, such as [[degaussing]] and the double-L sweep, were British inventions. When on operational missions, such as the recent invasion of Iraq, the US still relies on British and Canadian minesweeping services. The US has worked on some innovative mine-hunting countermeasures, such as the use of [[military dolphin]]s to detect and flag mines. However, they are of questionable effectiveness.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Mines in nearshore environments remain a particular challenge. They are small and as technology has developed they can have anechoic coatings, be non-metallic, and oddly shaped to resist detection.&lt;ref name="minewar"&gt;Oceanography and Mine Warfare. Ocean Studies Board, National Research Council {{ISBN|0-309-51587-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} Further, oceanic conditions and the sea bottoms of the area of operations can degrade sweeping and hunting efforts.&lt;ref name="minewar" /&gt;{{rp|18}} Mining countermeasures are far more expensive and time-consuming than mining operations, and that gap is only growing with new technologies.&lt;ref name="minewar" /&gt;{{rp|18}}

=== Passive countermeasures ===
Ships can be designed to be difficult for mines to detect, to avoid detonating them. This is especially true for minesweepers and mine hunters that work in minefields, where a minimal signature outweighs the need for armour and speed. These ships have hulls of glass fibre or wood instead of steel to avoid magnetic signatures. These ships may use special propulsion systems, with [[low magnetic electric motor]]s, to reduce magnetic signature, and [[Voith-Schneider]] propellers, to limit the [[acoustic signature]]. They are built with hulls that produce a minimal pressure signature. These measures create other problems. They are expensive, slow, and vulnerable to enemy fire. Many modern ships have a mine-warning [[sonar]]—a simple sonar looking forward and warning the crew if it detects possible mines ahead. It is only effective when the ship is moving slowly.&lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(See Also [[SQQ-32 Mine-hunting sonar]])&lt;/small&gt;

A steel-hulled ship can be ''[[Degaussing|degaussed]]'' (more correctly, de-oerstedted or [[deperming|depermed]]) using a special degaussing station that contains many large coils and induces a magnetic field in the hull with alternating current to demagnetize the hull. This is a rather problematic solution, as magnetic compasses need recalibration and all metal objects must be kept in exactly the same place. Ships slowly regain their magnetic field as they travel through the Earth's magnetic field, so the process has to be repeated every six months.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/degaussing.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A simpler variation of this technique, called ''wiping'', was developed by [[Charles F. Goodeve]] which saved time and resources.

Between 1941 and 1943 the US Naval Gun factory (a division of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory) in Washington, D.C., built physical models of all US naval ships. Three kinds of steel were used in shipbuilding: mild steel for bulkheads, a mixture of mild steel and high tensile steel for the hull, and special treatment steel for armor plate. The models were placed within coils which could simulate the Earth's magnetic field at any location. The magnetic signatures were measured with degaussing coils. The objective was to reduce the vertical component of the combination of the Earth's field and the ship's field at the usual depth of German mines. From the measurements, coils were placed and coil currents determined to minimize the chance of detonation for any ship at any heading at any latitude.&lt;ref name="eaglespeak.us"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Tempest |url=http://www.eaglespeak.us/2007/11/sunday-ship-history-degaussing-ships.html |title=Sunday Ship History: Degaussing Ships |work=EagleSpeak |publisher=Eaglespeak.us |date=2007-11-04 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ships are built with magnetic [[inductor]]s, large coils placed along the ship to counter the ship's magnetic field. Using magnetic probes in strategic parts of the ship, the strength of the current in the coils can be adjusted to minimize the total magnetic field. This is a heavy and clumsy solution, suited only to small-to-medium-sized ships. Boats typically lack the generators and space for the solution, while the amount of power needed to overcome the magnetic field of a large ship is impractical.&lt;ref name="eaglespeak.us"/&gt;

=== Active countermeasures ===
Active countermeasures are ways to clear a path through a minefield or remove it completely. This is one of the most important tasks of any mine warfare flotilla.

==== Mine sweeping ====
{{main|Minesweeping}}
A sweep is either a contact sweep, a wire dragged through the water by one or two ships to cut the mooring wire of floating mines, or a distance sweep that mimics a ship to detonate the mines. The sweeps are dragged by [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s, either purpose-built military ships or converted [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]]. Each run covers between one and two hundred meters, and the ships must move slowly in a straight line, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. This was exploited by the Turkish army in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in 1915, when mobile [[howitzer]] batteries prevented the British and French from clearing a way through minefields.

If a contact sweep hits a mine, the wire of the sweep rubs against the mooring wire until it is cut. Sometimes "cutters", explosive devices to cut the mine's wire, are used to lessen the strain on the sweeping wire. Mines cut free are recorded and collected for research or shot with a deck gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussimplicitmso-455.com/Minesweeping.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402163450/http://www.ussimplicitmso-455.com/Minesweeping.html |archivedate=2009-04-02 |title=Mine Sweeping Operations |work=Minesweeping |publisher=Charles Lees |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minesweepers protect themselves with an [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|oropesa]] or [[Paravane (weapon)|paravane]] instead of a second minesweeper. These are torpedo-shaped towed bodies, similar in shape to a Harvey Torpedo, that are streamed from the sweeping vessel thus keeping the sweep at a determined depth and position. Some large warships were routinely equipped with paravane sweeps near the bows in case they inadvertently sailed into minefields—the mine would be deflected towards the paravane by the wire instead of towards the ship by its wake. More recently, heavy-lift helicopters have dragged minesweeping sleds, as in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paravane |title=Paravane – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distance sweep mimics the sound and magnetism of a ship and is pulled behind the sweeper. It has floating coils and large underwater ''drums''. It is the only sweep effective against bottom mines.

During WWII, [[RAF Coastal Command]] used [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers Wellington DW.Mk I fitted with degaussing coils to trigger magnetic mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwiivehicles.com/unitedkingdom/aircraft/bomber/vickers-wellington.asp |title=Britain's Vickers Wellington bomber, 'Wimpey' |work=World War II Vehicles, Tanks, and Airplanes |publisher=Wwiivehicles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern influence mines are designed to discriminate against false inputs and are, therefore, much harder to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed to respond to the unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately mimic the required target signature to trigger detonation. The task is complicated by the fact that an influence mine may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld034.htm |title=Mine Counter-Counter Measures (MCCM) |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 34 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another anti-sweeping mechanism is a ship-counter in the mine fuze. When enabled, this allows detonation only after the mine [[fuze]] has been triggered a pre-set number of times. To further complicate matters, influence mines may be programmed to arm themselves (or disarm automatically—known as ''self-sterilization'') after a pre-set time. During the pre-set arming delay (which could last days or even weeks) the mine would remain dormant and ignore any target stimulus, whether genuine or false.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

When influence mines are laid in an ocean minefield, they may have various combinations of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the acoustic sensor enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures which may or may not overlap. The fuzes on influence mines allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Mines with ship-counters, arming delays and highly specific target signatures in mine fuzes can falsely convince a belligerent that a particular area is clear of mines or has been swept effectively because a succession of vessels have already passed through safely.

==== Mine hunting ====
As naval mines have become more sophisticated, and able to discriminate between targets, so they have become more difficult to deal with by conventional sweeping. This has given rise to the practice of mine-hunting.
Mine hunting is very different from sweeping, although some [[minehunter]]s can do both tasks. Minehunting pays little attention to the nature of the mine itself. Nor does the method change much. At the current state of the art, Minehunting remains the best way to deal with influence mines proving to be both safer and more effective than sweeping. Specialized high-frequency sonars and high fidelity sidescaning sonar are used for mine location.&lt;ref name="minewar" /&gt;{{rp|18}}  Mines are hunted using sonar, then inspected and destroyed either by divers or [[Remotely operated vehicle|ROV]]s (remote controlled unmanned mini-submarines). It is slow, but also the most reliable way to remove mines. Minehunting started during the Second World War, but it was only after the war that it became truly effective.

Sea mammals (mainly the [[Bottlenose Dolphin]]) have been trained to hunt and mark mines, most famously by the [[U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program]]. Mine-clearance dolphins were deployed in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iraq War]] in 2003. The US Navy claims that these dolphins were effective in helping to clear more than 100 antiship mines and underwater [[booby trap]]s from [[Umm Qasr Port]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2003/september/phenomena.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070901162827/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2003/september/phenomena.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-01 |title=Uncle Sam's Dolphins |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=September 2003 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French naval officer [[Jacques Yves Cousteau]]'s Undersea Research Group was once involved in mine-hunting operations: They removed or detonated a variety of German mines, but one particularly defusion-resistant batch—equipped with acutely sensitive pressure, magnetic, and acoustic sensors and wired together so that one explosion would trigger the rest—was simply left undisturbed for years until corrosion would (hopefully) disable the mines.&lt;ref&gt;Cousteau, Jacques Yves. ''The Silent World, p. 58.'' New York: 1953, Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==== Mine running ====
[[File:SeehundeTroika.jpg|thumb|[[Ensdorf class minesweeper|Seehund]] ROVs of the [[German Navy]] used for minesweeping]]

A more drastic method is simply to run a ship through the minefield, letting other ships safely follow the same path. An early example of this was [[David Farragut|Farragut's]] [[Battle of Mobile Bay|actions at Mobile Bay]] during the [[American Civil War]]. However, as mine warfare became more developed this method became uneconomical.
This method was revived by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during WWII. Left with a surfeit of idle ships due to the [[Blockade of Germany (1939–45)|Allied blockade]], the ''Kriegsmarine'' introduced a ship known as ''[[Sperrbrecher]]'' ("block breaker"). Typically an old cargo ship, loaded with cargo that made her less vulnerable to sinking (wood for example), the ''Sperrbrecher'' was run ahead of the ship to be protected, detonating any mines that might be in their path. The use of ''Sperrbrecher'' obviated the need to continuous and painstaking sweeping, but the cost was high. Over half the 100 or so ships used as ''Sperrbrecher'' were sunk during the war. Alternatively, a shallow draught vessel can be steamed through the minefield at high speed to generate a pressure wave sufficient to trigger mines, with the minesweeper moving fast enough to be sufficiently clear of the pressure wave so that triggered mines do not destroy the ship itself. These techniques are the only publicly known to be employed way to sweep pressure mines. The technique can be simply countered by use of a ship-counter, set to allow a certain number of passes before the mine is actually triggered. Modern doctrine calls for ground mines to be hunted rather than swept. A new system is being introduced for sweeping pressure mines, however counters are going to remain a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navysbir.com/n07_s/navst07-030.htm |title=Influence Sweeping of Pressure Mines |publisher=U.S. Navy Small Business Innovation Research |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2011-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308200055/https://www.navysbir.com/n07_s/navst07-030.htm |archivedate=2012-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Underwater-Warfare-Systems/Pressure-sweep-Sweden.html |title=Pressure sweep (Sweden) |work=Jane's Underwater Warfare Systems |publisher=Janes.com |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An updated form of this method is the use of small unmanned [[Remotely operated vehicle|ROV]]s (such as the [[Ensdorf class minesweeper|''Seehund'']] drone) that simulate the acoustic and magnetic signatures of larger ships and are built to survive exploding mines. Repeated sweeps would be required in case one or more of the mines had its "ship counter" facility enabled i.e. were programmed to ignore the first 2, 3, or even 6 target activations.

== National arsenals ==

===US mines===
The [[United States Navy]] [[MK56 ASW mine]] (the oldest still in use by the United States) was developed in 1966. More advanced mines include the [[CAPTOR mine|MK60 CAPTOR]] (short for "encapsulated torpedo"), the MK62 and MK63 Quickstrike and the MK67 SLMM (Submarine Launched Mobile Mine). Today, most U.S. naval mines are delivered by aircraft.

&lt;big&gt;'''MK67 SLMM Submarine Launched Mobile Mine'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The SLMM was developed by the United States as a submarine deployed mine for use in areas inaccessible for other mine deployment techniques or for covert mining of hostile environments. The SLMM is a shallow-water mine and is basically a modified [[Mark 37 torpedo]].

&lt;big&gt;'''MK65 Quickstrike'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Quickstrike&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comomag.navy.mil/Mine%20History/General%20Information.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107222633/http://www.comomag.navy.mil/Mine%20History/General%20Information.aspx |archivedate=2006-11-07 |title=General Mine Information |work=Mine History |publisher=Commander Mobile Mine Assembly Group, U.S. Navy |location=Corpus Christi, Texas |accessdate=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a family of shallow-water aircraft-laid mines used by the United States, primarily against surface craft. The MK65 is a 2,000-lb (900&amp;nbsp;kg) dedicated, purpose-built mine. However, other Quickstrike versions (MK62, MK63, and MK64) are converted general-purpose bombs. These latter three mines are actually a single type of electronic [[fuze]] fitted to [[Mk82]], [[Mk83]] and [[Mk84]] air-dropped bombs. Because this latter type of Quickstrike fuze only takes up a small amount of storage space compared to a dedicated sea mine, the air-dropped bomb casings have dual purpose i.e. can be fitted with conventional contact fuzes and dropped on land targets, or have a Quickstrike fuze fitted which converts them into sea mines.

===Royal Navy===
According to a statement made to the UK Parliament in 2002:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hansard Written Answers |date=4 November 2002 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo021104/text/21104w16.htm |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the Royal Navy does not have any mine stocks and has not had since 1992. Notwithstanding this, the United Kingdom retains the capability to lay mines and continues research into mine exploitation. Practice mines, used for exercises, continue to be laid in order to retain the necessary skills.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, a British company ([[BAE Systems]]) does manufacture the [[Stonefish (mine)|Stonefish]] influence mine for export to friendly countries such as Australia, which has both war stock and training versions of Stonefish,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/collins/ SSK Collins Class (Type 471) Attack Submarine]. Naval Technology. Retrieved on 2010-12-02.{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to stocks of smaller Italian MN103 Manta mines.&lt;ref name="MN103-MANTA Sea Mines"/&gt; The [[embedded computer system|computerised]] [[fuze]] on a Stonefish mine contains acoustic, [[magnetic]] and water [[pressure]] displacement target detection sensors. Stonefish can be deployed by fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, surface vessels and submarines. An optional kit is available to allow Stonefish to be air-dropped, comprising an [[aerodynamic]] tail-fin section and [[parachute]] pack to retard the weapon's descent. The operating depth of Stonefish ranges between 30 and 200 metres. The mine weighs 990 kilograms and contains a 600 kilogram aluminised [[Polymer bonded explosive|PBX]] explosive [[warhead]].

== Modern mine warfare challenges today ==

Mine warfare remains the most cost-effective of asymmetrical naval warfare. Mines are relatively cheap and being small they are easy to deploy. Indeed, with some kinds of mines, trucks and rafts will suffice. At present there are more than 300 different mines available. Some 50 countries currently have mining ability. The number of naval mine producing countries has increased by 75% since 1988. It is also noted that these mines are of an increasing sophistication while even the older type mines present a significant problem. It has been noted that mine warfare may become an issue with terrorist organizations. Mining busy shipping straits and mining shipping harbors remain some of the most serious threats.&lt;ref name="minewar" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

'''ORFS''' stands for ''Output RF Spectrum'', where 'RF' stands for [[Radio Frequency]].

The acronym ORFS is used in the context of mobile communication systems, e.g., [[GSM]]. It stands for the relationship between (a) the frequency offset from the carrier and (b) the power, measured in a specific bandwidth and time, produced by the mobile station due to effects in modulation and [[power ramp]]ing and switching. ORFS measurements are defined and required in order to prove conformance by various institutions, e.g., the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) or [[ETSI]].

A '''Plectron''' is a specialized [[VHF]]/[[UHF]] single-channel, emergency alerting [[radio receiver]], used to activate emergency response personnel, and disaster warning systems. Manufactured from the late 1950s, through the late 1990s, by the now defunct '''[[Plectron Corporation]]''' in [[Overton, Nebraska]], hundreds of thousands of these radios were placed in homes of first responders across all of North America. This included [[ambulance]] crews, full-time and volunteer [[firefighters]], off-duty specialized [[police]] response teams, [[Civil Defense]] members, and [[search and rescue]] teams.

A Plectron's main feature (distinguishing it from a regular [[squelch]]ed radio) was its selective de-squelching. It would only sound when a correct pair of tones were broadcast - allowing many agencies (with different tones) to share the same frequency. Some Plectron Models had a set of "Built-in Re-chargeable Batteries", for this made the Plectron Portable. The [[Motorola MINITOR pager]] also uses this function and has largely replaced the Plectron.

|title=Methods to Capture the Built Environment
|accessdate=2012-11-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a technology that enables a user or surveyor to [[Surveying#Building surveying|survey or capture]] a building's geometry in real time or while on site by translating laser range finder data directly into a [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD) or [[building information modeling|building information models]] (BIM) work station.

== Applications ==
Most commonly used for as-built and existing conditions documentation or converting the built environment into a digital format.

== Benefits ==
PPLT has many benefits in creating BIM or (CAD) models. Entering data directly into a CAD- or BIM-enabled work station allows a user or 'surveyor' to capture and confirm a building's geometry on site. This effectively builds a digital model of a building while it is being measured enabling not only speed but accuracy. Additionally, building in real time can eliminate the need for revisits and also minimizes the need for future interpretation and manipulation of measurements and data by a CAD operator.

== Associations ==
Since PPLT mainly deals with building surveying there are a few associations that are building surveying specific. There is the [[Association of Professional Building Surveyors]] (APBS) in the United States and the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS) in Britain. Whereas building surveying is offered at the curriculum level in Europe it still is in its nascent stages in the United States.

== Certifications ==
Both the APBS and RICS offer certification methods and programs. The APBS has the professional building surveyor (PBS) certifications.

[[File:IBM Electronic Data Processing Machine (9467782802).jpg|thumb|Two programmers working on an IBM Type 704 at [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]], 1954]]
A '''programmer''', '''developer''', '''dev''', '''coder''', or '''software engineer''' is a person who creates [[computer software]]. The term ''computer programmer'' can refer to a specialist in one area of [[computers]] or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to [[Computer programming|programming]] may also be known as a '''programmer analyst'''&lt;ref&gt;or programmer/analyst, as seen in employment opportunity postings&lt;/ref&gt;.

A programmer's primary [[computer language]] ([[Assembly language|Assembly]], [[COBOL]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Python programming language|Python]], etc.) is often prefixed to these titles, and those who work in a [[World Wide Web|web]] environment often prefix their titles with ''web''.

A range of occupations, including: [[software developer]], [[web developer]], mobile applications developer, embedded [[firmware]] developer, [[software engineer]], [[computer scientist]], or [[software analyst]], while they do involve programming, also require a range of other skills. The use of the simple term ''programmer'' for these positions is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory simplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Programmers |url=http://www.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Developer versus programmer |url=http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2005/02/22/55812.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Developers AND Programmers |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/miked/archive/2006/10/13/_2200_Developers_2200_-and-_2200_Programmers_2200_.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Programmer vs. Developer vs. Software Engineer |url=http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.112837.37 |access-date=21 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710101939/http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.112837.37# |archive-date=10 July 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Programmer vs. Developer vs. Software Engineer |url=http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/archive/index.php/t-233780.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ada Lovelace portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ada Lovelace]] is considered by many as the first computer programmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.|last=Fuegi|first2=J.|last2=Francis|title=Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'|journal=Annals of the History of Computing|volume=25|issue=4 |year=2003|pages=18–26|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
British countess and mathematician [[Ada Lovelace]] is often considered the first computer programmer, as she was the first to publish an [[algorithm]] intended for implementation on [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[analytical engine]], in October 1842, intended for the calculation of [[Bernoulli number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fuegi |first=J. |last2=Francis |first2=J. |date=October–December 2003 |title=Lovelace &amp; babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes' |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=16–26 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Babbage's machine was never completed to a functioning standard in her time, she never saw this algorithm run.

The first person to run a program on a functioning modern electronically based computer was [[computer scientist]] [[Konrad Zuse]], in 1941.

The [[ENIAC]] programming team, consisting of [[Kathleen Antonelli|Kay McNulty]], [[Jean Bartik|Betty Jennings]], [[Betty Holberton|Betty Snyder]], [[Marlyn Meltzer|Marlyn Wescoff]], [[Frances Spence|Fran Bilas]] and [[Ruth Teitelbaum|Ruth Lichterman]] were the first regularly working programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eniacprogrammers.org/eniac-programmers-project/memorials/ |title=Memorials |publisher=Eniacprogrammers.org |date= |accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3951187&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News: First Computer Programmers Inspire Documentary |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Programmers' Day is celebrated annually on 7 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalprogrammersday.org |title=International Programmers' Day |access-date=19 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103212304/http://internationalprogrammersday.org/ |archive-date=3 January 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the [[government of Russia]] decreed a professional annual holiday known as [[Programmers' Day]] to be celebrated on 13 September (12 September in leap years). It had also been an unofficial international holiday before that.

=== Software ===
The word "software" was first used as early as 1953, but did not appear in print until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/tocsoft.html|title=Softword: Provenance for the Word 'Software'|author=Paul Niquette|year=1995}} adapted from ''Sophisticated: The Magazine'' {{ISBN|1-58922-233-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this time, computers were programmed either by customers, or the few commercial computer vendors of the time, such as [[UNIVAC]] and [[IBM]]. The first company founded to provide software products and services was [[Computer Usage Company]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elmer C. Kubie|date=Summer 1994|title=Recollections of the first software company|journal=[[Annals of the History of Computing]]|volume=16|issue=2|pages=65–71|doi=10.1109/85.279238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, government, and business customers created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers. Some were distributed freely between users of a particular machine for no charge. Others were done on a commercial basis, and other firms such as [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (founded in 1959) started to grow. The computer/[[Computer hardware|hardware]] makers started bundling [[operating systems]], [[system software]] and programming environments with their machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the [[personal computer]] ("PC") in the mid-1970s, which brought computing to the [[desk]]top of the office worker. In the following years, it also created a growing market for games, applications, and utilities. [[DOS]], [[Microsoft]]'s first [[operating system]] product, was the dominant operating system at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1993-02-28/is-microsoft-too-powerful|title=Is Microsoft Too Powerful?|author1=Rebello, Kathy|author2=Schwartz, Evan I.|date=28 February 1993|website=Businessweek Archives|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=26 September 2014|author3=Verity, John W.|author4=Lewyn, Mark|author5=Levine, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the 21st century, another successful [[business model]] has arisen for hosted software, called [[software-as-a-service]], or SaaS; this was at least the third time{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} this model had been attempted. From the point of view of producers of some [[proprietary software]], SaaS reduces the concerns about [[Software copyright|unauthorized copying]], since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition, no [[client software]] is loaded onto the end user's PC.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  By 2014, the role of [[Cloud computing|cloud]] developer had been defined; in this context, one definition of a "developer" in general was published:&lt;ref name="hardiman2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/a-portrait-of-the-modern-cloud-developer/|title=A portrait of the modern cloud developer|author=Hardiman, Nick|date=24 July 2014|work=[[TechRepublic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the work==
:''Some of this section is from the [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm Occupational Outlook Handbook], 2006–07 Edition, which is in the [[public domain]] as a [[work of the United States Government]].''

Computer programmers write, test, [[debug]], and maintain the detailed instructions, called [[computer programs]], that computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming&amp;nbsp;— advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools&amp;nbsp;— have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.

Programmers work in many settings, including corporate [[information technology]] ("IT") departments, big [[software companies]], small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites as [[Independent contractor|contractors]]. [[License|Licensing]] is not typically required to work as a programmer, although [[professional certification]]s are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely considered a [[profession]] (although some{{Who|date=March 2011}} authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession).

Programmers' work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours, more complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmer’s supervision.
[[File:Coding Shots Annual Plan high res-5.jpg|thumb|225x225px|A software engineer writing [[JavaScript]].]]
Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers and by [[systems analyst]]s. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the program. [[COBOL]], for example, is commonly used for business applications that typically run on [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[minicomputer|midrange]] computers, whereas [[Fortran]] is used in science and engineering. [[C++]] is widely used for both scientific and business applications. [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic|VB]]  and [[PHP]] are popular programming languages for Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred to by the language they know, e.g. as ''Java programmers'', or by the type of function they perform or environment in which they work: for example, ''[[database]] programmers'', ''mainframe programmers'', or [[Web developer]]s.

When making changes to the [[source code]] that programs are made up of, programmers need to make other programmers aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by inserting comments in the [[source code]] so that others can understand the program more easily and by [[Software documentation|documenting their code]]. To save work, programmers often use [[Library (computing)|libraries]] of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps.

===Testing and debugging===
Programmers test a program by running it and looking for [[Software bug|bugs]] (errors). As they are identified, the programmer usually makes the appropriate corrections, then rechecks the program until an acceptably low level and severity of bugs remain. This process is called [[Software testing|testing]] and [[debugging]]. These are important parts of every programmer's job. Programmers may continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a program. Updating, repairing, modifying, and expanding existing programs is sometimes called ''maintenance programming''. Programmers may contribute to [[user guide]]s and [[online help]], or they may work with [[technical writer]]s to do such work.

===Application versus system programming===
Computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types: application programmers and systems programmers. Application programmers write programs to handle a specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an organization. They also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic applications which are frequently purchased from [[independent software vendor]]s. Systems programmers, in contrast, write programs to maintain and control computer systems software, such as [[operating system]]s and [[database management system]]s. These workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and [[Central processing unit|CPU]] of the system handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as [[Computer printer|printers]] and [[Data storage device|disk drives]].

=== Qualifications and skills ===
A software developer needs to have deep technical expertise with certain aspects of computing. Some positions will require a degree in a relevant field such as computer science, information technology, engineering, programming, or any other IT related post graduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|title=Software Engineer Skills and Responsibilities|url=http://www.jobawareness.com/software-engineer.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal software developer is a self-motivated professional carrying a dynamic hands-on experience on key languages of programming such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[JavaScript|Javascript]], VB, Oracle, UML, [[Linux]], Python, [[UNIX]], [[XML]], [[HTTP]], Smalltalk, or other software testing tools.

According to developer Eric Sink, the differences between system design, [[software development]], and programming are more apparent. Already in the current market place there can be found a segregation between programmers and developers, in that one who implements is not the same as the one who designs the [[Class (computer science)|clas]]s structure or hierarchy. Even more so that developers become [[software architect]]s or [[systems architect]]s, those who design the multi-leveled architecture or component interactions of a large software system.&lt;ref name="Sourcegear_2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://software.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html|title=Small ISVs: You need Developers, not Programmers|author=[[Eric Sink]]|publisher=Sourcegear|accessdate=2008-06-06|quote=A programmer is someone who does nothing but code new features and (if you're lucky) fix bugs. They don't write specs. They don't write automated test cases. They don't help keep the automated build system up to date. They don't help customers work out tough problems. They don't help write documentation. They don't help with testing. They don't even read code. All they do is write new code.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of software===
Programmers in software development companies may work directly with experts from various fields to create software&amp;nbsp;– either programs designed for specific clients or packaged software for general use&amp;nbsp;– ranging from [[video game]]s to educational software to programs for [[desktop publishing]] and financial planning. Programming of packaged software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer services industry. Some companies or organizations – even small ones – have set up their own IT team to ensure the design and development of in-house software to answer to very specific needs from their internal end-users, especially when existing software are not suitable or too expensive. This is for example the case in [[research laboratories]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In some organizations, particularly small ones, people commonly known as ''programmer analysts'' are responsible for both the systems analysis and the actual programming work. The transition from a mainframe environment to one that is based primarily on [[personal computers]] (PCs) has blurred the once rigid distinction between the programmer and the user. Increasingly, adept end users are taking over many of the tasks previously performed by programmers. For example, the growing use of packaged software, such as spreadsheet and database management software packages, allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform calculations.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In addition, the rise of the Internet has made [[web development]] a huge part of the programming field. Currently more software applications are [[web application]]s that can be used by anyone with a [[web browser]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Examples of such applications include the [[Google]] search service, the [[Outlook.com]] e-mail service, and the [[Flickr]] photo-sharing service.

Programming editors, also known as [[source code editor]]s, are text editors that are specifically designed for programmers or developers for writing the source code of an application or a program. Most of these editors include features useful for programmers, which may include color [[syntax highlighting]], auto indentation, [[auto-complete]], bracket matching, [[Syntax checker|syntax check]], and allows [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s. These features aid the users during coding, [[debugging]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zgmpr82/revision/4|title=BBC Bitesize - GCSE Computer Science - Programming software and the IDE - Revision 4|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globalization==
{{globalize/US|date=December 2010}}

===Market changes in the UK===
According to BBC News, 17% of computer science students could not find work in their field 6 months after graduation in 2009 which was the highest rate of the university subjects surveyed while 0% of medical students were unemployed in the same survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10477551|title='One in 10' UK graduates jobless|first=Martin|last=Shankleman|date=1 July 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK category system does, however, class such degrees as [[information technology]] and [[game design]] as 'computer science', industries in which jobs can be extremely difficult to find, somewhat inflating the actual figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=23727]ATAS classifications (University of Plymouth) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518224701/http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=23727 |date=18 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market changes in the US===
Computer programming, [[offshore outsourcing]], and [[Foreign Worker Visa]]s became a controversial topic after the crash of the [[dot-com bubble]] left many programmers without work or with lower wages. Programming was even mentioned in the 2004 US Presidential debate on the topic of [[offshore outsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-8-2004-debate-transcript|title=CPD: October 8, 2004 Debate Transcript|website=www.debates.org|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large companies claim there is a [[skills shortage]] with regard to programming talent. However, US programmers and unions counter that large companies are exaggerating their case in order to obtain cheaper programmers from developing countries and avoid previously employer paid training using industry specific technologies not covered in most accredited degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/MigLtrs.pdf] Migration Letters, Volume: 10, No: 2, pp. 211 – 228 {{ISSN|1741-8984}} &amp; e{{ISSN|1741-8992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons for employers claiming skill shortages is the result of their own cost saving combining of several disparate skill sets previously held by several specialized programmers into fewer generalized [[Mechatronics|multifaceted]]  positions that are unlikely to have enough [[Purple squirrel|"qualified" candidates]] with the desired experience.&lt;ref&gt;"Purple Squirrels and the Reserve Army of the Unemployed" Paul Solman https://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/purple-squirrels-and-the-reser/ [[PBS]]August 15, 2012  accessdate  = 2016-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment in computer-related degrees in US has dropped recently{{when|date=May 2018}} due to lack of general interests in science and mathematics and also out of an apparent fear that programming will be subject to the same pressures as manufacturing and agriculture careers.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Beaubouef and John Mason, [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1083474 Why the high attrition rate for computer science students: some thoughts and observations.], ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This situation has resulted in confusion about whether the US economy is entering a "post-[[Quaternary sector of the economy|information]] age" and the nature of US [[comparative advantage]]s. Most academic institutions have an [[Institutional research]] office that keep past statistics of degrees conferred which show several dips and rises in Computer Science degrees over the past 30 years. The overall trend shows a slightly overall decline in growth (especially when compared to other STEM degree growth) since certain peaks of [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|1986]], [[Early 1990s recession in the United States|1992]], [[Dot-com bubble|2002]], and [[Great Recession|2008]] showing periods of flat growth or even declines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/regional_reports/200908_silicon_valley_high_tech.htm|title=After the Dot-Com Bubble: Silicon Valley High-Tech Employment And Wages in 2001 and 2008|website=www.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook 2016-26 is -7% (a decline in their words) for Computer Programmers because [[Computer programming]] can be done from anywhere in the world, so companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm|title=Computer Programmers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''relay league''' is a chain of message forwarding stations in a system of [[optical telegraph]]s, [[Telegraphy#Radiotelegraphy|radio telegraph]] stations, or riding [[courier#History|courier]]s.

An interesting description of these early 19th century methods and its evolution into the [[electrical telegraph]] networks of the mid-to-late 19th century is found in ''The Victorian Internet'', a book by Tom Standage {{ISBN|0-425-17169-8}}.

== Radio relay leagues ==
[[Amateur radio|Radio amateur]]s have been early in arranging relay leagues, as is reflected in the name of the organization of [[American Radio Relay League]] (ARRL), http://www.arrl.org/.

Radio amateur message relay operations were originally conducted using [[Morse code]] in the first two decades of the 20th century using [[spark-gap transmitter]]s. As [[vacuum tube]]s became affordable operations shifted to more efficient manual telegraphy transmitters, referred to as CW ([[Continuous wave]]). Messages were relayed station to station typically covering four or more re-transmission cycles to cover the continental [[United States]], in an organized system of amateur radio networks. After [[World War II]], voice and [[radioteletype]] implementations of the message relay system were employed.

'''Responsive architecture''' is an evolving field of architectural practice and research. Responsive architectures are those that measure actual environmental conditions (via sensors) to enable buildings to adapt their form, shape, color or character responsively (via actuators).

Responsive architectures aim to refine and extend the discipline of architecture by improving the energy performance of buildings with responsive technologies (sensors / control systems / actuators) while also producing buildings that reflect the technological and cultural conditions of our time.

Responsive architectures distinguish themselves from other forms of interactive design by incorporating intelligent and responsive technologies into the core elements of a building's fabric.  For example: by incorporating responsive technologies into the structural systems of buildings architects have the ability to tie the shape of a building directly to its environment. This enables architects to reconsider the way they design and construct space while striving to advance the discipline rather than applying patchworks of intelligent technologies to an existing vision of "building".

== History ==
The common definition of responsive architecture, as described by many authors, is a class of architecture or building that demonstrates an ability to alter its form, to continually reflect the environmental conditions that surround it.

The term "responsive architecture" was introduced by [[Nicholas Negroponte]], who first conceived of it during the late 1960s when spatial design problems were being explored by applying cybernetics to architecture. Negroponte proposes that responsive architecture is the natural product of the integration of computing power into built spaces and structures, and that better performing, more rational buildings are the result.  Negroponte also extends this mixture to include the concepts of recognition, intention, contextual variation, and meaning into computing and its successful (ubiquitous) integration into architecture. This cross-fertilization of ideas lasted for about eight years. Several important theories resulted from these efforts, but today Nicholas Negroponte’s contributions are the most obvious to architecture. His work moved the field of architecture in a technical, functional, and actuated direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orambra.com/survey/~ecaade/media/sterkECAADE_03.pdf Building Upon Negroponte: A Hybridized Model of Control Suitable for A Responsive Architecture , Tristan d’Estrée Sterk (2003)], The School of The Art Institute of Chicago. Retrieved 20 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Negroponte’s contribution, new works of responsive architecture have also emerged, but as aesthetic creations—rather than functional ones. The works of Diller &amp; Scofidio (Blur),  dECOi (Aegis Hypo-Surface),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sial.rmit.edu.au/Projects/Aegis_Hyposurface.php Aegis Hyposurface project] from the SIAL (Retrieved 13 March 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  and NOX (The Freshwater Pavilion, NL)  are all classifiable as types of responsive architecture. Each of these works monitors fluctuations in the environment and alters its form in response to these changes. The Blur project by Diller &amp; Scofidio relies upon the responsive characteristics of a cloud to change its form while blowing in the wind. In the work of dECOi, responsiveness is enabled by a programmable façade, and finally in the work of NOX, a programmable audio–visual interior.

All of these works depend upon the abilities of computers to continuously calculate and join digital models that are programmable, to the real world and the events that shape it.

Finally an account of the development of the use of responsive systems and their history in respect to recent architectural theory can be found in Tristan d'Estree Sterk's recent opening keynote address (ACADIA 2009) entitled "Thoughts for Gen X— Speculating about the Rise of Continuous Measurement in Architecture" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orambra.com/survey/~genX/media/sterkACADIA_09.pdf Continuous Measurement in Architecture] from ORAMBRA (Retrieved 26 January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

While a considerable amount of time and effort has been spent on [[intelligent home]]s in recent years, the emphasis here has been mainly on developing computerized systems and electronics to adapt the interior of the building or its rooms to the needs of residents. Research in the area of responsive architecture has had far more to do with the building structure&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orambra.com/survey/~syntheticLandscapes/media/sterk4WCSCM_06.pdf Shape Control in Responsive Architectural Structures - Current Reasons &amp; Challenges, Tristan d’Estrée Sterk (2006)], The School of The Art Institute of Chicago. Retrieved 3 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; itself, its ability to adapt to changing weather conditions and to take account of light, heat and cold. This could theoretically be achieved by designing structures consisting of rods and strings which would bend in response to wind, distributing the load  in much the same way as a tree. Similarly, windows would respond to light, opening and closing to provide the best lighting and heating conditions inside the building.

This line of research, known as actuated tensegrity, relies on changes in structures controlled by actuators which in turn are driven by computerized interpreters of the real world conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orambra.com/survey/~usingActuatedTensegrity/media/sterkACADIA_03.pdf Using Actuated Tensegrity Structures to Produce a Responsive Architecture, Tristan d’Estrée Sterk (2003)], The School of The Art Institute of Chicago. Retrieved 14 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate adaptive building shells]] (CABS) can be identified as a sub-domain of responsive architecture, with special emphasis on dynamic features in facades and roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loonen|first1=R.C.G.M.|title=Pinterest - Climate Adaptive Building Shells|url=http://www.pinterest.com/CABSoverview/|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CABS can repeatedly and reversibly change some of its functions, features or behavior over time in response to changing performance requirements and variable boundary conditions, with the aim of improving overall building performance.&lt;ref name="loonen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loonen|first1=R.C.G.M.|last2=Trčka|first2=M.|last3=Cóstola|first3=D.|last4=Hensen|first4=J.L.M.|title=Climate adaptive building shells: State-of-the-art and future challenges|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=September 2013|volume=25|pages=483–493|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depicted Left: A full scale actuated tensegrity prototype built from cast aluminium, stainless steel components and pneumatic muscles (pneumatic muscles provided by Shadow Robotics UK) by Tristan d'Estree Sterk and The Office for Robotic Architectural Media (2003).  These types of structural systems use variable and controllable rigidity to provide architects and engineers with systems that have a controllable shape. As a form of ultra-lightweight structure these systems offer a primary method for reducing the [[embodied energy]] used in construction processes.

The '''SRTM Water Body Data (SWBD)''' is a geographical dataset (2003) encoding high-resolution worldwide coastline outlines in a [[vector graphics|vector]] format, published by [[NASA]] and designed for use in [[geographic information system]]s and mapping applications. It was created by BAE Systems ADR for the US [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) as a complementary product during editing of the [[digital elevation model]] database of the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] (SRTM). SWBD data covers the Earth's surface between 56° southern latitude and 60° northern latitude. It is distributed in [[ESRI shapefile]] format, divided into 12,229 files, each covering one 1°-by-1° tile of the Earth's surface.

SWBD data is in the [[public domain]] and is made available online for free download by NASA.

In '''safe-life design''' products are designed to survive a specific [[design life]] with a chosen reserve.

Safe life is particularly relevant to metal aircraft, where [[airframe]] components are subjected to varying loads over the lifetime of the aircraft which makes them susceptible to [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]]. In certain areas such as in wing or tail components structural failure in flight would be catastrophic.

The safe-life design technique is employed in critical systems which are either very difficult to repair or may cause severe damage to life and property. These systems are designed to work for years without requirement of any repairs.

The drawback is that products designed with a safe-life approach are over-built or allocated more resources than they are expected to need, which may be uneconomical.
In order to maintain the designed safety, they will have to be replaced after the [[design life]] has expired, while they may still have a considerable life ahead of them. To counter these drawbacks, alternative [[design philosophy|design philosophies]] like [[Fail-safe|fail-safe design]] and [[fault-tolerant design]] were developed.

[[Work Safe Victoria]] (an Australian organization) defines a Safety Barrier as a device that:&lt;ref name="Safety for Workers and Traffic"&gt;{{cite web|title=SWAT Bulletin|url=http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/10154/temp_safety_barriers.pdf|work=SWAT Bulletin Number 4|publisher=Work Safe Victoria|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704222359/http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/10154/temp_safety_barriers.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* physically separate the work area and the traveled way,
* are designed to resist penetration of an out-of control vehicle, and
* have properties which redirect an out-of-control vehicle back on to the road away from the work area.

=== Types of barriers ===
Hard barriers are fixed or removable guards which prevent entry. There include fences, [[traffic barrier]]s, and crush barriers.

Soft barriers are devices such as [[light curtain]]s. They detect the presence of a foreign body and are tied into the control circuit to stop the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.automation.com/library/articles-white-papers/machine-process-safe-guarding/how-safety-light-curtains-work|title=How Safety Light Curtains Work|website=www.automation.com|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Components ===
Hard barriers are fixed into the ground as a [[bollard]] or [[gate]], removable on stands, or clipped to a structure. Regardless of the barrier type, the components and overall assembly will be similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.omegaindl.com/products/custom-safety-barriers/|title=Safety Barriers|last=|first=|date=|work=Omega Industrial Safety|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material of rails used to stop the flow of objects into the protected area must be durable and strong enough to withstand any impacts related to the environment in which it is installed; for example, a guard rail on the side of the road must be able to contain and safely stop or drastically slow down a vehicle weighing up to 40 tons ([[cable barrier]]s are most effective against tractor trailers), whereas a pedestrian safety barrier only needs to be tall enough, designed with a lattice effect to keep people from climbing through it, or highly visible when being used to display caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=10758&amp;p_table=STANDARDS|title=Fall protection systems criteria and practices. - 1926.502 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications ===
Safety barriers vary depending on their application. In an industrial setting, a safety barrier may be a [[fence]] or window, designed to keep the operator away from moving parts or other hazards. Railings should be closed cornered with rounded or flared edges to prevent any further damage to personnel or machinery in the event of a collision. Safety barriers can also be used to protect the corners of fixtures, support columns, exposed pipes or cables, or designated areas on the work floor.

In an automotive setting, the barrier may be a [[traffic barrier]] or [[Jersey barrier]], separating lanes/directions of traffic flow. In crowd control, [[terrace (stadium)|terraces]] use crush barriers to reduce the risk of [[human crush]] in large crowds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8516">The ''' Standard hydrogen electrode''' (abbreviated '''SHE'''), is a [[redox electrode]] which forms the basis of the [[Table of standard electrode potentials|thermodynamic scale of oxidation-reduction potentials]]. Its [[absolute electrode potential]] is estimated to be {{nowrap|4.44 ± 0.02 V}} at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, but to form a basis for comparison with all other electrode reactions, hydrogen's [[standard electrode potential]] (''E''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) is declared to be zero volts only at 298K.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=S05917|title=standard hydrogen electrode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potentials of any other electrodes are compared with that of the standard hydrogen electrode at the same temperature.

Hydrogen electrode is based on the redox [[half cell]]:
:2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 2&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

This redox reaction occurs at a platinized [[platinum]] electrode.
The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced form and oxidised form is maintained at unity. That implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is 1&amp;nbsp;bar (100&amp;nbsp;kPa) and the activity of hydrogen ions in the solution is unity. The activity of hydrogen ions is their effective concentration, which is equal to the formal concentration times the [[activity coefficient]]. These unit-less activity coefficients are close to 1.00 for very dilute water solutions, but usually lower for more concentrated solutions. 
The [[Nernst equation]] should be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;E={RT \over F}\ln \frac{a_\mathrm{H^+}}{ \sqrt{p_\mathrm{H_2}/p^0}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E=-{2.303RT \over F}\mathrm{pH} - {RT \over 2F}\ln \frac{p_\mathrm{H_2}}{p^0}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* ''a''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of the hydrogen ions, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''p''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the partial pressure of the [[hydrogen]] gas, in [[pascal (unit)|pascal]]s, Pa
* ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]]
* ''T'' is the temperature, in [[kelvin]]s
* ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]] (the charge per mole of electrons), equal to 9.6485309&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;C&amp;nbsp;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''p''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the standard pressure, 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa

==Relationship between the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) ==
During the early development of electrochemistry, researchers used the normal hydrogen electrode as their standard for zero potential.  This was convenient because it could ''actually be constructed'' by "[immersing] a platinum electrode into a solution of 1&amp;nbsp;[[Normality (chemistry)|N]] strong acid and [bubbling] hydrogen gas through the solution at about 1&amp;nbsp;atm pressure".  However, this electrode/solution interface was later changed.  What replaced it was a theoretical electrode/solution interface, where the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was 1&amp;nbsp;[[Molarity|M]], but the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were assumed to have no interaction with other ions (a condition not physically attainable at those concentrations).  To differentiate this new standard from the previous one it was given the name 'Standard Hydrogen Electrode'.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramette|first1=R. W.|title=Outmoded terminology: The normal hydrogen electrode|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=October 1987|volume=64|issue=10|pages=885|doi=10.1021/ed064p885|bibcode=1987JChEd..64..885R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary,

:NHE:  potential of a platinum electrode in 1&amp;nbsp;N acid solution

:SHE:  potential of a platinum electrode in a theoretical [[ideal solution]] (the current '''standard''' for zero potential for all temperatures)

==Choice of platinum==
The choice of platinum for the hydrogen electrode is due to several factors:
* inertness of platinum (it does not corrode)
* the capability of platinum to catalyze the reaction of proton reduction
* a high intrinsic [[exchange current density]] for proton reduction on platinum
* excellent reproducibility of the potential (bias of less than 10&amp;nbsp;μV when two well-made hydrogen electrodes are compared with one another)&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|first1=D. T. |last1=Sawyer |first2=A. |last2=Sobkowiak |first3=J. L., Jr. |last3=Roberts |title=Electrochemistry for Chemists |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The surface of platinum is platinized (i.e., covered with [[platinum black]])  to:
* Increase total surface area. This improves reaction kinetics and maximum possible current
* Use a surface material that [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] hydrogen well at its interface. This also improves reaction kinetics

Other metals can be used for building electrodes with a similar function such as the [[palladium-hydrogen electrode]].

==Interference==
Because of the high adsorption activity of the platinized platinum electrode, it's very important to protect electrode surface and solution from the presence of organic substances as well as from atmospheric oxygen. Inorganic ions that can reduce to a lower valency state at the electrode also have to be avoided (e.g., Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{chem|CrO|4|2−}}). A number of organic substances are also reduced by hydrogen at a platinum surface, and these also have to be avoided.

Cations that can reduce and deposit on the platinum can be source of interference: silver, mercury, copper, lead, cadmium and thallium.

Substances that can inactivate ("poison") the catalytic sites include arsenic, sulfides and other sulfur compounds, colloidal substances, alkaloids, and material found in living systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=D. J. G. |last1=Ives |first2=G. J. |last2=Janz |title=Reference Electrodes: Theory and Practice |publisher=Academic Press |date=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotopic effect==
The standard redox potential of the deuterium couple is slightly different from that of the proton couple (ca. −0.0044&amp;nbsp;V vs SHE). Various values in this range have been obtained: −0.0061&amp;nbsp;V,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Znamirovschi|first1=V.|title=Isotopie Equilibrium at the Normal Hydrogen Electrode|journal=Isotopenpraxis Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies|date=January 1970|volume=6|issue=1|pages=29–31|doi=10.1080/10256017008621700}}&lt;/ref&gt; −0.00431&amp;nbsp;V,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gary|first1=Robert|last2=Bates|first2=Roger G.|last3=Robinson|first3=R.

:2&amp;nbsp;D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 2&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

Also difference occur when [[hydrogen deuteride]] is used instead of hydrogen in the electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wakao|first1=S.|last2=Yonemura|first2=Y.|title=Anodic polarization behaviour of hydride-deuteride electrodes|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|date=February 1983|volume=89|issue=2|pages=481–488|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(83)90359-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme of the standard hydrogen electrode:

# [[Platinum black|platinized]] platinum electrode
# hydrogen blow
# solution of the acid with activity of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;mol&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
# hydroseal for prevention of the oxygen interference
# reservoir through which the second half-element of the galvanic cell should be attached. The connection can be direct, through a narrow tube to reduce mixing, or through a [[salt bridge]], depending on the other  electrode and solution. This creates an ionically conductive path to the working electrode of interest.

'''Swissa''' was a popular [[typewriter]] brand of the post-war era. The Swissa was made by the company Birchmeier`s Söhne in [[Murgenthal]] (Aargau) and was based on the technical developments of the Patria typewriters. The Swissa Typewriters received much attention due to their product design.

[[File:Swissa Frontseite manual 03.jpg|thumb|Swissa Frontseite manual 03]]

== History and technical developments ==
=== Beginnings ===
Swissa`s predecessor - the Patria - was invented by Otto Haas&lt;ref&gt;Magazine: “ETCetera, Journal of the Early Typewriter Collectors’ Association”, by Will Davis, issue 80, December 2007, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; and produced in Switzerland beginning in 1936. 
The Company Patria started as a ski and ski poles manufacturer in 1908. It branched out into producing typewriters in 1936 initially at its factory in Büttenbergweg 5, Pierterlen, Switzerland (the factory building is still standing, as of May 2018). 
The first typewriter was a portable typewriter designed by Carl Winterling (of the Archo typewriter Company) based on the idea of engineer Otto Haas.

=== Technical developments ===
In 1933, Otto Haas filed a patent for the Patria Typewriter. In it, Otto Haas described his thoughts on his concept for a truly portable/compact typewriter. “In order to fully meet the requirements connected with the construction of an easily portable or travelling typewriter it is necessary to pay regard to the aforementioned conditions in a far greater measure than has heretofore been done in practice. For the purpose in view the dimensions of the typewriter and its parts must be kept so small, that it may conveniently be carried in a small travelling bag, and, accordingly, the weight of the typewriter must be quite considerably reduced, as compared with herefore constructed portable typewriters”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2039991A/en|title=Typewriter|website=Patents.google.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early production ===
In 1936 the Patria typewriter was shown at the Swiss tradeshow „Basler Mustermesse” 
In the same year, the production of the portable typewriter began in Pieterlen near Biel (Katon Bern). For this purpose the " A.G.für Schreibmaschinen-Fabrikation, Pieterlen, Schweiz” whose name translates to “Factory for Typewriters, Pieterlen, Switzerland” had been founded. Investors were the industrial families Chessex and Lutz.

The Engineer Otto Haas had settled in Teufenthal (Aargau) and brought his machine to production maturity together with Ch.Werner, Josef Brönner and Hermann Wasem.

In 1938/39 the corporation was dissolved, but seamlessly continued by the same family Lutz as "Patria-Schreibmaschinen GmbH" in Zurich.
The first Patria typewriter was only produced for three years up to 1938 when it moved its factory from Pieterlen to Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumaargau.ch/blog/objekt-des-monats-nr-40-die-schreibmaschine-swissa-junior-von-august-birchermeiers-soehne/|title=Objekt des Monats Nr. 40: Die Schreibmaschine SWISSA Junior von August Birchermeier’s Söhne – Museum Aargau|website=Museumaargau.ch|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence, not many Patria typewriters were labelled "A.G. für Schreibmaschinen-Fabrikation - Pieterlen (Schweiz)" on the front of the typewriter - most are labelled "Patria Schreibmaschinen Gesellschaft (Zürich)" as the Zurich factory produced these typewriters up till 1943.
 
After 1943 the Patria was produced by August Birchmeier`s sons, Murgenthal, Canton of Aargau, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Kunzmann, Hundert Jahre Schreibmaschinen im Büro. Geschichte des maschinellen Schreibens, Merkur Verlag Rinteln, 1979 ({{ISBN|3-8120-0373-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;
The first Patria models were known to be sturdy and solid and were even used by the Swiss Army.

In 1944, the architect, artist and designer [[Max Bill]] (1908-1994) was commissioned to redesign the Patria and designed an external form that became the archetype of the modern portable typewriter par excellence.&lt;ref&gt;The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts by Gordon Campbell. Oxford University Press; 1 edition (November 9, 2006), {{ISBN|0195189485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production of the Swissa ==
August Birchmeier's sons continued to manufacture after World War II and launched the machine in 1950 under the name “SWISSA”. The continuity is obvious: The "Patria" designed by Max Bill is identical to the "SWISSA" except for the brand name.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Kunzmann, Hundert Jahre Schreibmaschinen im Büro. Geschichte des maschinellen Schreibens, Merkur Verlag Rinteln, 1979 ({{ISBN|3-8120-0373-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== About the manufacturer ===
[[File:Swissa Frontseite manual 02.jpg|thumb|Swissa Frontseite manual 02]]
August Birchmeier`s Sons (August Birchmeier`s Söhne) was founded in 1908 by the eponymous founder as stamping tools factory August Birchmeier in Murgenthal, Canton of Aargau (from 1911 in the commercial register). 
In 1922 August Birchmeier died but his widow continued the workshop. 
In 1935 the sons took over the business: "August Birchmeier's sons" was founded. 
From 1931 to 1936 the company grew with the production of furniture fittings and locks. In the post-war years Birchmeier`s began the production of a portable typewriters.
1952/52 August Birchmeier`s sons set up a second plant in Wolfwil [Canton of Solothurn] (distance only 5 kilometers from Murgenthal).

In 1963 the toolmaking shop was relocated to the new factory. Around 1965 the typewriter SWISSA was produced in Murgenthal and furniture fittings and stamped products and other metal goods in Wolfwil.

The typewriter factory remained operational for 30 years until the late 1970s. On 31.5.1995 the company "August Birchmeier Sons" was deleted from the Swiss Commercial Register.

=== Swissa product lines ===
In 1950, the name changes from "Patria" to "Swissa Piccolo". All other models of the "Birchmeier Patria" now run under the brand name Swissa.
The following models were produced by August Birchmeier`s Sons until 1980 when production ceased:

* Swissa piccola (from 1950 to 1958)
* Swissa junior (from 1958),
* Swissa juneusse (until the 1970s)
* Swiss junior 4th (until the 1970s)
* "Helvetia" was an export variant of Swissa piccola.

== Patria family ==
The Swissa was sold all over Europe. However, a whole family of portable typewriters common throughout Europe had, as its base, the Patria of Switzerland. This machine's basic design was eventually produced via licensing agreements in England, France, Germany and Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://typewriters.ch/collection/patria_typewriter.html|title=Patria typewriter|website=Typewriters.ch|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes 
* In France: Japy, Byron, Typo, Select and Patria 
Japy acquires a license to manufacture the Swiss Patria typewriter. The result is the Japy, model P6, which was produced from 1937 to 1948. The P6 was mechanically a "Patria", but had its own design. 
From 1949 to 1959, the second design of the Patria typewriter, now SWISSA piccolo, which was designed by Max Bill, was made by Japy. The machines were called "P68" or "Japy Personelle".
In the 1960`s the JAPY SCRIPT was adopted, which was a later restyling, if only in the change to two-tone flat enamel paint, as opposed to single-color crinkle finish paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.widerstandsraeume.de/radikal-persoenlich/objekte/vervielfaeltigungsgeraet-japy/firma-japy/|title=Firma Japy - Widerstandsräume|website=Widerstandsraeume.de|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the UK: as the post-war Oliver and the Oliver Courier, 
The post-war Oliver Portable and Oliver Courier, were based perfectly on the original Patria design. This was the third Oliver portable typewriter design—the first was the Europa, the next the similar Italian-made SIM.

* In Spain: the Patria, Amaya, Pulasatta, Florida and Königer
The spanish Patria typewriter came on the market in 1947. “Spanish and Swiss technology and experience united have produced this gem of the mechanographic art for you,” states some early advertising. The Patria was recommended to “all those who need to bring work home, but do not wish to give their place of residence the sobriety of an office.” The Patria was distributed throughout Spain by Guillermo Trúniger, S.A., with a good deal of success. It was exported in small quantities as early as 1950 (one Patria sold in Canada and marked “Eaton’s” appears to be a Spanish product).&lt;ref&gt;Magazine: “ETCetera, Journal of the Early Typewriter Collectors’ Association”, by Alfredo Sirvent, Fransu Marín, and Richard Polt, issue 89, March 2010, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the magazine was entirely Internet-based with its journalists living all over the world and filing copy online, though in recent years it has been edited from Incisive Media's offices in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33419 | publisher=The Inquirer | date=2 August 2006 | title=All journalism will be Indian journalism one day | accessdate=23 August 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830182432/http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33419 | archivedate=30 August 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although traditionally a 'red top', under ''Incisive Media'' it has put more weight behind its journalism, reducing the number of jibes at companies, and moved instead towards sponsored online debates in association with high-profile organisations, most recently, Intel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://communities.intel.com/community/itpeernetwork/blog/2014/05/12/the-effect-of-the-internet-of-things-on-user-privacy-part-1 | publisher=Intel | date=12 May 2014 | title=The Effect of the Internet of Things on User Privacy: Part 1 | accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoops==

===Sony Laptop Battery Scandal===
In 2006 ''The Inquirer'' reported laptop battery problems that affected [[Dell]], [[Sony]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] as of September 2006, with rumours of problems at [[Toshiba]] and [[Lenovo Group|Lenovo]]. In June 2006, ''The Inquirer'' published photographs of a Dell notebook PC bursting into flames at a conference in Japan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 | publisher=The Inquirer | date=21 June 2006 | title=Dell laptop explodes at Japanese conference | accessdate=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'', and others,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} reprinted ''The Inquirer'''s photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/10/technology/10dell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Inquirer'' was also the first publication to report Dell's subsequent decision to recall faulty batteries, according to ''[[BusinessWeek]]''.&lt;ref name="bw-dell-recall"/&gt;

''The Inquirer''''s successful reporting of the story relied on information supplied by readers and later by a confidential source at Dell. "I attribute being on top of the story to old-fashioned print journalism standards — cultivating, and, if you'll excuse the pun, not burning such contacts," ''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s founder, Mike Magee, told BusinessWeek.&lt;ref name="bw-dell-recall"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-08-29/the-battery-recall-a-win-for-the-web | publisher=BusinessWeek | date=30 August 2006 | title=The Battery Recall: A Win for the Web | accessdate=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rydermark===
In July 2006, ''The Inquirer'' posted images to show cheating by [[NVIDIA]] Windows device drivers in ''Rydermark 2006''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1011446/rydermark-screenshots-back-california-graphics-fudge The Inquirer, 18 July 2006: ''Rydermark screenshots back California graphics fudge''] (cited 4 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The images were alleged to be fake by a number of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Such as:
*[http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=3400 DailyTech, 19 July 2006: ''"Rydermark" Cheating Allegations Discredited''] (cited 23 August 2006)

&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Inquirer'' denied any wrongdoing and quoted the maker of Rydermark calling the allegations against them "irresponsible".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060722010351/http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33131 The Inquirer, 19 July 2006: ''Rydermark maker labels hoax allegations 'irresponsible' ''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; About 8 months after the original Rydermark article, ''The Inquirer'' ran another article claiming that Rydermark was still being developed, but was near release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.theinquirer.net/?article=37716 The Inquirer, 19 February 2007: ''Rydermark benchmark lives. It's almost done''] (cited 28 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In response, one of its critics offered $1,000 to a charity of the Rydermark articles author's choosing if he could produce (breaching his [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]]) a version of Rydermark that showed the alleged screenshots in full-motion video before a set deadline (which gave the author 10 and a half hours, beginning at 6:30PM UK time). No one produced the program before the deadline passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristopher| last=Kubicki | url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=6149 | title=DailyTech Digest: RyderMark, My take on RyderMark's newest incarnation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent verification that RyderMark was genuine, first appeared in TweakTown in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/1103/1/page_1_introduction/index.html, 16 May 2007: ''TweakTown: RyderMark Beta 2 Preview - Emerging competition for Futuremark?''] (cited 17 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  RyderMark developer Ajith Ram denied ever sending the Inquirer NVIDIA cheating allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristopher | last=Kubicki | url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=7396 | title=RyderMark Developer: We Never Said NVIDIA Cheated |publisher=DailyTech |accessdate=2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATI Intel front side bus license revocation===
On 24 July 2006, ''The Inquirer'' wrote that, in response to AMD's announced intent to purchase ATI, "ATI had its chipset license pulled, or at least not renewed by Intel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33225 | publisher=The Inquirer | date=24 July 2006 | title=Intel pulls ATI bus licence | accessdate=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATI responded by stating that its license had not been revoked and that they continue to ship Intel chipsets under license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enthusiast.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTEyNSwxLCxoZW50aHVzaWFzdA== | publisher=H Enthusiast | date=26 July 2006 | title=AMD &amp; ATI Answers to Rumormongering | accessdate=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 2006, ATI showed its chipset roadmap to motherboard vendors which showed that next-generation chipsets for the Intel platform are cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/chipsets/display/20060823235224.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829125617/http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/chipsets/display/20060823235224.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |title=News - Thursday, August 28, 2008|publisher=www.xbitlabs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2007, AMD said that they would continue developing chipsets for Intel platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitimes.com/NewsShow/MailHome.asp?datePublish=2007/3/1&amp;pages=PD&amp;seq=214 | publisher=DigiTimes | date=1 March 2007 | title=AMD keeping open platform strategy: Q&amp;A with sales and marketing vice president Jochen Polster | accessdate=3 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows 10 Technical Preview Eavesdropping===
On 3 October 2014, ''The Inquirer'' reported on the privacy policy for the Technical Preview the upcoming ''Microsoft'' ''Windows 10'' operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2373838/microsofts-windows-10-preview-has-permission-to-watch-your-every-move | publisher=The Inquirer | date=3 October 2014 | title=Microsoft's Windows 10 Preview has permission to watch your every move | accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, it pointed out that the permissions included the ability for Microsoft to monitor individual keystrokes as well as file content from users. The story was picked up by news media around the world causing Microsoft to admit that monitoring was a necessary part of the process, but denying use of a keylogger.

''Ed Bott'', writing for ''ZDNet'' accused the site of being "a tech tabloid known for its breathless headlines and factually challenged prose" and said of writer Chris Merriman, "there’s little evidence that the author has enough background in computer science or security to tell a keylogger from a key lime pie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/windows-10-youve-got-questions-ive-got-answers-7000034462/ | publisher=ZDNet | date=23 October 2014 | title=Windows 10: You've Got Questions, I've Got Answers | accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''New Age of Innovation: Driving Cocreated Value Through Global Networks''''' ({{ISBN|9780071598286}}) is a book by [[University of Michigan]] [[Ross School of Business]] Professors [[C. K. Prahalad]] and [[M. S. Krishnan]] published in April 2008.  The book outlines a new strategic path for companies in the 21st century.

== Book Summary ==
In the first chapter, Prahalad and Krishnan outline their central [[thesis]]; that there are new managerial demands in business, requiring new sources of value creation.  They argue that these demands have created an N=1 and R=G environment, where companies need to customize their product for each customer by gaining access to a new array of suppliers.

The book argues that the old sources of [[competitive advantage]] -technology, labor, and capital – are fading and that new sources are emerging.  Prahalad and Krishnan suggest an internal capacity to reconfigure resources in real time by focusing on clearly documented, transparent, and resilient [[business processes]] (the link between strategy, business models and operations) has become a strong differentiator.  They also argue that a focus on [[co-creation]], by developing an R=G supply network and emphasizing analytics which identify trends and unique opportunities can create a strong competitive advantage. The technical architecture required to develop these flexible and resilient business processes and strong analytics capabilities is outlined in the book. 

The last four chapters describe how to implement these new strategies.  Recognizing that many companies have fragmented and archaic systems, the book describes typical problems that occur when migrating to an N=1 and R=G friendly system.  Prahalad and Krishnan emphasize the importance of a social architecture with strong linkages between managers and the technical architecture.  They also outline the necessity for companies to recruit new skills from around the world and use [[globalization]] to its advantage.

== Key Concepts ==

The book argues that "the industrial system as we know it has been morphing for some time. Now it may have reached an inflection point.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newageofinnovation.com/blog/archives/2008/04/the_inflection.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prahalad and Krishnan outline the approach that firms in the new economy must take to survive and become successful.  The previous choice between low cost and differentiation is rarely the chief strategic choice anymore, firms must achieve what Prahalad and Krishnan call N=1 and R=G.

=== N=1 ===
N=1 requires companies to focus on the importance of individual customer experiences and tailor their product accordingly.  It requires that companies have resilient, dynamic and flexible business processes.  They also emphasize the importance of strong analytics which allow management to discover trends and unique opportunities and enable the company to engage in product [[co-creation]] with their consumer base.

=== R=G ===
R=G advises firms take a horizontal approach to supply rather than [[vertical integration]].  The focus is on obtaining access, rather than ownership, to resources from an array of suppliers both inside and outside the firm.  R=G provides the best opportunity for firms to leverage the necessary resources to co-create a personalized experience for each customer.  R=G is often mistaken as a suggestion to [[outsource]], however this is often not the case, as there are many notable instances where it makes sense for companies to leverage local resources to fulfill a personalized demand model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newageofinnovation.com/blog/archives/2008/04/does_rg_equal_o.html New Age Of Innovation | Does R=G Equal Outsourcing? Not Necessarily | C.K. Prahalad &amp; M.S. Krishnan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermite''' ({{IPAc-en|'|θ|ɜːr|m|aɪ|t}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Longman pronunciation dictionary|last=Wells|first=John C.|publisher=Longman|year=1990|isbn=0-582-05383-8|location=Harlow, England|page=715|pages=}} entry "thermite"
&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[pyrotechnic composition]] of [[powder metallurgy|metal powder]], which serves as [[fuel]], and [[metal oxide]]. When ignited by heat, thermite undergoes an [[exothermic]] [[redox|reduction-oxidation]] (redox) reaction. Most varieties are not explosive, but can create brief bursts of heat and high temperature in a small area. Its form of action is similar to that of other fuel-oxidizer mixtures, such as [[gunpowder|black powder]].

Thermites have diverse compositions. Fuels include [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[zinc]], [[silicon]], and [[boron]]. Aluminium is common because of its high [[boiling point]] and low cost. Oxidizers include [[bismuth(III) oxide]], [[boron(III) oxide]], [[silicon(IV) oxide]], [[chromium(III) oxide]], [[manganese(IV) oxide]], [[iron(III) oxide]], [[iron(II,III) oxide]], [[copper(II) oxide]], and [[lead(II,IV) oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1yJNr92-YcC&amp;pg=RA2-PA19|title=Pyrotechnic Chemistry&amp;nbsp;— Google Books |publisher=|date= December 2004|accessdate=15 September 2009|isbn=978-1-889526-15-7|author1=Kosanke|first1=K|last2=Kosanke|first2=B.

The reaction, also called the '''Goldschmidt process''', is used for [[Exothermic welding|thermite welding]], often used to join [[rail track]]s. Thermites have also been used in metal refining, disabling munitions, and in [[incendiary device|incendiary weapons]]. Some thermite-like mixtures are used as [[pyrotechnic initiator]]s in [[fireworks]].

== Chemical reactions ==
[[Image:ThermiteReaction.jpg|thumb|upright|A thermite reaction using iron(III) oxide. The sparks flying outwards are globules of molten iron trailing smoke in their wake.]]
In the following example, elemental aluminium reduces the oxide of another [[metal]], in this common example [[iron oxide]], because aluminium forms stronger and more stable bonds with oxygen than iron:

: Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Al → 2 Fe + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The products are [[aluminium oxide]], elemental [[iron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilpi.com/genchem/demo/thermite/index.html |title=Demo Lab: The Thermite Reaction |publisher=Ilpi.com|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large amount of [[heat]]. The reactants are commonly [[powder (substance)|powdered]] and mixed with a binder to keep the material solid and prevent separation.

Other metal oxides can be used, such as chromium oxide, to generate the given metal in its elemental form. For example, a [[copper]] thermite reaction using copper oxide and elemental aluminium can be used for creating electric joints in a process called [[cadwelding]], that produces elemental copper (it may react violently):

: 3 CuO + 2 Al → 3 Cu + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Thermites with nanosized particles are described by a variety of terms, such as [[metastable intermolecular composite]]s, super-thermite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navysbir.com/n08_1/N081-020.htm |title=Low-Cost Production of Nanostructured Super-Thermites |publisher=Navysbir.com |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nano-thermite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/prep.200700273|title=Development of Nanothermite Composites with Variable Electrostatic Discharge Ignition Thresholds|year=2007|last1=Foley|first1=Timothy|last2=Pacheco|first2=Adam|last3=Malchi|first3=Jonathan|last4=Yetter|first4=Richard|last5=Higa|first5=Kelvin|journal=Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics|volume=32|issue=6|pages=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nanocomposite energetic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ci.confex.com/ci/2005/techprogram/P1663.HTM |title=Reaction Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Nanothermite Propellants |publisher=Ci.confex.com|accessdate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2787972|title=Generation of fast propagating combustion and shock waves with copper oxide/aluminum nanothermite composites|year=2007|last1=Apperson|first1=S.|last2=Shende|first2=R.

== History ==
The thermite (''thermit'') reaction was discovered in 1893 and [[patent]]ed in 1895 by German [[chemist]] [[Hans Goldschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt, H. (13 March 1895) "Verfahren zur Herstellung von Metallen oder Metalloiden oder Legierungen derselben" (Process for the production of metals or metalloids or alloys of the same), Deutsche Reichs Patent no. 96317.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the reaction is sometimes called the "Goldschmidt reaction" or "Goldschmidt process". Goldschmidt was originally interested in producing very pure metals by avoiding the use of [[carbon]] in [[smelting]], but he soon discovered the value of thermite in [[welding]].&lt;ref name="JotSoCI"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pyrobin.com/files/thermit%28e%29%20journal.pdf |first1=Hans |last1=Goldschmidt |author-link=Hans Goldschmidt |first2=Claude |last2=Vautin |title=Aluminium as a Heating and Reducing Agent |journal=[[Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry]] |volume=6 |issue=17 |pages=543–545 |date=30 June 1898 |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715133307/http://www.pyrobin.com/files/thermit%28e%29%20journal.pdf |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial application of thermite was the welding of [[tram]] tracks in [[Essen]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldschmidt-thermit.com/en/gtg_3.php |title=Goldschmidt-Thermit-Group |publisher=Goldschmidt-thermit.com |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405044624/http://www.goldschmidt-thermit.com/en/gtg_3.php |archivedate=5 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red iron(III) oxide (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, commonly known as [[rust]]) is the most common iron oxide used in thermite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QKBQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TCIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6875,1422491 |title=Thermite Bombs used to Set Fires |publisher=The Milwaukee Journal |date=1 December 1939 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lR8sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I7oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5630,1866720 |title=what it Means: Thermite Bombing |publisher=the Florence Times |date=31 August 1940 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/science/hydrogen-may-not-have-caused-hindenburg-s-fiery-end.html?pagewanted=all |title=Hydrogen May Not Have Caused Hindenburg's Fiery End |work=The New York Times |date=6 May 1997 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnetite]] also works.&lt;ref name="amazingrust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazingrust.com/experiments/how_to/thermite.html |title=Thermite |publisher=Amazing Rust.com |date=7 February 2001 |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707122232/http://amazingrust.com/experiments/how_to/thermite.html |archivedate=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other oxides are occasionally used, such as [[manganese(IV) oxide|MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in manganese thermite, [[chromium(III) oxide|Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] in chromium thermite, quartz in silicon thermite, or copper(II) oxide in copper thermite, but only for specialized purposes.&lt;ref name="amazingrust"/&gt; All of these examples use aluminium as the reactive metal. [[Fluoropolymers]] can be used in special formulations, [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] with magnesium or aluminium being a relatively common example. [[Magnesium/teflon/viton]] is another [[pyrolant]] of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1521-4087(200211)27:5&lt;262::AID-PREP262&gt;3.0.CO;2-8 |title=Metal-Fluorocarbon-Pyrolants: III.

Combinations of dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) and reducing agents such as magnesium, aluminium and boron follow the same chemical reaction as with traditional thermite mixtures, producing metal oxides and carbon.  Despite the very cold temperature of a dry ice thermite mixture, such a system is capable of being ignited with a flame.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xCbal2YyaE&lt;/ref&gt; When the ingredients are finely divided, confined in a pipe and armed like a traditional explosive, this cryo-thermite is detonatable and a portion of the carbon liberated in the reaction emerges in the form of [[diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2710026/summary.html |title=Method For Creating Diamonds|last=Swanson|first=Daren|date=2007-12-21|website=www.EnviroDiamond.com|publisher=Daren Swanson|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, any reactive metal could be used instead of aluminium. This is rarely done, because the properties of aluminium are nearly ideal for this reaction:

* It is by far the cheapest of the highly reactive metals. For example, in December 2014, tin was US$19,830/metric ton, zinc was US$2,180/t and aluminium was US$1,910/t.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/ |title=Commodity Prices |publisher=IndexMundi |accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It forms a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer making it safer to handle than many other reactive metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/B:JMSC.0000044879.63364.b3|title=The role of the Al2O3passivation shell surrounding nano-Al particles in the combustion synthesis of NiAl|year=2004|last1=Granier|first1=J. J.|last2=Plantier|first2=K. B.|last3=Pantoya|first3=M. L.|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=39|issue=21|pages=6421|bibcode = 2004JMatS..39.6421G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Its relatively low [[melting point]] (660&amp;nbsp;°C) means that it is easy to melt the metal, so that the reaction can occur mainly in the liquid phase and thus proceeds fairly quickly.
* Its high [[boiling point]] (2519&amp;nbsp;°C) enables the reaction to reach very high temperatures, since several processes tend to limit the maximum temperature to just below the boiling point. Such a high boiling point is common among transition metals (e.g., iron and copper boil at 2887&amp;nbsp;°C and 2582&amp;nbsp;°C respectively), but is especially unusual among the highly reactive metals (cf. magnesium and [[sodium]], which boil at 1090&amp;nbsp;°C and 883&amp;nbsp;°C respectively).
* Further, the low density of the aluminium oxide formed as a result of the reaction tends to cause it to float on the resultant pure metal. This is particularly important for reducing contamination in a weld.

Although the reactants are stable at room temperature, they burn with an extremely intense [[exothermic reaction]] when they are heated to ignition temperature. The products emerge as liquids due to the high temperatures reached (up to 2500&amp;nbsp;°C with iron(III) oxide)—although the actual temperature reached depends on how quickly heat can escape to the surrounding environment. Thermite contains its own supply of oxygen and does not require any external source of air. Consequently, it cannot be smothered, and may ignite in any environment given sufficient initial heat. It burns well while wet, and cannot be easily extinguished with water—though enough water to remove sufficient heat may stop the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(01)00280-3 |title=Water/magma interaction: some theory and experiments on peperite formation|year=2002|last1=Wohletz|first1=Kenneth|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=114|pages=19|bibcode = 2002JVGR..114...19W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of water boil before reaching the reaction. Even so, thermite is used for welding underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah Lyall |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/27/world/europe/27camera.html?pagewanted=all |title=Cameras Catch Speeding Britons and Lots of Grief  |work=The New York Times |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermites are characterized by almost complete absence of gas production during burning, high reaction temperature, and production of molten [[slag]]. The fuel should have high heat of combustion and produce oxides with low melting point and high boiling point. The oxidizer should contain at least 25% oxygen, have high density, low heat of formation, and produce metal with low melting and high boiling point (so the energy released is not consumed in evaporation of reaction products). Organic binders can be added to the composition to improve its mechanical properties, however they tend to produce endothermic decomposition products, causing some loss of reaction heat and production of gases.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt;

The temperature achieved during the reaction determines the outcome. In an ideal case, the reaction produces a well-separated melt of metal and slag. For this, the temperature must be high enough to melt both reaction products, the resulting metal and the fuel oxide. Too low a temperature produces a mixture of sintered metal and slag; too high a temperature (above the boiling point of any reactant or product) leads to rapid production of gas, dispersing the burning reaction mixture, sometimes with effects similar to a low-yield explosion. In compositions intended for production of metal by [[aluminothermic reaction]], these effects can be counteracted. Too low a reaction temperature (e.g., when producing silicon from sand) can be boosted with addition of a suitable oxidizer (e.g., sulfur in aluminium-sulfur-sand compositions); too high a temperature can be reduced by using a suitable coolant and/or slag [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]]. The flux often used in amateur compositions is [[calcium fluoride]], as it reacts only minimally, has relatively low melting point, low melt viscosity at high temperatures (therefore increasing fluidity of the slag) and forms a eutectic with alumina. Too much of flux however dilutes the reactants to the point of not being able to sustain combustion. The type of metal oxide also has dramatic influence to the amount of energy produced; the higher the oxide, the higher the amount of energy produced. A good example is the difference between [[manganese(IV) oxide]] and [[manganese(II) oxide]], where the former produces too high temperature and the latter is barely able to sustain combustion; to achieve good results a mixture with proper ratio of both oxides should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developing-your-web-presence.blogspot.com/2008/07/manganese-thermite-based-on-manganese.html |title=Manganese thermite based on manganese (II) oxide |publisher=Developing your Web presence |date=10 July 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction rate can be also tuned with particle sizes; coarser particles burn slower than finer particles. The effect is more pronounced with the particles requiring being heated to higher temperature to start reacting. This effect is pushed to the extreme with [[nano-thermite]]s.

The temperature achieved in the reaction in [[adiabatic process|adiabatic conditions]], when no heat is lost to the environment, can be estimated using the [[Hess's law]] – by calculating the energy produced by the reaction itself (subtracting the enthalpy of the reactants from the enthalpy of the products) and subtracting the energy consumed to heating the products (from their specific heat, when the materials only change their temperature, and their [[enthalpy of fusion]] and eventually [[enthalpy of vaporization]], when the materials melt or boil). In real conditions, the reaction loses heat to the environment, the achieved temperature is therefore somewhat lower. The heat transfer rate is finite, so the faster the reaction is, the closer to adiabatic condition it runs and the higher is the achieved temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gupta, Chiranjib Kumar |title=Chemical Metallurgy: Principles and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tq6MTFXk3cQC&amp;pg=PA387 |date= 2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-60525-5|pages=387–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron thermite ===
The most common composition is the iron thermite. The oxidizer used is usually either [[iron(III) oxide]] or [[iron(II,III) oxide]]. The former produces more heat. The latter is easier to ignite, likely due to the crystal structure of the oxide. Addition of copper or manganese oxides can significantly improve the ease of ignition.

The original mixture, as invented, used iron oxide in the form of [[mill scale]]. The composition was very difficult to ignite.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. Kosanke|author2=B. J.

=== Copper thermite ===
Copper thermite can be prepared using either [[copper(I) oxide]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, red) or [[copper(II) oxide]] (CuO, black). The burn rate tends to be very fast and the melting point of copper is relatively low so the reaction produces a significant amount of molten copper in a very short time.  Copper(II) thermite reactions can be so fast that copper thermite can be considered a type of [[flash powder]].  An explosion can occur and send a spray of copper drops to considerable distance.&lt;ref name="pyroguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pyroguide.com/index.php?title=Thermite |title=Thermite |publisher=PyroGuide |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper(I) thermite has industrial uses in e.g., welding of thick copper conductors ("[[cadwelding]]"). This kind of welding is being evaluated also for cable splicing on the US Navy fleet, for use in high-current systems, e.g., electric propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hts.asminternational.org/portal/site/hts/NewsItem/?vgnextoid=a7879c63e1681310VgnVCM100000621e010aRCRD |title=HTS &gt; News Item |publisher=Hts.asminternational.org |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermates ===
{{main article|Thermate}}
Thermate composition is a thermite one enriched with a salt-based oxidizer (usually nitrates, e.g., [[barium nitrate]], or peroxides). In contrast with thermites, thermates burn with evolution of flame and gases. The presence of the oxidizer makes the mixture easier to ignite and improves penetration of target by the burning composition, as the evolved gas is projecting the molten slag and providing mechanical agitation.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt; This mechanism makes thermate more suitable than thermite for [[incendiary weapon|incendiary purposes]] and for emergency destruction of sensitive equipment (e.g., cryptographic devices), as thermite's effect is more localized.

== Ignition ==
[[Image:ThermiteFe2O3.JPG|thumb|left|A thermite reaction using iron(III) oxide]]
[[Metals]] can burn under the right conditions, similar to the [[combustion]] process of wood or gasoline. In fact, rust is the result of [[oxidation]] of [[steel]] or iron at very slow rates. A thermite reaction is a process in which the correct mixture of metallic fuels combine and ignite. Ignition itself requires extremely high temperatures.

Ignition of a thermite reaction normally requires a [[sparkler]] or easily obtainable magnesium ribbon, but may require persistent efforts, as ignition can be unreliable and unpredictable. These temperatures cannot be reached with conventional [[black powder]] [[fuse (explosive)|fuses]], [[nitrocellulose]] rods, [[detonator]]s, [[pyrotechnic initiator]]s, or other common igniting substances.&lt;ref name="amazingrust"/&gt; Even when the thermite is hot enough to glow bright red, it doesn't ignite, as it must be at or near white-hot to initiate the reaction.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} It is possible to start the reaction using a [[propane torch]] if done correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/thermites.html |title=Richard Nakka's Experimental Rocketry Site |publisher=Nakka-rocketry.net |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, strips of [[magnesium]] metal are used as [[Fuse (explosives)|fuses]]. Because metals burn without releasing cooling gases, they can potentially burn at extremely high temperatures. Reactive metals such as magnesium can easily reach temperatures sufficiently high for thermite ignition. Magnesium ignition remains popular among amateur thermite users, mainly because it can be easily obtained.&lt;ref name="amazingrust"/&gt;

The reaction between [[potassium permanganate]] and [[glycerol]] or [[ethylene glycol]] is used as an alternative to the magnesium method. When these two substances mix, a spontaneous reaction begins, slowly increasing the temperature of the mixture until it produces flames. The heat released by the oxidation of glycerine is sufficient to initiate a thermite reaction.&lt;ref name="amazingrust"/&gt;

Apart from magnesium ignition, some amateurs also choose to use sparklers to ignite the thermite mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2004/s1205680.htm |title=The World Today – Virgin Blue security scare |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=23 September 2004 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reach the necessary temperatures and provide enough time before the burning point reaches the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray |first=Theodore |url=http://www.popsci.com/node/2865 |title=Making Steel with Beach Sand &amp;#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=19 August 2004 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be a dangerous method, as the iron [[Spark (fire)|sparks]], like the magnesium strips, burn at thousands of degrees and can ignite the thermite even though the sparkler itself is not in contact with it. This is especially dangerous with finely powdered thermite.

Similarly, finely powdered thermite can be ignited by a [[flint spark lighter]], as the sparks are burning metal (in this case, the highly reactive [[rare-earth metals]] [[lanthanum]] and [[cerium]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shurlite.com/msds.pdf |title=Material Safety Data Sheet Lighter Flints Ferro Cerrium |publisher=shurlite.com |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is unsafe to strike a lighter close to thermite.

Thermite reactions have many uses. Thermite is not an explosive; instead it operates by exposing a very small area to extremely high temperatures. Intense heat focused on a small spot can be used to cut through metal or weld metal components together both by melting metal from the components, and by injecting molten metal from the thermite reaction itself.

Thermite may be used for repair by the welding in-place of thick steel sections such as [[locomotive]] [[axle]]-frames where the repair can take place without removing the part from its installed location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffus|first1=Larry|title=Welding principles and applications|date=2012|publisher=Delmar Cengage Learning|location=Clifton Park, N.Y.|isbn=1111039178|pages=744|edition=7th|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=uU0gBN2aYSgC&amp;pg=PA744&amp;dq=thermite+welding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAsciK06nUAhVBDCwKHbwLC_wQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=thermite%20welding&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermite can be used for quickly cutting or welding steel such as [[rail tracks]], without requiring complex or heavy equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TS19061115.2.43 |title=Papers Past — Star — 15 November 1906 — NEW WELDING PROCESS |publisher=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date=15 November 1906 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wHw1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6875,1950492 |title=How Many Ways to Weld Metal? |publisher=Eugene Register-Guard |date=8 December 1987 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, defects such as slag inclusions and voids (holes) are often present in such welded junctions and great care is needed to operate the process successfully.  The numerical analysis of thermite welding of rails has been approached similar to casting cooling analysis.  Both this [[finite element analysis]] and experimental analysis of thermite rail welds has shown that weld gap is the most influential parameter affecting defect formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y|last2=Lawrence|first2=F V|last3=Barkan|first3=C P L|last4=Dantzig|first4=J A|title=Heat transfer modelling of rail thermite welding|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit|date=24 October 2006|volume=220|issue=3|pages=207–217|doi=10.1243/09544097F01505}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasing weld gap has been shown to reduce shrinkage cavity formation and cold lap [[welding defect]]s, and increasing preheat and thermite temperature further reduces these defects.  However, reducing these defects promotes a second form of defect: microporosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y|last2=Lawrence|first2=F V|last3=Barkan|first3=C P L|last4=Dantzig|first4=J A|title=Weld defect formation in rail thermite welds|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit|date=14 December 2006|volume=220|issue=4|pages=373–384|doi=10.1243/0954409JRRT44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Care must also be taken to ensure that the rails remain straight, without resulting in dipped joints, which can cause wear on high speed and heavy axle load lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2063863/Strengthening-the-track-structure-for.html |title=Strengthening the track structure for heavy axle loads: strengthening track infrastructure provides another method of dealing with ever-increasing car capacities.

A thermite reaction, when used to purify the [[ore]]s of some metals, is called the {{vanchor|thermite process}}, or aluminothermic reaction. An adaptation of the reaction, used to obtain pure [[uranium]], was developed as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] at [[Ames Laboratory]] under the direction of [[Frank Spedding]]. It is sometimes called the [[Ames process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 2830894 | status = patent | title = Production of Uranium | gdate = {{Date|1958|04|02}} | fdate = {{Date|1947|11|07}} | invent1 = Spedding, Frank H. | invent2 = Wilhelm, Harley A. | invent3 = Keller, Wayne H. | assign1 = [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] | accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper thermite is used for welding together thick copper wires for the purpose of electrical connections. It is used extensively by the electrical utilities and telecommunications industries ([[exothermic welded connection]]s).

== Military uses ==
Thermite [[hand grenade]]s and charges are typically used by armed forces in both an anti-[[materiel]] role and in the partial destruction of equipment; the latter being common when time is not available for safer or more thorough methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmike.com/Grenades/fm-23-30.pdf |title=Grenades and Pyrotechnics Signals.

Because standard iron-thermite is difficult to ignite, burns with practically no flame and has a small radius of action, standard thermite is rarely used on its own as an incendiary composition. In general, an increase in the volume of gaseous [[Chemical reaction|reaction products]] of a thermite blend increases the heat transfer rate (and therefore damage) of that particular thermite blend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Eric S.|last2=Pantoya|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Daniels|first3=Michael A.|last4=Prentice|first4=Daniel J.|last5=Steffler|first5=Eric D.|last6=D’Arche|first6=Steven P.|title=Heat Flux Analysis of a Reacting Thermite Spray Impingent on a Substrate|journal=Energy &amp; Fuels|date=15 March 2012|volume=26|issue=3|pages=1621–1628|doi=10.1021/ef201954d}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used with other ingredients that increase its incendiary effects.

A classic military use for thermite is disabling [[artillery]] pieces, and it has been used for this purpose since World War II, such as at [[Pointe du Hoc]], [[Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/101869797.html?dids=101869797:101869797&amp;FMT=ABS |title=THE INVASION, CHAPTER 9 THE GUNS OF POINTE-DU-HOC |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |accessdate=12 October 2011 |date=29 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermite can permanently disable artillery pieces without the use of explosive charges, and therefore thermite can be used when silence is necessary to an operation.

Incendiary bombs created massive damage in many cities due to fires started by the thermite. Cities that primarily consisted of wooden buildings were especially susceptible. These incendiary bombs were utilized primarily during [[Bombing of Tokyo#B-29 raids|nighttime air raids]]. Bombsights could not be used at night, creating the need to use munitions that could destroy targets without the need for precision placement. In recent times, thermite was used by Russia (under [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]]'s administration) in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. In mid 2016, [[RT (TV network)|Russian Television]] by mistake showed video of RBK-500 [[cluster bomb]]s loaded with ZAB-2.5SM thermite incendiaries mounted on [[Sukhoi Su-34|Su-34]] bomber aircraft. In the video, the defense minister of Russia can be seen supervising the attacks on civilian areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/22/russia-caught-out-using-incediary-weapons-in-report-by-own-chann/|title=Russians 'caught out' using incendiary weapons in Syria by own channel Russia Today|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hazards ==
[[Image:Utah-thermite.jpg|thumb|The violent effects of thermite]]
Thermite usage is hazardous due to the extremely high temperatures produced and the extreme difficulty in smothering a reaction once initiated. Small streams of molten iron released in the reaction can travel considerable distances and may melt through metal containers, igniting their contents. Additionally, flammable metals with relatively low boiling points such as zinc (with a boiling point of 907&amp;nbsp;°C, which is about 1,370&amp;nbsp;°C below the temperature at which thermite burns) could potentially spray superheated boiling metal violently into the air if near a thermite reaction.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

If, for some reason, thermite is contaminated with organics, hydrated oxides and other compounds able to produce gases upon heating or reaction with thermite components, the reaction products may be sprayed. Moreover, if the thermite mixture contains enough empty spaces with air and burns fast enough, the super-heated air also may cause the mixture to spray. For this reason it is preferable to use relatively crude powders, so the reaction rate is moderate and hot gases could escape the reaction zone.

Preheating of thermite before ignition can easily be done accidentally, for example by pouring a new pile of thermite over a hot, recently ignited pile of thermite [[slag]]. When ignited, preheated thermite can burn almost instantaneously, releasing light and heat energy at a much higher rate than normal and causing burns and eye damage at what would normally be a reasonably safe distance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The thermite reaction can take place accidentally in industrial locations where workers use abrasive [[grinding wheel|grinding and cutting wheels]] with [[ferrous metal]]s. Using aluminium in this situation produces a mixture of oxides that can explode violently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanford.gov/rl/?page=542&amp;parent=506 |title=Fireball from Aluminium and Grinding Dust |publisher=Hanford.gov |date=21 September 2001 |accessdate=15 September 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071125064608/http://www.hanford.gov/rl/?page=542&amp;parent=506 |archivedate = 25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing water with thermite or pouring water onto burning thermite can cause a [[steam explosion]], spraying hot fragments in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skylighter.com/fireworks/how-to-make/Thermite.asp|title=Make Thermite with Iron Oxide and Aluminum|website=www.skylighter.com|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermite's main ingredients were also utilized for their individual qualities, specifically reflectivity and heat insulation, in a paint coating or [[Aircraft dope|dope]] for the German [[zeppelin]] ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'', possibly contributing to its fiery destruction. This was a theory put forward by the former [[NASA]] scientist [[Addison Bain]], and later tested in small scale by the scientific reality-TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'' with semi-inconclusive results (it was proven not to be the fault of the thermite reaction alone, but instead conjectured to be a combination of that and the burning of [[hydrogen]] gas that filled the body of the ''Hindenburg'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/science/21myth.html |title=The Best Science Show on Television? |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''MythBusters'' program also tested the veracity of a video found on the Internet, whereby a quantity of thermite in a metal bucket was ignited while sitting atop several blocks of ice, causing a sudden explosion. They were able to confirm the results, finding huge chunks of ice as far as 50m from the point of explosion. Co-host [[Jamie Hyneman]] conjectured that this was due to the thermite mixture [[aerosol]]izing, perhaps in a cloud of steam, causing it to burn even faster. Hyneman also voiced skepticism about another theory explaining the phenomenon: that the reaction somehow separated the hydrogen and oxygen in the ice and then ignited them. This explanation claims that the explosion is due to the reaction of high temperature molten aluminium with water. Aluminium reacts violently with water or steam at high temperatures, releasing hydrogen and oxidizing in the process. The speed of that reaction and the ignition of the resulting hydrogen can easily account for the explosion verified.&lt;ref name="Aluminium Times Vol 11 n 3 Jul/Aug 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Molten Metal Explosions|url=http://www.pyrotek.info/documents/newsandeventspdfs/Aluminium_Times_-_2009-08_-_Safety_Coatings_(A4).pdf|publisher=Modern Media Communications Ltd|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is akin to the explosive reaction caused by dropping metallic [[potassium]] into water.

The '''Union process''' was an above ground [[shale oil extraction]] technology for production of [[shale oil]], a type of [[synthetic crude]] oil. The process used a vertical retort where heating causes decomposition of [[oil shale]] into shale oil, [[oil shale gas]] and [[Spent shale|spent residue]]. The particularity of this process is that oil shale in the retort moves from the bottom upward to the top, countercurrent to the descending hot gases, by a mechanism known as a rock pump.  The process technology was invented by the American oil company [[Unocal Corporation]] in late 1940s and was developed through several decades.  The largest oil shale retort ever built was the Union B type retort.

==History==
Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) started its oil shale activities in 1920s.  In 1921, it acquired an oil shale tract in the [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute Creek]] area of [[Colorado]], southern [[Piceance Basin]].&lt;ref name=BLM2008appendix&gt;

The Union retort is a vertical shaft retort.  The main difference to other vertical shaft retorts such as Kiviter, Petrosix, Paraho and Fushun is that crushed oil shale is fed through the bottom of the retort rather than the top. Lumps of oil shale in size of {{convert|3.2|to|50.8|mm|in}} are moved upwards through the retort by a solids pump (known as a "rock pump").  Hot gases, generated by internal combustion or circulated through the top of the retort, decompose the oil shale while descending.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  The pyrolysis occurs at the temperature of {{convert|510|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|540|°C|°F|1}}.&lt;ref name=BLM2008appendix/&gt;  Condensed shale oil and gases are removed from the retort at the bottom. Part of the gases is recirculated for pyrolysis and fueling combustion, while other part could be used as product gas. The [[spent shale]] is removed from the top of the retort. After cooling with a water, it is conveyed to the waste disposal.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;

==Advantages==
The Union retort design has several advantages. The reducing atmosphere in the retort allows the removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds through the formation of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]].  Oil vapors are cooled by the raw oil, thus minimizing polymer formation among the hydrocarbon fractions.&lt;ref name=BLM2008appendix/&gt;

'''Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools''' (GAT) is an open-source and cross-platform [[Geographic information system]] (GIS) and remote sensing software package that is distributed under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It has been developed by the members of the [[University of Guelph]] [http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/ Centre for Hydrogeomatics] and is intended for advanced geospatial analysis and data visualization in research and education settings. The package features a friendly [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) with help and documentation built into the dialog boxes for each of the more than 410 analysis tools. Users are also able to access extensive off-line and online help resources. The Whitebox GAT project started as a replacement for the Terrain Analysis System (TAS), a geospatial analysis software package written by John Lindsay. The current release support raster and vector ([[shapefile]]) data structures. There are also extensive functionality for processing laser scanner (LiDAR) data contained with LAS files.

Whitebox GAT is extendible. Users are able to create and add custom tools or plugins using any [[List of JVM languages|JVM language]]. The software also allows scripting using the programming languages [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

== Analysis tools ==
Whitebox GAT contains more than 385 tools to perform spatial analysis on raster data sets. The following is an incomplete list of some of the more commonly used tools:

*''GIS tools:'' Cost-distance analysis, buffer, distance operations, weighted overlays, multi-criteria evaluation, reclass, area analysis, clumping
*''Image processing tools:'' k-means classification, numerous spatial filters, image mosaicing, NDVI, resampling, contrast enhancement
*''Hydrology tools:'' DEM preprocessing tools, flow direction and accumulation (D8, Rho8, Dinf, and FD8 algorithms), mass flux analysis, watershed extraction
*''Terrain analysis tools:'' surface derivatives (slope, aspect, and curvatures), hillshading, wetness index, relative stream power index, relative landscape position indices
*''LiDAR tools:'' IDW interpolation, nearest neighbour interpolation, point density, removal of off-terrain objects (non-ground points)

== Software transparency ==
The Whitebox GAT project has adopted a novel approach for linking the software's development and user communities, known as software transparency, or open-access software (considered an extension of open-source software). The philosophy of transparency in software states that the user 1) has the right to view the underlying workings of a tool or operation, and 2) should be able to access this information in a way that reduces, or ideally eliminates, any barriers to viewing and interpreting it. This concept was developed as a response to the fact that the code base of many open-source projects can be so massive and its organization so complex that individual users often find the task of interpreting the underlying code too daunting when they are interested in a small portion of the overall code base, e.g. if the user would like to know how a particular tool or algorithm operates. Furthermore, when the software's source code is written in an unfamiliar [[programming language]], the task of interpreting the code is made even more difficult. For some open-source projects, these characteristics can create a divide between the development and user communities, often restricting future development to a few individuals that have been involved in the project during the earliest periods of development.&lt;ref&gt;Câmara, G. and Onsrud, H. (2004) "Open Source GIS Software: Myths and Realities" in ''"Open Access and the Public Domain in Digital Data and Information for Science: Proceedings of an International Symposium"'' Retrieved on 2010-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The View Code button that is present on all Whitebox GAT tools is the embodiment of this software-transparency philosophy by pointing the user to the specific region of the source-code that is relevant to a particular tool, also allowing for code conversion to other programming languages. The Whitebox GAT logo is also representative of the open and transparent characteristic of the software, being a transparent glass cube, open on one face.

'''Wireless Engineering''' is the branch of [[engineering]] which addresses the design, application, and research of wireless communication systems and technologies.

==Overview==
Wireless engineering is an engineering subject dealing with engineering problems using wireless technology such as radio communications and radar, but it is more general than the conventional radio engineering. It may include using other techniques such as acoustic, infrared, and optical technologies.

==History==
Wireless technologies have skyrocketed since their late 19th Century advancements. With the invention of the [[FM Radio]] in 1935, wireless communications have become a concentrated focus of both private and government sectors.

===In Education===
[[Auburn University]]'s Samuel Ginn College of Engineering was the first in the [[United States]] to offer a formalized undergraduate degree in such a field. The program was initiated by Samuel Ginn, an Auburn Alumni, in 2001.&lt;ref name="Auburn University"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], was the first University to offer Wireless Engineering in [[Australia]]. The university works closely with nearby industries in research and teaching development in wireless engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research.mq.edu.au/excellence/wireless_communications,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka]] in [[Malacca]], was the first University to offer Wireless Communication Engineering in [[Malaysia]].

==Applications==
Wireless engineering contains a wide spectrum of application, most notably [[cellular networks]]. The recent popularity of cellular networks has created a vast career demand with a large repository. The popularity has also sparked many wireless innovations, such as increased network capacity, [[3G]], cryptology and network security technologies.
