'''Abbé Faria''' ({{Lang-pt|'''Abade Faria'''}}), or [[Abbé]]  ([[Abbot]]) '''José Custódio de Faria''' (31 May 1756 – 20 September 1819), was a [[Portugal|Luso]]-[[Goan Catholics|Goan Catholic]] monk who was one of the pioneers of the [[Science|scientific study]] of [[hypnotism]], following on from the work of [[Franz Mesmer]]. Unlike Mesmer, who claimed that hypnosis was mediated by "[[animal magnetism]]", Faria understood that it worked purely by the power of [[suggestion]]. In the early 19th century, Abbé Faria introduced [[oriental hypnosis]] to [[Paris]].

He was one of the first to depart from the theory of the "magnetic fluid", to place in relief the importance of suggestion, and to demonstrate the existence of "[[autosuggestion]]"; he also established that what he termed ''nervous sleep'' belongs to the natural order. From his earliest [[magnet therapy|magnetizing]] [[séance]]s, in 1814, he boldly developed his doctrine. Nothing comes from the magnetizer; everything comes from the subject and takes place in his [[imagination]] generated from within the mind. Magnetism is only a form of [[sleep]]. Although of the moral order, the magnetic action is often aided by physical, or rather by physiological, means–fixedness of look and cerebral fatigue.

Faria changed the terminology of mesmerism. Previously, the focus was on the "concentration" of the subject. In Faria's terminology the operator became "the concentrator" and [[somnambulism]] was viewed as a lucid sleep. The method of hypnosis used by Faria is command, following expectancy. The theory of Abbé Faria is now known as '''Fariism'''.

Later, [[Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault]] (1864–1904), the founder of the [[Nancy School]], and [[Émile Coué]] (1857–1926), father of applied [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]], developed the theory of [[suggestion]] and [[autosuggestion]] and began using them as therapeutic tools. [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz|Johannes Schultz]] developed these theories as [[Autogenic training]].

==Origins==
[[File:AbaDeFaria.JPG|thumb|Statue of Abbé Faria hypnotising a woman next to the Old Secretariat (Idalçao palace) in [[Panjim]], Goa]]
José Custódio de Faria was born in [[Candolim]], [[Bardez]] in the erstwhile territory of [[Portuguese India|Portuguese Goa]], on 31 May 1756. He was the son of Caetano Vitorino de Faria of [[Colvale]], and Rosa Maria de Sousa of [[Candolim]]. He also had an adopted sister, Catarina who was an orphan. Caetano was in turn a descendant of Anantha [[Shenoy]], a [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin]], village clerk and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] of the same village who converted to Christianity in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Journal of Psychiatry, Volume 16, 1974, University of California, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Goan Catholic]] of the ''[[Roman Catholic Brahmin|Bamonn]]'' caste,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abbefaria.com/Abbe%20Faria%20Conspiracy.htm ABBÉ FARIA and the CONSPIRACY of  1787] – Prof. Alfredo de Mello, Abbefaria.com, "Caetano Victorino de Faria, a Brahmin Christian, born in Colvale, in the north of Bardez district, just on the south bank of the river Chapora, devoted himself to ecclesiastical studies when young."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradnock"&gt;Robert Bradnock, Roma Bradnock, ''Footprint Goa Handbook: The Travel Guide'', Footprint Travel Guides, 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-903471-22-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pWAnvOJD1qwC&amp;pg=PA57 Google Print, p. 57] "Abbé José Custodio Faria was born on May 30, 1756, in Candolim, just inland of Calangute. His family claimed descent from Brahmins in Colvale, but his parents separated after his birth, his mother becoming a nun and his father a priest."&lt;/ref&gt; and was also of partial African descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8XLPnkqwzDYC&amp;dq=the+portuguese+in+india+book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_jlqUvTdO6LU0QWqs4GoCw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAg=false 149]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his parents had irreconcilable differences, they decided to separate and obtained the Church's dispensation. Caetano Vitorino joined the [[seminary]] to complete his studies for the [[priest]]hood (which he had interrupted to get married), and Rosa Maria became a [[nun]], joining the [[St. Monica]] [[convent]] in [[Old Goa]], where she rose to the position of [[Priory|prioress]].

==Lisbon==
The father had great ambition for himself and his son. Hence, Faria reached [[Lisbon]] on 23 December 1771 with his father at the age of 25. After a year they managed to convince the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]], [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]], to send them to [[Rome]] for Faria Sr. to earn a [[doctorate]] in [[theology]], and the son to pursue his studies for the [[Clergy|priesthood]].

Eventually, the son too earned his doctorate, dedicating his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral thesis]] to the Portuguese Queen, [[Mary I of Portugal]], and another study, on the [[Holy Spirit]] to the [[Pope]]. Apparently [[His Holiness]] was sufficiently impressed to invite José Custódio to preach a [[sermon]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]], which he himself attended.

On his return to Lisbon, the Queen was informed by the [[Nuncio]] of the Pope's honour to Faria Jr. So, she too invited the young priest to preach to her as well, in her chapel. But Faria, climbing the pulpit, and seeing the august assembly felt tongue tied. At that moment his father, who sat below the pulpit, whispered to him in [[Konkani language|Konkani]]: ''Hi sogli baji; cator re baji'' (they are all vegetables, cut the vegetables). Jolted, the son lost his fear and preached fluently.

Faria Jr., from then on, often wondered how a mere phrase from his father could alter his state of mind so radically as to wipe off his stage fright in a second. The question would have far reaching consequences in his life.

==Participation in conspiracy==
He was implicated in the [[Conspiracy of the Pintos]] during 1787, and left for France in 1788. He stayed in [[Paris]] residing at Rue de Ponceau.

==France==
In Paris, he became a leader of one of the [[French Revolution|revolutionary battalions]] in 1795, taking command of one of the sections of the infamous ''10 of the [[Vendémiaire]]'', which attacked the infamous [[National Convention|French Convention]], taking an active part in its fall. As a result, he established links with individuals like [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], the [[Marquise of Coustine]]. He was also a friend of [[Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marques of Puységur]] (a disciple of [[Franz Anton Mesmer]]), to whom he dedicated his book ''Causas do Sono Lúcido'' ("On the Causes of Lucid Sleep").

In 1797 he was arrested in [[Marseille]] for unknown reasons, and sent by a [[Court|law court]] to the infamous [[Chateau d'If]] in a barred police carriage. He was shut up in solitary confinement in the Chateau. While imprisoned he steadily trained himself using techniques of self-suggestion.{{Disputed inline|date=June 2013}}

After a long imprisonment in the Chateau, Faria was released and returned to Paris.

In 1811, he was appointed [[Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] at the [[List of universities in France|University of France]] at [[Nîmes]], and was elected member of the ''Société Medicale de Marseille'' at Marseille.

In 1813 Abbé Faria, realising that [[animal magnetism]] was gaining importance in Paris, returned to Paris and started promoting a new doctrine. He provoked unending controversies with his work ''Da Causa do Sono Lúcido no Estudo da Natureza do Homem'' (On the cause of Lucid Sleep in the Study of the Nature of Man), published in Paris in 1819 and was soon accused of being a charlatan.

He retired as [[chaplain]] to an obscure religious establishment, and died of a stroke in Paris on 30 September 1819. He left behind no addresses {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} and his grave remains unmarked and unknown, somewhere in [[Montmartre]].

==Tributes==
* There is a [[bronze]] statue in central [[Panjim]], [[Goa]] (next to the former Government Secretariat or Idalçao palace) of Abbé Faria trying to hypnotise a woman. It was sculpted in 1945 by Ramchandra Pandurang Kamat. According to lettriste{{clarify|date=February 2016}} late{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Prof. Nora Secco De Souza, the statue was sculpted by Goan sculptor Constâncio Fernandes.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  This claim is based on an article titled "On the Abbe's Trail" written by Frederick Noronha, writer, journalist and book publisher.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The article is included in the book ''Reflected in Water'' edited by Jerry Pinto, published by Penguin Books India 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} There is indirect evidence that the statue was executed by Constancio, because in 1939 he exhibited in the Town Hall, Bombay, a somewhat similar sculpture of Abbe Faria, "Idealising Le Sommeil Lucide", and was awarded the Bombay Art Society Prize.
* Portugal commemorated the 250th anniversary of the Abbé's birth in May 2006 by releasing a postcard of his statue in Panjim, Goa.
* A city road in the Areeiro zone of Lisbon is also named in his honour.
* An authentic caricature of him is preserved in the National Library of Paris.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mundo Goa|last=|first=|publisher=Singbal's book house|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Britto|editor-first=Nigel|location=Goa|pages=|editor-last2=Menezes|editor-first2=Vivek|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A prominent thoroughfare in the southern Goan city of [[Margao]] is named 'Rua Abade Faria' (Abbé Faria Street) in his honour.
* On Abbe Faria Street in Margao, there was an educational institution called Instituto Abade Faria which imparted Portuguese language secondary school education known as "Lyceum studies", consisting of First Year To Fifth Year classes. It ceased to function after the liberation of Goa.
* [[Alexandre Dumas]] used a fictionalised version of the Abbé{{citation needed|reason=same name doesn't mean that the character was based on this person|date=October 2013}} in his novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. In the novel, Faria, an Italian, is a prisoner of the Château d'If who instructs [[Edmond Dantès]] in [[mathematics]], the [[science]]s, and [[foreign language]]s, and eventually helps him to escape from the island prison. He also discloses to Dantès the whereabouts of a hoard of jewels at [[Montecristo|Monte Cristo]], a small island near the Italian coast, before dying from a [[cataleptic]] seizure.
* [[Asif Currimbhoy]] in his play ''Abbé Faria'' dramatizes Faria's life and views as a revolutionary priest and premier hypnotist. The play was published by Writers Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/b/OL1056393M/Abbe_Faria {{ISBN|81-7189-441-0}} / 9788171894413 / 81-7189-441-0&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Institute of Clinical Hypnosis and Counselling established in the Indian state of Kerala is a memorial to Abbé Faria.
* The Mustard Seed Art Company, a theater group from Goa, celebrated the 250th anniversary of Faria's birth by staging a play entitled ''Kator Re Bhaji'', which was written and directed by Isabel de Santa Rita Vaz.
* Laurent Carrer included the first English translation of Faria's single tome, originally written in French as ''De la cause du sommeil lucide ou Etude de la nature de l’homme'' (''On the Cause of Lucid Sleep or Study On The Nature of Man'') in his 2004 ''José Custódio de Faria: Hypnotist, Priest and Revolutionary''.

== Quotes ==
* "[Faria was] great, because he had no fear and fought for truth rather than for his place at the vanity fair. The Abbot de Faria's mystery does not lie in the circumstances of his life that are unknown to historians and lost forever; his mystery lies in his talent, courage, and quest for truth. His mystery was the mystery of someone who was ahead of his time and who blazed a trail for his descendants due to his sacrifice." – Dr. Mikhail Buyanov, President of the [[Moscow]] Psychotherapeutic Academy, and author of ''A Man Ahead of His Times'', a study in [[Russian language|Russian]] of Abbe Faria.
* "There was a man in Paris who made the experience of hypnotism public. Every day, some 60 people used to gather at his residence and it was rare among these, that there were not at least five or six people who were susceptible to fall into a hypnotic trance. He would openly declare that he did not possess any secrets nor any extraordinary powers, and that everything he achieved was dependent on the will of the persons he was performing upon." – French [[General]] [[François Joseph Noizet]].

'''Alaska Natives''' are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of [[Alaska]], [[United States]] and include: [[Iñupiat]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Eyak]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tsimshian]], and a number of [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Northern Athabaskan]] cultures. They are often defined by their language groups. Many Alaska Natives are enrolled in federally recognized [[Alaska Native tribal entities]], who in turn belong to 13 [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations]], who administer land and financial claims.

Ancestors of Alaska Natives migrated into the area thousands of years ago, in at least two different waves. Some are descendants of a third wave of migration in which people settled across the northern part of North America. They never migrated to southern areas. For this reason, genetic studies show they are not closely related to Native Americans in South America.

Throughout the Arctic and the circumpolar north, the ancestors of Alaska Natives established varying [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|indigenous]], complex cultures that have succeeded each other over time. They developed sophisticated ways to deal with the challenging climate and environment, and cultures rooted in the place. Historic groups have been defined by their languages, which belong to several major language families. Today, Alaska Natives comprise over 15% of the population of Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/AK#viewtop|title=U.S. Census Bureau Quick Facts|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
The Alaska Natives Commission estimated that there were about 86,000 Alaska Natives living in Alaska in 1990, with another 17,000 who lived outside Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alaskool.org/resources/anc/anc07.htm|title=Alaska Natives Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study by the [[Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development]] documented over 120,000 Alaska Native people in Alaska.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kdlg.org/post/alaska-native-population-upward-trend#stream/0|title=The Alaska Native Population Is on an Upward Trend|last=|first=|date=|website=KOLG Public Radio for Bristol Bay|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the majority of Alaska Natives live in small villages or remote regional hubs such as [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], and [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], the percentage who live in urban areas has been increasing. In 2000, 38% lived in urban areas, compared to 44% in the 2010 census.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Russian colonial period==
Arriving from Siberia by ship in the mid-eighteenth century, Russians began to trade with Alaska Natives. New settlements around trading posts were started by Russians, including Russian Orthodox missionaries. These were the first to translate Christian scripture into Native languages. British and American traders generally did not reach the area until the nineteenth century, and in some cases missionaries were not active until the twentieth century. In the 21st century, the numerous congregations of Russian Orthodox Christians in Alaska are generally composed mostly of Alaska Natives.

Rather than hunting the marine life, the Russians forced the [[Aleut people|Aleuts]] to do the work for them.&lt;ref name="Colonies"&gt;Taylor, Alan (2001) ''American Colonies: The Settling of North America'' Penguin Books, New York p.452&lt;/ref&gt; As word spread of the riches in furs to be had, competition among Russian companies increased and they forced the [[Aleuts]] into [[slavery]].&lt;ref name="Colonies"/&gt; [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], who became [[emperor|Empress]] in 1763, proclaimed good will toward the Aleut and urged her subjects to treat them fairly. The growing competition between the trading companies, merging into fewer, larger and more powerful corporations, created conflicts that aggravated the relations with the [[indigenous populations]]. Over the years, the situation became catastrophic for the natives.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

As the animal populations declined, the [[Aleuts]], already too dependent on the new barter economy created by the Russian fur trade, were increasingly coerced into taking greater risks in the dangerous waters of the North Pacific to hunt for more otter. As the [[Shelikhov-Golikov Company]] and later [[Russian-American Company]] developed as a monopoly, it used skirmishes and systematic violence as a tool of colonial exploitation of the indigenous people. When the Aleut revolted and won some victories, the Russians retaliated, killing many and destroying their boats and hunting gear, leaving them no means of survival.

The most devastating effects were from disease: during the first two generations (1741/1759-1781/1799 AD) of Russian contact, 80 percent of the Aleut population died from Eurasian [[infectious diseases]]. These were then [[endemic]] among the Europeans, but the Aleut had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] against the new diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaska.net/~aleut/Culture_History.html "Aleut History"], The Aleut Corporation  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102172428/http://www.alaska.net/~aleut/Culture_History.html |date=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of Colonization ==
Geopolitical reasons drove the Tsarist government to expand into Indigenous territory in present day Alaska, spreading [[Russian Orthodoxy]] and consuming the natural resources of the territory along their way.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lightfoot|first=Ken G|date=|title=Russian Colonization: The Implications of Mercantile Colonial Practices in the North Pacific|url=|journal=Historical Archaeology|volume=37|pages=14-28|via=JStor}}&lt;/ref&gt;Their movement into these populated areas of Indigenous communities altered the demographic and natural landscape. The idea [[Russian-American Company]] used Indigenous populations for inexpensive labour and exploited them for the companies profit has been suggested by historians.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The [[fur trade]] led the Russian American Company to not only use Indigenous populations for labour, but to also use them as hostages to acquire iasak&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Iasak, a from of taxation used by the Russians , was a tribute in the form of otter pelts. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;It was a taxation method the Russians had previously found useful in their early encounter with Indigenous communities of [[Siberia]] during the [[Siberian fur trade]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;Beaver pelts were also customary to be given to fur traders upon first contact with various communities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Five Journal Reports From 1789-90 Concerning Treatments of Aleuts|last=|first=|date=|website=www.alaska.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Russian American Company used military force type tactics on Indigenous families as they were taken hostage and held until the male community members brought forth furs. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Otter furs on [[Kodiak Island]] and [[Aleutian Islands]] enticed the Russians to start these taxations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Robbery and maltreatment in the form of corporal punishment and the withholding of food was also present upon the arrival of fur traders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Journal of Navigator Potap Zaikov, on Ship, "Alexander Nevski"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.alaska.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Catherine the Great]] dissolved the giving of tribute in 1799, and instead instituted a mandatory conscription of Indigenous men between the ages of 18 to 50 to become seal hunters strictly for the Russian American Company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mandatory service of Indigenous men gave the Russian American Company ground for competition with other American and British fur traders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The conscription of mandatory labour separated men from their families and villages thus altering and breaking down communities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reedy-Maschen|first=Katherine|date=Fall 2018|title=Where Did All the Aleut Men Go? Aleut Men Attrition and Related Patterns in Aleutian Historical Demography and Social Organization|url=|journal=Human Biology|volume=82|pages=583-611|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; With able-bodied men away on the hunt, villages were left with little protection as as only women, children, and the elderly were left behind. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All aspects of Indigenous life changed because of Russian contact, the spread of disease altered populations of communities and conscription sent men far away. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veltre|first=Douglas, W|date=Fall 2018|title=Russian Exploitation of Aleuts and Fur Seals: The Archaeology of Eighteenth Century and Early Nineteenth Century Settlements in the Pribilof Island, Alaska|url=|journal=Historial Archaeology|volume=36|pages=8-17|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although records kept in the period were scare, it can be said that 80% of the pre-contact population of the [[Aleut]] people were gone by 1800.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Relationships between Indigenous women and fur traders increased as Indigenous men were away from villages. This resulted in marriages and children that would come to be known as [[Creole peoples]], children who were Indigenous and Russian. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To reduce hostilities with Aleutiion communities, it became policy for fur traders to enter into marriage with Indigenous women which also helped grow a strong Creole population in the territory controlled by the Russian American Company. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The growth of the Russian Orthodox Church was an important tactic in the colonization and conversion of Indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dehass|first=Media Csoba|date=Fall 2018|title=What is in a Name? The Predicament of Ethnonyms in the Sugpi-aq- Aluitq Region of Alaska|url=|journal=Arctic Archaeology|volume=49|pages=3-17|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ioann Veniaminov was an important religious saint who carried out the agenda for the Orthodox Church to Christianize Indigenous populations. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Creole children were to be brought up following Russian Orthodox Christianity, as well as have an education provided for them by the Russian American Company.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Creole people were considered to have high levels of loyalty towards the Russian crown and Russian American Company.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After completing their education , children were often sent to Russia where they would stud skills such as mapmaking, theology, and military intelligence. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==ANCSA and since (1971 to present)==
[[File:Woman and child - Nunivak - Edward S. Curtis - restoration1.jpg|thumb|Nunivak [[Cup'ik]] mother and child]]
In 1971 the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA), which settled [[aboriginal land claims|land]] and financial claims for lands and resources which the peoples had lost to European Americans. It provided for the establishment of 13 [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations]] to administer those claims. Similar to the separately defined status of the [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[List of Canadian Inuit|Inuit]] and [[First Nations]] in Canada, which are recognized as distinct peoples, in the United States, Alaska Natives are in some respects treated separately by the government from other [[Native Americans in the United States]]. This is in part related to their interactions with the US government in a different historic period than indigenous peoples in the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] and early federal period.

Europeans and Americans did not have sustained encounters with the Alaska Natives until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when many were attracted to the region in gold rushes. The Alaska Natives were not allotted individual title in severalty to land under the [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 but were instead treated under the [[Alaska Native Allotment Act]] of 1906.

It was repealed in 1971, following ANSCA, at which time reservations were ended. Another characteristic difference is that Alaska Native tribal governments do not have the power to collect taxes for business transacted on tribal land, per the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government]]'' (1998). Except for the [[Tsimshian]], Alaska Natives no longer hold [[Indian reservations|reservations]] but do control some lands. Under the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] of 1972, Alaska Natives are reserved the right to harvest [[Whaling|whales]] and other [[marine mammals]].

==Subsistence==
{{see also|Subsistence economy}}
Gathering of subsistence food continues to be an important economic and cultural activity for many Alaska Natives.&lt;ref name="Ristroph"&gt;Elizabeth Barrett Ristroph, "Alaska Tribes' Melting Subsistence Rights," 1 ''Arizona Journal of Environmental Law &amp; Policy'' 1, 2010, Available at {{cite web|url=http://ajelp.com/documents/RistrophFinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811064534/http://ajelp.com/documents/RistrophFinal.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]] in 2005, more than 91 percent of the Iñupiat households which were interviewed still participated in the local subsistence economy, compared with the approximately 33 percent of non-Iñupiat households who used wild resources obtained from hunting, fishing, or gathering.&lt;ref&gt;URS CORP., BARROW VILLAGE PROFILE 4.3-6 (2005), available at http://www.north-slope.org/information/comp_plan/BarrowVillageProfile06.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, unlike many tribes in the contiguous United States, Alaska Natives do not have treaties with the United States that protect their subsistence rights,&lt;ref name="Ristroph"/&gt; except for the right to harvest whales and other marine mammals. The [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] explicitly extinguished aboriginal hunting and fishing rights in the state of Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;43 U.S.C. § 1603(b) (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alonzo Harding Mourning Jr.''' (born February 8, 1970) is an American retired professional [[basketball]] player, who played most of his 15-year [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) career for the [[Miami Heat]].

Nicknamed "'''Zo'''", Mourning played at [[center (basketball)|center]]. Following his college basketball career at [[Georgetown University]], his tenacity on defense twice earned him [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] and perennially placed him on the [[NBA All-Defensive Team]]. Mourning made a comeback after undergoing a kidney transplant and later won the 2006 NBA Championship with the Heat. Mourning also played for the [[Charlotte Hornets]] and [[New Jersey Nets]]. On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first [[Miami Heat]] player to have his number retired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/basketball/story/926656.html ''Miami Herald'' article]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since June 26, 2009, Mourning has served as Vice President of Player Programs and Development for the Heat. In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the [[Virginia Sports Hall of Fame]]. On August 8, 2014, Mourning was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/2014/4/7/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-class-of.html |publisher=The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Announces Class of 2014 |date=April 7, 2014 |accessdate=October 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408220838/http://www.hoophall.com/news/2014/4/7/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-class-of.html |archivedate=April 8, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
During his time at [[Indian River High School (Virginia)|Indian River High School]] in Chesapeake, Virginia, he led the team to 51 straight victories and a state title his junior year (1987). As a senior, he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots a game. He was named Player of the Year by USA Today, Parade, Gatorade, and Naismith. He was the #1 recruit of the 1988 class, over Billy Owens, Kenny Williams, [[Shawn Kemp]], Stanley Roberts, [[Christian Laettner]], and Malik Sealy, among others.

==College career==
Mourning played [[college basketball]] for the [[Georgetown University]] [[Georgetown Hoyas|Hoyas]]. He led the nation in blocked shots his freshman year and was an All-American his last year there.

==Professional career==
===Charlotte Hornets===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2014}}
Mourning was selected second overall in the [[1992 NBA draft]] by the [[1992–93 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte Hornets]], behind [[Shaquille O'Neal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hornets Happenings: The Five Best Hornets Draft Picks of All Time |first= Paul |last= Augustin |url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/210796-hornets-happenings-the-best-hornets-draft-picks-of-all-time|work= [[Bleacher Report]] |date= July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 pts, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Tom  |date=2006 |title=Shaquille O'Neal: Giant on and Off the Court |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBr3_Zr6GWUC&amp;dq=shaquille+o+neal+alonzo+mourning+rookie+of+the+year&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |location= |publisher=[[Enslow Publishers]] |page=48 |isbn=9780766028234}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] in [[1989–90 NBA season|1989–90]] to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993 in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the [[1992–93 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]]. His 20-footer with 4 tenths left gave the Hornets a 104–103 victory in the game and a three-games-to-one victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the [[1992–93 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] in 5 games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in 9 playoff games.  The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.

In the [[1994–95 NBA season|1994–95 season]], Mourning and teammate [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] led the [[1994–95 Charlotte Hornets season|Hornets]] to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in [[point (basketball)|scoring]] (21.3 ppg), [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] (9.9 rpg), [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]] (2.92 per game), and [[field goal percentage]] (.519), and played in the [[1995 NBA All-Star Game]] where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in 4 games to the [[1994–95 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning posting 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks for the series.

===Miami Heat===
On November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte’s contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves [[Pete Myers]] and [[LeRon Ellis]] in exchange for [[Glen Rice]], [[Matt Geiger]], [[Khalid Reeves]] and a first-round pick in the [[1996 NBA draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawthon|first1=Raad|author2=Michael Sokolov|title=Hornets Forced To Deal Alonzo Mourning, Seeking $13 Million A Year, Went To Miami In A Six-player Swap. Glen Rice Became A Hornet.|url=http://articles.philly.com/1995-11-04/sports/25681814_1_hornets-dell-curry-rafael-addison|accessdate=June 11, 2014|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|agency=Associated Press|date=November 4, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mourning would immediately serve as the centerpiece of the [[Pat Riley]]-coached Heat, and in his first season in Miami he averaged 23.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks a game as Miami made the playoffs before being swept in the first round by the 72 win [[1995–96 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]].  Mourning played in the [[1996 NBA All-Star Game]] and was joined by all-star point guard [[Tim Hardaway]] who arrived through a midseason trade.

In the summer of 1996 Mourning would go on to sign a 7-year $105 million dollar contract with the Heat. In the 1996-97 season, the Heat would win a then franchise record 61 games, second in the Eastern Conference to the defending champion Bulls, and Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks.  In the playoffs, Miami defeated the [[1996–97 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the [[1996–97 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]], where [[Heat–Knicks rivalry|the rivalry]] between the Heat and the [[New York Knicks]] intensified. The Knicks took a 3–1 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and [[P. J. Brown]] late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago.  The [[1996–97 Chicago Bulls season|Bulls]] took a 3–0 series lead, and Mourning guaranteed a victory in Game 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Clifton |last=Brown |date=May 25, 1997 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/25/sports/killing-the-bulls-with-boredom.html |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Killing the Bulls, With Boredom |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heat won 87–80, but they lost Game 5 100–87.

The next season, Mourning posted almost similar averages of 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks but only played in 58 games, and Miami was eliminated in the first round by the [[1997–98 New York Knicks season|Knicks]], a series in which Mourning was suspended for the 5th and deciding game due to an on-court fight with ex-teammate [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]], with Knicks head coach [[Jeff Van Gundy]] hanging onto Mourning's leg in an attempt to break it up.

In the [[1998–99 NBA lockout|lockout-shortened]] 1998–99 season, Mourning averaged 20.1 points, a career high 11 rebounds and a career high 3.9 blocks per game as Miami won another Atlantic Division title and the top seed in the playoffs. Mourning won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]], was named [[All-NBA First Team]] and finished second to [[Karl Malone]] in the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] voting.  Despite being the top seed, the Heat lost to the eighth-seeded [[1998–99 New York Knicks season|Knicks]] in five games, off a last-second shot by [[Allan Houston]] in Miami.

The following season, Mourning averaged 21.7 points a game, 9.5 rebounds and 3.7 blocks a game, and won his second straight Defensive Player of the Year Award. Miami swept the [[1999–2000 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning dominating the Pistons{{quantify|date=June 2014}}. The Heat faced [[1999–2000 New York Knicks season|New York]], the fourth straight year that the two teams met in the postseason, and took a 3–2 series lead, but New York won the series in seven games. In the summer, Mourning and Hardaway won a gold medal with the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]] at the [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|Olympics in Sydney]].

During the off-season, Miami underwent an overhaul and expectations leading up to the season were high.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Prior the start of the [[2000–01 NBA season|2000–01 season]], however, Mourning was diagnosed with [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]], a kidney condition, that caused him to miss the first five months of the season. He returned to play on March 27, and played a total of 13 games as Miami made the postseason but were swept in the first round by the [[2000–01 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte Hornets]].

The following year, Mourning played in 75 games despite his kidney disease, and was selected to play in the 2002 [[NBA All-Star Game]], where he scored 13 points off the bench. He averaged 15.7 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks a game, but the Heat missed the playoffs.  As his condition worsened, Mourning did not play during the entire [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03 season]] and his expiring contract was not renewed by the Heat.

===New Jersey Nets===
Mourning signed a four-year deal with the [[2003–04 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]] in 2003 as a free agent. But on November 25, 2003, Mourning retired from the NBA due to complications from his kidney disease. On December 19 of that year he underwent a successful kidney transplant. In 2004, he started practicing with the Nets again, and made the team's regular season roster during the 2004–05 season. He did not play a significant role with the Nets, however, and openly complained to the media that he wanted out of New Jersey, especially after the team traded away [[Kenyon Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://probasketball.about.com/od/newsrumorsopinion/a/vincecartertrad.htm |title=NBA Trade Winds: Raptors Trade Vince Carter to Nets |publisher=About.com |date=December 18, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618033445/http://probasketball.about.com/od/newsrumorsopinion/a/vincecartertrad.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mourning was traded to the [[2004–05 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] on December 17, 2004. Mourning never reported to the Raptors, and was bought out of his contract at a remaining 9 million dollars on February 11, 2005. Raptors team officials later said that he did not meet the medical conditions to play for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehoops.com/mourning-raptors-buyout-021105.shtml |title=Toronto Raptors buyout Alonzo Mourning, end contract |publisher=Insidehoops.com |date=February 11, 2005 |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/16/sports/pro-basketball-mourning-is-expected-to-rejoin-the-heat-soon.html |title=PRO BASKETBALL; Mourning Is Expected To Rejoin the Heat Soon |work=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2005 |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mourning then finished the season with the [[2004–05 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] being paid a second salary, the veteran's minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/ian_thomsen/12/14/artest.mourning/index.html |first=Ian |last=Thomsen |title=Mourning, Nets share hard feelings |work=Sports Illustrated |date=December 15, 2005 |accessdate=June 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103203128/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/ian_thomsen/12/14/artest.mourning/index.html |archivedate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Miami===
After being unhappy at the prospect of playing for a losing franchise,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Mourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005. His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar [[Shaquille O'Neal]], although he was called upon as a starter due to O'Neal missing stretches due to injury. O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the second-best record in the NBA's Eastern conference during the 2004–05 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning scoring 21 points with 9 rebounds in just 16 minutes in game 2.  In the second round against the [[2004–05 Washington Wizards season|Washington Wizards]], Mourning stepped in for the injured O'Neal and scored 14 points with 13 rebounds and 4 blocked shots in game 3 as Miami completed another four-game sweep.  Miami fell in seven games to the defending champion [[2004–05 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Mourning leading the team in blocks with 3 per game for the series.

Mourning re-signed with Miami, as the Heat once again re-hauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Gary Payton]].  Mourning continued to serve as the Heat's backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team's starting center after O'Neal suffered an injury early on.  Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks a game despite playing as a reserve.  In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the [[2005–06 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] and New Jersey before defeating [[2005–06 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]] in 6 games to advance to the [[2006 NBA Finals]], the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning.  After a 2-0 deficit, Miami won all three of its home games led by the spectacular play of [[Dwyane Wade]], and in game 6 in [[2005–06 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas]] Mourning came off the bench to score 8 points with 6 rebounds and a team high 5 blocks to help Miami win its first NBA Championship in franchise history.

After winning the championship, Mourning announced that he would return to the Heat in [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07]] to defend their title, despite receiving offers of more money from other teams, including the [[2006–07 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]]. In 2007, Mourning announced he would return for one more year with the Heat and his 15th season. "It will definitely be my last year", Mourning said. After starting the season on a solid note averaging 6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.75 blocks in just over 16 minutes played per 24 games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/580/alonzo-mourning |title=Alonzo Mourning Stats, Bio|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mourning tore his [[patellar tendon]] in his right knee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3162228 |title=Heat's Mourning tears knee tendon while playing defense vs. Hawks |publisher=ESPN |date=December 20, 2007 |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on December 19, 2007, during the first quarter of a loss in [[2007–08 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles |last=Odum |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20071219/MIAATL/recap.html |title=Johnson, Hawks Outlast Heat in OT |publisher=National Basketball Association |date=December 20, 2007 |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=271219001 |title=Atlanta nudges Miami in OT behind Johnson's 3-point play |publisher=ESPN |date=December 19, 2007 |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mourning has averaged the most blocks in the NBA per 48 minutes with 5.46.

During the 2007–08 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by [[Dwyane Wade]]).

==Retirement==
Mourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, "I'm 38 years old and I feel like I have physically done all I can for this game."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090301/sp_afp/basketnbaheatmourning |title=NBA Heat to Retire Mourning's Jersey |publisher=Yahoo!

During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor [[Charlie Crist]]; former Georgetown University basketball coach [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]]; Basketball Hall of Famer [[Patrick Ewing]]; Heat players [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Udonis Haslem]]; and Heat head coach [[Pat Riley]].

In May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia.  In the following April, he was inducted into the [[Virginia Sports Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his outstanding high school, collegiate, and professional career as well as his commitment to volunteer service in the communities in which he has lived and worked throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vshfm.com/inductees/inductee_details.php?inducteeID=176 |title=Inductee Details – Alonzo Mourning |publisher=Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum |accessdate=October 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829044105/http://www.vshfm.com/inductees/inductee_details.php?inducteeID=176 |archive-date=August 29, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mourning announced his return to the Heat in late June 2009; he holds the position of Vice President of Player Programs and Development, which covers community outreach and mentoring young players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7015619322 |title=Zo' Busy: Mourning To Work For Heat's Front Office |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidney transplant==
On November 25, 2003, Mourning's cousin and a retired [[United States Marine Corps|U. S. Marine]], Jason Cooper, was visiting Mourning's gravely ill grandmother in the hospital.  Mourning's father was present and informed Cooper that Mourning was retiring that very same day from the NBA because of a life-threatening kidney disease, [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]], the same problem that [[Sean Elliott]] had in 1999. Cooper asked if there was anything he could do, and began to contemplate donating one of his kidneys to his estranged cousin, whom he had not seen in 25 years and whom he only knew through basketball.  Cooper was tested for compatibility, along with many other family members and friends (including fellow NBA center and good friend [[Patrick Ewing]]); during his grandmother's funeral, Mourning received the news that Jason Cooper was a match.

Mourning received Cooper's left kidney on December 19, 2003.&lt;ref name=LVA&gt;{{cite web|title=Strong Men &amp; Women in Virginia History: Alonzo Harding "Zo" Mourning Jr. (b. 1970–)|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/smw/2015/honoree.htm?bio=mourning|publisher=Library of Virginia|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable work==

[[File:Bill Clinton Alonzo Mourning CGI U.jpeg|thumb|Alonzo Mourning with former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] during [[Clinton Global Initiative]] University Day of Service at [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]] community for formerly homeless families in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami]], Florida.]]

In 1997, Mourning established Alonzo Mourning Charities Inc. to aid in the development of children and families living in at-risk situations and provides support and services that enhance the lives of youth of promise.

After being diagnosed with focal [[glomerulosclerosis]] (FSGS), Mourning launched Zo's Fund for Life, a campaign which seeks to raise funds for research, education, and testing to fight focal glomerulosclerosis. Funds are allocated toward research for a cure, education for doctors and the general public, testing for early detection and a fund for those not able to afford medication.

In 2007, Mourning along with [[Andre Agassi]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Lance Armstrong]], [[Warrick Dunn]], [[Mia Hamm]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Andrea Jaeger]], [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]], [[Mario Lemieux]], and [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] founded [[Athletes for Hope]], a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletesforhope.org/ |title=Athletes for Hope |publisher=Athletes for Hope |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he also founded the Overtown Youth Center for underprivileged kids, located in Miami, Florida. The program aims to inspire, empower, and enrich these children while teaching them to become positive contributing citizens.

In 2009, the [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools|Miami-Dade school board]] named a new high school in [[North Miami, Florida]] in his honor, [[Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus]].

==Personal life==
Mourning and his wife Tracy have three children: a son named Alonzo III ("Trey"), a daughter named Myka Sydney, and a second son named Alijah (born September 18, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackcelebkids.com/2009/09/23/celebrity-baby-news-via-alonzo-and-tracy-mourning-its-a-boy/ |title=Celebrity Baby News Via Alonzo and Tracy Mourning: It's a Boy! |publisher=Blackcelebkids.Com |accessdate=June 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018231945/http://www.blackcelebkids.com/2009/09/23/celebrity-baby-news-via-alonzo-and-tracy-mourning-its-a-boy/ |archive-date=October 18, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, Trey is a member of the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team where he starts at power forward and wears his father's signature number 33 jersey.  They reside in [[Pinecrest, Florida]], where Mourning purchased a two-story, 9,786-square-foot residence for $4.5 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailybusinessreview.com/PubArticleDBR.jsp?id=1202575843496&amp;rss=rss_dbr&amp;slreturn=20130318083856 |title=Ex-Heat star Mourning buys Pinecrest house |newspaper=Daily Business Review |date=October 23, 2012 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 Mourning was sued by Miami-based lawyer Spencer Aronfeld on behalf of Alberto Candoleria for crashing his car into another car and then leaving the scene of the accident. The [[Florida Highway Patrol]] later charged Mourning with leaving the scene of a car accident.  The accident allegedly occurred after he left [[Chris Bosh]]'s wedding in Miami Beach after 3:00 A.M. Candoleria had just been in an accident when Mourning struck his car.  He did not know if he was in his car when Mourning hit him as he claimed to have amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/07/25/2330229/fhp-zo-charged-with-leaving-the.html ''Miami Herald'' article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826231940/http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/07/25/2330229/fhp-zo-charged-with-leaving-the.html |date=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike |last=Clary |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/heat/suit-targets-ex-heat-alonzo-mourning-claiming-he-1630843.html |title=Suit targets Ex-Heat Alonzo Mourning, claiming he left crash victim too soon |work=The Palm Beach Post |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Curt |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700164627/Ex-Heat-star-Mourning-sued-over-traffic-crash.html |title=Ex-Heat star Mourning sued over traffic crash |work=Deseret News |date=July 20, 2011 |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amasis II''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄμασις}}) or '''Ahmose II''' was a [[pharaoh]] (reigned 570 BCE{{snd}}526 BCE) of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]], the successor of [[Apries]] at [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. He was the last great ruler of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] before the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] conquest.&lt;ref name="OCD"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Lloyd | first = Alan Brian  | contribution = Amasis | year = 1996  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | isbn = 0-19-521693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Most of our information about him is derived from [[Herodotus]] (2.161ff) and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence. According to the Greek historian, he was of common origins.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = Charles Peter Mason | title = Amasis (II) | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 136–137 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0145.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally an [[officer]] in the Egyptian army. His birthplace was Siuph at [[Saïs]]. He took part in a general campaign of Pharaoh [[Psamtik II]] in 592 BC in [[Nubia]].

A revolt which broke out among native Egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne. These troops, returning home from a disastrous military expedition to [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]] in Libya, suspected that they had been betrayed in order that [[Apries]], the reigning king, might rule more absolutely by means of his Greek [[mercenaries]]; many Egyptians fully sympathized with them. General Amasis, sent to meet them and quell the revolt, was proclaimed king by the rebels instead, and Apries, who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries, was defeated.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amasis|display=Amasis s.v. Amasis II.|volume=1|page=782|first=Francis Llewellyn|last=Griffith|authorlink=Francis Llewellyn Griffith}} This cites:
* [[William Flinders Petrie|W. M. Flinders Petrie]], ''History'', vol. iii.
* [[James Henry Breasted]], ''History and Historical Documents'', vol. iv. p.&amp;nbsp;509
* [[Gaston Maspero]], ''Les Empires''.&lt;/ref&gt; Apries fled to the Babylonians and was captured and killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in 567 BCE with the aid of a Babylonian army.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The Histories, Book II, Chapter 169&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription confirms the struggle between the native Egyptian and the foreign soldiery, and proves that Apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of Amasis ({{circa|567}} BCE).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Amasis then married Chedebnitjerbone II, one of the daughters of his predecessor [[Apries]], in order to legitimise his kingship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!--Dodson places her as the wife of Nakhthorheb--&gt;

Some information is known about the family origins of Amasis: his mother was a certain Tashereniset, as a bust of her, today located in the British Museum, shows.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Dodson &amp; Dyan Hilton, ''The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004. pp.245 &amp; 247&lt;/ref&gt; A stone block from Mehallet el-Kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother—Tashereniset's mother—was a certain Tjenmutetj.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson &amp; Hilton, pp.245 &amp; 247&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Egyptian - Head of King Amasis - Walters 22415.jpg|thumb|This head probably came from a temple statue of Amasis II. He wears the traditional royal nemes head cloth, with a protective uraeus serpent at the brow. Circa 560 BCE. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

His court is relatively well known. The head of the gate guard Ahmose-sa-Neith appears on numerous monuments, including the location of his sarcophagus. He was referenced on monuments of the 30th dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time.  Wahibre was 'Leader of the southern foreigners' and 'Head of the doors of foreigners', so he was the highest official for border security. Under Amasis the career of the doctor Udjahorresnet began, who was of particular importance to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Several "heads of the fleet" are known. Psamtek Meryneit and Pasherientaihet / Padineith are the only known viziers.

[[Herodotus]] describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus, Amasis was asked by [[Cambyses II]] or [[Cyrus the Great]] for an Egyptian [[ophthalmologist]] on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor, causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for this, the physician grew very close to Cambyses and suggested that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage.&lt;ref name=Hero/&gt;

Amasis, worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king, refused to give up his offspring; Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire, so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex-pharaoh [[Apries]], whom Herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by Amasis, to go to Persia instead of his own offspring.&lt;ref name="Hero"&gt;{{cite book| author = Herodotus| title = The History of Herodotus Volume I,Book II| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1uQaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA245| year = 1737| publisher = D. Midwinter| pages = 246–250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sir"&gt;{{cite book| author = Sir John Gardner Wilkinson| title = Manners and customs of the ancient Egyptians: including their private life, government, laws, art, manufactures, religions, and early history; derived from a comparison of the paintings, sculptures, and monuments still existing, with the accounts of ancient authors.

Murray| pages = 195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herodotus"&gt;{{cite book| author = Herodotus (Trans.) Robin Waterfield, Carolyn Dewald| title = The Histories| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Or5CKl1ObX4C&amp;pg=PA170| year = 1998| publisher = Oxford University Press, US| isbn = 978-0-19-158955-3| pages = 170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This daughter of Apries was none other than [[Nitetis]], who was, as per Herodotus's account, "tall and beautiful." Nitetis naturally betrayed Amasis and upon being greeted by the Persian king explained Amasis's trickery and her true origins. This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis died before Cambyses reached him, but his heir and son Psamtik III was defeated by the Persians.&lt;ref name=Hero/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;

First, Cyrus the Great signed alliance agreements with the [[Lydia]]n King [[Croesus]] and [[Nabonidus]] the Babylonian king in 542 BC. The actual aim of the agreements was to prevent aid between Egypt and her allies. With both now deprived of Egyptian support, the Persians conquered, first, Croesus's empire in 541 BCE, and, then, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE.

Herodotus also describes that just like his predecessor, Amasis relied on Greek mercenaries and councilmen. One such figure was [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]], who would later on leave Amasis, for reasons Herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis sent one of his [[eunuch]]s to capture Phanes, but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and Phanes fled to Persia, meeting up with Cambyses and providing advice in his invasion of Egypt. Egypt was finally lost to the Persians during the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|battle of Pelusium]] in 525 BC.&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;

==Egypt's wealth==
[[File:Statue of Tasherenese, mother of king Amasis II, 570-526 BCE, from Egypt, currently housed in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Statue of Tasherenese, mother of king Amasis II, 570-526 BCE, British Museum]]
Although Amasis appears first as champion of the disparaged native, he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]], and brought Egypt into closer touch with it than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration, Egypt reached a new level of wealth; Amasis adorned the temples of [[Lower Egypt]] especially with splendid [[monolith]]ic [[shrine]]s and other monuments (his activity here is proved by existing remains).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; For example, a temple built by him was excavated at [[Tell Nebesha]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Amasis assigned the commercial colony of [[Naucratis]] on the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]] to the Greeks, and when the [[temple of Delphi]] was burnt, he contributed 1,000 [[talent (weight)|talents]] to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named [[Ladice (Cyrenaean Princess)|Ladice]] daughter of King [[Battus III of Cyrene|Battus III]] and made alliances with [[Polycrates]] of Samos and [[Croesus]] of Lydia.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Under Amasis, Egypt's agricultural based economy reached its zenith. Herodotus, who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis II's death, writes that:
{{quote|It is said that it was during the reign of Ahmose II (Amasis) that Egypt attained its highest level of prosperity both in respect of what the river gave the land and in respect of what the land yielded to men and that the number of inhabited cities at that time reached in total 20,000&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, (II, 177, 1)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the [[First Cataract]], but to this he added [[Cyprus]], and his influence was great in [[Cyrene, Libya]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In his fourth year ({{circa|lk=no|567}} BCE), Amasis was able to defeat an invasion of Egypt by the Babylonians under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]; henceforth, the Babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against Amasis.&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd, 'The Late Period' in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt (ed. Ian Shaw), Oxford Univ. Press 2002 paperback, pp.381-82&lt;/ref&gt; However, Amasis was later faced with a more formidable enemy with the rise of Persia under [[Cyrus II of Persia|Cyrus]] who ascended to the throne in 559 BCE; his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending Persian onslaught against Egypt.&lt;ref name="Lloyd.(2002)p.382"&gt;Lloyd. (2002) p.382&lt;/ref&gt; With great strategic skill, Cyrus had destroyed Lydia in 546 BCE and finally defeated the Babylonians in 538 BCE which left Amasis with no major Near Eastern allies to counter Persia's increasing military might.&lt;ref name="Lloyd.(2002)p.382"/&gt; Amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the Greek states to counter the future Persian invasion into Egypt but was fortunate to have died in 526 BCE shortly before the Persians attacked.&lt;ref name="Lloyd.(2002)p.382"/&gt; The final assault instead fell upon his son [[Psamtik III]], whom the Persians defeated in 525 BCE after a reign of only six months.{{sfn|Griffith|1911}}

==Tomb and desecration==
Amasis II died in 526 BC. He was buried at the royal necropolis of Sais, and while his tomb was never discovered, Herodotus describes it for us:

{{quote|[It is] a great cloistered building of stone, decorated with pillars carved in the imitation of palm-trees, and other costly ornaments. Within the cloister is a chamber with double doors, and behind the doors stands the sepulchre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/amasis.htm Amasis]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herodotus also relates the desecration of Ahmose II/Amasis' mummy when the Persian king [[Cambyses_II | Cambyses]] conquered Egypt and thus ended the 26th Saite dynasty:
{{quote|[N]o sooner did [... Cambyses] enter the palace of Amasis that he gave orders for his [Amasis's] body to be taken from the tomb where it lay. This done, he proceeded to have it treated with every possible indignity, such as beating it with whips, sticking it with goads, and plucking its hairs. [... A]s the body had been embalmed and would not fall to pieces under the blows, Cambyses had it burned.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The Histories, Book III, Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Later reputation==

From the fifth century BCE, there is evidence of stories circulating about Amasis, in Egyptian sources (including a demotic papyrus of the third century BCE), [[Herodotus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanikos]], and [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Convivium Septem Sapientium]]''. 'In those tales Amasis was presented as a non-conventional Pharaoh, behaving in ways unbecoming to a king but gifted with practical wisdom and cunning, a trickster on the throne or a kind of comic Egyptian [[Solomon]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis M. Konstantakos, 'Trial by Riddle: The Testing of the Counsellor and the Contest of Kings in the Legend of Amasis and Bias', ''Classica et Mediaevalia'', 55 (2004), 85-137 (p. 90).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Arca was born in [[Caracas, Venezuela]]. His father was an investment banker and his mother studied International Studies. His family moved to Connecticut for a time, before returning to Venezuela, where he was privately educated and was introduced to piano lessons. He describes his childhood as "kind of in a bubble", and had difficulty accepting the fact that he was [[gay]]. He released music in his teen years by the name of Nuuro, and received moderate popularity in his home country, with praise from big national artists such as [[Los Amigos Invisibles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hutchinson |first=Kate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/31/arca-bjork-kanye-west |title=Arca: 'Nothing is off limits emotionally' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 July 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended the [[Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music]] at [[NYU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zeichner |first=Naomi |url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/10/29/gen-f-arca |title=GEN F: Arca |work=[[The Fader]] |date=29 October 2012 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Guinness''' (24 September 1725 – 23 January 1803) was an Irish brewer and the founder of the [[Guinness]] brewery business and [[Guinness family|family]]. He was also an entrepreneur and philanthropist.

At 27, in 1752, Guinness's godfather [[Arthur Price (archbishop)|Arthur Price]], the [[Church of Ireland]] Archbishop of Cashel, bequeathed him £100 in his will. Guinness invested the money and in 1755 had a brewery at [[Leixlip]], just 17&amp;nbsp;km from Dublin. In 1759, Guinness went to the city and set up his own business. He took a 9,000-year lease&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinness.com/en-row/thestory.html The Story: "1759: It begins with a signature"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022021553/http://www.guinness.com/en-row/thestory.html |date=22 October 2013 }} Official web site. Retrieved&lt; 22 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on the {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} brewery at St. James's Gate from the descendants of [[Sir Mark Rainsford]] for an annual rent of £45.

Guinness's flowery red signature is still copied on every label of bottled [[Guinness]].

== Background ==
Arthur Guinness's parents Richard and Elizabeth were both the children of [[tenant farmer]]s in [[County Dublin|Dublin]] and [[County Kildare|Kildare]]. Richard's family claimed a descent from the Gaelic [[Magennis]] clan of [[County Down]].&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Robert Bell "The Book of Ulster Surnames", published 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[DNA]] evidence however suggests descent from the [[McCartan]]s, another [[County Down]] clan, whose spiritual home of Kinelarty included the townland of "Guiness" near [[Ballynahinch, County Down]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7145951.stm|title=Guinness origins begin to settle|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinness's place and date of birth are the subject of speculation. His gravestone in [[Oughterard, County Kildare]] says he died on 23 January 1803, "in his 78th year", i.e. aged 77, indicating that he was born in 1725. There is no proof of the date of 28 September 1725 chosen by the Guinness company in 1991, apparently to end speculation about his birthdate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Article.php?Page=1377|title=Cold, Hard Football Facts.com: The Truth Hurts|work=Cold, Hard Football Facts|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place of birth was perhaps his mother's home at [[Ardclough#Lived in Ardclough|Read homestead]] at [[Ardclough]] [[County Kildare]].&lt;ref&gt;Corry, Eoghan and Tancred, Jim "The Annals of Ardclough" pp70-71 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 it was claimed he was born in nearby [[Celbridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maynooth.org/?p=2309|title=Maynooth Town|work=maynooth.org|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his parents lived in 1725 and where his father worked as an agent for the cleric Dr. [[Arthur Price (archbishop)|Arthur Price]], and may (or may not) have brewed beer for the household. 

In his will, Dr. Price left £100 each to "his servant" Arthur and his father in 1752. Starting his first brewery in [[Leixlip]] in 1755, Arthur then bought a long lease of an adjacent site from [[George Bryan]] "of [[Philadelphia]] in the [[Province of Pennsylvania]]" in 1756, that was developed as investment property.&lt;ref&gt;George Bryan was born in Dublin in 1731, and became one of the American revolutionary leaders in the 1770s.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Guinness Home on Thomas Street.jpg|thumb|Arthur Guinness's home on Thomas Street]]

In 1761 he married Olivia Whitmore in [[St. Mary's Church, Dublin]], and they had [[List of people with the most children|21 children]], 10 of whom lived to adulthood. Olivia's father was William Whitmore, a grocer in Essex Street, [[Temple Bar, Dublin]], and her mother was Mary Grattan from Drummin House, [[Carbury]], [[County Kildare]]. Olivia also brought a [[dowry]] of £1,000.

From 1764 they lived at Beaumont House, which he had built on a {{convert|51|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm, which is now a part of Beaumont Convalescent Home, behind the main part of [[Beaumont Hospital, Dublin|Beaumont Hospital]], between [[Santry]] and [[Raheny]] in north [[County Dublin]]. His landlord was [[Charles Gardiner]].&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Ireland, Gardiner Papers, Mss. 36,501-36,626&lt;/ref&gt; The townland name of Kilmore was renamed by Arthur as [[Beaumont, Dublin|Beaumont]] (meaning beautiful hill) and the later Beaumont parish copied the name. From March 1798 he lived at [[Mountjoy Square]] in Dublin, which was then in the process of being built in the style of elegant [[Georgian architecture]], where his landlord was Gardiner's son [[Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy|Luke]]. Three of his sons were also brewers, and his other descendants eventually included missionaries, politicians, and authors (see: [[Guinness family]]).

He died in Dublin and was buried in his mother's family plot at [[Oughter Ard#Arthur Guinness and Other Notable Burials|Oughterard, County Kildare]] in January 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/the-man-behind-the-world-s-favorite-pint-arthur-guinness|title=Arthur Guinness, founder of the Dublin brewery, dies in 1803|date=2017-01-23|work=IrishCentral.com|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Guinness supported [[Henry Grattan]] in the 1780s and 1790s, not least because Grattan wanted to reduce the tax on beer. He was one of the four brewers' guild representatives on [[Dublin Corporation]] from the 1760s until his death. Like Grattan, Guinness was publicly in favour of [[Catholic Emancipation]] from 1793, but he was not a supporter of the [[United Irishmen]] during the [[1798 rebellion]] and was accused of spying for the British.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-13 |work=The Economist |accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was against Irish home-rule.&lt;ref name="Google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=807iAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=arthur+guinness+anglo-irish&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hzPyMVCeK9&amp;sig=Hu5dl4kxM_KyHiExPTHDW73Kr2I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sObKVL6MKJKwsATdwYDoAw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=arthur%20guinness%20anglo-irish&amp;f=false|title=Flann O'Brien &amp; Modernism|work=google.com|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the Guinness family became [[Irish Unionist]]s and Arthur Guinness accepted the system,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0919/1224254847574.html Who was Arthur Guinness?

== Brewer of porter ==
[[File:Guinness Brewery 9000 year lease.jpg|thumb|The 9,000-year lease on display]]
Guinness leased a brewery in [[Leixlip]] in 1755, brewing [[ale]]. Five years later he left his younger brother Richard in charge of that enterprise and moved on to another in [[St. James's Gate Brewery|St. James' Gate]], Dublin, at the end of 1759. The 9,000-year lease he signed for the brewery is presently displayed in the floor at St. James' Gate, effective from 31 December 1759. By 1767 he was elected Master of the Dublin Corporation of Brewers. His first actual sales of [[porter (beer)|porter]] were listed on tax (excise) data from 1778, and it seems that other Dublin brewers had experimented in brewing porter beer from the 1760s. From the 1780s his second son [[The Second Arthur Guinness|Arthur]] (1768–1855) worked at his side and eventually became the senior partner in the brewery from 1803. He commented on this in a letter of 1790:
:"''..one of my sons is grown up to be able to assist me in this Business, or I wd not have attempted it, tho' prompted by a demand of providing for Ten Children now living out of one &amp; twenty born to us, &amp; more likely yet to come...''"&lt;ref&gt;Guinness P. "Arthur's Round" 2008 p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

His major achievement was in expanding his brewery in 1797–99. Thereafter he brewed only porter and employed members of the Purser family, [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] from [[Tewkesbury]] who had brewed porter in [[London]] until 1776. The Pursers became partners in the brewery for most of the 19th century. By his death in 1803 the annual brewery output was over 20,000 barrels. Subsequently, Arthur and/or his beer was nicknamed "[[Guinness|Uncle Arthur]]" in Dublin.

== Arthur Guinness Fund ==
[[File:GuinnessBeer.jpg|thumb|A can of Guinness featuring Arthur Guinness's signature]]
To further honour Arthur Guinness's legacy, in 2009 Guinness &amp; Co. established the '''Arthur Guinness Fund''' (AGF). An internal fund set up by the Company, its aim is to enable and empower individuals with skills and opportunities to deliver a measured benefit to their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinness.com/en-row/agf/default.html|title=Arthur Guinness|work=guinness.com|accessdate=19 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723024255/http://www.guinness.com/en-row/agf/default.html|archivedate=23 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinness has donated more than €7 million to the Fund since its inception.

Arthur is one of a handful of Irish people commemorated twice [[List of people on the postage stamps of Ireland|on stamps]], in 1959 and 2009.

In October 2013 a statue of him was erected in his birthplace Celbridge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leinsterleader.ie/news/local-news/arthur-guinness-arrives-home-to-celbridge-1-5578650 Leinster Leader, October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a series of pathways were created beside places from his early life by [[Kildare County Council]], known collectively as "Arthur's Way".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kildare.ie/CountyCouncil/media/Photos%20for%20Press%20Release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audrey Marie Munson''' (June 8, 1891 – February 20, 1996) was an American [[model (person)|artist's model]] and film actress, considered "America's First Supermodel,"&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"&gt;{{Cite book|first=James|last=Bone|title=The Curse of Beauty: The Scandalous and Tragic Life of Audrey Munson, America's First Supermodel|publisher=ReganArts|location=New York City|date=2016|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and variously known as "Miss Manhattan", the "Panama–Pacific Girl", the "Exposition Girl" and "American Venus". She was the model or inspiration for more than 12 statues in [[New York City]] and was the first American movie star to appear fully nude in film, in ''[[Inspiration (1915 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1915), appearing in four [[silent film]]s.&lt;ref name=gilding /&gt;

==Life and career==
{{quotation|Long after she and everyone else of this generation shall have become dust, Audrey Munson, who posed for three-fifths of all the statuary of the Panama–Pacific exposition, will live in the bronzes and canvasses of the art centers of the world.|''New Oxford Item'', April 1, 1915&lt;ref name="New Oxford"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=April 1, 1915 |title=Audrey Munson |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/9806831/ |newspaper=New Oxford Item |location=[[New Oxford, Pennsylvania]] |access-date=January 23, 2016|subscription=yes|via=newspapers.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Audrey Marie Munson was born in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on June 8, 1891.&lt;ref name="audrey"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rediscovering Audrey |first= Justin D. |last=White |url= http://www.andreageyer.info/projects/audrey_munson/munson_book/MunsonPages/PDF/JustinWhite.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Andreageyer.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was from [[Mexico (town), New York|Mexico, New York]], and she later lived there. Her parents, Edgar Munson and Katherine "Kittie" Mahaney, divorced when she was eight, and Audrey and her mother moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="db"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bone | first = James | title =The Glamorous Life And Tragic Fall of America’s First Supermodel | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/24/the-glamorous-life-and-tragic-fall-of-america-s-first-supermodel.html | website =[[The Daily Beast]]  | date = Apr 23, 2016 | access-date = Apr 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, when she was 17 years old, Audrey Munson moved to New York with her mother to become an actress and chorus girl.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt; Her first role on Broadway was as a "footman" in ''The Boy and The Girl'' at the Aerial Garden, which ran from May 31-June 19, 1909.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/Person/View/409405|title=Internet Broadway Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in ''The Girl and the Wizard'', ''Girlies'' and ''La Belle Paree''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[File:Star, for the "Colonnade of Stars," Court of the Universe building, 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco.jpg|alt=Star, for the "Colonnade of Stars," Court of the Universe building, 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco|thumb|left|220px|''Star Maiden'', for the "Colonnade of Stars," Court of the Universe building, 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco]]

While window-shopping on Fifth Avenue with her mother, she was spotted by photographer [[Felix Benedict Herzog]], who asked her to pose for him at his studio in the Lincoln Arcade Building on Broadway and 65th Street.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt; Herzog introduced her to his friends in the art world, and she began to pose for numerous artists. It was the sculptor [[Isidore Konti]] who first persuaded her to pose nude, using her as his model for the three figures in his ''Three Graces'' for the new Grand Ballroom at the Hotel Astor in Times Square.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt; For the next decade, Munson became the model of choice for a host of sculptors and painters in New York. According to ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'' in 1913, "Over a hundred artists agree that if the name of Miss Manhattan belongs to anyone in particular it is to this young woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobs|first1=Andrew |title=Rescuing a Heroine From the Clutches of Obscurity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/14/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-up-close-rescuing-heroine-clutches-obscurity.html|accessdate=April 9, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=April 14, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915, she was so well established that she became [[Alexander Stirling Calder]]'s model of choice for the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] held that year. She posed for three-fifths of the sculpture created for the event&lt;ref name="New Oxford" /&gt; and earned fame as the "Panama–Pacific Girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=June 27, 1915|title=The Broad Minded Romance of the Famous Panama-Pacific Girl |url=http://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&amp;d=RTD19150627.1.50 |newspaper=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her newfound celebrity helped launch her career in the nascent film industry and she starred in four silent films. In the first, ''[[Inspiration (1915 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1915), the story of a sculptor's model, she appeared [[nude scene|fully nude]], the first woman to do so in an American motion picture. The censors were reluctant to ban the film, fearing they would also have to ban [[Renaissance art]]. Munson's films were a [[box office]] success, although the critics were divided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Rozas and Bourne-Gottehrer| title=American Venus: The Extraordinary Life of Audrey Munson, Model and Muse| publisher= Balcony Press|location= Los Angeles|date=1999 |pages= 81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio hired a lookalike named Jane Thomas to do Munson's acting scenes, while Munson did the scenes where she posed nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donnelly |first=Elisabeth |url= http://www.believermag.com/issues/201508/?read=article_donnelly |title= Descending Night |work=[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]] | volume= 13 |issue=2 |date= Summer 2015 |accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second film, ''Purity'' (1916), made in Santa Barbara, California, is the only one of her films to survive, being rediscovered in 1993 in a "pornography" collection in France and acquired by the French national cinema archive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt; Her third film, ''The Girl o' Dreams'', also made in Santa Barbara, was completed by the fall of 1916 and was copyrighted on December 31, 1918, but appears never to have been released.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt;

Munson returned to the East Coast by train via Syracuse in December 1916 and became involved with high society in New York and Newport, Rhode Island. Her mother insisted she marry "Comstock Lode" silver heir Hermann Oelrichs Jr., then the richest bachelor in America, but there is no record of Audrey Munson's making this claim herself. On January 27, 1919, she wrote a rambling letter to the US State Department denouncing Hermann Oelrichs Jr. as part of a pro-German network that had driven her out of the movie business. She said she planned to abandon the United States to restart her movie career in England.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fold3.com/image/3621646/|title=Fold3.com FBI archive "Old German Case Files"|last=|first=|date=1919|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Audrey Munson was living with her mother in a boarding house at 164 West 65th Street, Manhattan, owned by Dr. Walter Wilkins. Wilkins fell in love with Munson and murdered his wife, Julia, so he could be available for marriage.&lt;ref name="gilding" /&gt; Munson and her mother left New York, and the police sought them for questioning. After a nationwide hunt, they were located. They refused to return to New York, but were questioned by agents from the Burns Detective Agency in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. The contents of the affidavits they supplied have never been revealed, but Audrey Munson strongly denied she had any romantic relationship with Dr. Wilkins.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt; Wilkins was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to the [[electric chair]]. He [[hanging|hanged]] himself in his prison cell before the sentence could be carried out.&lt;ref name="obscurity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keithyorkcity.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/audrey-munson-miss-manhattan-died-in-obscurity-in-1996/ |title=Audrey Munson: "Miss Manhattan" Died in Obscurity in 1996 &amp;#124; Keith York City |publisher=Keithyorkcity.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sunset-FC-October-1915.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Munson was the model for [[Adolph Alexander Weinman]]'s ''The Setting Sun'', created for the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] and featured on the cover of ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'' magazine (October 1915)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balconypress.com/html/venus.html |title=American Venus |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=Balcony Press |access-date=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By 1920, Munson, unable to find work anywhere, was living in [[Syracuse, New York]], supported by her mother, who sold kitchen utensils door to door. In February 1921, agent-producer Allan Rock took out advertisements showing a $27,500 check he said he had paid Munson to star in a fourth film titled ''[[Heedless Moths]]''. She later said the $27,500 check was just a "publicity stunt," and she filed suit against Allan Rock.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt; The 1921 film was based on her life story, which was then being serialized in dozens of newspapers,&lt;ref name="Thanhouser" /&gt; and on short stories and other articles she had written for ''Hearst's Sunday Magazine''.&lt;ref name="AFI" /&gt; In the series of twenty articles that recounted her life story, she asked the reader to imagine her future:&lt;ref name="gilding" /&gt;

{{Quote|What becomes of the artists' models? I am wondering if many of my readers have not stood before a masterpiece of lovely sculpture or a remarkable painting of a young girl, her very abandonment of draperies accentuating rather than diminishing her modesty and purity, and asked themselves the question, "Where is she now, this model who was so beautiful?"}}

On May 27, 1922, Munson attempted suicide by swallowing a solution of [[bichloride of mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Model Who Attempted Suicide by Poison Will Recover |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/05/29/archives/audrey-munson-is-out-of-danger-model-who-attempted-suicide-by.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 29, 1922 |accessdate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 1931,  her mother petitioned a judge to commit her to a lunatic asylum. The Oswego County judge ordered Munson be admitted into a psychiatric facility for treatment. She remained in the [[Ogdensburg Correctional Facility|St. Lawrence State Hospital for the Insane]] in [[Ogdensburg, New York|Ogdensburg]], where she was treated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[schizophrenia]], for 65 years, until her death at the age of 104.&lt;ref name=gilding&gt;{{cite news |first=Saki |last=Knafo |title=The Girl Beneath the Gilding  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/nyregion/thecity/09muns.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 9, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Brock, Chris|url=http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20140919/CURR/140918631|title=‘American Muse’ story of beauty from Oswego County carved in stone, forgotten in memory|newspaper=[[Watertown Daily Times]]|date=September 19, 2014|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, she had no visitors at all, but she was rediscovered in the asylum by a half-niece, Darlene Bradley, in 1984, when Munson was 93.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2016"/&gt; Munson died February 20, 1996 at the age of 104.&lt;ref&gt;Number: ''082-42-0284''; Issue State: ''New York''; Issue Date: ''1996''. Ancestry.com. ''U.S., Social Security Death Index, 1935–2014'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT: USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried without a gravestone of her own in the Munson family plot in New Haven Cemetery, [[New Haven, New York]] until 2016, 20 years after her death when her family decided to add a simple tombstone for what would have been her 125th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|grid=15080347|name=Audrey Marie Munson| accessdate= May 26, 2016|date=July 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades after her career ended, she was sufficiently famous to serve as the subject of an anecdote in a memoir that [[P.G. Wodehouse]] and [[Guy Bolton]] wrote of their years on Broadway, ''[[Bring on the Girls!]]'' (1953), though that memoir is considered more fiction than fact by Wodehouse's biographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson |first= Frances |title=P.G. Wodehouse: The Authorized Biography |publisher=Futura |location =London | date=1983 |isbn= 0-7088-2356-4 | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1996 recounted the story:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weller|first1=Steve|title=Famed Artist's Model Bared All for a Playwright |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/16/nyregion/l-famed-artist-s-model-bared-all-for-a-playwright-023604.html|accessdate=April 9, 2016| work=The New York Times|date=June 16, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Wodehouse was working alone in an apartment that has recently been vacated by a sculptor. His wife told him to expect a woman who would redo the couch, so when Audrey Munson knocked and asked if there was any work for her, Wodehouse said yes and "How much would it be altogether?"

"You want the altogether?" she replied and ducked into a bedroom. She "emerged in an advanced form of nudity," which Wodehouse thought was "pretty eccentric even for a lady decorator."

Anyway, things got sorted out, and Bolton thought the situation so funny that he incorporated it into the play they were working on, ''Oh, Lady, Lady''.}}}}

'''Aureliano Blanquet''' ([[Morelia]], [[Michoacán]], 31 December 1849 – 15 April 1919 Barranca de Chavaxtla, [[Huatusco]], [[Veracruz]]) was a general of the Federal Army during the [[Mexican Revolution|Mexican Civil War]]. He was a key participant  in the [[coup d'état]] during the [[Decena trágica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Blanquet Led Coup D'etat. But Diaz's Attitude and Strong Position Caused Madero's Downfall. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1913/02/20/archives/blanquet-led-coup-detat-but-diazs-attitude-and-strong-position.html |quote=Although Gen. Felix Diaz knew nothing of the arrest of Francisco I. Madero until Gen. Victoriano Huerta and Gen. Aureliano Blanquet had captured the Mexican President in his quarters in the National Palace yesterday morning, it was the rebel leader, nevertheless, who brought about the downfall of the Madero Government. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= 1913-02-20|accessdate=2010-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanquet has been identified "as one of the major villains of the Mexican Revolution".
&lt;ref name=H65&gt;Henderson, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early career===
Blanquet was born in 1849 in [[Morelia]], [[Michoacán]]. At 18 he joined the Republican forces besieging the city of [[Queretaro]] where the last of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]]'s Imperial troops had been trapped. After the surrender Blanquet served as a member of the firing squad which executed Maximilian and two of his generals: [[Miguel Miramón]] and [[Tomás Mejía]].

In 1877 Blanquet enlisted in the regular Federal Army. Under [[Porfirio Diaz]] he made steady but unspectacular advancement. While holding the rank of captain he was involved in the suppression of a Maya rising in [[Yucatan]] during the 1890s.

===During the Mexican Revolution===
In July 1911 Blanquet commanded federal troops stationed in [[Puebla (city)|Puebla]].&lt;ref name=H65&gt;Henderson, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12 a group of armed men fired shots at the rival [[Maderistas]] and fled into the federal army barracks.&lt;ref name=H65/&gt; The incident erupted into an all-out battle in which Blanquet defeated the Maderistas. 46 were killed, including women and children.&lt;ref name=H65/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David LaFrance, “The Mexican Revolution in Puebla” 1989, p115&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day [[Francisco I. Madero|Madero]] publicly hugged Blanquet and cleared him of any wrongdoing; he ordered radical Maderistas to surrender arms to Blanquet's ''Federales'' and go home.&lt;ref name=H66&gt;Henderson, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Puebla Incident also created international tension after the fleeing Maderistas killed German and Spanish expatriates who stood in their way.&lt;ref name=H66/&gt;

During May 1912 Blanquet served under General [[Victoriano Huerta]], leading the 29th Infantry Battalion in the successful suppression of the Orozquista revolt against the Madero government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rene|last=De La Pedraja|page=171|title=Wars of Latin America 1899-1941|isbn=9780786482573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1913, General Huerta dismissed General Mondragon as Secretary of War, and replaced him with Blanquet.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Henderson, “Felix Díaz” 1981, p101&lt;/ref&gt; Now promoted to the rank of General of Division, Blanquet was also appointed to hold the position of Minister of Marine (i.e. Navy).

In October 1913 Huerta dissolved the Federal Congress and prepared for a rigged [[referendum]] to legitimize himself as the President, with Blanquet named as Vice-President.&lt;ref name=L7&gt;LaFrance, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1914, when the Huerta government collapsed, Blanquet resigned as Vice President, and departed from Mexico with Huerta.&lt;ref&gt;John Eisenhower, “Intervention!” 1993, p149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, “Huerta” 1972, p208&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 1914 General Blanquet, having returned from overseas, intervened in the disbandment process of Huerta's defeated Federal army. He led the 29th Battalion of 400 men, which he had formerly commanded, plus other remnants of Federal troops dissatisfied with their redundancy payments,&lt;ref name=L49&gt;LaFrance, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; against Carrancistas in [[Puebla (city)|Puebla]]. Blanquet captured the city and learned that two Carrancistas agents, brothers Ramon and Raphael Cabrera, were on their way to Puebla to assert the authority of the new government. Blanquet's federals captured the Cabreras and shot them on Blanquet's order. The two surviving Cabrera brothers, [[Luiz Cabrera|Luiz]] and [[Alfonso Cabrera|Alfonso]], avenged the dead with a campaign of terror, killing over sixty Federal prisoners.&lt;ref name=L49&gt;LaFrance, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Blanquet escaped and resumed his exile, in Cuba.

===Death===
In March 1919, Blanquet returned from exile in Cuba, to support the Felix Díaz rebellion against Carranza.  With only about six followers he moved inland from the Gulf Coast in an attempt to join up with Diaz.  On April 7, 1919, Blanquet was killed when his horse fell down a ravine after a skirmish with government troops near La Barranca de Chavaxtla, Veracruz.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Henderson, “Felix Díaz” 1981, p141&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutionalist commander General Guadalupe Sanchez had Blanquet's head taken to Veracruz for display and photographing.

'''Cinta Laura Kiehl''', better known as '''Cinta Laura''' ({{IPA-id|ˈtʃinta ˈlaura|}}; born  August 17, 1993), is an Indonesian-German actress, electropop singer and model in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cintalaura.blogseleb.com/bio/ |title=Cinta Laura|publisher=Blogseleb.com|year=2007|accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Life and career ==

===1993-2007: childhood and early career===
Laura was born on August 17, 1993 in [[Quakenbrück]], [[Germany]]. Her father, Michael Kiehl, was a German hotelier, and her mother, Herdiana Soekarseno, was an [[Indonesia]]n lawyer of ethnic [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] descent. Due to her father’s job, Cinta grew up in several countries such as the UAE, [[Malaysia]], [[Germany]] and finally [[Indonesia]], which led her to grow up with English as her first language despite her German and Indonesian background.

Upon her move to Indonesia, Cinta began to cultivate her love for sports. Her love for swimming led her to become a competitive swimmer, competing against dozens of international schools in the country. By the time she was 12, she had attained 10 gold medals, 7 silver medals and 7 bronze medals from various swim meets. In 2006 Cinta suffered from appendicitis, which led to an operation that required her to remain inactive for three months. During this break, her dance teacher encouraged her to join an acting/modeling competition. Though initially hesitant due to her preference for sports, she took up the challenge and participated in the competition. Little did she know that this competition was going to change her life forever.

To Cinta’s surprise she won the first place for modeling. One of the judges, who was a casting director for one of the biggest production house in Indonesia, immediately offered her a contract for a leading role in a local TV soap series. Weeks later she signed a contract with MD Entertainment and started her journey as an actress. Due to her rusty Indonesian and inexperience in acting, MD Entertainment provided Cinta with both an Indonesian teacher and acting coach. In February 2007, her first soap, ''[[Cinderella: Apakah Cinta Hanyalah Mimpi?]]'' aired on [[SCTV (Indonesia)|SCTV]]. Within weeks it became the most popular show in the country. Cinta’s popularity rose at an immense pace. Shortly before her 14th birthday in August 2007, she received an award for Best Actress, beating other female actresses who have been in the industry for years. The show also won Best Sinetron (TV soap) that year. ''[[Cinderella: Apakah Cinta Hanyalah Mimpi?]]'' lasted for 310 episodes and ended due to Cinta’s need for a break in order to attain some normality in her teenage life.

===2008-2010: ''Oh Baby'' &amp; ''Cinta Laura''===
Her break from the industry did not last long as Cinta began to shoot her first movie ''Oh Baby'' in February 2008. The Step Up inspired movie was catered to young teens as it depicted a young girl pursuing her dream of becoming a dancer in order to provide for her beloved grandpa while finding love on the way. In 2008, Cinta also began her singing career, having her first single debut as the soundtrack of her film. Her first single "Oh Baby" reigned in the number position of various charts in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei Darussalam]]. 2008 proved to be Cinta’s year as she received numerous awards from various renowned teenage magazines such as Gadis, in which she was dubbed Artist of the Year. She also won her first Kids Choice Awards (Indonesia) for Best Actress and was also nominated for Best Singer. Midway through 2008, Cinta also began filming her second TV soap series, ''Upik Abu dan Laura'', which was a tremendous success in both [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].

In 2009 Cinta made the executive decision to slowdown as the 11th grade was approaching. Aware of the difficulty of the last two years of High School prior to university, Cinta decided to switch her focus not to studying but to the music industry as it consumed less time. However, as a farewell gift to her fans, Cinta filmed her last TV soap series, ''Air Mata Cinta'' over the summer of 2009. As she entered the 11th grade, she began restricting her schedule to weekends, in which she spent time recording her first self-titled studio album, ''[[Cinta Laura (album)|Cinta Laura]]''. The album was released in February 2010 and sold over a million copies, which made it a great success. In the summer of 2010, Cinta received the most honorable award one could receive from the Kids Choice Awards (Indonesia), the Wannabe Artist Award of 2010.

===2011-present: Early international career===
Later in 2010, Cinta filmed another movie called ''SKJ: Seleb Kota Jogja'', which validated her role as both an actress and a singer. Due to her academics, Cinta decided to take a real break. Her hectic schedule alongside stress from having to juggle both her education and career led her to decide on quitting the movie industry in Indonesia. Nonetheless, it all paid of as she graduated from the [[Jakarta International School]] (JIS) with honors in June 2011. In the summer of 2011, prior to her preparation for college, Cinta focused on recording her second studio album titled, ''[[Hollywood Dreams]]''. In addition to all that, Cinta was also offered to act in an American produced movie ''[[After the Dark]]'', starring [[Bonnie Wright]] and [[James D’Arcy]]. As a result, plans changed and Cinta began filming her first Hollywood movie in June 2011.

In September 2011, Cinta moved to the [[United States]] to study at [[Columbia University]] in the city of [[New York City|New York]]. While at Columbia, she joined the sorority [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://issuu.com/thetafdn/docs/finalfinalkat_annualreport-2012-13/52&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her full-time dedication as a student, Cinta spent her winter break in January 2012 recording two singles with American music producers in [[Los Angeles]]. These two singles, "Boomerang" and "Playlist" became her first English singles and were placed in her second studio album, which was released in July 2012. In the summer of 2012, Cinta again spent her holiday touring Indonesia to promote her album.

Soon after, Cinta took a yearlong break from the industry and did not return to Indonesia until the summer of 2013. She was offered to do a live show called ''YKS: Yuk Kita Sahur'', a show conceptually similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. To everyone’s surprise the show became a big hit and has been rated number one ever since. As a result of the show’s great success, Cinta rejoined the cast of ''YKS'' during the months of December 2013 and January 2014.

Despite Cinta’s success and achievements, education has always been her number one priority. Her determination and ambition has led her to attain great success at Columbia University, allowing her to graduate a year earlier than expected. She is also a teaching assistant (TA) for Professor Herbert Terrace in Columbia’s psychology department. Cinta graduated cum laude from the university in May 2014. Additionally, she is also preparing for her move to Los Angeles in order to pursue her acting career in Hollywood.

}}'''Edmund Valentine White III''' (born January 13, 1940) is an American novelist, memoirist, and an essayist on literary and social topics.  Much of his writing is on the theme of same-sex love. His books include ''[[The Joy of Gay Sex]]'' (1977) (written with [[Charles Silverstein]]), his trio of autobiographic novels, ''[[A Boy's Own Story]]'' (1982), ''[[The Beautiful Room Is Empty]]'' (1988) and ''[[The Farewell Symphony]]'' (1997), and his biography of [[Jean Genet]].

==Early life==
Edmund Valentine White was born on January 13, 1940, in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. White largely grew up in Chicago, Illinois. He attended [[Cranbrook Kingswood School|Cranbrook School]] in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], as a boy. Afterwards he studied Chinese at the [[University of Michigan]], graduating in 1962.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Incestuous feelings existed in White's family; his mother was attracted to him.  White spoke of his own sexual attraction to his father in an interview: "I think with my father he was somebody who every eye in the family was focused on and he was a sort of a tyrant and nice-looking, the source of all power, money, happiness, and he was implacable and difficult. He was always spoken of in sexual terms, in the sense he left our mother for a much younger woman who was very sexy but had nothing else going for her. He was a famous womanizer. And he slept with my sister!"&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Edmund White on writing, incest, life and Larry Kramer#On incest in his family|Interview with Edmund White]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also stated: "Writing has always been my recourse when I've tried to make sense of my experience or when it's been very painful. When I was 15 years old, I wrote my first (unpublished) novel about being gay, at a time when there were no other gay novels. So I was really inventing a genre, and it was a way of administering a therapy to myself, I suppose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevedow.com.au/default.aspx?id=247|title=Steve Dow, Journalist|work=stevedow.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
White declined admission to [[Harvard University]]'s Chinese doctoral program in favor of following a lover to New York, where he worked for eight years as a staffer at [[Time-Life Books]] and freelanced for ''[[Newsweek]]''. After briefly relocating to [[Rome]] and then New York, he was briefly employed as an editor for the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' when the magazine was based in [[San Francisco]] in the early 1970s; after the magazine folded in 1973, White returned to New York to edit ''[[Horizon (U.S. magazine)|Horizon]]'' (a quarterly cultural journal) and freelance as a writer and editor for entities, including Time-Life and ''[[The New Republic]]''.

White is gay and much of his work draws on his gay experience. His debut novel, ''Forgetting Elena'' (1973), set on an island, can be read as commenting on gay culture in a coded manner. The American/Russian novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] called it "a marvelous book".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bloomsburybooks.tumblr.com/post/269220622/how-did-one-edit-nabokov Edmund White, ''City Boy'', 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926112748/http://bloomsburybooks.tumblr.com/post/269220622/how-did-one-edit-nabokov |date=September 26, 2015 }} ("Gerald Clarke...had gone to Montreux to do an interview with Nabokov for ''Esquire'', and followed the usual drill...On his last evening in Switzerland he confronted Nabokov over drinks: 'So whom do you like?' he asked—since the great man had so far only listed his dislikes and aversions. 'Edmund White' Nabokov responded. 'He wrote ''Forgetting Elena''. It’s a marvelous book." He’d then gone on to list titles by [[John Updike]] and [[Delmore Schwartz]] (particularly the short story "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities"), as well as Robbe-Grillet’s ''Jealousy'' among a few others.")&lt;/ref&gt; Written with psychotherapist [[Charles Silverstein]], ''The Joy of Gay Sex'' (1977) made him known to a wider readership. His next novel, ''Nocturnes for the King of Naples'' (1978) was explicitly gay-themed and drew on his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/14/reviews/white-nocturnes.html |title=Apostrophes to a Dead Lover |first=John |last=Yohalem |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 10, 1978 |accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 to 1981, White was a member of a gay writers' group, [[The Violet Quill]], that met briefly during that period and included [[Andrew Holleran]] and [[Felice Picano]]. White's autobiographic works are frank and unapologetic about his promiscuity and his [[HIV]]-positive status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art12352.html | work=The Body | title=AIDS, Arts and Responsibilities: An Interview With Edmund White | first=Mark | last=Mascolini | date=August 2005 | accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, he brought out ''States of Desire'', a survey of some aspects of gay life in America. In 1982, he helped found the group [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jan/03/edmund-white-city-boy-extracts | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A walk on the wild side in 70s New York | first=Gaby | last=Wood | date=January 3, 2010 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year appeared White's best-known work, ''[[A Boy's Own Story]]'' &amp;mdash; the first volume of an autobiographic-fiction series, continuing  with ''[[The Beautiful Room Is Empty]]'' (1988) and ''[[The Farewell Symphony]]'' (1997), describing stages in the life of a gay man from boyhood to middle age. Several characters in the latter novel are recognizably based on well-known people from White's New York-centered literary and artistic milieu.&lt;ref name="NYTimesBenfey"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|date=September 14, 1997|accessdate=March 12, 2013|first=Christopher|last=Benfey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/14/reviews/970914.14benfeyt.html|title=The Dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 to 1990 White lived in France. In 1984 in Paris he was involved in the foundation of the French HIV/AIDS organisation, [[AIDES]]. During this period, he brought out his novel, ''Caracole'' (1985), which centres on heterosexual relationships. After returning to America White maintained his interest in France and French literature, publishing ''Genet: a biography'' (1993), ''Our Paris: sketches from memory'' (1995), ''Marcel Proust'' (1998), ''The Flaneur: a stroll through the paradoxes of Paris'' (2000) and ''Rimbaud'' (2008).

[[File:Edmund White BBF 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|White at the 2011 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]]

The novel ''The Married Man'' (2000) is gay-themed and draws on White's life. ''Fanny: A Fiction'' (2003) is a historical novel about novelist [[Frances Trollope]] and social reformer [[Frances Wright]] in early 19th-century America. White's 2006 play ''Terre Haute'' (produced in New York City in 2009) portrays discussions that take place when a prisoner, based on terrorist bomber [[Timothy McVeigh]], is visited by a writer based on [[Gore Vidal]]. (In real life McVeigh and Vidal corresponded but did not meet.)

In 2005 White published his autobiography, ''My Lives'' &amp;mdash; organised by theme rather than chronology &amp;mdash; and in 2009 his memoir of New York life in the 1960s and 1970s, ''City Boy''.

White has been influential as a literary and cultural critic, particularly on same-sex love and sexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

He is currently a professor of creative writing in [[Princeton University]]'s Lewis Center for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~visarts/cwr/faculty/ewhite.html |title=The Program in Creative Writing, Princeton University |work=princeton.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305082049/http://www.princeton.edu/~visarts/cwr/faculty/ewhite.html |archivedate=March 5, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, White was reported by his husband, [[Michael Carroll (American writer)|Michael Carroll]], to be making 'remarkable' recovery after suffering two strokes in previous months.&lt;ref name=Blade&gt;Reece, Phil. ''Washington Blade''. {{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2012/06/01/edmund-whites-partner-after-stroke-his-improvement-is-remarkable/|title=Edmund White’s partner after stroke: ‘his improvement is remarkable’|date=June 1, 2012|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has received many awards and distinctions. Among these he is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and an Officier de [[l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. He received the inaugural [[Bill Whitehead Award]] for Lifetime Achievement from [[Publishing Triangle]] in 1989, and is also the namesake of the organization's [[Edmund White Award]] for Debut Fiction.

In 2014, Edmund White was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto, for his contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pennantmediagroup.com/en/the-2014-bonham-centre-awards-gala-celebrates-power-of-the-word-on-april-24-2014-honouring-authors-and-writers-who-have-contributed-to-the-public-understanding-of-sexual-diversity-in-canada/|title=The 2014 Bonham Centre Awards Gala celebrates Power of the Word on April 24, 2014, honouring authors and writers who have contributed to the public understanding of sexual diversity in Canada|work=pennantmediagroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24305">In [[Finland]], a person must have a [[surname]] and can have up to three [[given name]]s. Surnames are usually inherited patrilineally, while given names are usually chosen by a person's parents. '''Finnish names''' come from a variety of dissimilar traditions that were consolidated only in the early 20th century. The first national act on names came into force in 1921, and it made surnames mandatory. Between 1930 and 1985, the Western Finnish tradition whereby a married woman took her husband's surname was mandatory. Previously in Eastern Finland, this was not necessarily the case.

Finnish given names are often of Christian origin (e.g., ''Jukka'' from Greek [[Johannes]]), but Finnish and [[Sweden|Swedish]] origins are also common.

In Finnish, the letter "j" denotes the [[approximant]] {{IPA-fi|j|}}, as in English ''you''. For example, the two different names ''Maria'' and ''Marja'' are pronounced nearly identically. The letter "y" denotes the vowel {{IPA|[y]}}, not found in English, but similar to German "ü" and French "u". "R" is rolled. The stress is always on the first syllable in Finnish. For example, ''Yrjö Kääriäinen'' is pronounced {{IPA-fi|ˈyrjø ˈkæːri.æinen|}}. Double letters always stand for a geminate or longer sound (e.g., ''Marjaana'' has a stressed short {{IPA-fi|ɑ|}} followed by an unstressed long {{IPA-fi|ɑː|}}).

Pronunciation of Swedish names is similar, but long vowels are not doubled and the stress may be on any syllable. Finland has a long bilingual history and it is not unusual for Finnish speakers to have Swedish surnames or given names. Such names may be pronounced according to Finland–Swedish phonology or, depending on the person named, the person speaking and the language used, a Fennicized variant.

When writing Finnish names without the [[Finnish alphabet]] available (such as in e-mail addresses), the letters "ä" and "ö" are usually replaced with "a" and "o", respectively (e.g., ''Pääkkönen'' as ''Paakkonen''). This is not the same, but visually recognizable; since they are not linguistically [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]s, they cannot be substituted with "ae" and "oe" as in German.

==Surnames==
[[File:Kiianmies Kyander graves Tampere 20090818.JPG|thumb|right|A set of graves in Tampere, showing the Swedish surname "Kyander" as well as the Fennicized "Kiianmies".]]

Finland has three predominant surname traditions: the [[West Finnish]], the [[East Finnish]] and that of the Swedish [[nobility]], [[clergy]], [[bourgeoisie]] and [[military]]. Until the early 20th century, Finland was a predominantly [[agriculture|agrarian]] society and the names of West [[Finnish people|Finns]] were based on their association with a particular area, [[farm]], or [[Smallholding|homestead]] (e.g., ''Jaakko Jussila'' ("Jaakko from the farm of Jussi")). Farm names typically had the suffix ''-la'' and could refer to the husband (like ''Jussila'') or describe the location (e.g., ''Isoaho'' "large clearing"). This name could change every time the person moved to a different farm. Also, even if one had a surname, one would still be better known by the farm name. Farm names, patronyms and village names could be used to disambiguate between different people, but they were not true inherited surnames. For example, in the novel [[Seven Brothers]] (Aleksis Kivi, 1870) the character ''Juhani'' was officially summoned as ''Juhani Juhanin-poika Jukola, Toukolan kylästä''; "Juhani, son of Juhani, from Jukola farm, Toukola village".

On the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the [[Savonian people|Savonians]] pursued [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families (e.g., ''Ikävalko'', ''Termonen'', ''Pentikäinen''). In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the place name of the former or current place of living (e.g., ''Puumalainen'' &lt; [[Puumala]]). In the East Finnish tradition, women carried the family name of their fathers in female form (e.g., ''Puumalatar'' &lt; ''Puumalainen''). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of West-European surname tradition. Also, women did not change their surnames with marriage.

In 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, if there was no surname, the homestead names were usually adopted as surnames. Because the inhabitants often included farmhands and other non-family, holders of the same surname are not necessarily genetically related. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes ''Ala-'' or ''Ali-'' (Sub-) or ''Ylä-'' (Up-), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation of the main holding (e.g., ''Yli-Ojanperä'', ''Ala-Verronen''). In [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Pohjanmaa]], there are similar prefixes ''Rinta-'' "downstream" and ''Latva-'' "upriver".

Common suffixes are ''[[wikt:-nen#Finnish|-nen]]'' (in oblique form ''-se-''; e.g., Miettinen—Miettisen "Miettinen's"), a [[diminutive]] suffix usually meaning "small", and ''[[wikt:-la#Finnish|-la]]''/''[[wikt:-lä#Finnish|-lä]]'', a [[locative]] suffix usually meaning "place of". The ''-nen'' suffix was freely interchanged with ''-son'' or ''-poika'' as late as the 16th century, but its meaning was ambiguous as it could refer not only to a "son", but any member of a patriarch's family, a farm or even a place. For example the surname [[Tuomonen]] could mean "Son of Tuomo" or "Farm of Tuomo"
or something else belonging to Tuomo.

A third tradition of surnames was introduced in Finland by the [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking upper and middle classes which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking persons who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in case of clergy) [[Latin]] surnames.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Hormia, Y. (1941) [http://www.genealogia.fi/genos-old/12/12_13.htm Säätyläisnimiä Pyhämaan ja Pyhärannan rahvaan keskuudessa]. Genos 12:13-17. {{fi}}. Retrieved 2015-10-13. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Swedish allotment system|enlisted soldiers]], the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual. The oldest noble surnames of Swedish origin were not original, but were derived from the charges in the [[coat of arms]], sigil and flag of the family, for example with ''Svärd'' (Swedish: "sword"), ''Kurki/Kurck'' (Finnish: "crane") and ''Kirves'' (Finnish: "axe").&lt;ref&gt;Antti Matikkala. Vapatietomuksesta ikonografiseen heraldiikkaan - vaakunoista, heraldiikasta ja niiden tutkimuksesta, in Henkilö- ja sukuvaakunat Suomessa, ed. Antti Vitikkala and Wilhelm Brummer.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- sic Vapatietomuksesta --&gt; Families of German origin would use the ''von'' suffix (e.g., ''[[von Wright]]'').

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process and especially, the political movement of [[Fennicization]] caused a movement for adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many persons with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings ''-o/ö'', ''-nen'' (''Meriö'' &lt; ''[[wikt:meri#Finnish|meri]]'' "sea", ''Nieminen'' &lt; ''[[wikt:niemi#Finnish|niemi]]'' "peninsula") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (''Helleranta'' &lt; ''Hällstrand'').&lt;ref&gt;The whole section is based on the article Paikkala, S. [http://www.fennia.nu/artiklar/sukunimet_paikkala_sv.htm Sukunimet sukututkimuksessa]. Retrieved 11-6-2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fennicizing one's name also concealed non-Finnish origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolumbus.fi/bjorn.corander/historia/nimilista.htm Sukunimien muutokset&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040012/http://www.kolumbus.fi/bjorn.corander/historia/nimilista.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Martti Ahtisaari]]'s grandfather was ''Adolfsen'' from [[Norway]]. Nevertheless, Fennicization was not mandatory and thus it is common to find entirely Finnish-speaking families with Swedish surnames; having a Swedish name does not imply that one would speak Swedish.

An effect of industrialization was that large numbers of people moved to the cities and towns and had to adopt a surname. Missing an inherited surname, they invented one from scratch. Initially, these were in Swedish, and they were not very stable; people called them "superfluous names" (''liikanimi''), and a person could change one's surname several times during their career. Later, Finnish became the preferred language, and themes were taken from nature. Some of the most common examples of this type are ''Laine'' "comber, wave", ''Vainio'' "cultivated field", ''Nurmi'' "grassland", and ''Salo'' "grove".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogia.fi/nimet/nimi83s.htm Nimiartikkelit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When applicable, ''-nen'' or ''-la''/''-lä'' could be suffixed, such as in ''Koskinen'' "rapids + nen".

In 21st-century Finland, the use of surnames follows the [[German name|German model]]. Every person is legally obliged to have a first and last name. At most, three first names are allowed. A Finnish married couple may adopt the surname that either spouse had as non-married, in which case this name will be the surname of their children. A spouse changing his or her name may decide to ''use'' a [[double-barrelled name]] consisting of his or her former and current official surname. In the case where both spouses keep their names they may choose either name for their children, but all siblings must share the same surname.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mol.fi/mol/fi/99_pdf/fi/04_maahanmuutto/07_aineistot_kirjasto/01_esitteet/tasarv/tasarv_eng.pdf Equality in Finland]. Information for Immigrants. Ministry of Labour. Page 2. Retrieved 3-11-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 Nimilaki] (694/1985) § 2, 7, 8a. Retrieved 8-3-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All persons have the right to change their surname once without any specific reason. A surname that is un-Finnish, contrary to the usages of the Swedish or Finnish languages, or in use by any person resident in Finland cannot be accepted as the new name, unless valid family reasons or religious or national customs give a reason for waiving this requirement. However, persons may change their surname to any surname that has ever been used by their ancestors, if they can prove such claim.&lt;ref&gt;The information here is taken from the Finnish [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 ''Nimilaki (694/1985)] (Name Act). Retrieved 11-6-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames behave like regular words when forming grammatical cases. Thus, for example, the genitive of surname ''Mäki'' is ''Mäen'', just like the regular word ''[[wikt:mäki#Finnish|mäki]]'' ("hill") becomes ''mäen'' in the genitive. For given names this is not always the case even if the word is a regular word; for example ''Suvi'' ("summer") becomes ''Suvin'' in the genitive,  not ''Suven''.

In 1985, of the types of surnames, 38% of Finns had a ''-nen'' name, 8.9% ''-la'', 7.4% with other derivative suffix (e.g., ''-io/-iö'', as in ''Meriö'', or ''-sto/-stö'', as in ''Niinistö''), 17.5% other names in Finnish, 14.8% non-Finnish (chiefly Swedish), 13.1% with compound word names (e.g., ''Kivimäki'' "stone hill", ''Rautakoski'' "iron rapids"). Only 0.3% had a double-barreled name (e.g., marriage of a ''Forsius'' to ''Harkimo'' giving ''Forsius-Harkimo'').&lt;ref&gt;Mikkonen, Pirjo; Paikkala, Sirkka. ''Sukunimet''.

==Patronymics==
[[Patronymic]]s were used in official documents until the late 19th century. Finns did not address each other by patronymics in colloquial speech. The natural Finnish way of referring to someone's parentage is the genitive: ''Matin Olli'' ("Matthew's Olaf") instead of the solemn ''Olli Matinpoika'' ("Olaf Matthew's son").&lt;ref&gt;Paikkala(2004), page 542&lt;/ref&gt; When patronymics were no longer required in documents, they quickly fell out of use.&lt;ref&gt;Paikkala(2004), pages 422-426, 543-544&lt;/ref&gt; They are still perfectly legal, but very rare, often representing a deliberate archaism. Unlike in Swedish, Finnish patronymics were not transferred into hereditary family names. Thus, the Finnish situation differs considerably from, for instance, Sweden, which has hundreds of thousands of Johanssons and Anderssons. The Swedish patronymics-like surnames are treated as any other surname. Real patronymics are handled like additional first names, i.e., one must still have a surname.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 Nimilaki] (694/1985) § 26. Retrieved 3-11-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is [[Icelandic nationality law|Icelandic citizens]] resident in Finland, who are allowed to follow the [[Icelandic name]] tradition.

==&lt;span id="given name"&gt;First names&lt;/span&gt;==
The native Finnish tradition of first names was lost during the early Christian period, and by the 16th century, only Christian first names were accepted. The popular names were usually the names of saints whose cult was widespread. This resulted in some differences between the Western and Eastern Finnish first names, as the names in Eastern Finland might have had forms derived from [[Russian language|Russian]] or Church-Slavic, instead of Swedish and Latin forms. For example, there are two Finnish cognates of George, ''Yrjö'' &lt; Swedish ''Örjan'' and ''Jyri'' &lt; Russian Юрий ([[Yuri (Slavic name)|Yuri]]). The most important source for researching the name forms actually used by the Finns themselves in the 15th to 18th centuries are the surnames preserved in written sources, as these often are formed on the basis of a first name. The first names themselves are usually given in Swedish or Latin forms, as these are the languages used in the sources. The name actually used was a Fennicized form of the name, which might change as the person became older.&lt;ref name="Sarilo, M. Nimien alkuperä"&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/campus/981/kolm.htm Sarilo, M. Nimien alkuperä]. Campus. University of Tampere. Retrieved 3-11-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person given the Swedish name ''Gustaf'' in the parish register might be called ''Kustu'' as a child, ''Kusti'' as an adolescent, ''Kyösti'' or ''Köpi'' as an adult and ''Kustaa'' as an old man.&lt;ref&gt;Vilkuna (1976) page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, almost all Finnish first names were taken from the official [[almanac]], published by the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], later the [[University of Helsinki]]. The names were mostly names of the saints whose cult had been popular before the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], but the almanac also incorporated a number of names from the [[Old Testament]] and Swedish royalty, which were added to certain days during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compuline.fi/ComDocs/Suomi/uushlp/html/fin-0l2s.htm Yleisimmät nimet]. Retrieved 3-11-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the Finnish forms were gradually added to the Finnish almanac, while the Swedish and Latin forms were removed (the Swedish forms were retained in a separate Swedish almanac). At the same time, the vicars gradually started to use Finnish name forms in parish registers. This in turn, cemented the Finnish name forms used.

Names with originally Finnish etymology were revived in the 19th century. In the absence of reliable information about ancient names, parents chose names of mythical characters from folklore (''[[Aino (mythology)|Aino]]'', ''[[Tapio (name)|Tapio]]''), and many new names were created from Finnish words (''Seppo'' "smith" or "skilled person", ''Ritva'' "birch twig"). Some clergymen initially refused to christen babies with such "pagan" names.&lt;ref&gt;Vilkuna (1976), pages 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; The first given name of Finnish origin, ''Aino'', was accepted in the almanac in 1890, followed by numerous others in 1908. About 30% of Finns born in 1910–1939 received a name with Finnish etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Kiviniemi (2006) pages 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the use of Finnish names and name forms was stabilized and most of the popular names were noticed in the almanac. Since then, the almanac has been gradually changed to include new, popular names.&lt;ref name="Sarilo, M. Nimien alkuperä"/&gt; At present, all names which have at least 1,000 bearers are incorporated into the almanac of the University of Helsinki and given a "name day" ({{lang-fi|nimipäivä}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://almanakka.helsinki.fi/faq.html Almanakkatoimisto. Kysymyksiä ja vastauksia.] Retrieved 3-11-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, 792 of the 35,000 first names used in Finland are listed in the Finnish almanac.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=452 Nimipäivän vietto]. Research Institute for the Languages of Finland. Retrieved 3-11-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nimipäivä'' calendar follows the Medieval Catholic Saint calendar when applicable.

First names are subject to changing fashions, while second or third given names are more traditional and typically trisyllabic. In the table below both first and middle names are counted. Since the digitalization of the Finnish national population database in the 1970s, the most popular names in Finland (of all Finnish residents or citizens who have lived after that point) have been&lt;ref&gt;[https://192.49.222.187/Nimipalvelu/nimipalvelu_etunimitop.asp?L=1 Nimipalvelu.] Väestörekisterikeskus.

===Legal aspects===
At present, the Names Act ({{lang-fi|Nimilaki}}; {{lang-sv|Namnlagen}}) of 1985 requires that all Finnish citizens and residents have at least one and at the most three first names. Persons who do not have a first name are obligated to adopt one when they are entered into the Finnish national population database. Parents of new-born children must name their child and inform the population registry within two months of the child's birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 Nimilaki] (694/1985) §§ 1, 32a. Retrieved 3-11-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name may be chosen freely, but it must not be

* a name used primarily by persons of the other sex
* a name foreign to the naming tradition in Finland
* a surname, except a patronymic as last given name
* a name already used by a sibling, if this is to be the only given name.

Waivers may be granted if valid family, religious or ethnic reasons give grounds to use a name contrary to these principles. Persons may change their first names once without a specific reason. For subsequent changes, valid reasons must be presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 Nimilaki] (694/1985) § 32b. Retrieved 3-11-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

As in general in European culture, the surname is seen as more formal and the first names as less formal. Strangers are expected to refer to each other by their surnames and using grammar in [[T-V distinction|formal plural]]. The use of first names indicates familiarity, and children often refer to each other by first names only. However, in many workplaces familiarity between individuals working on the same site is assumed.

In contrast to other European tradition, the use of titles such as ''tohtori'' "Doctor" with surnames is not very common and is found only in highly formal contexts, or it is considered old-fashioned.  The titles equivalent to Mr., Mrs. and Miss are ''[[herra]]'', ''rouva'' and ''neiti'', respectively. Thus, for example, in formal contexts, ''Matti Johannes Virtanen'' can be referred to as ''herra Virtanen'' or ''herra Matti Virtanen'', if several Virtanens are present. In most other contexts, simply one name, surname or first name, is used. As in Swedish culture, politeness is often expressed by indirect address, such that the use of names might even be deliberately avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Meski, Arja.

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Fabletown===
Flycatcher was once a normal human named Ambrose, until Frau Totenkinder (centuries prior to receiving amnesty) turned him into a frog, who could only return to human form when he found true love. When he did, he became a happily married prince of a small kingdom in the Homelands, with a beautiful wife with whom he had eight children.
He lived peacefully with his family, his only quirk being the occasional resumption of his frog curse when he was nervous, scared or especially excited.  Fortunately it only took a kiss from his loving wife to return him to human form, and, as time went on, he would often go for years between instances of the curse asserting itself.
His tranquil family life was shattered when the Adversary invaded his realm.  As Flycatcher prepared to leave to fight the Empire, he was unaware that the enemy troops had already invaded his castle. As he bid farewell to his family, enemy soldiers burst into the room, causing his curse to manifest immediately. Trapped in his frog form, he could only watch helplessly as his younger children were murdered and his wife and eldest daughter repeatedly raped before being killed themselves.

How Fly eventually returned to his human form is unknown, though it is speculated that he took a last kiss from his dead wife. In deep denial about the deaths of his wife and children, Fly wandered as a beggar for a long time, asking everywhere he went if people had seen his family.
Eventually, he learned of the sanctuary of the mundane world and, figuring that his family would have fled there, traveled there as well. Failing to find any of his family members there, Fly asked one of the magic mirrors retrieved from the Homelands to search for his family on his behalf while he stayed protected in Fabletown — a position which racked him further with guilt. Some of his friends and coworkers were aware of this situation, and together conspired to keep the truth from him, knowing that it would destroy him.
Still, when drunk, Flycatcher appeared to have a clearer memory of what had really happened to his family (which was believed to be the reason why he'd so rarely turn to drink).&lt;ref name="vert-ency"/&gt;

===Fabletown===
Flycatcher acted as the janitor for the Woodland building, the center of government for [[Fabletown]]. However, he wasn't employed in the traditional sense - the nature of his history being such that, if he had a job that he could choose to quit, he would ''have'' to do so and return to the Homelands to seek his missing family. As this would almost certainly result in his death, [[Bigby Wolf]] developed a system of convenient deception, whereby Fly was made to work off a never-ending series of short community service orders for a series of minor infractions (usually eating flies).
Fly thus remained in the job that he enjoyed, and where he felt important in the service to his fellow Fables. The arrangement was nearly disrupted when the well-meaning [[List of Fables characters#Beauty and the Beast|Beast]] misguidedly freed Fly from his wrongful "punishment" after replacing Bigby as Sheriff, and offered to employ him legitimately instead, before [[List of Fables characters#Rose Red|Rose Red]] explained the real nature of the situation to him.&lt;ref name="vert-ency"/&gt;

Upon her arrival from the Homelands, Fly began spending a considerable amount of time with [[List of Fables characters#Red Riding Hood|Red Riding Hood]], having been asked to look after her by his close friend [[Boy Blue (Fables)|Boy Blue]] before the latter departed for the Farm. "Ride" became enamored of Fly for his sweet and thoughtful nature, and eventually accompanied him to Bigby and [[Snow White (Fables)|Snow White]]'s wedding. Fly, however, seemed oblivious to the fact that Red was falling for him, something that he only seemingly began to realize when she went out into the mundane city, where she had a makeover with him in mind. He was shocked when he saw her and ran away, hiding in the depths of the business office, where his curse then manifested and reverted him once again to his frog form.

Eventually, Santa Claus visited Flycatcher on [[Christmas eve]] and forced him to reveal that he could still speak as a frog, and also that he still remembered what had happened to his family in the Homelands. Santa then presented Fly with the ghost of his wife, so that she could restore him to human form. He then explained that Fly was destined to play a crucial part in future events, but only if he could learn to accept the past and move on.

===Haven===
During ''The Good Prince'', Flycatcher finally faced his past. With his memory fully restored, he resigned from his "job" at the Woodlands and swore vengeance on those who had destroyed his family, attempting to enlist Boy Blue's help in training his combat skills. Blue refused, partly on the grounds that Fly's idea was essentially a [[suicide mission]], but more importantly because he didn't want to be responsible for the one truly good Fable losing his innocence.

It was this purity of spirit that would become central to Fly's actual destiny. Returning to Fabletown, Fly found himself awakening from his sleep as he was supernaturally drawn to the business office, where he encountered the ghost of the Forsworn Knight, now released from his armor. Introducing himself as [[Lancelot|Lance]], the ghost of the great knight informed Fly that he was to act as a guide for the first part of Fly's quest. Lance bequeathed his magical armor to Fly (which resumed its luster after being placed on a pure and just person), and also helped him obtain the legendary [[Excalibur]]. He then formally knighted Fly, claiming he was to take up the role of the [[Once and Future King]] (formerly held by King Arthur). Fly was imbued with a now-clear vision of what he was meant to do.

Flycatcher proceeded to lead Lancelot into the [[Witching Well]], to find the ghosts of those who had previously been thrown there.  Among the ghosts were [[Little Miss Muffet]]'s spider husband (Mr. Web), Gretel, [[Shere Khan]] and [[Bluebeard]], as well as [[Trusty John]] (the only Fable besides Fly to jump down the Witching Well while still alive). The ghosts were informed that they would have new flesh while near Flycatcher, on the condition that they serve as his loyal army. They then follow Flycatcher for the long march out of the land of the dead (which lasted more than a month) and into the Homelands, eventually finding the garden kingdom where Flycatcher had once ruled as a prince.
Rechristening his kingdom "Haven", Flycatcher brought to him powerful magics that nullified any sent by the [[Geppetto (Fables)|Adversary]] to his regained lands. Fly conquered opposing armies one after another through non-lethal means&amp;mdash;he duels one giant to exhaustion using only the flat of his blade and sends his ghost army into the minds of a goblin horde, racking them with their own fears and nightmares. He positions Haven as a "third course" beside the two opposing parties in the war between the Adversary's Empire and Fabletown.
Flycatcher ultimately manages to defeat every enemy sent at him without shedding any blood and graciously accepts his defeated enemies as new citizens of Haven, since their return to the Empire will result in being executed for their failure.

Eventually, the Adversary assembles all of the [[wooden soldiers]] into the dreaded Golden Horde. As they march — immune to the fear of the army of ghosts, and with the magic of the [[Sacred Grove]] too strong to be nullified by Flycatcher's — the advancing army appears unbeatable. Fly senses the end of his visions, and believes that it means his final act in the conflict will result in his death. He walks alone to meet the Horde, apparently for the purpose of surrender.
However, to the surprise of puppets and Fly alike, his magical armor (the armor of the Unspoiled Knight) adds itself to the Sacred Grove's magic, causing all of the wooden soldiers to suddenly sprout into an enormous grove of trees. Flycatcher, having not expected his own survival, explains that the Adversary is now defeated; the soldiers, nearly every one in the Empire, have all become a new Sacred Grove. Because there can be only one Sacred Grove in all the worlds, this means that Gepetto's will never grow back. Moreover, the new Sacred Grove's magic has increased Fly's own, meaning he would be able to continue expanding his kingdom of benevolent rule.

When questioned about his intentions toward the Sacred Grove — explicitly, whether he intends to raise his own army of wooden soldiers and capture lands from the Empire — Fly experiences a nightmarish vision of an older version of himself waging war on countless worlds with such a wooden soldier army. This causes him to declare that the grove is to be left alone, and that it be no more than a place of quiet reflection and peace.

During Boy Blue's recovery from the injury caused by the enchanted arrow he had been shot with during "War and Pieces", Blue told Flycatcher about how naive he was being about Red Riding Hood's feelings for him, and that he felt the two should get together.
Soon after that, Flycatcher was quick to notice that Blue's arm had turned gangrenous and infected, despite his previous apparent recovery. When Blue was eventually taken to the Farm after the fall of Fabletown to Mr. Dark, his wound now seriously infected by the dark magic contained within the witching cloak (which was originally a sack carried by Mr. Dark), Flycatcher attempted to use the magic given to him by Haven and the Sacred Grove to heal Blue. However, this attempt failed, and Flycatcher was reduced to tears as he told everyone to say their last goodbyes to his best friend.
Blue died the next morning and was buried in Haven on the hill overlooking the baseball field there.

Later, Flycatcher finally decided to follow Blue's advice and move forward with his feelings towards Red Riding Hood, kissing her, which caused him to accidentally transform back into a frog. However, he decided he had allowed the curse to dominate him for too long, and he managed to turned himself back under his own power.
Shortly afterwards, Flycatcher was called forward on a sad matter when one of his goblin subjects, Mr. Brump, ate a squirrel Fable, Mr. Seedcrate, while drunk. Flycatcher begged Trusty John to find a way to allow Brump mercy and thereby keep him from breaking his policy about killing.
Flycatcher used his magic to gain Blue's strength by touching his grave and hardened his heart, simply banishing Mr. Brump from Haven, under penalty of death if he should return. Then, tired of hiding his feelings, he asked Red Riding Hood to spend the night with him, which she happily agreed to.

In "The Last Story of Flycatcher" (released at the end of issue #141), it is revealed that Flycatcher and Red Riding Hood eventually got married. They were shown to be happily raising their four children (Trent, Lucy, Bobby and an unnamed son) years after their previous appearance in the series.

==Personality and traits==
Tall and decidedly gangly, Fly is almost universally popular in Fabletown, as he's known for being kind and friendly to all (if not exceptionally bright). Indeed, he is generally treated with respect and politeness even by the most shady and harsh fables in the town. He becomes an invaluable part of administering Fabletown as the primary custodian of the Woodlands office.  Snow and Bigby name one of their children Ambrose in their friend's honor. Although still ostensibly searching for his family, Fly develops something of a crush on [[List of Fables characters#Briar Rose|Briar Rose]] during their centuries in Fabletown, to the extent that his kiss was enough to wake her from her curse.

''Fables'' artist [[Mark Buckingham]] has stated that Flycatcher is his favorite character; Buckingham has said that he is the only truly innocent character in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=George |first=Richard |title=Exclusive Fables Interview Complete Edition |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2007-01-05 |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/753/753361p1.html |accessdate=2008-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925200008/http://comics.ign.com/articles/753/753361p1.html |archivedate=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has since been backed up in the series itself, in which it has been noted that Flycatcher was the only Fable to reach the mundane world who had nothing to be forgiven, covered up, or otherwise absolved of, under the Fabletown amnesty.

'''Frank Foster''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]'', played by [[Andrew Lancel]]. He made his debut appearance on 20 January 2011. Frank was introduced as a business associate of [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]). In December 2011, it was announced Frank would be leaving ''Coronation Street'' at the end of his storyline. Two months later, it was confirmed Frank would be murdered as part of a "[[whodunit]]" storyline. Five regular characters became suspects during the investigation, but his mother, [[Anne Foster]] ([[Gwen Taylor]]) eventually confessed to killing him. Frank made his last on-screen appearance on 8 March 2012.

==Storylines==
Frank comes to Underworld to do a deal with Carla Connor and he takes an interest in her assistant, [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]). Carla tells Michelle that they need to impress Frank, so she goes out for a meal with him to discuss business arrangements, much to the anger of her boyfriend, [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]). Frank later returns to do a business deal with Carla and meets [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Smith]]), Michelle's replacement. Carla tells Maria to go to his house to finalise a business deal and Frank cooks dinner for them, and tells Maria that he is willing to seal the deal. Whilst they sit and have a drink on his sofa, Frank tells Maria that he is attracted to her and tries to force himself on her. A distraught Maria escapes and later tells Carla about Frank's attack. [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) arranges a date with Frank but he stands her up when he has some business to deal with. Maria warns Tracy about Frank assaulting her but Tracy refuses to listen and tells Frank about Maria's accusation. Frank then cancels the deal with Underworld, much to Carla's anguish as the factory was relying on his business. However, a smitten Tracy continues dating him and Carla persuades him to do business, much to Maria's indignation. Tracy tires of Frank and deliberately keeps mentioning her ex [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) whilst on a date. Frank is not impressed and ends their relationship.

Frank later offers to buy a share in Underworld, which Carla happily accepts. Everyone at the factory celebrates the factory's new victory, but Maria quits her job, and tells her boyfriend [[Chris Gray (Coronation Street)|Chris Gray]] ([[Will Thorp]]) about what happened with Frank; Chris threatens Frank. Maria reluctantly reports Frank to the police, after a heated encounter with Carla. The police arrest Frank, but he is soon released for lack of evidence. A few months later when Carla is informed of the death of her mother, Frank comforts her, and after she gets heavily drunk at the Bistro Bar and later the Rover's Return, Frank is told by [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) to look after her. He takes Carla home, and lets her sleep on the couch. When they arrive for work the next morning together, gossip begins to spread, and Maria becomes convinced they are a couple. Chris confronts Frank in the Rovers, leading to a pub brawl. Some time later, Carla goes to stay at Frank's and they kiss, thus beginning a relationship.

Frank proposes to Carla in the Rovers. After originally rejecting his offer, a confrontation with Peter, whom she really loves, causes her to change her mind, and later that day she tells Frank that she will marry him. In the weeks that follow, Frank begins planning their future together as husband and wife, even mentioning the prospect of children and making an offer on a plush suburban house he has chosen for them. The offer is rejected, to Carla's secret relief. It soon becomes apparent that Carla does not really want to marry Frank and she comes under increasing pressure after meeting his parents to celebrate the engagement. She gets drunk during a meal with Frank's parents and jumps into Frank's car. Frank tries to stop her driving but she ignores his pleas and accidentally runs over [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) before crashing into the betting office. In order to save his fiancée, a quick-thinking Frank places an unconscious Carla in the passenger seat to make it appear that he was driving. When questioned by police, he tells them that he was responsible and is lucky to escape the charges with points on his driver's licence and a fine.

Carla eventually tells Frank the truth about her not wanting to go through with the wedding. However, Frank becomes aggressive, pinning her against the wall and hitting her twice. He eventually rapes her, claiming that she made him the person he is. Carla phones Maria, and together they report Frank's sexual assault to the police. Frank is arrested for rape but released on bail while the police hunt for evidence. To anger Carla, Frank persuades his mother to begin working at ''Underworld'', as he is not allowed anywhere near Carla. Anne attempts to discredit Carla, disbelieving the claims against her son. Frank opens his own factory and persuades some of Carla's workers to join him. One of these is [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]), with whom he soon begins an affair. Frank is devastated when his father dies. He hires a private investigator to follow Carla and Peter and she gives him pictures of them kissing. He and his mother then expose their relationship. Frank is found not guilty of raping Carla and he goes free.

Frank returns to work at the factory alongside Carla. He begins seeing [[List of Coronation Street characters (2012)#Jenny Sumner|Jenny Sumner]] ([[Niky Wardley]]) and they concoct a plan to buy Carla out of the factory for a low price and sack the workforce. Sally learns of Frank and Jenny's relationship and realises he did rape Carla. She tells Michelle, but they arrive at the factory shortly after Carla signs the factory over to Frank, who gloats about his plan. Peter tries to attack him, but is held back. Frank then throws his mother out of the factory and his home. Carla comes to confront Frank and she makes him admit that he raped her. [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) and [[Julie Carp]] ([[Katy Cavanagh]]) later find Sally with Frank's dead body on the floor of the factory. On the day of Frank's funeral, Anne confesses to Sally that she killed her son. Anne later explains that she overheard him taunting Carla about the rape and blamed him for Sam's death. She went to the factory to get her husband's watch back, but when Frank resisted and pushed her away, Anne picked up a whiskey bottle and hit him.

==Casting==
On 23 November 2010, it was announced actor Andrew Lancel had joined the cast of ''Coronation Street'' as businessman, Frank Foster.&lt;ref name="Means"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/frankfostercast/|title=Frank means business|date=23 November 2010|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer for [[itv.com]] said Frank is a business associate of [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), who eventually becomes a factory client.&lt;ref name="Means"/&gt; Of his casting, Lancel said "I'm made up to be here. It's been a long time coming and I'm a big fan of the show so I'm thrilled. Frank looks like he's going to be fun to play, there's more to him than meets the eye, he's definitely not one-sided."&lt;ref name="Means"/&gt; Lancel revealed he was an extra on ''Coronation Street'' when he was a teenager and had always watched the show, so when he was asked to join the show he could not resist it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a289768/lancel-i-couldnt-resist-corrie-role.html|title=Lancel: 'I couldn't resist Corrie role'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=25 November 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancel made his on screen debut as Frank in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+stories.-a0246492829|title=Soap stories|date=15 January 2011|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Rape storylines===
The storyline which saw Frank sexually assaulting [[Maria Connor]] was originally intended for the character of [[Michelle Connor]]. But when [[Kym Marsh]], who plays Michelle, took an early maternity leave, the story was hastily re-written for Maria instead. Lancel admitted that filming the sexual assault scene was "uncomfortable", but hoped that Frank would become "one of the villains people love to hate".&lt;ref name="Frank villain"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/240418-corries-andrew-lancel-hopes-frank-becomes-a-villain-people-love-to-hate/|title=Corrie’s Andrew Lancel hopes Frank becomes villain people love to hate|date=31 March 2011|work=[[stv.tv]]|publisher=[[STV (TV network)|STV]]|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the character as "charismatic, charming and you’re never quite sure what he'll do next."&lt;ref name="Frank villain"/&gt; He added "Don't mess with Frank. He doesn't worry about using force of a different kind to keep [Maria] quiet. He turns things around and says he could take her to court over what she is saying. That takes some ego. I'm not trying to justify what he did... He's a bad man. [...] Underworld is run by two beautiful women and he's got power over them as they aren't doing that well... he enjoys the power he now has over her from a business point of view."&lt;ref name="Frank villain"/&gt; In August 2011, it was announced Frank's parents, Anne ([[Gwen Taylor]]) and Sam Foster (Paul Clayton), would be arriving in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/meetfranksparents/|title=Meet the Fosters|date=4 August 2011|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, it was announced that [[Carla Connor]] will reportedly be left fighting for her life after being attacked by her boyfriend.&lt;ref name="Rape Storyline"&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title=Corrie's Carla Connor 'to suffer brutal attack'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a323203/corries-carla-connor-to-suffer-brutal-attack.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=5 March 2012|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory owner, played by [[Alison King]], will be subjected to a physical and sexual assault by Frank Foster after he suspects she is cheating on him with [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]]. Carla will consider leaving Frank prior to the attack, but feels she owes him after he invested in her business and takes the blame for a car accident she is responsible for.&lt;ref name="Rape Storyline" /&gt; The plot was a prominent storyline over the summer and aired after the 9pm watershed during a week of special episodes. [[Tracy Barlow]] will offer to give Frank a positive character reference in court, while Peter's marriage to Leanne suffers.&lt;ref name="Rape Storyline" /&gt;

===Departure and death===
On 19 December 2011, Angharad Llewellyn from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' announced Lancel would be leaving ''Coronation Street'' in 2012 following the conclusion of the rape storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/4007934/Evil-Frank-Foster-warns-Carla-Connor-off-as-Corrie-rape-trial-goes-to-court.html|title=Evil Frank Foster warns Carla Connor off as Corrie rape trial goes to court|date=19 December 2011|last=Llewellyn|first=Angharad|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 2012, Lancel revealed there would be "lots more to come" from Frank before his departure from the show.&lt;ref name="TeasesExit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a360556/coronation-street-andrew-lancel-teases-frank-future-show-exit.html|title='Coronation Street' Andrew Lancel teases Frank future, show exit|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 January 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor said he had not finished filming yet and that he would be around for a little while to come.&lt;ref name="TeasesExit"/&gt; He explained "People are asking me all the time, 'Are you leaving?' It doesn't feel like I'm leaving, because I've always known the whole thing. I read the other day that it's coming to a conclusion, and I think that's a really good way of putting it."&lt;ref name="TeasesExit"/&gt; Lancel added that he had liked playing Frank.&lt;ref name="TeasesExit"/&gt; Daniel Kilkelly reported Lancel had finished filming with ''Coronation Street'' in early February. He made his final on screen appearance as Frank on 8 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a364087/coronation-street-andrew-lancel-im-getting-back-into-singing.html|title='Coronation Street' Andrew Lancel: 'I'm getting back into singing'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=6 February 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a367771/eastenders-rumours-corrie-murder-more-soap-scoop-qa.html|title='EastEnders' rumours, Corrie murder, more: Soap Scoop Q&amp;A|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=24 February 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a367077/peter-cannot-remember-last-night.html|title=Peter cannot remember last night|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=28 February 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2012, ''Coronation Street'' confirmed Frank would be killed off as part of a [[whodunit]] storyline.&lt;ref name="GoesTo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/frankgoestotheunderworld/|title=Breaking news: Frank goes to the Underworld|date=3 February 2012|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=3 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126144346/http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/frankgoestotheunderworld/|archivedate=26 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news came shortly after the episode showing Frank being found not guilty of raping Carla was broadcast.&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; A writer for the official ''Coronation Street'' website said "Now events will take an even more dramatic turn as tensions rise and vengeance will be on the minds of several characters, climaxing in Frank's death! And with so many residents having a motive for killing the twisted factory boss – the list of suspects reads like a 'Who's Who' of Weatherfield."&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; Over the following weeks, Frank manages to alienate himself as he tries to get revenge on Carla for dragging him through court.&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; Lancel said Frank's true colours would be exposed and he does not think his life is in danger for a moment.&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; His body will be found in the factory, following "days of arguments and confrontations with associates, lovers and enemies alike."&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; A reporter for the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' later announced that five regular characters would become suspects during the investigation into Frank's murder.&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/891632-five-coronation-street-favourites-suspected-of-frank-fosters-murder|title=Five Coronation Street favourites suspected of Frank Foster's murder|date=28 February 2012|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank will be found dead on the floor of the Underworld factory by [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]).&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt; The ''Metro'' reporter said Sally comes under suspicion when she is found standing over Frank's body with bloodied hands.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt; Carla, [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) and [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) are questioned by the police, while Sally's ex-husband, [[Kevin Webster|Kevin]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]), will also fall under suspicion.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt; Lancel praised his character's final storyline, calling it "classic Corrie".&lt;ref name="ClassicCorrie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a368983/coronation-street-frank-killer-could-be-anybody-says-andrew-lancel.html|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Coronation Street' Frank killer could be anybody, says Andrew Lancel|date=2 March 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While appearing on ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'', Lancel said Frank had made a lot of enemies on the Street for a number of reasons.&lt;ref name="ClassicCorrie"/&gt; The actor explained "He's been monstrous, horrendous. People know what he's done - he's assaulted and twisted the knife into many people, and he's closed down the factory, so there's plenty of people who could be bumping off Frank and there are many suspects."&lt;ref name="ClassicCorrie"/&gt; Lancel believed the five regular characters named as suspects were all potential killers and he was looking forward to watching the mystery unfold on screen. He added that the way Frank's final scenes were shot, viewers would not see the killer.&lt;ref name="ClassicCorrie"/&gt; Carla later emerged as the bookies' top suspect with odds of 2/1.&lt;ref name="TopSuspect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a369044/coronation-street-murder-mystery-carla-connor-is-bookies-favourite.html|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Coronation Street' murder mystery: Carla Connor is bookies' favourite|date=2 March 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert Adams, a spokesman for [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] said Carla has her reasons to kill Frank and that the dark horse is [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]).&lt;ref name="TopSuspect"/&gt;

'''Gaetano Jjuko Kagwa''' is a Ugandan actor and broadcaster. He played Abe Sakku on [[Nana Kagga]]'s TV series, [[Beneath The Lies - The Series]]. He rose to fame when he represented Uganda in the first edition of ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' in 2003. He has also hosted the television show ''Studio 53'' on Mnet. Between the years 2004 to 2008, Gaetano was the host of the ''Capital in the Morning Show'' on Kenyan radio station [[98.4 Capital FM]].

Gaetano was born Gaetano Jjuko Kagwa on 22 June 1972 in Kampala, Uganda. Gaetano moved to Kenya when he was five years old and then to Lesotho when he was nine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvsa.co.za/actorprofile.asp?actorID=1383]&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Lesotho that he completed his high school education. In 1993, he joined the [[University of Wisconsin-La Crosse]], USA where he graduated with a degree in political science in 1997.

Gaetano's career as a radio presenter goes back several years before signing up with Kenya's Capital FM. Prior to moving to neighboring country Kenya as a radio presenter, Gaetano worked for [[91.3 Capital FM|Capital FM Uganda]] as well as ''Vision Voice'', a Ugandan radio station.&lt;ref name="expat"&gt;[http://www.expatriate.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57:kiundu-waweru&amp;catid=38:profiles&amp;Itemid=48]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Big Brother Africa==

While a third year law student at [[Makerere University]], Gaetano went to represent Uganda in the premier ''Big Brother Africa'' series in 2003.&lt;ref name="expat" /&gt; Gaetano made it to the final day of the competition, finishing in fourth place ahead of Namibian representative Stefan Ludik but behind Botswana's Warona Setshwaelo.

He is most remembered for starting a romantic relationship with South African housemate Abby Plaatjes. While at the house, Gaetano won the chance to swap places with ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' contestant [[Cameron Stout]]. He won the chance to swap places to the UK house after he won a cocktail making challenge. His stint at the UK house caused media outrage when he called representative Tania a "piggy", something that made her shed tears and threaten to leave the house for good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3010872.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23671">In 2014, material was revealed by two [[whistleblowers]] of An [[Garda Síochána]] (Irish police), Maurice McCabe and John Wilson, to the Confidential Recipient. The disclosures and the handling of the disclosures, led to the resignation of Ireland's [[Minister for Justice and Equality]], [[Alan Shatter]]. It was also part of the background leading up to the resignation of the Garda Commissioner, [[Martin Callinan]]. It was also part of the reason for the retirement of his successor [[Nóirín O'Sullivan]].

The scandal that ensued would have huge ramifications for both [[An Garda Siochana]] and the [[Irish Government|Irish government]]. The whistleblower scandal led to the resignation of Martin Callinan in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26730162|title=Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan resigns over whistleblower row|date=25 March 2014|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gemma O'Doherty]], a journalist for the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', was subsequently vindicated after she had been fired by the newspaper for pursuing a story regarding Callinan and his abuse of the penalty points system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/mar/25/irish-independent-ireland|title=Irish police chief's resignation vindicates sacked investigative journalist|date=25 March 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casualties of the scandal reached the highest levels of government, with Alan Shatter resigning from the [[Cabinet of Ireland|Cabinet]] in May 2014. McCabe was also found to be subject to a smear campaign, orchestrated by senior Garda officials, namely Dave Taylor, the Garda Press Officer, and former Commissioner Martin Callinan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/guerin-report-finds-shatter-garda%C3%AD-failed-to-adequately-investigate-whistleblower-claims-1.1789747|title=Guerin report finds Shatter, gardaí failed to adequately investigate whistleblower claims|date=9 May 2014|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/why-alan-shatter-resign-1452807-May2014/|title=Explainer: Why Alan Shatter has resigned|last=Bohan|first=Christine|date=7 May 2014|work=The Journal|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/maurice-mccabe-delighted-after-vindication-by-tribunal-875315.html|title=Maurice McCabe ‘delighted’ after vindication by tribunal|date=2018-10-12|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;A new 'Policing Authority' was established to ensure that scandal within Garda Siochana remained at a minimum and that the Government could have more involvement with the daily operations of the organisation.

==Whistleblowers==

===Maurice McCabe===
Maurice McCabe was a Garda Sergeant, recognised for being a [[whistleblower]] on corruption within An Garda Síochána, Ireland's national police force.

During the early 2000s, McCabe had served as sergeant-in-charge at the Garda station in the town of [[Bailieborough]], [[County Cavan]]. There had been a number of concerns expressed by McCabe during his time as station sergeant. Incidents such as off-duty Gardai attempting to deal with a suicide situation. Among other incidents were Gardai making use of unmarked Garda vehicles while off-duty, along with issues over the amount of hours the guards were actually working. McCabe lodged multiple complaints about slipping police standards in Bailieborough and the lack of initiative of several Gardai.

McCabe resigned as sergeant-in-charge of the station in January 2006 after an investigation into an assault in Crossan's Pub in the town was mishandled. The Garda in charge of handling the situation had failed to investigate the incident properly and subsequently contacted the victim in the case. The victim was asked to withdraw the charges against the perpetrator. McCabe, who heard about this afterwards, was shocked and had "never seen anything like it within the force". McCabe lodged a complaint through the "confidential recipient" system. This system, which was part of [[PULSE (Police Using Leading Systems Effectively)|PULSE]], a computer program used by the Gardai, was restricted from Maurice McCabe on the 14 December 2012. Two senior Gardai travelled from Westmeath to his home in Cavan to communicate this to the Sergeant - an action that was unheard of within the force.&lt;ref name="noble_attempt" /&gt;

McCabe later approached [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] and Transport Minister [[Leo Varadkar]], who passed details on to Justice Minister [[Alan Shatter]]. Shatter asked for an internal garda inquiry into the penalty points complaints, with Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney failing to even interview McCabe. A letter from McCabe, read onto the [[Oireachtas]] record, said the way the matter had been handled had "destroyed me, my career and my family".&lt;ref name=noble_attempt&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Clifford|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/columnists/michael-clifford/maurice-mccabes-noble-attempt-to-police-gardai-256419.html|title=Maurice McCabe's noble attempt to police gardaí|work=Irish Examiner|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatter later wrongly accused McCabe of refusing to co-operate with his inquiry, a claim for which McCabe unsuccessfully sought an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Niall|last=O'Connor|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/whistleblower-maurice-mccabe-wants-dail-record-on-remarks-corrected-30055854.html|title=Whistleblower Maurice McCabe wants Dail record on remarks corrected|work=Irish Independent|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Orla|last=Ryan|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/martin-says-shatter-should-apologise-to-mccabe-1357840-Mar2014/|title=‘Do the honourable thing’: Shatter told to apologise to Maurice McCabe - Micheál Martin said today’s Garda Inspectorate report into penalty points ‘vindicated’ whistleblowers|work=The Journal|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luke 'Ming' Flanagan]], at the time a [[Teachta Dála|TD]], suggested McCabe be appointed Callinan's successor as Garda Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick|last=Conboy|url=http://www.longfordleader.ie/news/local-news/luke-ming-flanagan-calls-for-mccabe-to-be-appointed-garda-commissioner-1-5959264|title=Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan calls for McCabe to be appointed Garda Commissioner|work=Longford Leader|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shannonside.ie/news/roscommon-south-leitrim-td-calls-for-sgt-maurice-mccabe-to-be-made-new-garda-commissioner/ |title=Roscommon South Leitrim TD calls for Sgt Maurice McCabe to be made new Garda Commissioner |work=Shannonside |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=25 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512231549/http://www.shannonside.ie/news/roscommon-south-leitrim-td-calls-for-sgt-maurice-mccabe-to-be-made-new-garda-commissioner/ |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2018, Sergeant McCabe announced he was retiring from [[An Garda Síochána]] that night.

===John Wilson===
John Wilson (born 17 April 1963)&lt;ref name=no_choice_but_to_quit&gt;{{cite news|first=Colum|last=Kenny|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/whistleblower-garda-had-no-choice-but-to-quit-force-29242994.html|title=Whistleblower garda had 'no choice' but to quit force|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=5 May 2013|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former [[Garda Síochána|Garda]], recognised for [[Whistleblower|blowing the whistle]] on Penalty Points system irregularities within Ireland's national police force.

Wilson first brought information of Garda penalty points malpractice to the attention of members of [[Dáil Éireann]] under the Garda Siochána Act 2005 in 2012, having been unable to have the matter adequately handled within the Garda Complaints System. He left the force the following year, having served for more than 30 years (since 1982).&lt;ref name=no_choice_but_to_quit/&gt;&lt;ref name=up_against_it&gt;{{cite news|first=Orla|last=Ryan|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/john-wilson-to-run-for-seat-in-cavan-1354598-Mar2014/|title=‘I'm up against it’: Garda whistleblower to run in local elections - The former garda's revelations about penalty-point terminations in 2012 are now the subject of an official inquiry|work=The Journal|date=10 March 2014|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=court_challenge/&gt; In 2013, Wilson brought a [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] challenge to findings that he breached Garda discipline, but lost.&lt;ref name=court_challenge&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary|last=Carolan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/court-challenge-brought-by-garda-whistleblower-1.1631693|title=Court challenge brought by Garda whistleblower|work=The Irish Times|date=18 December 2013|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson later approached Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Transport Minister Leo Varadkar, who passed details on to Justice Minister Alan Shatter. Shatter asked for an internal garda inquiry into the penalty points complaints, with Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney failing to even interview Wilson.&lt;ref name="noble_attempt"/&gt;

Wilson has recommended no tribunal, but has called for an independent public inquiry. "Maybe an independent High Court judge; I would settle for that."&lt;ref name=no_choice_but_to_quit/&gt; He has asked that motorists who benefited from the alleged "corruption of Gardaí" be interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Conor|last=Lally|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/interview-drivers-with-terminated-points-urges-wilson-1.1670753|title=Interview drivers with terminated points, urges Wilson|work=The Irish Times|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called for an apology from Shatter (who later resigned over the scandal) and from Kenny, saying that Shatter and Callinan "ridiculed" him for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/we-were-ridiculed-i-want-an-apology-whistleblower-wilson-624914.html|title='We were ridiculed. I want an apology' .: Whistleblower Wilson|newspaper=BreakingNews.ie|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guerin Report==
In response to growing concern at mismanagement within the Gardaí arising from the whistleblower's allegations, the ''Guerin Report'' into corruption within the [[Garda Síochána]] (Ireland's national police force) was published on 9 May 2014. This looked only at issues raised by the serving Garda, Sergeant Maurice McCabe.

The report, compiled by Sean Guerin SC, investigated allegations that serious crimes were improperly investigated by the police and was critical of the treatment of whistleblower McCabe, who was harassed and subjected to death threats after attempting to disclose information. Alan Shatter resigned as Minister for Justice and Equality in advance of its publication. His successor [[Frances Fitzgerald (politician)|Frances Fitzgerald]] immediately announced the establishment of a [[Commission of investigation (Ireland)|Commission of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0509/616164-guerin-report/|title=Commission of Investigation to be established following Guerin Report|work=RTÉ News|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerin recommended the establishment of a comprehensive Commission of Investigation whose terms of reference ought to include “definite matters of urgent public importance” such as the case of Jerry McGrath, who was convicted of murdering Sylvia Roche-Kelly in [[Limerick]] while on bail in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pamela|last=Duncan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/guerin-report-main-findings-1.1789786|title=Guerin report: main findings|work=The Irish Times|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Daly|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/jerry-mcgrath-guerin-report-1457028-May2014/|title=Jerry McGrath: The escalating horror and failures that led to a murder|work=The Journal.ie|date=10 May 2014|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerin concluded: "No complex organisation can succeed in its task if it cannot find the means of heeding the voice of a member whose immediate supervisors hold in the high regard in which Sgt McCabe was held. Ultimately An Garda Síochána does not seem to have been able to do that. Nor does the Minister for Justice and Equality, despite his having an independent supervisory and investigation function with specific statutory powers. The same appears true of GSOC (Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission), although this review is hampered in that regard by the fact that GSOC has not made documentation available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/editorial-comment-guerin-exposes-failures-in-gardai-and-government-30261827.html|title=Guerin exposes failures in Gardai and Government|work=Irish Independent|date=10 May 2014|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCabe's fellow whistleblower John Wilson described the contents of the report as "disgusting, truly disgusting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/garda-whistleblower-john-wilson-the-contents-of-the-guerin-report-are-truly-disgusting-30260565.html|title=Garda whistleblower John Wilson: The contents of the Guerin report are truly disgusting|work=Irish Independent|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disclosures Tribunal{{Anchor|Tribunal}}&lt;!-- [[Disclosures Tribunal]] redirects here --&gt;==
On 9 February 2017, a report in the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/exclusive-false-sex-allegation-against-mccabe-circulated-by-tusla-following-clerical-error-442503.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: False sex allegation against McCabe circulated by Tusla  following "clerical error"|date=2017-02-09|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a subsequent ''[[Prime Time (Irish TV programme)|Prime Time]]'' special, revealed how Maurice McCabe was treated in the aftermath of the scandal, including when he was reported to [[Tusla]], the Child and Family Agency, for [[child sexual abuse]]. This provoked outrage, with McCabe stating his intention to sue the State over the accusations. In February 2017, the government promised another [[commission of investigation (Ireland)|commission of investigation]] into the 2017 allegations, to be chaired by [[Peter Charleton]], a judge of the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]]. McCabe demanded a [[Public inquiries in the Republic of Ireland|Tribunal of Inquiry]], which would take evidence in public rather than in private, and the government agreed to this after opposition pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2017/0214/852646-dail-maurice-mccabe-analysis/|title=After days of political turmoil, tribunal on way|date=14 February 2017|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Charleton formally opened the '''Disclosures Tribunal''' (Tribunal of Inquiry into protected disclosures made under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and certain other matters following Resolutions) with an introductory statement on 27 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0227/855663-trbunal/|title=Judge outlines details of McCabe tribunal|date=27 February 2017|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public sittings commenced on 4 July 2017. The first week of this module examined the circumstances surrounding the creation of an incorrect sexual abuse report and whether it was seized upon by senior gardai to blacken Sergeant McCabe's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chain of errors fed false claims about McCabe |last=Phelan |first=Shane |date=9 July 2017 |work=Sunday Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of November 2017, the second interim report of the Disclosures Tribunal found that claims by Garda Keith Harrison and his partner Marisa Simms were "entirely without any validity", that their allegations against social workers and police had "simply collapsed", and that social workers accused of abuse of office by them  were "entitled to feel deeply upset at being targeted with such allegations".&lt;ref name=RTE2017-12-01a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/1130/924078-disclosures-tribunal/|title=Tribunal finds Harrison claims without 'validity'|date=1 December 2017|accessdate=3 December 2017|publisher=RTE|quote=The tribunal said: "All of the allegations of Garda Keith Harrison and Marisa Simms examined by the tribunal are entirely without any validity. "They have claimed to have been the victims of a malicious procession of events. "That is not so ... It is appropriate here to exonerate everyone in social services and in policing accused by them of discreditable conduct. That is the only possible conclusion to the tribunal's enquiry." The report states that during the hearing "very serious allegations" by Mr Harrison and Ms Simms "simply collapsed". It said the social workers accused by them of abuse of office were "entitled to feel deeply upset at being targeted with such allegations".}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tribunal2ndIntRep2017-11-30a&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disclosurestribunal.ie/en/DIS/(n)%20and%20(o)%20report.pdf/Files/(n)%20and%20(o)%20report.pdf|title=Second Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiries into protected disclosures made under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and certain other matters - Report on matters relating to Garda Keith Harrison pursuant to terms of reference (n) and (o).|date=30 November 2017|accessdate=3 December 2017|publisher=disclosurestribunal.ie|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garda Harrison said he was disappointed but not surprised by the findings.&lt;ref name=RTE2017-12-01b&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/1201/924351-harrison-statement-tribunal/|title=Harrison disappointed by findings of Disclosures Tribunal|date=1 December 2017|accessdate=3 December 2017|publisher=RTE|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 2018, the third interim report of the was released by Judge [[Peter Charleton]]. It vindicated Sergeant McCabe, former Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan and former Minister for Justice [[Frances Fitzgerald (politician)|Frances Fitzgerald]]. It severely criticised former Commissioner [[Martin Callinan]] and former Garda press officer, Superintendant David Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/1011/1002470-disclosures-tribunal-dave-taylor/|title='Utter mystery' as to how Taylor was press officer, says Charleton|publisher=RTÉ|date=11 October 2018|access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Delmotte''' (born 15 December 1917 in Liège, died 1945) was a Belgian [[Waffen SS|SS]] doctor at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in the branch of the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen SS. 
Initially he refused to take part in selections, allegedly going as far as to tell his superiors "You can send me to the front or gas me myself, but I won't do it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Jay Lifton]], "The Nazi Doctors", p. 309 http://www.holocaust-history.org/lifton/LiftonT309.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; By the late fall of 1944 he finally was persuaded to take part in selections.  For Delmotte's dissertation, he reserved a Jewish prisoner doctor and professor to assist him. For this research, Delmotte took part in [[typhus]] experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz.  Delmotte's dissertation:. Contributions to pathological physiology of gastric secretion in typhoid fever was already completed in 1944.

After the evacuation of Auschwitz in January 1945, Delmotte briefly continued to work in [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. While trying to make his way back to Belgium, he was arrested by members of the U.S. Army. During the transfer to a prison, Delmotte managed to shoot himself.&lt;ref&gt;People in Auschwitz (Published in Association with the United States Holocaust Museum) Hermann Langbein (Author), Henry Friedlander (Foreword)&lt;/ref&gt;

Canellas is best known for his role in breaking the [[Bundesliga scandal (1971)|1971 Bundesliga scandal]]. He was also a hostage on the hijacked German [[Lufthansa Flight 181]] in 1977.

==Biography==
Canellas, son of a Spanish father and a German mother, was born in [[Plauen]], [[Saxony]], in 1921. After the end of [[World War II]] he spent some time in Spain and then moved to [[Hesse]] and adopted German citizenship. He became the managing director of a fruit importer in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-43231213.html|title=„Ein Elfmeter kostet 1000 Mark“|date=14 June 1971|website=spiegel.de|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date= 2 July 2016|language=German|trans-title="A penalty costs DM1,000"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rQfNyLM5svIC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=Horst-Gregorio+Canellas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4mTPdA8zZJ&amp;sig=p-j9frAZfJUhkLlN9nufRGGr8Yg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIw8ftj9TNAhUKLMAKHavmA_o4ChDoAQgzMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Horst-Gregorio%20Canellas&amp;f=false|title=Tor!: The Story of German Football|date=|website=google.com.au|publisher=|access-date= 2 July 2016|language=|trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boss" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42953667.html|title=Boss, wir müssen Spiele kaufen|date=24 April 1972|website=spiegel.de|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date= 2 July 2016|language=German|trans-title="Boss, we have to buy games"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Canellas became chairman of [[Kickers Offenbach]], a club then playing in the second division [[Regionalliga Süd (1963–74)|Regionalliga Süd]]. Offenbach won promotion to the [[Bundesliga]] in 1968 and 1970 but suffered immediate relegation on both occasions.&lt;ref name="Boss" /&gt;

The day after the end of the [[1970–71 Bundesliga]] season Canellas invited officials of the [[German Football Association]] and the press to his 50th birthday celebration. It was there that he broke the [[Bundesliga scandal (1971)|1971 Bundesliga scandal]] by replaying voice recordings he had made of attempts to manipulate Bundesliga games through bribes. Earlier attempts to inform the German Association had been ignored by the latter. Canellas stepped down immediately as chairman of Kickers Offenbach and was initially banned for life from holding any office at a German football club but this ban was lifted in 1976. The following scandal took 18 month to clear up and saw 52 players and two managers banned and fined.&lt;ref name="Dead" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/hintergrund-der-bundesliga-skandal-von-1971-a-338187.html|title=Hintergrund: Der Bundesliga-Skandal von 1971|date=23 January 2005|website=spiegel.de|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date= 2 July 2016|language=German|trans-title=Background: The Bundesliga scandal from 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/fussball/bundesligaskandal-1971-aus-unschuldsbeteuerungen-wurden-meineide-1209394.html|title=Aus Unschuldsbeteuerungen wurden Meineide|date=1 February 2005|website=faz.net|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]|access-date= 2 July 2016|language=German|trans-title=Pleas of innocence turned into perjury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canellas retired from his business in 1974. On a flight from [[Mallorca]] to Frankfurt in 1977 the plane he was on, [[Lufthansa Flight 181]], was hijacked by members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PLO]] and the hostages were later freed by the German counter-terrorism unit [[GSG 9]] in [[Mogadishu]].&lt;ref name="Dead" /&gt;

The '''House of Herbert''' is a [[Anglo-Welsh|British]] [[Noble House]] founded by [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423–1469)|William Herbert]], known as "Black William", the son of [[William ap Thomas]], founder of [[Raglan Castle]], a follower of [[Edward IV of England]] in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The name Herbert originated in 1461 when William was granted the title [[Baron Herbert|Baron Herbert of Raglan]], having assumed an English-style [[surname]] in place of his Welsh [[patronymic]], ''ap William''.

An '''ironworker''' is the American term for a [[tradesman]] who works in the iron working industry. A structural/ornamental ironworker fabricates and erects (or even dismantles) the [[structural steel]] framework of [[pre-engineered building|pre-engineered metal buildings]], single and multi-story buildings, stadiums, arenas, hospitals, towers, [[wind turbine]]s, and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Wiley Dictionary of Civil Engineering and Construction |author= Len F. Webster|year=1997|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=0471181153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0471181153&amp;id=u7nAYkS9lGcC&amp;pg=PA557&amp;lpg=PA557&amp;dq=%22Steel+erector%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=yzF3cDwFo9MrjTXlFIiBDF5fNnc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironworkers assemble the structural framework in accordance with [[engineering drawings|engineered drawings]].&lt;ref&gt;

Ironworkers are called “steel erectors" in Australia and New Zealand.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Must be a qualified "Dogman" and "Rigger". Does not work with rebar as that is the "Steel Fixer's" job. A dogman or rigger may move the rebar bundles for the steel fixer. A steel fixer fixes steel only.

Bangash|year= 2000|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=0727728504 |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0727728504&amp;id=Wy_3nd8ZzaQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Steel+erector%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=SXcVHTF-dVFX0JF_7qTko63-Wt0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironworkers also unload, place and tie reinforcing steel bars ([[rebar]]) as well as install post-tensioning systems, both of which give strength to the concrete used in piers, [[Foundation (engineering)|footings]], slabs, buildings, and bridges. Ironworkers load, unload, place, and set machinery and equipment as well as operate power hoists, forklifts, and [[aerial lift]]s. They unload, place, and fasten metal decking, safety netting, and edge rails to facilitate safe working practices. Ironworkers finish buildings by erecting [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] and window wall systems, stairs and handrails, metal doors, and sheeting and elevator fronts. Ironworkers perform all types of industrial maintenance as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ironworkers.org/becoming/careers.aspx|title=Careers|website=www.ironworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically ironworkers mainly worked with [[wrought iron]] or [[cast iron]], but today they utilize many different materials including [[ferrous]] and non-ferrous metals, [[plastic]]s, [[glass]], [[concrete|concrete,]] and [[Composite material|composite]]s.

==History==
{{See also|Cast-iron architecture}}
Practically overnight, bridge carpenters became ironworkers during the 1880s. It was seen as a new, exciting job for pioneers in America, despite its dangerous drawbacks. For about two dollars per day, a worker could risk his life on high structures.&lt;ref name="our history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Union History|url=http://www.ironworkers512.com/pages/UnionHistory1/|work=Ironworker|publisher=Ironworkers Union Local 512|year=2012|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[industrial revolution]], the production of cast iron parts brought about the use of cranes. This heavy equipment was used in the early 1900s to construct high level structures.  This new technology brought about a special form of trade workers called ironworkers. They used cranes to lift steel girders into place, and used rivets to connect the girders to the columns of a structure. The mortality rate of men working in this trade was the highest of all trades, and the ironworker could be lucky to go 10 years without a serious or fatal injury.

In the late 19th century, workers formed the International Union of Ironworkers because of concerns they had about safety on-the-job and the lack of protection from employers. The union's first order of business was to give widows of ironworkers $50 to cover the costs of a funeral and to give disabled ironworkers $5 a week to compensate for lost wages. With the increase in benefits from unionization, the Union greatly increased its presence in numbers in the early 1900s.  Approximately 10,000 workers were considered Ironworkers through the Union.&lt;ref name="our history" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, during the third great immigration wave&lt;ref name="yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1999/3/99.03.01.x.html|title=99.03.01: Immigration in the United States|website=www.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ironworker wage in real 2010 US dollars was $9.50 (2010) to $12 (2010) per hour (40 to 50 cents an hour in 1900). Following the imposition of immigration quotas in 1921&lt;ref name="yale.edu"/&gt; wages rose to $17.50 (2010) an hour ($1.37) for a structural ironworker just prior to the Great Depression and the real wage subsequently only dropped 10% to $16.00 (2010) ($1.05) given the deflation during the depression. However, following the [[Marshall Plan#Wartime destruction|wartime destruction]] of manufacturing complexes - with the exception of North America, 1956 wages for structural, ornamental, and rebar ironworkers rose to $27.30 (2010) an hour ($3.40). By 1970, through the [[Cold war#Soviet and US military and economic issues|Coldwar buildup]], iron worker wages peaked at $44.80 (2010) ($7.97).  Then, following the 1965 new immigration policy and the start of the fourth great migration wave &lt;ref name="yale.edu"/&gt;, wages fell 10% to $40.38 (2010) by 1980 ($15.26), and fell another 20% to $29.90 (2010) per hour ($20.88) by 1990, comparable to the 50's wage rate. With the end of the [[Effects of the Cold War#Economic legacies|Cold War buildup]] in 1991, ironworker rates have since stayed constant and were $29.30 (2010) an hour ($24.15) in 2002.&lt;ref name="wages"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wages |url=http://www.ironworkerslocal55.com/Home/History/tabid/69/Default.aspx |publisher=Union Ironworkers Local 55 |accessdate=2010-10-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tV67udgQ?url=http://www.ironworkerslocal55.com/Home/History/tabid/69/Default.aspx |archivedate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the mean wage for Ohio ironworkers, both union and nonunion, is $24.66 per hour; the 75th percentile for the nation is 29.51&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes472221.htm|title=Structural Iron and Steel Workers|website=www.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; - likely for the unionized workforce and indicates that for the past 20-years Ironworker wages have been stagnant for various reasons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/the_sad_but_true_story_of_wages_in_america/|title=The sad but true story of wages in America|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - most prominently the offset in real wages created by debt, today 126% of income compared to 40% in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapidtrends.com/private-debt-is-much-higher-now-than-during-the-great-depression/|title=Private Debt Is Much Higher Now Than During the Great Depression - Thoughts about Gold, Silver, and other stuff|website=www.rapidtrends.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing short-term survival on less than the [[living wage]].

==Types==
There are three main types of ironworks: reinforcing, structural, and ornamental.

===Reinforcing ironworker===
{{main article|Steel fixer}}
A [[reinforcing bar|reinforcing]] (rebar) ironworker, colloquially known as a "Rodbuster", works with reinforcing bars to make structures based on a certain design. Reinforcing ironworkers assemble structures with reinforcing bars by tying the bars together with tie wire. They place the rebar inside of forms, so concrete can be poured over top of them to form a solid structure. When reinforcing floors, concrete blocks are used to raise the rebar off of the deck, so no rebar can be seen underneath of the deck of the floor after the forms are stripped. In addition, ironworkers often have to cut the steel that they have for a job to fit into certain positions.  For example, the rebar will have to be cut with a [[cutting torch]], so it can fit around a drain. In some instances, welded wire fabric is used to help strengthen concrete; however, it is difficult to place this fabric in the concrete because it must be placed while the concrete is being poured into the forms.&lt;ref name="description rebar"&gt;{{cite web | title=Structural and Reinforcing Ironworkers| url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/ooh9899/222.htm | work= | publisher= Conley Hall Dillon| date= | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average pay for a reinforcing bar ironworker in residential construction was an hourly wage of $23.59 in early 2009 and  rebar ironworkers in commercial and industrial construction earn an hourly wage of $39.11.&lt;ref name="wages ironwork"&gt;{{cite web | title=#382 - REINFORCING-IRON WORKER| url=http://www.michigan.gov/careers/0,1607,7-170-46398-64796--,00.html | work= | publisher=| date= | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical tools of a reinforcing bar ironworker are pliers, tie wire reel, rod buster bag, and a rebar hook.  The main tool of a reinforcing bar ironworker is their work [[pliers]].  The pliers cuts soft annealed rebar tie wire and twists the wire into place.  The pliers have a hook bend handle, and a spring in between the handles for self-opening of the pliers.  The pliers cut ACSR, screws, nails and most hardened wire. Also, the pliers are finished with a black oxide paint to resist rust on the tool.  A tie wire reel is a lightweight aluminum alloy mechanism used for dispensing tie wire efficiently.  A rod buster bag is a split-leather double bottom pouch used for holding tools while they are not in use.  A rebar hook is a hook made of solid steel that has a snap hook in front, and fits onto a tool belt easily.

The British call a reinforcing ironworker a '''steelfixer'''. In the United Kingdom and Ireland a steelfixer's main tool is the pincer-like '''nips'''.

===Structural ironworker===
Before construction can begin, the structural ironworkers put together the cranes that will be used to lift the steel columns, beams, and [[girders]] according to structural blueprints. To hoist the steel, structural ironworkers use cables connected to the crane to lift the beams onto the steel columns.  A rope called a tagline is attached to the beams so an ironworker can control the beams if necessary.  The crane hoists steel into place, and the ironworkers position the beams in place with spud wrenches to align bolt holes.  Then, the beams can be bolted to the steel columns.  This process is continued until there are no beams or columns left to construct the structure.&lt;ref name="description struc"&gt;{{cite web | title=Structural and Reinforcing Iron and Metal Workers| url=http://stats.bls.gov/OCO/OCOS215.HTM| work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural ironworkers also erect [[girder|joist girders]], [[joists|bar joists]], [[trusses|trusses,]] and install metal decking.

The average annual income for a structural ironworker in the early 2000s was 15.85 dollars per hour; however, a full-time structural ironworker could make between 30 dollars per hour to 40 dollars per hour depending on the location of the work.   &lt;ref name="wages ironwork"/&gt;
Current wages for Local Union #1 Chicago Ironworkers can be found at the Chicago Ironworkers local union website.&lt;ref&gt; http://iwlocal1.com/pdf/ASE%206-1-2017.web.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

The typical structural ironworker tools are the spud wrench, bolt bag, sleever bars, bull pins, drift pins, and beaters. The spud wrench is the most important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes.  It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and the opposite end of the wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient.  A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or "point" and stuff the rest of the holes. Drift pins have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center and are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.

Although use of fall harnesses has reduced fatalities in this sector over time, structural steel erection remains one of the most dangerous occupations in construction. Workplace accidents claim the lives of approximately 38 out of every 100,000 full-time ironworkers each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Construction Chart Book: The US Construction Industry and its Workers|url=http://www.cpwr.com/pdfs/chart_book_5th/fatal_and_nonfatal_injuries.pdf#page=11|work=6/11/2013|publisher=CPWR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornamental ironworker===
Ornamental ironworkers install metal windows into structures, erect curtain walls and window wall systems that cover the steel, erect metal stairways, cat walks, gratings, ladders, doors of all types, railings, fencing, gates, metal screens, elevator fronts, platforms, and entranceways.  A variety of materials are used to make these structures and this type of work is fastened by welding or bolting to the main structure.  A common name for an ornamental ironworker is a finisher because they are responsible for finishing the structures after the structural and rebar work is done.&lt;ref name="ornamental"&gt;{{cite web | title= Ornamental Ironworkers | url=http://www.ironworkers.org/becoming/careers.aspx | work= Ironworker| publisher= International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental, and Reinforcing Ironworkers | date= | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main wage rate for ornamental ironworkers ranges from $20.89 per hour to $45.00 per hour.  The wages are adjusted according to the location of the work and the nature of the work.

The main tool of the ornamental ironworker is an [[arc welder]].  According to ironworkers.org, welding and burning equipment are considered “tools of the trade.”  However, any ironworker must be certified to weld on a project.&lt;ref name="ornamental"/&gt;

==Name==
{{see|Name of Italy}}
{{wiktionary|Italian|italiano}}
The Latin name ''Italia''&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Latin Dictionary|OLD]], p. 974: "first syll. naturally short (cf. [[Quintilian|Quint.]]''Inst.''1.5.18), and so scanned in &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;[[Gaius Lucilius|Lucil.]]&lt;/span&gt;825, but in dactylic verse lengthened ''metri gratia''."&lt;/ref&gt;  according to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'' was used by Greeks to indicate the southwestern tip of the Italian peninsula, corresponding roughly to the current region of [[Calabria]], from  the [[strait of Messina]] to the line connecting the [[gulf of Salerno]] and [[gulf of Taranto]].
It most likely originates with [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''Víteliú'', meaning "land of young cattle" (''cf.'' [[Latin]] ''vitulus'' "calf", [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] ''vitlo'' "calf")&lt;!-- and named for the god of cattle, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams, ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]].  
The name was later extended to include all the Italian peninsula south of the  [[Rubicon]], and still later, by the end of the 1st century BC, to all of the peninsula and beyond (including [[Istria]], [[Gallia Cisalpina]], [[Raetia]] and the islands of [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]]).

Latin ''Italicus'' as a substantive meaning "a man of Italy" is first recorded in [[Pliny the Elder]], ''Letters'' 9.23 (''Italicus es an provincialis'' "are you an Italian or a provincial?", referring to the extension of [[Roman citizenship]] to all of ''Italia'' after 88 BC). 
The adjective ''italianus'', from which are derived the Italian (and also French and English) name of the Italians is [[Middle Latin|medieval]].&lt;ref&gt;''ytaliiens'' (1265) [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/italien TLFi]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman era===
{{see|Roman Italy|Ancient peoples of Italy|Etruscan civilization|Italic peoples|Magna Graecia|Cisalpine Gaul|Ancient Rome}}
[[File:Tarquinia Tomb of the Leopards.jpg|thumb|[[Etruscan Civilization]] fresco from the [[Tomb of the Leopards]]]]
[[File:RomanItaly.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Expansion of the territory known as [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]] from the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]] until [[Diocletian]].]]
The Italian peninsula was divided into a multitude of tribal or ethnic territory prior to the [[Roman expansion in Italy|Roman conquest of Italy]] in the 3rd century BC. After a series of wars between [[Greeks]] and [[Etruscans]], the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], with [[Rome]] as their capital, gained the ascendancy by 272 BC, and completed the conquest of the Italian peninsula by 218 BC.

This period of unification was followed by one of conquest in the Mediterranean, beginning with the [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]]. In the course of the century-long struggle against Carthage, the Romans conquered Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. Finally, in 146 BC, at the conclusion of the [[Third Punic War]], with Carthage completely destroyed and its inhabitants enslaved, Rome became the dominant power in the Mediterranean. 

The process of Italian unification, and the associated [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], culminated in 88 BC, when, in the aftermath of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]], Rome granted  [[socii|its Italian allies]]   full rights in Roman society, extending [[Roman citizenship]] to all [[Italic peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keaveney |first=Arthur |year=1987 |title=Rome and the Unification of Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojoOAAAAQAAJ |location=London |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=9781904675372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inception, Rome was a republican city-state, but four famous civil conflicts destroyed the republic: [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] against [[Gaius Marius]] and his son (88–82 BC), [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey]] (49–45 BC), [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] against [[Mark Antony]] and Octavian (43 BC), and Mark Antony against [[Augustus|Octavian]].
Octavian, the final victor (31 BC), was accorded the title of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and thereby became the first Roman emperor. Augustus created for the first time an administrative region called ''Italia'' with inhabitants called "Italicus populus", stretching from the [[Alps]] to Sicily: for this reason historians like [[Emilio Gentile]] called him ''Father of Italians''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lagrandebiblioteca.com/moda-e-stile/italiani.php] {{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1st century BC, ''Italia'' was still a collection of territories with different political statuses. Some cities, called ''[[municipium|municipia]]'', had some independence from Rome, while others, the ''[[Colonia (Roman)|coloniae]]'', were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, [[Augustus]] divided Italy into eleven ''regiones''.
During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor [[Diocletian]] restored political stability. The importance of Rome declined, because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. 
The seats of the Caesars were [[Augusta Treverorum]] (on the River [[Rhine]] frontier) for [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Sirmium]] (on the River [[Danube]] frontier) for [[Galerius]] who also resided at Thessaloniki.
Under Diocletian, Italy became the ''Dioecesis Italiciana'', subdivided into thirteen provinces, now including [[Raetia]]. Under [[Constantine the Great]], Italy became the [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]] (''praefectura praetoria Italiae''), and was subdivided into two dioceses. ''Diocesis Italia annonaria''  (Italy of the [[Cura Annonae|annona]], governed from Milan) and '' Diocesis Italia Suburbicaria''' (Italy "under the government of the ''[[wikt:urbs|urbs]]''", i.e. governed from Rome).
[[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity]] became the Roman state religion in AD 380, under emperor [[Theodosius I]].
The last Western emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus]], was deposed in 476 by a Germanic foederati general in Italy, [[Odoacer]]. His defeat marked the end of the western part of the Roman Empire, and the end of the political unification of Italy until the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

===The Middle Ages===
{{see|Italy in the Middle Ages}}
[[Image:Italy 1000 AD.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Italy around AD 1000.]]
Odoacer ruled well for 13 years after gaining control of Italy in 476. Then he was attacked and defeated by [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], the king of another Germanic tribe, the [[Ostrogoths]]. Theodoric and Odoacer ruled jointly until 493, when Theodoric murdered Odoacer. Theodoric continued to rule Italy with an army of Ostrogoths and a government that was mostly Italian. After the death of Theodoric in 526, the kingdom began to grow weak. By 553, emperor [[Justinian I]] expelled the Ostrogoths, and Italy was included into the [[Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty]].
Byzantine rule in Italy collapsed again by 572 as a result of invasions by another Germanic tribe, the [[Lombards]].
The peninsula was now dominated by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], with minor remnants of Byzantine control especially in the south.

During the 5th and 6th centuries, the popes increased their influence in both religious and political matters in Italy. It was usually the popes who led attempts to protect Italy from invasion or to soften foreign rule. For about 200 years the popes opposed attempts by the Lombards, who had captured most of Italy, to take over Rome as well. The [[pope]]s finally defeated the Lombards with the aid of two Frankish kings, [[Pepin the Short]] and [[Charlemagne]]. Using land won for them by Pepin in 756, the popes established political rule in what were called the [[Papal States]] in central Italy.

The Lombards remained a threat to papal power, however, until they were crushed by Charlemagne in 774. Charlemagne added the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] to his vast realm. In recognition of Charlemagne's power, and to cement the church's alliance with him, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Charlemagne's death in 814, his son [[Louis the Pious]] succeeded him. Louis divided the empire among his sons, and
Frankish Italy became part of [[Middle Francia]], extending as far south as [[Rome]] and [[Spoleto]]. This [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 10th century,  while southern Italy was under the rule of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Principality of Benevento]] or of the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the 12th century absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].

===Rise of the city-states and the Renaissance===
{{see|Italian city-states|Italian language#Origins}}
From the 11th century on, Italian cities began to grow rapidly in independence and importance. They became centres of political life, [[banking]], and foreign trade. Some became wealthy, and many, including [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]] and [[Venice]], grew into nearly independent city-states. Each had its own foreign policy and political life. They all resisted the efforts of noblemen and emperors to control them.

The emergence of identifiable [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italian dialects]] from [[Vulgar Latin]], and as such the possibility of a specifically "Italian" ethnic identity, has no clear-cut date, but takes place from roughly 12th century. Modern standard Italian derives from the written vernacular of   [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] writers of the 12th century.
The recognition of Italian vernaculars as literary languages in their own right begins with 
''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', an essay written by [[Dante Alighieri]] at the beginning of the 14th century.

During the 14th and 15th centuries, some Italian city-states ranked among the most important powers of Europe. Venice, in particular, had become a major maritime power, and the city-states as a group acted as a conduit for goods from the Byzantine and Islamic empires. In this capacity, they provided great impetus to the developing [[Renaissance]], began in Florence in the 14th century,&lt;ref name="Burke1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Burke|title=The European Renaissance: Centers and Peripheries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWKnnbajUUQC|year=1998|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-19845-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to an unparalleled flourishing of the arts, literature, music, and science.

However, the city-states were often troubled by violent disagreements among their citizens. The most famous division was between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]. The Guelphs supported supreme rule by the pope, and the Ghibellines favoured the emperor. City-states often took sides and waged war against each other. During the Renaissance, Italy became an even more attractive prize to foreign conquerors. After some city-states asked for outside help in settling disputes with their neighbours, King [[Charles VIII of France]] marched into Italy in 1494. Charles soon withdrew, but he had shown that the Italian peninsula could be conquered because they were not united{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. After the [[Italian Wars]], Spain emerged as the dominant force in the region. Venice, Milan, and other city-states retained at least some of their former greatness during this period, as did [[Savoy]]-Piedmont, protected by the Alps and well defended by its vigorous rulers.

===The French Revolution and Napoleon===
{{Main|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy}}
[[File:Laura bassi1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Laura Bassi]], the first chairwoman of a university in a scientific field of studies.]]
The French Revolution and Napoleon influenced Italy more deeply than they affected any other outside country of Europe. The [[French Revolution]] began in 1789 and immediately found supporters among the Italian people. The local Italian rulers, sensing danger in their own country, drew closer to the European kings who opposed France. After the French king was overthrown and France became a republic, secret clubs favouring an Italian republic were formed throughout Italy. The armies of the French Republic began to move across Europe. In 1796, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] led a French army into northern Italy and drove out the Austrian rulers. Once again, Italy was the scene of battle between the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] and the French. Wherever France conquered, Italian republics were set up, with constitutions and legal reforms. Napoleon made himself emperor in 1804, and part of northern and central Italy was unified under the name of the Kingdom of Italy, with Napoleon as king. The rest of northern and central Italy was annexed by France. Only Sicily and the island of Sardinia, which had been ceded to the [[House of Savoy]] in 1720 and had been under their rule ever since, remained free of French control.

French domination lasted less than 20 years, and it differed from previous foreign control of the Italian peninsula. In spite of heavy taxation and frequent harshness, the French introduced representative assemblies and new laws that were the same for all parts of the country. For the first time since the days of ancient Rome, Italians of different regions used the same money and served in the same army. Many Italians began to see the possibility of a united Italy free of foreign control.

===The Kingdom of Italy===
{{Main|Kingdom of Italy}}
[[File:Partenza da Quarto.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[Expedition of the Thousand]].]]

After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the reaction set in with the [[Congress of Vienna]] allowed the restoration of many of the old rulers and systems under Austrian domination. The concept of nationalism continued strong, however, and sporadic outbreaks led by such inveterate reformers as [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] occurred in several parts of the peninsula down to 1848–49. This ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' movement was brought to a successful conclusion under the able guidance of [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], prime minister of Piedmont.

Cavour managed to unite most of Italy under the headship of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] of the house of Savoy, and on 17 March 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel II as king. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the popular republican hero of Italy, contributed much to this achievement and to the subsequent incorporation of the Papal States under the Italian monarch. Italian troops occupied Rome in 1870, and in July 1871, this formally became the capital of the kingdom. [[Pope Pius IX]], a longtime rival of Italian kings, considered himself a "prisoner" of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and refused to cooperate with the royal administration. Only in 1929 the Roman Pope accepted the unified Italy with [[Rome]] as capital.

In the decades following unification, Italy started to create colonies in [[Africa]], and under [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[fascism]] conquered [[Ethiopia]] founding in 1936 the [[Italian Empire]]. [[World War I]] completed the process of Italian unification, with the annexation of Trieste, [[Istria]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] and [[Zadar|Zara]]. The Italians grew to 45 millions in 1940 and the land, whose economy had been until that time based upon agriculture, started its industrial development, mainly in northern Italy. But [[World War II]] soon destroyed Italy and its colonial power.

===The Italian Republic===
{{Main|History of the Italian Republic}}

Between 1945 and 1948, the outlines of a new Italy began to appear. [[Victor Emmanuel III]] gave up the throne on 9 May 1946, and his son, [[Umberto II]], became king. On 2 June Italy held its first free election after 20 years of Fascist rule (the so-called ''Ventennio''). Italians chose a republic to replace the monarchy, which had been closely associated with [[Fascism]]. They elected a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] to prepare a new democratic constitution. The Assembly approved the constitution in 1947, which came into force since 1 January 1948.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Italy}}

[[File:Apollon Mokritsky Rim Italyanki na Terrase 1846.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Italian women dance the [[tarantella]], 1846]]
From the Magna Graecia period to the 17th century, the inhabitants of the Italian peninsula were at the forefront of [[Western culture]], being the fulcrum and origin of [[Magna Graecia]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Humanism]], the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and [[Neoclassicism]].

Italy also became a seat of great formal learning in 1088 with the establishment of the [[University of Bologna]], the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|first university]] in the Western World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These great centres of learning presaged the ''Rinascimento'': the European Renaissance began in Italy and was fueled throughout Europe by Italian painters, sculptors, architects, scientists, literature masters and music composers. Italy continued its leading cultural role through the [[Baroque]] period and into the Romantic period, when its dominance in painting and sculpture diminished but the Italians re-established a strong presence in music.

Italian explorers and navigators in the 15th and 16th centuries left a perennial mark on human history with the modern "discovery of America", due to [[Christopher Columbus]]. In addition, the name of the [[Americas|American continents]] derives from the geographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first name. Also noted, is explorer [[Marco Polo]] who travelled extensively throughout the [[eastern world]] recording his travels.

Due to comparatively late national unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the Italian peninsula, many traditions and customs of the Italians can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social isolation of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of the Western world remain immense. Famous elements of Italian culture are its [[opera]] and music, its iconic gastronomy and food, which are commonly regarded as amongst the most popular in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Italian philosophy}}

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], the founder of modern political science and ethics.|alt=]]Over the ages Italian literature had a vast influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and going onto Renaissance, [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] and modern philosophy.
Italian Medieval philosophy was mainly Christian, and included several important philosophers and theologians such as St [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas was the student of [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a brilliant [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] experimentalist, much like the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]], [[Roger Bacon]] of [[Oxford]] in the 13th century. Aquinas reintroduced [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] to Christianity. He believed that there was no contradiction between faith and secular reason. He believed that Aristotle had achieved the pinnacle in the human striving for truth and thus adopted Aristotle's philosophy as a framework in constructing his theological and philosophical outlook. He was a professor at the prestigious [[University of Paris]].

Italy was also affected by the Enlightenment, a movement which was a consequence of the [[Renaissance]] and changed the road of Italian philosophy.&lt;ref name="history-world.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm|title=The Enlightenment throughout Europe|website=history-world.org|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of the group often met to discuss in private salons and coffeehouses, notably in the cities of [[Milan]], Rome and [[Venice]]. Cities with important universities such as [[Padua]], [[Bologna]] and [[Naples]], however, also remained great centres of scholarship and the intellect, with several philosophers such as [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) (who is widely regarded as being the founder of modern Italian philosophy)&lt;ref name="maritain.nd.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hop70.htm|title=History of Philosophy 70|website=maritain.nd.edu|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antonio Genovesi]].&lt;ref name="history-world.org" /&gt; Italian society also dramatically changed during the Enlightenment, with rulers such as [[Leopold II of Tuscany]] abolishing the death penalty. The church's power was significantly reduced, and it was a period of great thought and invention, with scientists such as [[Alessandro Volta]] and [[Luigi Galvani]] discovering new things and greatly contributing to Western science.&lt;ref name="history-world.org" /&gt; [[Cesare Beccaria]] was also one of the greatest Italian Enlightenment writers and now considered one of the fathers of [[Classical school (criminology)|classical criminal theory]] as well as modern [[penology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hostettler|first=John|title=Cesare Beccaria: The Genius of 'On Crimes and Punishments'|date=2011|publisher=Waterside Press|location=Hampshire|isbn=978-1904380634|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beccaria is famous for his masterpiece ''[[On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1764), a treatise (later translated into 22 languages) that served as one of the earliest prominent condemnations of [[torture]] and the [[death penalty]] and thus a landmark work in [[anti-death penalty]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="history-world.org" /&gt;

Some of the most prominent philosophies and ideologies in Italy during the late 19th and 20th centuries include [[anarchism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[futurism]], [[fascism]], and [[Christian democracy]]. Both futurism and fascism (in its original form, now often distinguished as [[Italian fascism]]) were developed in Italy at this time. From the 1920s to the 1940s, Italian Fascism was the official philosophy and ideology of the Italian government led by Benito Mussolini. [[Giovanni Gentile]] was one of the most significant 20th-century Idealist/Fascist philosophers. Meanwhile, anarchism, communism, and socialism, though not originating in Italy, took significant hold in Italy during the early 20th century, with the country producing numerous significant [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]], socialists, and communists. In addition, [[anarcho-communism]] first fully formed into its modern strain within the Italian section of the [[First International]].&lt;ref name="Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111-113"&gt;Nunzio Pernicone, ''Italian Anarchism 1864–1892'', pp. 111-113, AK Press 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Gramsci]] remains an important philosopher within [[Marxist]] and communist theory, credited with creating the theory of [[cultural hegemony]].

==Literature==
{{Main|Italian literature}}

Italian literature may be unearthed back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most significant poets of the period being [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].
During the [[Renaissance]], humanists such as [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Coluccio Salutati]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] were great collectors of antique manuscripts. Many worked for the organized Church and were in holy orders (like Petrarch), while others were lawyers and chancellors of Italian cities, like Petrarch's disciple, Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence, and thus had access to book copying workshops.
One of the most remarkable poets of the early 19 and 20th century writers was [[Giacomo Leopardi]], who is widely acknowledged to be one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/115276/giacomo-leopardis-zibaldone-reviewed-adam-kirsch The Least Known Masterpiece of European Literature], New Republic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/leopardi/projects/index.aspx The Zibaldone project], University of Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italo Svevo]], the author of ''La coscienza di Zeno'' (1923), and [[Luigi Pirandello]] (winner of the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature), who explored the shifting nature of reality in his prose fiction and such plays as ''Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore'' (''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', 1921).
[[Federigo Tozzi]] and [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] were well-known novelists, critically appreciated only in recent years, and regarded one of the forerunners of [[existentialism]] in the European novel.

==Law and justice==
Since the Roman Empire, most western contributions to Western legal culture was the emergence of a class of Roman jurists. During the Middle Ages, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the most influential western scholar of the period, integrated the theory of natural law with the notion of an eternal and biblical law.&lt;ref&gt;Code of [[Canon Law]], Can. 252, §&amp;nbsp;3 [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt; During the Renaissance, Prof. [[Alberico Gentili]], the founder of the science of international law, authored the first treatise on public international law and separated secular law from canon law and Roman Catholic theology. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s greatest legal theorists, [[Cesare Beccaria]], [[Giambattista Vico]] and [[Francesco Mario Pagano]], are well remembered for their legal works, particularly on criminal law.
[[Francesco Carrara (jurist)|Francesco Carrara]], an advocate of abolition of the death penalty, was one of the foremost European criminal lawyers of the 19th century. During the last periods, numerous Italians have been recognised as the prominent prosecutor magistrates.

==Science and technology==
{{Main|Science and technology in Italy|List of Italian inventions}}

Italians have been the central figures of countless inventions and discoveries and they made many predominant contributions to various fields. During the [[Renaissance]], Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–72) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include the invention of the thermometer and key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]]. Other astronomers such as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]].
Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901–54), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that built the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. He and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]], including [[Emilio G. Segrè]] (1905–89) (who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]),&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Orlando, "Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the" New Tasks" of Physics in Italy." ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141-181. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27757806 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905–93), a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy. Other prominent physicists and scientists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Giulio Natta]] (the inventor of the first catalyst for the production of isotactic propylene and among the fathers of macromolecular chemistry, for which he won the Nobel prize for chemistry along with [[Karl Ziegler]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of the [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of the [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Antonio Meucci]] (known for developing a voice-communication apparatus, often credited as the inventor of the first [[telephone]] before even [[Alexander Graham Bell]]),&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/17/humanities.internationaleducationnews |location=London, UK|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Rory|last=Carroll|title=Bell did not invent telephone, US rules|date=17 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Several Italian encyclopaedias claim Meucci as the inventor of the telephone, including:

==Mathematics==
During the Middle Ages, [[Leonardo Fibonacci]], the greatest Western mathematician of the Middle Ages, introduced the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] to the Western World and he also introduced the sequence of [[Fibonacci number]]s which he used as an example in [[Liber Abaci]]. [[Gerolamo Cardano]], introduced the [[probability]] and established the [[binomial coefficients]] and [[binomial theorem]] and he also invented some essential onjects. During the Renaissance, [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world, published the first work on [[Double-entry bookkeeping system]]. [[Galileo Galilei]] made several significant advances in mathematics. [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s works anticipated [[integral calculus]] and popularized [[logarithms]] in Italy. [[Jacopo Riccati]], who was also a jurist, invented the [[Riccati equation]]. [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]], the first woman to write a mathematics handbook, become the first woman Mathematics Professor at a University. [[Gian Francesco Malfatti]], posed the problem of carving three circular columns out of a triangular block of marble, using as much of the marble as possible, and conjectured that three mutually-tangent circles inscribed within the triangle would provide the optimal solution, which are now known as [[Malfatti circles]]. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who was one of the most influential mathematician of his time, made essential works to [[analysis]], [[number theory]], and both classical and celestial mechanics. [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] invented the [[Tensor calculus]] and made meaningful works on algebra, infinitesimal analysis, and papers on the theory of [[real number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

From [[Italian folk music|folk music]] to [[European classical music|classical]], music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the [[symphony]], concerto, and [[sonata]], can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.
Italians invented many of the musical instruments, including the piano and violin.

Most notable Italians composers include the [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], the [[List of Baroque composers|Baroque composers]] [[Alessandro Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], the [[List of Classical era composers|Classical composers]] [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and the [[List of Romantic-era composers|Romantic composers]] [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], whose operas, including ''[[La bohème]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', and ''[[Turandot]]'', are among the most frequently worldwide performed in the [[List of important operas|standard repertoire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Alessandro Bonci]].

Introduced in the early 1920s, [[jazz]] took a particularly strong foothold among Italians, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the [[progressive rock]] movement of the 1970s, with bands like [[Premiata Forneria Marconi|PFM]] and [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]]. Italy was also an important country in the development of [[disco]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] music, with [[Italo disco]], known for its futuristic sound and prominent usage of synthesizers and [[drum machine]]s, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from [[Euro disco]] (which later went on to influence several genres such as [[Eurodance]] and [[Nu-disco]]).

Producers and songwriters such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], who won three [[Academy Award]]s for his music, were highly influential in the development of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] (electronic dance music). Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], which served as inspiration for the [[Eurovision]] song contest, and the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]]. Singers such as [[traditional pop|pop]] [[diva]] [[Mina (singer)|Mina]], classical crossover artist [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Grammy]] winner [[Laura Pausini]], and European chart-topper [[Eros Ramazzotti]] have attained international acclaim.

Italians have a long tradition in sport.
In numerous sports, both individual and team, Italy has been very successful.

[[Football in Italy|Association football]] is the most popular sport in Italy.
[[Italian national football team|Italy]] is one of the most successful national teams in association football having four [[FIFA World Cup]]s, one UEFA European Championship and one Olympic tournament.
Amongst the players who won the FIFA World Cup there are [[Giuseppe Meazza]], [[Silvio Piola]] (to date the highest goalscorer in Italian first league history), [[Dino Zoff]], [[Paolo Rossi]], [[Marco Tardelli]], [[Bruno Conti]], [[Gianluigi Buffon]], [[Fabio Cannavaro]], [[Alessandro Del Piero]], [[Andrea Pirlo]] and [[Francesco Totti]].
Amongst those who did not win the World Cup but laureated as European champions are [[Gianni Rivera]], [[Luigi Riva]] (to date Italy's leading scorer of all time), [[Sandro Salvadore]], [[Giacomo Bulgarelli]], [[Pietro Anastasi]] and [[Giacinto Facchetti]].
Other prominent players who achieved success at club level are [[Giampiero Boniperti]], [[Romeo Benetti]], [[Roberto Boninsegna]], [[Roberto Bettega]], [[Roberto Baggio]] and [[Paolo Maldini]].
Of the above-mentioned, the goalkeeper Dino Zoff, who served in the National team from 1968 to 1983, is to date the only Italian player to have won both the European championship (in 1968) and the FIFA World Cup (in 1982), apart from being the oldest winner ever of the World Cup.
At club level, to date Italy has won a total of 12 European Cup / Champions' Leagues, 9 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cups / UEFA Europa League]] and 7 [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]].

Motorcycle racers such as [[Giacomo Agostini]] and [[Valentino Rossi]] are recognized as some of the greatest sportstars of all time. [[Federica Pellegrini]], one of the few female swimmers to have set world records in more than one event has been one of the world's most successful swimmers. Italian athletes have won 549 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], and another 114 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. [[Jessica Rossi]] scored a [[Shooting sport]] world record of 75 in the qualification and a world record of 99. As for Olympic games, 663 Italians won medals, particularly in [[Swordsmanship]], which makes them the 6th most successful ethnic group in Olympic history. There are more than 2,000,000 Italian skiers in the world, most of them in the north and in the centre.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} Italian skiers received good results in the Winter Olympic Games, World Cup, and World Championships.

Italians are the second of the most who have won the [[World Cycling Championship]] more than any other country after [[Belgium]]. The [[Giro d'Italia]] is a world-famous long-distance cycling race held every May, and constitutes one of the three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]], along with the [[Tour de France]] and the [[Vuelta a España]], each of which last approximately three weeks.
[[Tennis]] has a significant following near courts and on television. Italian professional tennis players are almost always in the top 100 world ranking of male and female players. [[Beach tennis#Beach tennis with paddle racquet|Beach tennis with paddle racquet]] was invented by Italians, and is practised by many people across the country.
[[Volleyball]] is played by a lot of amateur players and professional players compete in the [[Italian Volleyball League]], regarded as the best and most difficult volleyball league in the world. The [[Italy national volleyball team|male]] and [[Italy women's national volleyball team|female]] national teams are often in the top 4 ranking of teams in the world.
[[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] is a popular sport for Italians, as the Italian World and Olympic champions are very celebrated people.
In [[wrestling]], one of the most remarkable wrestlers is [[Bruno Sammartino]], who held the record of the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWWF (World) Heavyweight Championship]] for over 11 years across two reigns, the first of which is the longest single reign in the promotion's history.

[[Rugby union]] was imported from France in the 1910s and has been regularly played since the 1920s; the [[Italy national rugby union team|National team]] has progressed slowly but significantly during the decades and thanks to the good results achieved in the second half of the 1990s, when they managed to beat historical teams like [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and eventually [[France national rugby union team|France]], Italy gained the admission to the Five Nation Championship, later renamed [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]]; Italy has taken part to the [[Rugby World Cup]] since its inauguration in 1987 and never missed an edition though to date has never gone past the group stage.

Most Italians originate from these two primary elements, and all share a common Latin heritage and history.

===Ancient history===
The Italians are a Southwestern European population, with origins predominantly from Southern and [[Western Europe]].

The earliest [[Human|modern humans]] inhabiting Italy are believed to have been [[Paleolithic]] peoples that may have arrived in the [[Italian Peninsula]] as early as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Italy is believed to have been a major Ice-age refuge from which Paleolithic humans later colonized Europe. Migrations from what is now Italy during the Paleolithic and [[Mesolithic]] link modern [[Italian Peninsula|Italians]] to the populations of much of [[Western Europe]] and particularly the [[British Isles]] and [[Atlantic Europe]].

The [[Neolithic]] colonization of Europe from [[Western Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] beginning around 10,000 years ago reached Italy, as most of the rest of the continent although, according to the [[demic diffusion]] model, its impact was most in the southern and eastern regions of the European continent.&lt;ref name=pmid15044595&gt;{{cite journal

Italy was, throughout the pre-Roman period, predominantly inhabited by [[Italic tribes]] who occupied the modern regions of [[Lazio]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Campania]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]], [[Apulia]] and [[Sicily]].

Beginning in the 8th century BC, Greeks arrived in Italy and founded cities along the coast of southern Italy and eastern Sicily, which became known as [[Magna Graecia]] ("Greater Greece").

The [[Gauls]] crossed the Alps and [[Roman-Gallic wars#Cisalpine|invaded northern Italy in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC]], settling in the area that became known as [[Cisalpine Gaul]] ("Gaul on this side of the Alps"). Although named after the Gauls, the region was mostly inhabited by indigenous tribes, namely the Ligures, Etruscans, Veneti and [[Euganei]].

John Murray: printed by Spottiswoode and Co., New-Street Square and Parliament Streetp. 661&lt;/ref&gt;—would go on to [[Roman conquest of Italy|conquer the whole Italian peninsula]]. During the Roman period hundreds of cities and colonies were established throughout Italy, including [[Florence]], [[Turin]], [[Como]], [[Pavia]], [[Padua]], [[Verona]], [[Vicenza]], [[Trieste]] and many others. Initially many of these cities were colonized by Latins, but later also included colonists belonging to the other Italic tribes who had become Latinized and joined to Rome. After the Roman conquest of Italy "the whole of Italy had become Latinized".&lt;ref&gt;M. Rostovtzeff, ''A History of the Ancient World: Rome'', Vol. II, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Cisalpine Gaul#Gallic expansion and Roman conquest|Roman conquest of Cisalpine Gaul]] and the widespread confiscations of Gallic territory, much of the Gaulish population was killed or expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred S.

These colonies included [[Bologna]], [[Modena]], [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Parma]], [[Piacenza]], [[Cremona]] and [[Forlì]]. According to [[Strabo]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The greater part of the country used to be occupied by the Boii, Ligures, Senones, and [[Gaesatae]]; but since the Boii have been driven out, and since both the Gaesatae and the Senones have been annihilated, only the Ligurian tribes and the Roman colonies are left."&lt;ref name="Strabo, 5.1.10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Boii]], the most powerful and numerous of the Gallic tribes, were expelled by the Romans after 191 BC and settled in [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 5.213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Roman rule, Sicily and Sardinia were conquered by the [[Vandals]], then by the Ostrogoths, and finally by the Byzantines. At one point, while Sardinia grew increasingly autonomous from Byzantine rule to the point of organizing itself into four sovereign Kingdoms or "Judgedoms" ([[Judicati]]) that would last until the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] conquest in the 15th century. In 687, Sicily became the Byzantine [[Sicily (theme)|Theme of Sicily]], during the course of the [[Arab–Byzantine wars|Arab-Byzantine wars]] Sicily gradually came became the [[Emirate of Sicily]] (831–1072). Later a series of conflicts with the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Normans]]; would bring about the establishment of the [[County of Sicily]], and eventually the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], the [[Lombards of Sicily]] (not to be confused with the ''Longobards''), coming from the [[Northern Italy]], settled in the central and eastern part of Sicily. After the marriage between the Norman [[Roger I of Sicily]] with [[Adelaide del Vasto]], descendant of [[Aleramici]] family, many Northern Italian colonisers (known collectively as ''Lombards'') left their homeland, in the Aleramici's possessions in [[Piedmont]] and [[Liguria]] (then known as ''Lombardy''), to settle on the island of Sicily.&lt;ref name="books.google.it"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IBspuVRwnUC&amp;pg=PA323 |title="Following the marriage to his third wife, Adelaide, from the Aleramici clan in Piedmont, many northern Italians (the sources refer to them as lombardi, as opposed to the longobardi from southern Italy) settled on the island of Sicily from the late Eleventh century onwards."|author1=G.

The geographical and cultural proximity with Southern Italy pushed Albanians to cross the [[Strait of Otranto]], especially after [[Skanderbeg]]'s death and the conquest of the [[Balkans]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. In defense of the Christian religion and in search of soldiers loyal to the Spanish crown, [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], also king of Naples, invited Arbereshe soldiers to move to Italy with their families. In return the king guaranteed to Albanians lots of land and a favourable taxation.

Arbereshe and Schiavoni were used to repopulate abandoned villages or villages whose population had died in earthquakes, plagues and other catastrophes. Albanian soldiers were also used to quell rebellions in Calabria.

Major Slavic colonies were in [[Friuli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picmediofriuli.it/enciclopedia/pdf/4.4.1.pdf|website=Picmediofriuli.it|format=PDF|accessdate=12 December 2017|title = Il popolamento slavo (PDF)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Veneto]], [[Marche]], [[Sicily]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europaorientalis.it/uploads/files/1983/1983.1.pdf|website=Europaorientalis.it|format=PDF|accessdate=12 December 2017|title = UN INSEDIAMENTO SLAVO PRESSO SIRACUSA NEL PRIMO MILLENNIO D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the [[Kingdom of Naples]] (including Apulia, [[Molise]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Calabria]], [[Terra di Lavoro]] and [[Campania]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Sprachwiss/slavistik/acqua/Resetar_Libro_completo1.pdf|website=Uni-konstanz.de|format=PDF|accessdate=12 December 2017|title = LE COLONIE SERBOCROATE DELL'ITALIA MERIDIONALE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] period, there were several waves of immigration of Albanians into Italy, in addition to another in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.arbitalia.it/storia/migrazioni.htm|website=Arbitalia.it|format=PDF|accessdate=12 December 2017|title=LE MIGRAZIONI DEGLI ARBERESHE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of these Albanian emigrants, many still retaining the [[Albanian language]], the [[Arbëresh language|Arbëresh]] dialect, have survived throughout Italy, numbering about 260,000 people,&lt;ref name="RhzMMTTdIC 2010, p. 18"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=31RhzMMTTdIC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB%20people Ethnobotany in the New Europe: People, Health and Wild Plant Resources, vol. 14, Manuel Pardo de Santayana, Andrea Pieroni, Rajindra K.

In this period, large groups of ethnic [[Bavarians]] and [[Swabians]] settled in the northern half of the country. Most of them were quickly assimilated in the native population.

Italian migration outside Italy took place, in different migrating cycles, for centuries.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Survey of World Migration|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521444057|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YbzsBPuhyggC&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22about%205%20million%20French%20nationals%20are%20of%20Italian%20origin%20if%20their%20parentage%20is%20retraced%20over%20three%20generations.%22 143]|authorlink=Robin Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]] in high numbers took place after its unification in 1861 and continued through 1914 with the emergence of the [[World War I|First World War]]. This rapid outflow and migration of Italian people across the globe can be attributed to factors such as the internal economic slump that emerged alongside its unification, family and the industrial boom that occurred in the world surrounding Italy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italy's Many Diasporas|last=Gabaccia|first=Donna|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge|pages=58–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moretti|first=Enrico|date=1999-01-01|title=Social Networks and Migrations: Italy 1876-1913|jstor=2547529|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=33|issue=3|pages=640–657|doi=10.2307/2547529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy after its unification did not seek nationalism but instead sought work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sadly, a unified state did not automatically constitute a sound economy. The global economic expansion, ranging from Britain's Industrial [[Industrial Revolution|Revolution]] in the late 18th and through mid 19th century, to the use of slave labor in the Americas did not hit Italy until much later (with the exception of the "industrial triangle" between [[Milan]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This lag resulted in a deficit of work available in Italy and the need to look for work elsewhere.The mass industrialization and urbanization globally resulted in higher labor mobility and the need for Italians to stay anchored to the land for economic support declined.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Moreover, better opportunities for work were not the only incentive to move; family played a major role and the dispersion of Italians globally.  Italians were more likely to migrate to countries where they had family established beforehand.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These ties are shown to be stronger in many cases than the monetary incentive for migration, taking into account a familial base and possibly an Italian migrant community, greater connections to find opportunities for work, housing etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, thousands of Italian men and women left Italy and dispersed around the world and this trend only increased as World War I approached.

Notably, it was not as if Italians had never migrated before, internal migration between North and Southern Italy before unification was common. Northern Italy caught on to the global industrialization sooner than Southern Italy, therefore it was considered more modern technologically, and tended to be inhabited by the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The View from Vesuvius Italian Culture and the Southern Question How did Southern Italy Become "The South"?|last=Moe|first=Nelson|publisher=University of California Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, rural and agro-intensive Southern Italy was seen as economically backward and was mainly populated by lower class peasantry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Given these disparities, prior to unification (and arguably after) the two sections of Italy, North and South were essentially seen by Italians and other nations as separate countries. So, migrating from one part of Italy to next could be seen as though they were indeed migrating to another country or even continent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Furthermore, large-scale migrations phenomena did not recede until the late 1920s, well into the Fascist regime, and one last wave can be observed after the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

Over 80 million people of full or part Italian descent live outside Europe, with over 60 million living in [[South America]] (mostly in [[Brazil]], which has the largest number of Italian descendants outside Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazil.org.uk/resources/documents/bs-primary03.pdf |title=Brazil - the Country and its People |publisher=www.brazil.org.uk |date= |accessdate=December 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021152752/http://www.brazil.org.uk/resources/documents/bs-primary03.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Argentina]], where over 62.5% of the population have at least one Italian ancestor)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://infouniversidades.siu.edu.ar/noticia.php?titulo=historias_de_inmigrantes_italianos_en_argentina&amp;id=1432#.U2cKkYHa70s |title=Historias de inmigrantes italianos en Argentina |date=14 November 2011 |author =Departamento de Derecho y Ciencias Políticas de la [[National University of La Matanza|Universidad Nacional de La Matanza]] |publisher=infouniversidades.siu.edu.ar |language=Spanish |quote=Se estima que en la actualidad, el 90% de la población argentina tiene alguna ascendencia europea y que al menos 25 millones están relacionados con algún inmigrante de Italia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 20 million living in North America ([[United States]] and [[Canada]]) and 1 million in Oceania ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]). Others live in other parts of Europe (primarily [[The United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]). Most Italian citizens living abroad live in other nations of the European Union.

In recent years, [[Italians in the United Arab Emirates|The United Arab Emirates]] has maintained a desirable destination for Italian immigrants, with the number of Italians leaving for the UAE having gone up 40% between 2005 and 2007. currently, over 10,000 Italians live in the United Arab Emirates.

Regarding the diaspora, there are many individuals of Italian descent who are possibly eligible for Italian citizenship by method of jus sanguinis which is from the Latin meaning "by blood." However, on a bases of just having Italian ancestry is not enough to qualify for Italian citizenship. To qualify, one must have at least one Italian born citizen ancestor who, after emigrating from Italy to another country, had passed citizenship onto their children before they naturalized as citizens of their newly adopted country. The Italian government does not have a rule regarding on how many generations born outside of Italy can claim Italian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://conssanfrancisco.esteri.it/consolato_sanfrancisco/en/i_servizi/per_i_cittadini/cittadinanza/citizenship-by-descent.html|title=Citizenship by descent|website=conssanfrancisco.esteri.it|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autochthonous Italian communities outside Italy==
{{Main|Istrian Italians|Dalmatian Italians|Swiss Italian|Italians of Crimea|Corsican people|Maltese Italians}}

In both the Slovenian and Croatian portions of [[Istria]], in Dalmatia as well as in the city of [[Rijeka]], Italian refers to autochthonous speakers of Italian and various [[Italo-Dalmatian languages]], natives in the region since before the inception of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. In the aftermath of the [[Istrian exodus]] following the Second World War, most Italian-speakers are today predominantly located in the west and south of Istria, and number about 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of inhabitants with Italian ancestry is likely much greater but undeterminable. In the first Austrian census carried out in 1870 the number of Italian Dalmatians varied between 40,000 and 50,000 amongst the about 250,000 inhabitants of [[Dalmatia]], or 20% of the total Dalmatian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the French [[County of Nice]], autochthonous speakers of regional languages of Italy ([[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] and [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]]), are natives in the region since before annexation to France in 1860. The number of inhabitants with Italian ancestry is generally indeterminable, and the use of [[French language]] is now ubiquitous. In addition, Corsica was a part of the [[Republic of Genoa]] until 1768 and most of the islanders still have a certain level of proficiency of [[Corsican language|Corsican]], a language of the Italo-Dalmatian family closely related to [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]. The Italian language ceased to have official status in Corsica in 1859&lt;ref&gt;Abalain, Hervé, (2007) ''Le français et les langues historiques de la France'', Éditions Jean-Paul Gisserot, pp.113&lt;/ref&gt; when it was supplanted by French and a process of de-Italianization was started by the French government in Corsica (and in 1861 the [[Nizzardo Italians|Nizzardo area]]).

A similar process happened in [[Malta]], where the [[Maltese Italians]] have practically disappeared in the last two centuries after Britain took control of the island during [[Napoleon]] times. However, the Italian language is today spoken and understood by 66% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europeans and their Languages |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf |website=European Commission |publisher=Special Eurobarometer |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss Italian is spoken as natively by about 350,000 people in the canton of [[Ticino]] and in the [[Italian Graubünden|southern part of Graubünden]] (Canton Grigioni). Swiss-Italian also refers to the Italian speaking population in this region (southern Switzerland) close to the border with [[Italy]]. Swiss Italian dialects are spoken in emigrant communities around the world, including in [[Swiss Italians of Australia|Australia]].

==Background and education==
He was born in the then [[Gulu District]], on 23 March 1965. He attended ''St. Joseph's College Layibi'', ''Dr. Obote College Boroboro'', and [[Kololo Senior Secondary School]] for his O-Level and A-Level education. In 1988, he joined [[Makerere University]], the oldest university in the [[East African Community]], where he studied agricultural economics. He graduated in 1991 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in that subject. That same year, he entered law school, also at Makerere University, graduating in 1994 with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree. He served as speaker of the university students' guild during his stay at Makerere. In 1995, he attended the [[Law Development Centre]] (LDC), where he obtained a [[Legal practice|postgraduate diploma in legal practice]].&lt;ref name="Speak"/&gt;

==Career==
Following his graduation from the LDC, Oulanyah worked as a lecturer at the centre. During the same timeframe, he began private law practice at the law firm of Oulanyah, Onoria &amp; Company Advocates.&lt;ref name="Speak"/&gt; In 2001, he entered politics by successfully contesting for the parliamentary seat of Omoro County in Gulu District under the no-party arrangement constitutionally referred to as the ''Movement Political System''. He was however a cardholder of the [[Uganda People's Congress]] (UPC). In 2005, he chaired the legal and parliamentary affairs committee that handled the constitutional amendment bill that proposed the lifting of the presidential term limits. He also participated in the peace talks between the [[government of Uganda]] and the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] rebels.&lt;ref name="Speak"/&gt; In 2006, standing as a UPC candidate, he lost his re-election bid. In July 2006, he quit the UPC and joined the ruling [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM). In 2008 he served as the chairman of the commission of inquiry into the controversial sub-lease of Kisekka Market, one of the municipal markets in the city of [[Kampala]]. In March 2011, Oulanyah was elected to represent Omoro County, Gulu District, in the Ninth Parliament, this time on the NRM ticket. He was elected as Deputy Speaker of Parliament on 19 May 2011.&lt;ref name="Speak"/&gt;

Following the [[Ugandan general election, 2016|February 2016 general election]], Oulanyah was re-elected as Deputy Speaker of Parliament on 19 May 2016. In the vote, conducted by secret ballot, he received 300 votes, while [[Mohammed Nsereko]] received 115.&lt;ref name="Speak"/&gt;

'''John Tucker "Chick" Hayward''' (15 November 1908 – 23 May 1999) was a [[World War II]] [[naval aviator]]. He helped develop one of the two [[atomic bomb]]s that was [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Japan in the closing days of the war]]. Later, he was a pioneer in the development of [[nuclear propulsion]], nuclear weapons, guidance systems for ground- and air-launched rockets, and underwater [[anti-submarine]] weapons. A former [[batboy]] for the [[New York Yankees]], Hayward dropped out of high school and lied about his age to enlist in the [[United States Navy]] at age 16. He was subsequently admitted to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at Annapolis, from which he graduated 51st in his class of 1930. He volunteered for naval aviation.

During World War II, he served at the [[Naval Aircraft Factory]] in Philadelphia, where he was involved in an effort to improve aircraft instrumentation, notably the compass and altimeter. He attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], and studied nuclear physics. In June 1942, he assumed command of a new patrol bomber squadron, VB-106, equipped with [[PB4Y-1 Liberator]]s, which he led in a daring raid on [[Wake Island]], in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], and in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]]. Returning to the United States in 1944, he was posted to the [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|Naval Ordnance Test Station]] at Inyokern, California, where he joined the [[Manhattan Project]], participating in [[Project Camel]], the development of the non-nuclear components of the [[Fat Man]] bomb, and in its drop testing.

After the war ended, he travelled to Hiroshima and Nagasaki as part of the  team investigating the bomb damage, and during [[Operation Crossroads]], he led the effort to photograph the nuclear explosion at the [[Bikini Atoll]]. In 1949, he assumed command of VC-5, the first naval nuclear bomber squadron. In March 1949, he took off from the carrier {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}} in the Atlantic in a [[Lockheed P2V Neptune]] bomber carrying a dummy [[Little Boy]] [[pumpkin bomb]], flew across the United States to make a simulated attack on a test site in California., and flew back to Patuxent River, where he landed after a total of 23 hours flying. In August 1950, he was at the controls of the first carrier landing and takeoff of an [[AJ-1 Savage]] heavy attack bomber.

From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward was head of the Military Applications Division of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], where he conducted atomic weapons laboratory work at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. In June 1953, he assumed command of the [[escort carrier]] {{USS|Point Cruz|CVE-119|6}}, and was involved in the rescue of a baby who was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. In June 1954, he became  the first naval aviator to command the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]], where he was involved with the development of the [[Mark 52 naval mine]] and the  [[Mark 90 nuclear bomb]], a nuclear [[depth charge]]. He was Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Research and Development, and then Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Development. In 1962 he assumed command of a carrier task force which included the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He commanded the Antisubmarine Warfare Force, Pacific Fleet, from 1963 to 1966, and then was president of the [[Naval War College]] from 1966 until 1968.

==Early life==
Hayward was born in [[New York City]] on November 15, 1908 one of eight children of Charles Brian and Rosa Hayward, née Valdetaro.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=1,5}} As a youngster, he was a [[batboy]] for the [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref name=postobit&gt;{{cite news |title=Vice Adm. John T. 'Chick' Hayward Dies at 90 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=29 May 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1925, he dropped out of high school at [[Loyola School (New York City)|Loyola School]] and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] by lying about his age, which at the time he believed to be only 15, and forging his father's signature on the papers.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/27/us/vice-adm-john-hayward-90-helped-design-bomb-for-nagasaki.html |title=Vice Adm. John Hayward, 90; Helped Design Bomb for Nagasaki |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 May 1999 |last=Honan |first=William H. |author-link=William H. Honan}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=1,5}} He soon acquired the nickname "Chick" from a [[bosun]] who asked "And how in did a little chick like you get in here amongst all these grown men?" The nickname would remain with him for the rest of his naval career.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=6}}

Hayward did his initial naval training at the [[Naval Station Newport]] at Newport, Rhode Island. He was encouraged by the Chaplain, Father John J. Brady, to try for admission to [[United States Naval Academy]] at Annapolis. Brady arranged for Hayward to be sent to the [[Naval Academy Preparatory School]] in Norfolk, Virginia, to study for the entrance exams. During [[World War I]], some one-hundred presidential appointments to Annapolis had been set aside for enlisted sailors, but few had applied, and fewer still had passed the entrance exams. Of the 119 sailors who sat the exams in 1926, only 19 passed, one of whom was Hayward. He entered Annapolis in August 1926,{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=8–12}} and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on graduation in June 1930, ranking 51st in his class of 406.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=17}}

After graduation, Hayward volunteered for naval aviation, and learned to fly in a [[Consolidated NY]] seaplane at [[Naval Air Station Hampton Roads]]. A tour of sea duty on the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Richmond|CL-9|6}}  followed,{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=18–19}} after which he was posted to the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] to complete his flight training. He received his aviator's wings in July 1932.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=29}}  While there he met a local woman, Leila Marion (Lili) Hyer, and the two were married at St John's Church in [[Warrington, Florida]] on 15 October 1932. {{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=35–39}}  Their marriage would produce five children.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Hayward was posted to a scout bombing squadron, VS-1B, flying [[Vought SBU Corsair]]s, on the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}} on the West Coast, and was soon promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]], but owing to government austerity measures, was not paid as such.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=35–39, 43}} In 1935, the squadron was transferred to the {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}. Coming in for a landing, a fuel line on his aircraft broke, spraying him with fuel and damaging his left eye. After he recovered, and his flight status was restored, he was sent to VP-2, which was stationed in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], flying [[Martin PM]] patrol aircraft.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=49–53}} Following a two-year tour there, he was assigned to the [[SON Seagull]] detachment aboard the newly commissioned cruiser {{USS|Philadelphia|CL-41|6}}, where he was promoted to [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] on 30 June 1937. He then repeated the procedure of commissioning the aircraft detachment of a new cruiser on another ship of the same class, the {{USS|Phoenix|CL-46|6}} in 1938.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=63–67}}

==World War II==

===Pacific Theater===
[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|thumb|right|A Navy PB4Y bomber]]
Hayward was posted to the [[Naval Aircraft Factory]] in Philadelphia in June 1940, where he continued graduate studies at [[Temple University]] that he had begun in 1937, and then attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], where he studied nuclear physics. At the Naval Aircraft Factory, he was involved in an effort to improve aircraft instrumentation, notably the compass and altimeter. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] in January 1942.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=74–75, 79–80, 84}}

In June 1942, Hayward assumed command of a new patrol bomber squadron, VB-106, equipped with [[PB4Y-1 Liberator]]s. He was promoted to [[Commander (United States)|commander]] in August 1942. VB-106 trained in Hawaii,{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=92–94}} and flew its first combat mission against [[Wake Island]] in October 1943. For this mission, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. His citation read:{{quote|For extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight as Squadron Commander of a Heavy Bombing Squadron during the attack by U.S. Naval Forces against Wake Island on 5 October 1943. He led the attack by his squadron and personally directed the operations against enemy objectives during which time he successfully and effectively bombed, strafed enemy installations, and obtained many valuable photographs of the island in the face of intense anti-aircraft fire. His aggressive and skillful leadership and constant devotion to duty contributed directly to the success of this action against the enemy and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref name="medals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=55752 |title=Valor Awards for John Tucker Hayward |publisher= Military Times |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hayward was awarded a second Distinguished Flying Cross on the recommendation of [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Arleigh Burke]] for leading his squadron in the [[South Pacific Area]].{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=106}} His citation read:{{quote|For extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight against the enemy as Commanding Officer of a Navy Bombing Squadron operating in the South Pacific area from 8 November 1943 to 24 February 1944. During this period, Commander Hayward completed many combat and search missions over Japanese territory, frequently encountering heavy anti-aircraft fire. Several of the missions were made, despite adverse weather conditions. On 8 November while on a routine search, he bombed Kapingimarangi Island, scoring four direct hits on an enemy bivouac area. On 20 and 31 December and 8 January he bombed, strafed and sank enemy supply barges on each occasion. On 24 February, his efficient spotting enabled our destroyers to destroy three Japanese cargo vessels in Kavieng Harbor. His superior airmanship and outstanding leadership contributed materially to the success of the squadron in inflicting severe damage on the Japanese forces in the area. His courageous conduct was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref name="medals"/&gt;}}

In March 1944, VB-106 was transferred to [[Nadzab]] in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]], where it came under the command of the [[Fifth Air Force]]. It thus served in three different theaters in the Pacific.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=106}} Hayward was awarded a third Distinguished Flying Cross:{{quote|For extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight from 13 April 1944 to 23 April 1944. Captain Hayward completed twenty flights in a combat area where enemy anti-aircraft fire was expected to be effective or where enemy aircraft patrols usually occurred.&lt;ref name="medals"/&gt;}} He was also awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] with the [[valor device]]:{{quote|for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Commanding Officer of Bombing Squadron One Hundred Six (VB-106), in connection with operations against enemy Japanese forces in the Pacific Ocean Area from 25 March to 1 June 1944. During this period, Captain Hayward successfully carried out three hundred and five long-range search operations, armed reconnaissance and offensive strikes against the enemy. His competent leadership, professional skill and initiative were contributing factors in the success of his squadron in sinking twelve enemy cargo vessels and thirteen barges; and in shooting down twelve aircraft and damaging three in aerial combat. Captain Hayward's aggressiveness and unwavering devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref name="medals"/&gt;}}

Somewhat depleted in both aircraft and aircrews, VB-106 handed over its three PB4Ys with the least hours on the clock to its relief, VB-115, on 27 May 1944, and returned to the United States.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=110}}

===Manhattan Project===
Hayward's next posting was to the [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|Naval Ordnance Test Station]] at Inyokern, California. Initially he was involved with test firing rockets from various aircraft, including the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] and the twin engine [[Grumman F7F Tigercat]]. Once his security clearance was complete, he was assigned to the [[Manhattan Project]]. He participated in [[Project Camel]], the development of the non-nuclear components of the [[Fat Man]] bomb, and in its drop testing. This involved flying the four engine [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]. {{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=115–117, 125–126, 132–135}} After the war ended, he travelled to Hiroshima and Nagasaki as part of the Manhattan Project team investigating the bomb damage.&lt;ref name=postobit/&gt; He was promoted to captain on 10 December 1945.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=147}} During [[Operation Crossroads]], he led the effort to photograph the nuclear explosion at the [[Bikini Atoll]].&lt;ref name=postobit/&gt;

==Post war==

===Nuclear weapons===
After a series of clashes with his superior at Inyokern, Captain James B. Sykes, Hayward left to become the Director for Plans and Operations for Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] on 1 August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Toledo Blade |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19480717&amp;id=v_YjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RgAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1983,4829159 |title=Detection of Atom Bomb in Russia Held Difficult |date=17 July 1948 |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=157–158, 181}} On 1 January 1948, he was reduced in rank to commander again. The Air Force offered a commission as a brigadier general, and [[Convair]] offered a job working on the [[SM-65 Atlas]] missile, but Hayward elected to stay in the navy. He participated in the [[Operation Sandstone]] nuclear tests in the Pacific in April 1948.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=163–164}}

[[File:P2V-3 CVB-41 launch 1949.jpg|thumb|left|A P2V takes off from {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}} using [[JATO]] on 21 April 1950]]
After World War II, the US Navy sought to acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]] wanted them to operate from aircraft carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the [[Lockheed P2V Neptune]] for carrier operations using [[jet-assisted takeoff]] (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller [[Little Boy]] bomb; it could only be operated by the large [[Midway class aircraft carrier|''Midway'' class aircraft carriers]], which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no [[tailhook]], so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=166–167}}

On 28 April 1948, two P2Vs were launched from a carrier, the {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}, for the first time.&lt;ref name=navysite/&gt; The intention was that each of the three ''Midway''-class carriers would have a nuclear attack squadron.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=169}} The first of these, Composite (Heavy Attack) Squadron 5 (VC-5) was formed at [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Moffett Field]], California, on 9 September 1948, with Commander [[Frederick Ashworth|Frederick L.

Hayward was promoted to captain again on 19 February 1949.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=169}} On 7 March, he took off ''Coral Sea'' in the Atlantic in a P2V carrying a dummy Little Boy [[pumpkin bomb]], and flew across the United States to make a simulated attack on the Salton Sea test site near [[El Centro, California]]. He then flew to Patuxent River, where he landed after a total of 23 hours flying.&lt;ref name=navysite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navysite.de/cvn/cv43.htm |title=USS Coral Sea (CV 43) |accessdate=11 June 2009 |last=Doehring |first=Thoralf |publisher=Thoralf Doehring}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=183}}  Hayward had tailhooks fitted to a pair of P2Vs, and made practice landings on a carrier deck painted on the ground at [[NAS Patuxent River]], Maryland, He made some touch and go passes at the {{USS|Franklin D. Roosevelt|CV-42|6}}, but a carrier landing was considered too dangerous for regular crews to attempt.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=184, 188}}

The P2Vs would be first augmented, and then replaced, by the more capable [[North American AJ Savage]] as they became available. These could take off and land on a carrier, carrying a Fat Man.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=167–169}} On 21 August 1950, Hayward was at the controls of the first carrier landing and takeoff of an [[AJ-1 Savage]] heavy attack bomber, on the ''Coral Sea'' with the Commander of Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet (COMAIRLANT), Vice Admiral [[Felix Stump]], in the back seat. However, by mid-December VC-5 still only had six AJ-1s.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=192–194}}

From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward was head of the Military Applications Division of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], where he conducted atomic weapons laboratory work at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. He also worked on the foundation of the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] program in 1952 in close collaboration with [[Edward Teller]].{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=197–202}} The culmination of this was working on the [[Ivy Mike]] nuclear test.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=206–207}}

===''Point Cruz''===
In June 1953, Hayward took command of the [[escort carrier]] {{USS|Point Cruz|CVE-119|6}}. He confessed to the crew that he did not know what he was doing, and urged any crewman who felt he was doing something wrong to tell him so at once.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=210–211}} At the end of the [[Korean War]], the carrier was deployed at [[Incheon|Inchon]], where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent ''Point Cruz'''s chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in Korea.&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite news |title=After 54 years, this 'baby' is still in the hearts of the Sailors who 'adopted' him |publisher=[[Pensacola News Journal]] |date=14 September 2007 |author=Thrower, Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward is said to have told the chaplain: "You are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby."&lt;ref name=pi&gt;{{cite news |title=A Tale Made for Hollywood – From Wartime to Ephrata, Orphan's Odyssey Recounted |author=Jamieson, Robert L. Jr. |date=5 July 1997 |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |pages=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayward is credited with putting his naval career "on the line" by bringing the baby on the ship, which was against regulations, and he subsequently received orders to get the baby off the ship.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; However, having a baby on board boosted sailors' morale, and Hayward later said that a leader must "know when to intelligently disregard regulations."&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; A visa was obtained by intervention of [[Richard Nixon]]'s staffers, and a passport was secured by winning a poker game against the South Korean who issued passports. The baby, adopted by Navy surgeon Hugh Keenan, who was also in port at Inchon, was later named Daniel, and was transferred to a civilian ship in Japan. Daniel Keenan was raised in Seattle and began attending reunions of the crew of the ''Point Cruz'' in 1993.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; The story of Daniel Keenan was made into a television movie, ''A Thousand Men and a Baby'', which aired on [[CBS]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tough guys fall for cute 'Baby' |date=5 December 1997 |publisher=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |author=Grahnke, Lon |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:TaskForce One.jpg|right|thumb|{{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|2}} and {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}} in 1964]]
Hayward assumed command of the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] at [[White Oak, Maryland]] in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the previous commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the [[Mark 52 naval mine]], an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=210–211}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mk 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 and 57 Mines and Depth Bombs (United States) – Jane's Air-Launched Weapons |url=http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Air-Launched-Weapons/Mk-52-53-54-55-56-and-57-Mines-and-Depth-Bombs-United-States.html |publisher=[[Jane's]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the [[Mark 90 nuclear bomb]], a nuclear [[depth charge]], which was tested during [[Operation Wigwam]] in May 1955.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=228–232}}

From a naval career point of view, Hayward's most notable drawback was his lack of time in command of a ship at sea. Admiral Arleigh Burke, now Chief of naval Operations, arranged for Hayward to be given command of the aircraft carrier ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'' in February 1956. This would normally be the climax of  naval aviator's career, but that year he was selected for promotion to rear admiral.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=232–233}} His record of 13,200 flight hours was the highest ever achieved by a [[flag officer]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; On 7 January 1957, he was assigned to the office of the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Operations.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=241–243}} In October, he became Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Research and Development. The very public failure of [[Project Vanguard]] resulted in Hayward being called to appear before a Congressional Committee, where he was grilled by its chairman, Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=249–251}} The post was upgraded to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Development in 1959, and he was promoted to vice admiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810946,00.html |title=Armed Forces: Call for Test Pilots |newspaper=[[Time magazine]] |date=13 April 1959 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed the development of a number of new weapons systems, including the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] and the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. Between 1959 and 1961, Defense expenditure on research and development grew from $525 million (roughly equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|525000000|1959|r=2}}}} in 20{{CURRENTYEARYY}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to $4 billion (roughly equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|4000000000|1961|r=2}}}} in 20{{CURRENTYEARYY}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=254–258}}

In 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] offered Hayward four stars and the job of [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]]. Hayward turned it down, accepting a demotion to rear admiral on 9 March 1962 to take command of Carrier Division 2, which included the nuclear-powered ''Enterprise'' {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|2}}, {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}} and {{USS|Truxtun|CGN-35|2}}.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=264–265}} In October 1962, his ships participated in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=272–273}} In June 1963, he was restored to the rank of vice admiral, which was backdated to 25 April 1959, the day he had first been promoted.{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=314}} He commanded the Antisubmarine Warfare Force, Pacific Fleet, from 13 June 1963 to 12 January 1966, for which he was awarded the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] for his "leadership, judgment and foresight in research and development associated with antisubmarine warfare and the training of Antisubmarine Warfare Groups during his tenure of command.&lt;ref name="medals"/&gt;

Hayward was president of the [[Naval War College]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] from 1966 until 1968. He strove to transform the Naval War College into the Navy's premier postgraduate school, one from which graduation would fit officers for, and mark them out as future flag officers. Heading a captain's selection board in May 1967, he disapproved of two officers with spotless records. "You mean they never argued, never had a difference of opinion?" he remarked. "What kind of man is that?"{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|pp=285–289}}

Hayward was awarded a second Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his service as president of  Naval War College.&lt;ref name="medals"/&gt; He retired in 1968, but returned to serve to duty as a rear admiral from November 1970 to December 1971 as Commander, [[14th Naval District]], Commander Fleet Air Hawaii and Commander, Naval Base Pearl Harbor. His responsibilities included "the planning, training and execution of highly successful recoveries of [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] spacecraft in the Mid-Pacific",  for which he was awarded a third [[Legion of Merit]].&lt;ref name="medals"/&gt;

==Later life==
After retiring from the Navy, Hayward worked for [[General Dynamics]] as a vice president for international programs until 1973, and then as a consultant until 1979. He then worked with the [[Draper Laboratory]] and the [[Hertz Foundation]].{{sfn|Hayward|Borklund|2000|p=292}} He became an [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] Fellow in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=249&amp;lugradecode=MD&amp;showall=1 |title=Past Recipients |publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] |accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the [[Naval Aviation Hall of Honor]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Hayward was part of a team of scientists sent to investigate the origins of the [[Shroud of Turin]] in [[Vatican City]]. Speaking of the venture at the Naval War College in 1982, he said that the evidence collected convinced him that the shroud was in fact used to bury Christ. However, he spoke only for himself and not the entire team. According to the majority of the team, the image on the shroud was formed by "a combination of heat and light" and was not painted. Hayward decided that further research into the age of the shroud via [[Carbon-14 dating]] was needed but Church authorities would not permit this to happen at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/161091858/|title=Expert says Resurrection Made Images |accessdate=27 August 2016|newspaper=[[The News Journal]]|page=19|date=25 November 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hayward died of cancer on 23 May 1999 in Atlantic Beach, Florida, and was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], along with his wife Leila, who had died the year before. He was survived by his son and four daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jhayward.htm |title=John T.

'''Jonathan Wayne Perry''', known as '''JP Perry''' (born January 27, 1973), is the District 4F judge on the [[Louisiana Circuit Courts of Appeal|Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Third Circuit]]. Perry ran unopposed for the judgeship in the November 6, 2018 [[primary election]], held in conjunction with [[general election]]s for [[Congress]] in the forty-nine other states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Louisiana_intermediate_appellate_court_elections,_2018|title=Louisiana intermediate appellate court elections, 2018|publisher=Ballotpedia.org|accessdate= November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry assumes the post on January 1, 2019.

Earlier from 2011 to 2018, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senate]] for District 26 ([[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana|Vermilion]] and portions of [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia]], [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette]], and [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry]] parishes in south [[Louisiana]]. Previously from 2008 to 2011, he was the [[Louisiana State Legislature|state representative]] for District 47 (Vermilion and [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron]] parishes), Perry won a [[special election]] for the state Senate held on February 19, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acadiaparishtoday.com/bookmark/11517746 Jonathan Perry Elected] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075626/http://acadiaparishtoday.com/bookmark/11517746 |date=July 7, 2011 }} ''Acadia Parish Today.com'' February 19, 2011. Retrieved February 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate vacancy occurred with the resignation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Nick Gautreaux]], who accepted an appointment from Republican then [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] to head the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref name=brma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/La-Senate-race-on-ballot.html|title=La.

==Background==

Perry graduated in 1991 from Kaplan High School in his native [[Kaplan, Louisiana|Kaplan]] in Vermilion Parish, [[Louisiana]], where he still resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house.legis.state.la.us/H_Reps/members.asp?ID=47|title=Jonathan W. Perry|publisher=house.legis.state.la.us|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[sociology]] and [[criminal justice]] from the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] in [[Ouachita Parish, Louisiana|Ouachita Parish]]. Thereafter, he procured a [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[historically black]] [[Southern University Law Center]] in Baton Rouge though Perry is white.&lt;ref name=vsmart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=93854|title=Representative Jonathan W. Perry (LA)|publisher=votesmart.org|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wed his high school sweetheart, the former Christine LeBeouf, and the couple has four children, Molli, Meredith, Major, and Marlee.&lt;ref name=perry/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=June 2017}} Perry is a former sergeant on the Kaplan city police force who formerly was a member of the Kaplan City Council. While studying law, he served on the Kaplan City Council, the youngest person in that position in the history of his city.&lt;ref name=perrybio/&gt; He is also a former assistant district attorney for the 15th Judicial District, which covers Acadia, Lafayette, and Vermilion parishes.&lt;ref name=perrybio/&gt;

==House service==

Representative Perry served on the House committees of (1) Administration of Criminal Justice, (2) Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture and Rural Development, and (3) Ways and Means. He was the chairman of the House [[Acadiana]] delegation and a member of the Louisiana Rural Caucus.&lt;ref name="vsmart"/&gt; Perry serves on the Louisiana Commission on Family and Marriage, the Louisiana Energy Council, and the Governor's Task Force on D.W.I. and Vehicular Homicide.&lt;ref name=perry/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=June 2017}}

Perry holds a 100 percent rating from the Louisiana [[Right to Life]] Committee.&lt;ref name=vsmart/&gt; Since 2008, he has been named "Outstanding Family Advocate" by the [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[Louisiana Family Forum]]. In 2009, he received that organization's "Life and Liberty Award".&lt;ref name=perry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perry4louisiana.com/about.html|title=About Jonathan Perry|publisher=perry4louisiana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=June 2017}} He also carries a 100 percent rating from the [[trade association]], the [[Louisiana Association of Business and Industry]].&lt;ref name=devney/&gt;

In April 2018, Perry was one of ten senators who voted against criminalizing sexual abuse of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1084427|title=SBS 3rd Reading and Final Passage SBS 236 By Morrell Crime/Punishment Final Passage Roll Call|last=|first=|date=April 9, 2018|website=Louisiana State Legislature|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413180130/http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1084427|archive-date=April 13, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senate election==

Perry defeated the Democrat Nathan Charles Granger (born January 23, 1968), a member of the Vermilion Parish Police Jury from [[Erath, Louisiana|Erath]], who owns two oilfield service companies.&lt;ref name=brma/&gt; Perry received 10,179 votes (52 percent) to Granger's 9,491 (48 percent). Perry's 53-47 percent margin in his own Vermilion Parish, where the majority of the ballots were cast in the race, proved decisive to his election. The voter turnout was nearly 36 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/graphical/ |title=Special election returns, February 19, 2011 |publisher=electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov |accessdate=February 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904033849/http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/graphical/ |archivedate=September 4, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Louisiana blog ''The Dead Pelican'' reported near the end of the Senate campaign that Granger's campaign manager was from [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], not Louisiana, and in 2008 had organized supporters of [[U.S. Senator]] [[Barack Obama]], the Democratic [[U.S. President|presidential]] nominee from [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name=devney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehayride.com/2011/02/perry-granger-race-turns-ugly-as-final-days-unfold/|title=Perry-Granger Race Turns Ugly As Final Days Unfold, February 17, 2011|publisher=thehayride.com|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granger reported having raised $310,000 for the campaign and ran advertising accusing Perry of having voted to gut higher education and failure to have prosecuted a seven-time DWI offender while Perry was an assistant district attorney.&lt;ref name=devney/&gt; In an interview on ''[[Moon Griffon|The Moon Griffon Show]]'' talk radio program based from Monroe on February 17, 2011, Granger called himself a conservative and denied that he had the support of Obama in the special election.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moon Griffon Show'', February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Records also reveal that Granger contributed to two Republican candidates from his area, former State Senator [[Craig Romero]] and former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jeff Landry]], the current [[Attorney General of Louisiana|state attorney general]], both of [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]].&lt;ref name=devney/&gt;

He landed a few parts, playing tough guys on ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'' and ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0600800}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he described as "forgettable" TV roles, before deciding on the career change.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; He also worked as one of [[Casting (performing arts)|casting director]] [[Caro Jones]]' first office assistants early in her career.&lt;ref name=hr&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mike |last=Barnes |title=Casting director Caro Jones dies |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3ia3f2289d03ed2216bd37db0541b79990 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 10, 2009|access-date=September 20, 2009|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002303/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3ia3f2289d03ed2216bd37db0541b79990 |archivedate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 1993, he was [[president (corporate title)|president]] at Lorimar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-11/business/fi-2655_1_leslie-moonves|title= Moonves Takes Over Helm of Lorimar|author=John Lippman|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date =October 11, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1993, he became president/[[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Warner Bros.

In February 2005, Moonves was identified as the executive directly responsible for ordering the cancellation of [[UPN]]'s ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' and the ending of the 18-year revival of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television franchise.&lt;ref name="Trek Today"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.trektoday.com/news/020205_04.shtml|title= UPN Cancels 'Star Trek: Enterprise'|publisher= Trektoday.com|date= February 2, 2005|access-date= November 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Moonves helped make the deal that brought together the CBS-owned [[UPN|United Paramount Network]] (UPN) with [[The WB|The WB Television Network]] to form [[The CW|The CW Television Network]] that fall.

Moonves was the second-most highly-paid director for 2012 and 2013: he received $58.8 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capital.fr/carriere-management/actualites/les-grands-patrons-de-mieux-en-mieux-payes-aux-etats-unis-843619|title=Les grands patrons de mieux en mieux payés aux Etats-Unis|author=Prisma Media|date=May 16, 2013|work=Capital.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $65.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ceo-compensation-histogram-chart-2014-5|title=CEO Compensation Histogram Chart&amp;nbsp;— Business Insider|date=May 28, 2014|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered the second-highest paid CEO, having been paid $68.4 million in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CBS investigating sexual misconduct claims against CEO Les Moonves |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/cbs-moonves-sexual-misconduct-1.4765291 |access-date=July 28, 2018 |work=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |agency=The Associated Press |date=July 27, 2018 |quote=Moonves was the No. 2 highest paid CEO of a major public company in 2017, according to an analysis by The Associated Press and Equilar, an executive data firm.

Of the tone of the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Republican presidential campaign]] and the [[advertising]] dollars it delivered, Moonves said, "It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS." He added, "[[Donald Trump|Donald]]'s place in this election is a good thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bond|first1=Paul|title=Leslie Moonves on Donald Trump: "It May Not Be Good for America, but It's Damn Good for CBS"|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=March 17, 2016|date=February 29, 2016|quote=he likes the ad money Trump and his competitors are bringing to the network.

In September 2018, following allegations of sexual assault against him, it was reported that CBS was negotiating a $100 million exit package for Moonves and that CBS Chief Operating Officer Joe Ianniello would serve as his interim replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/cbs-board-in-negotiations-for-ceo-moonves-exit-from-the-company-sources.html|title=CBS board offering CEO Moonves $100 million in stock as exit package: Sources|last=Faber|first=David|date=|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 2018, CBS Corporation announced he had resigned and Joe Iannello would become interim CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/leslie-moonves-departs-cbs-ceo-chairman-financial-package-withheld-pending-investigation/|title=Leslie Moonves departs as chief of CBS, financial package to be withheld pending investigation|last=|first=|date=|work=CBS News|access-date=September 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moonves and CBS will donate $20 million to the #MeToo movement that will be deducted from any severance benefits Moonves may be owed, the company said. The donation to charities promoting women’s equality in the workplace will come upon the conclusion of an independent investigation into the allegations, according to the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/cbs-les-moonves-out_us_5b5b4455e4b0de86f496be08|title=Les Moonves Leaves CBS, Will Make $20 Million Donation To Me Too Movement|date=9 September 2018|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Howard Stern litigation===
In February 2006, Moonves led CBS to file a $500 million lawsuit against [[Howard Stern]] for allegedly breaching his contract by failing to disclose the details of his deal with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] while still employed by [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]]. Stern vowed to fight the suit, and said on his radio program that Moonves and CBS were trying to "bully" him and his agent, Don Buchwald. Stern later appeared on CBS' own ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', wearing a shirt mocking Moonves and his wife. In June 2006, Stern announced that the lawsuit had been settled. As part of the settlement, Sirius acquired the exclusive rights to all of the [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] tapes (over two decades' worth of shows) for $2 million.

===ZeniMax Media===
Moonves has been on the board of [[ZeniMax Media]] since its foundation in 1999, alongside his friend and ZeniMax president [[Ernest Del]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/24/arts/kick-starting-kapow-tv-series-cbs-broke-all-rules-fling-action-show-young-men.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=James | last=Sterngold | title=Kick-Starting (Kapow!) a TV Series; CBS Broke All the Rules to Fling an Action Show at Young Men | date=September 24, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moonves' personal investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/05/30/zenimax-media-raises-99-million-from-some-big-names/|title=ZeniMax Media raises $9.9 million from some big names&amp;nbsp;— VentureBeat&amp;nbsp;— Deals&amp;nbsp;— by Dean Takahashi|work=venturebeat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the company has been noted, as well as his appearances at several launch parties, including for [[Bethesda Softworks]]' ''[[Fallout 3]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', and ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/rRCFcwbE50Z/Rage+Video+Game+Launch/reua5-El2QE/Leslie+Moonves|title=Leslie Moonves Pictures&amp;nbsp;— "Rage" Video Game Launch&amp;nbsp;— Zimbio|work=Zimbio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, [[The New Yorker|''The New Yorker'']] published an article by [[Ronan Farrow]] saying that six women accuse Moonves of harassment and intimidation, and dozens have described abuse at CBS.&lt;ref name="newyorker-farrow"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Farrow |first=Ronan |date=August 6, 2018|title=Les Moonves and CBS Face Allegations of Sexual Misconduct |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/06/les-moonves-and-cbs-face-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en-US |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moonves was subsequently placed under investigation by the CBS board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flint |first1=Joe |last2=Hagey |first2=Keach |title=CBS to Investigate Allegations of Sexual Harassment Against CEO Moonves |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbs-board-to-investigate-allegations-of-misconduct-by-ceo-leslie-moonves-1532708699 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Bucknell University [[Memory_hole|removed references]] to Moonves on its website, and University of Southern California suspended Moonves' name from its Media Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=USC Annenberg suspends use of Les Moonves' name on media center |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usc-annenberg-suspends-use-of-cbs-ceo-les-moonves-name-on-media-center/ |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=CBS News |agency=The Associated Press |date=August 2, 2018 |quote=Moonves' alma mater, Bucknell University, has also removed some references to him from its website.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, [[The New Yorker|''The New Yorker'']] reported that six more women (in addition to the six original women reported in July) had raised accusations against Moonves, going back to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ronan Farrow |title=As Leslie Moonves Negotiates His Exit from CBS, Women Raise New Assault and Harassment Claims |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/as-leslie-moonves-negotiates-his-exit-from-cbs-women-raise-new-assault-and-harassment-claims |accessdate=September 9, 2018 |work=The New Yorker |quote=Six additional women are now accusing Moonves of sexual harassment or assault in incidents that took place between the nineteen-eighties and the early aughts. They include claims that Moonves forced them to perform oral sex on him, that he exposed himself to them without their consent, and that he used physical violence and intimidation against them. A number of the women also said that Moonves retaliated after they rebuffed him, damaging their careers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after resigning as CEO of CBS, Moonves released a statement denying all of the sexual misconduct allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/latest-cbs-leslie-moonves-resigns-amid-allegations-000714973.html|title=The Latest: CBS' Leslie Moonves denies wrongdoing|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article in which actress [[Bobbie Phillips]] alleges that Moonves sexually assaulted her during the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/business/les-moonves-bobbie-phillips-marv-dauer-cbs-severance.html|title=‘If Bobbie Talks, I’m Finished’: How Les Moonves Tried to Silence an Accuser|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public appearances==
On April 7, 2003, Moonves portrayed himself in an episode of ''[[The Practice]]''. From early 2004 until its end in May 2015, Moonves made regular appearances on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. One of these came when [[David Letterman|Letterman]] declared outrage that CBS featured his late-night competitor [[Jay Leno]] in an ad for CBS's telecast of the [[People's Choice Awards]]. Letterman jokingly warned the "CBS stooge in the control room" to call his buddies "before things turn ugly"; Moonves obliged. Later appearances took the same format, with Letterman discussing current events and the CBS network with the company's CEO.

On the March 23, 2015 premiere episode of ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]'', Moonves portrayed himself as the head of CBS who sends out a golden ticket granting whoever finds it a chance to host ''[[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'', in an homage to ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. Moonves also appeared on the September 8, 2015 premiere of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', operating a large switch he could use to switch back to [[CBS Summer Showcase|reruns]] of ''[[The Mentalist]]'' if he was unhappy with the new program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4026215/stephen-colbert-les-moonves/|title=Watch Stephen Colbert Joke With CEO of CBS About Canceling His Show|first=Justin|last=Worland|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time.com]]|date=September 9, 2015|access-date=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, although his divorce from Nancy was not yet finalized, Moonves began dating [[Julie Chen]],  [[CBS]]' ''[[The Early Show]]'' reporter and host of the reality series ''[[Big Brother (U.S. TV series)|Big Brother]]''.&lt;ref name="Reality TV World"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/big-brother-host-julie-chen-marries-cbs-president-les-moonves-3150.php|title= 'Big Brother' host Julie Chen marries CBS president Les Moonves|publisher= Realitytvworld.com| date = December 29, 2004|access-date= November 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2004, Moonves got a court to grant an early divorce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/moonves-i-want-get-my-life|title=Moonves: "I Want To Get On With My Life"|work=The Smoking Gun}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a motion citing a "desire to return to the status of being single".

===Philanthropy===
In 2015, Moonves and Chen made a major donation to University of Southern California, resulting in a media center being named the "Julie Chen/Leslie Moonves and CBS Media Center."  Moonves was already a USC School of Cinematic Arts' board of councilors member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=BRIAN LOWRY |title=USC Media Center Named For CBS’ Leslie Moonves, Julie Chen |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/usc-media-center-named-for-cbs-leslie-moonves-julie-chen-1201440766/#! |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=Variety |date=February 25, 2015 |quote=Moonves attended Bucknell University and is a member of the USC School of Cinematic Arts’ Board of Councilors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Moonves was a University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=USC Annenberg Media Center Named for Julie Chen, Leslie Moonves |url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/usc-annenberg-media-center-named-for-julie-chen-leslie-moonves |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=Philanthropy News Digest |date=March 2, 2015 |quote=Moonves is a member of the USC School of Cinematic Arts' board and a past member of the USC Annenberg board.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Moonves was "suspended" from the USC School of Cinematic Arts' board of councilors in the wake of sex abuse allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/usc-school-of-cinematic-arts-suspends-leslie-moonves-from-board-1202892517/|title=USC School of Cinematic Arts Suspends Leslie Moonves From Board|first=Tara|last=Bitran|date=August 1, 2018|website=variety.com|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, at the same time Moonves resigned, CBS announced that Moonves and the network would be donating $20 million to #MeToo-related organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Les Moonves resigns from CBS after sexual misconduct allegations |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45467975 |accessdate=September 10, 2018 |work=BBC News|date=September 10, 2018 |quote=CBS said the company and Mr Moonves would donate $20m (£15.4m) to groups supporting the #MeToo movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tom McCarthy |title=Les Moonves resigns from CBS after six more women accuse him of sexual harassment |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/09/les-moonves-cbs-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-new-ronan-farrow-report |accessdate=September 10, 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=September 10, 2018 |quote=Moonves and CBS will donate $20m to one or more organisations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace.

'''Lizzy Clark''' (born 3 April 1994 in [[Shrewsbury]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]) is an [[English people|English]] actress. Clark is best known for playing the role of Poppy in the 2008 television film ''[[Dustbin Baby (film)|Dustbin Baby]]''. Both Clark and Poppy have [[Asperger syndrome]].

==Career==
Clark's first experience of professional acting came in 2008 when she starred alongside [[Dakota Blue Richards]] in the [[BBC]] film ''[[Dustbin Baby (film)|Dustbin Baby]]'', an adaptation of the [[Jacqueline Wilson]] novel [[Dustbin Baby|of the same name]]. She played the part of Poppy, a teenager with Asperger syndrome. The BBC said that the fact Clark also had the condition offered her a "unique take" on the role.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title= Fame for actress with Asperger syndrome|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2008/09/16/aspergers_actress_feature.shtml|publisher= [[BBC]]|date=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark was the first actress with Asperger syndrome to portray a fictional character with the condition.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Clark auditioned for the role when her mother, Nicky, saw the position advertised on a website about autism. She said that she thinks "it's incredibly positive that the BBC chose to find an actress who has the same condition as the character."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Clark said that being on set was the best experience of her life, and though "at first it was a bit intimidating", she said that eventually you "stop noticing the cameras".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; She said that her "Asperger's made some things on the film set difficult at first, like dealing with the sudden noise of the storyboard, but I was soon so focused on acting that I didn't notice anything else."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mentally disabled actors are victims of modern 'blacking-up', says campaigner|author= Hill, Amelia|newspaper= [[The Observer]]|date= 2009-11-15|url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/nov/15/disabled-actors-television-campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

===Don't Play Me, Pay Me===
Prompted by Clark's role in ''Dustbin Baby'', Clark's mother started the Don't Play Me, Pay Me campaign in attempt to stop actors "playing disabled".&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Her mother said that actors without mental disabilities playing characters with specific conditions is the "blacking-up of the 21st century", claiming that "we need to break down these barriers. They're unacceptable and indefensible in a modern-day society, especially when there are so many good, disabled actors who are both ready, eager and able to take on these parts".&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Clark is heavily involved in the campaign, and said that&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is not just mentally disabled actors who lose out when non-disabled people are employed to act them. Audiences think they are getting an authentic portrayal of a mentally disabled person, but they're not. It's not like putting on a different accent or learning what it was like to be raised in a different era. You can't understand what it is like to have a mental disability unless you've really lived with it. When non-disabled people try to portray us, they tend to fall back on stereotypes that have done our community so much harm in the past.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Targets of the campaign include setting up a forum for mentally disabled actors, and "to see disabled actors playing parts where the least interesting thing about them is their disability."&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; As part of the campaign, her mother, who was an aspiring actress herself, asked stage schools to be more pro-active in encouraging the enrollment of students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Drama schools must do more to attract disabled students, says campaigner|last=Hemley|first=Matthew|work=[[The Stage]]|date=9 December 2009|url= http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/26525/drama-schools-must-do-more-to-attract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louise Gavan Duffy''' ({{lang-ga|Luíse Ghabhánach Ní Dhufaigh}}, 17 July 1884 – 12 October 1969) was a [[suffragist]] and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] who was present in the [[General Post Office, Dublin#History|General Post Office]], the main headquarters during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. She was also an educator, [[Irish language]] enthusiast and [[Gaelic revival]]ist, setting up the first [[Gaelscoil]] in Ireland.{{sfn|Independent|2012}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}{{sfn|The three lives of Gavan Duffy|1979}}

Duffy was born in [[Cimiez]], France, into an Irish family which was both strongly Catholic and staunchly nationalist. Her [[Charles Gavan Duffy|father]] and brothers were important figures in political and legal spheres. She was raised in France in a well-to-do and culturally vibrant home where she was exposed to political figures and ideas.{{sfn|León Ó Broin|1967}} As she became increasingly interested in [[Irish language|Irish]], she moved to Ireland to learn and teach the language, eventually establishing the first Irish language school in 1917. She was one of the first women to graduate from [[University College Dublin]], earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911.{{sfn|Struggle with fortune|1954}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}

Her interest in [[women's suffrage]] and [[Irish nationalism]] led to close connections with those movements and with similarly minded women. She became a founding member of two of the country's paramilitary republican organisations for women, ''[[Cumann na mBan]]'' and ''[[Cumann na Saoirse]]''. She was closely involved in the fighting during the [[Easter Rising|Irish Easter Rebellion]] in 1916 and was part of the unsuccessful deputation to U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], calling for his support of Irish independence.

==Biography==
Born in [[France]], Louise Gavan Duffy was the daughter of the Irish nationalist [[Charles Gavan Duffy|Sir Charles Gavan Duffy]], one of the founders of ''[[The Nation]]'' and his third wife, Louise (née Hall).{{sfn|Burke's Peerage|1976}}{{sfn|National Library of Ireland}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}} As a result of his activities as a nationalist, her father had been repeatedly tried for treason and sedition. Eventually he moved to Australia where he became the 8th [[Premier of Victoria]]. Finally he retired to France.

Her brother [[George Gavan Duffy]], one of the signatories to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1921, was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. Her half-brother [[Frank Gavan Duffy|Sir Frank Gavan Duffy]] was the fourth Chief Justice of the [[High Court of Australia]], sitting on the bench from 1913 to 1935. After her mother died when she was five, she was reared in [[Nice]] by her Australian half-sisters from her father's second marriage.{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}{{sfn|National Library of Ireland}}

Duffy first came to Dublin in 1903, when her father died and was buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]]. That was when she first heard [[Irish language|Irish]] spoken; she found a grammar book in her father's belongings and became curious. Her father had not been an Irish speaker, though his mother had been fluent. Duffy fell for the language and resolved to move to Ireland.{{sfn|Biography in Irish|2015}}{{sfn|Glasnevin}}

She could not afford to move until she received a small inheritance from her grandmother in 1907. Once in Ireland, she went to the [[Gaeltacht]] to learn Irish and also took courses through Cusack's College in London so that she could matriculate. Then she entered [[University College Dublin]], taking arts. She lived in the Women's College, Dominican Convent, graduating in 1911 with a Bachelor of Arts and was one of the first women to do so.{{sfn|Struggle with fortune|1954}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}} Given the lack of teachers, even without a full qualification, she taught in [[Patrick Pearse]]'s St Ita's school for girls in [[Ranelagh]].{{sfn|Biography in Irish|2015}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}{{sfn|Bureau of Military History}}{{sfn|National Library of Ireland}}

===Politics===
A supporter of [[women's suffrage]], Duffy spoke at a mass meeting in Dublin in 1912 in favour having of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule bill]] include a section to grant women the vote. She also joined the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] women's paramilitary organisation ''[[Cumann na mBan]]'', as a founding member in April 1914, serving on the provisional committee with [[Mary Colum]], as a co-secretary.{{sfn|Bureau of Military History}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}
[[File:Osteraufstand - Dublin - Hauptpost.jpg|thumb|300px|The interior of the GPO after the Rising]]
She was aware that being a suffragist and a nationalist were not necessarily the same thing, realizing her involvement in ''Cumann na mBan'' was in support of nationalism.{{sfn|Irish Nationalist Women|2013}}{{sfn|The Military Archives}}
When St Ita's closed for funding problems in 1912, Duffy took the opportunity to complete her qualifications. After receiving her Cambridge teacher's diploma in 1913, she returned to UCD to study for a Master of Arts degree.{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}{{sfn|Biography in Irish|2015}}

She was in fact working on her Master's thesis during the Easter break in 1916 when the rumour came to her that the [[Easter Rising|Rising]] had begun in [[Dublin|Dublin city centre]]. She walked to the Rebel headquarters in the [[General Post Office, Dublin#History|GPO]] where she told [[Patrick Pearse|Pearse]], one of the leaders, that she did not agree with the violent uprising.{{sfn|Charles Gavan Duffy Society}}{{sfn|Bureau of Military History}}{{sfn|RTE1916|2016}}&lt;blockquote&gt;''I was brought to Pearse and had the temerity to tell him that I thought the rebellion was very wrong as it would certainly fail but that I wished to be there if there was going to be anything doing.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; She spent all of Easter week working in the GPO kitchens with other volunteers like [[Desmond FitzGerald (politician)|Desmond FitzGerald]] and a couple of captured British soldiers, ensuring the volunteers were cared for.{{sfn|Irish Catholic|2015}} The women in the GPO were given the opportunity to leave under the protection of the [[British Red Cross|Red Cross]] on the Thursday as the shelling of the building had caused fires but almost all of them refused. In the end the she was amongst the second group of the people to leave the GPO on the Friday, tunnelling through the walls of the buildings to avoid coming under fire.{{sfn|Renegades|2010}}

Her group made it to [[Jervis Street Hospital]] where they spent the night. The next day, Saturday, Pearse formally surrendered.{{sfn|Bureau of Military History}} Duffy headed for Jacob's Biscuit Factory, another volunteer position, on the morning after the surrender, to see what was happening.{{sfn|The Women of 1916|1996}} There she found a hold out of volunteers who were unaware of the surrender or that the fighting was over.{{sfn|Bureau of Military History}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}

After 1916 she was elected to the ''Cumann na mBan’s'' executive and in 1918 was one of the signatories to a petition for self-determination for Ireland which was presented to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] by [[Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington]].{{sfn|Charles Gavan Duffy Society}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}} During her time in the GPO, she had collected names of the volunteers and promised to take messages to their families. This may have influenced her in being involved in the National Aid Association and Volunteers Dependants Fund. In the aftermath of the rebellion there were 64 known dead among the volunteers, while 3,430 men and 79 women were arrested. Families needed support. These organisations were able to arrange funding from the USA.{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}{{sfn|National Aid Association Letters|1916}}

===Scoil Bhríde===
In 1917 Duffy co-founded and ran ''Scoil Bhríde'', an [[Gaelscoil|Irish language school]] for girls in Dublin, which is still in operation. Her co-founder was Annie McHugh who later married [[Ernest Blythe]]. The end of the Rising led to the [[Irish War of Independence]]. It was fought from 1919 to 1921. During this time, Duffy was mostly focused on the school. However, it was raided by the military and Duffy later admitted it was in fact used for rebel meetings and to safeguard documents. In October 1920, the Irish leader [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] met Archbishop [[Patrick Clune]] there in secret.{{sfn|National Library of Ireland}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}{{sfn|Biography in Irish ref}}{{sfn|National Archives Ireland}}

The war ended with the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1921. The result was the [[Irish Civil War]] which lasted until 1923. Duffy was a supporter of the Treaty, which her brother had signed, and as such she left ''Cumann na mBan'' and joined ''[[Cumann na Saoirse]]'' which she was instrumental in founding as an Irish republican women's organisation which supported the Pro-Treaty side.{{sfn|Renegades|2010}}{{sfn|Biography in Irish ref}}

Once the civil war was over, Duffy left the political arena and returned to education. She especially needed to focus on funding in the early years of the school. She worked with UCD's Department of Education from 1926, once ''Scoil Bhríde'' was recognised as a teacher training school. She published educational documents like ''School Studies in The Appreciation of Art'' with Elizabeth Aughney and published by UCD in 1932.

Until her retirement, she also lectured on the teaching of French. Once retired, she gave much of her time to the [[Legion of Mary]] and to an association which worked with [[Au Pair|French au pairs]] in Dublin. In 1948 she was awarded an honorary [[Legum Doctor|Doctorate of Laws]] by the [[National University of Ireland]]. She retired as principal in 1944.{{sfn|National Library of Ireland}}{{sfn|UCD Biography|2015}}

===Historical legacy===
Recognising the importance of her first-hand experience and with a good political understanding, Duffy recorded her memories of the events in which she had taken part. In 1949, she gave an account of her life in relation to nationalist activities to the [[Bureau of Military History]].{{sfn|Bureau of Military History}} She was involved in an [[RTÉ Radio|Radio Éireann]] broadcast in 1956 about the women in the Rising.{{sfn|Radio Éireann|1956}} In 1962 she took part in the [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] TV program ''Self Portrait'' broadcast on 20 March 1962.{{sfn|Biography in Irish|2015}} In March 1966 she gave a lecture in UCD to mark the 50th anniversary of the Rising which was published in ''The Easter rising, 1916, and University College Dublin'' (1966).

In 2014, An Post issued a stamp to commemorate the centenary of the founding of ''Cumann na mBan''.{{sfn|An Post|2014}} In 2016, for the centenary, a documentary was  produced, discussing seven of the women, including Duffy, who were involved in the Easter rising.{{sfn|Seven Women|2016}}

Duffy died, unmarried, in 1969, aged 85, and was interred in the family plot in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].{{sfn|Glasnevin}}

'''Lucinda Williams''' (born January 26, 1953)&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5833|pure_url=yes}} Lucinda Williams biography]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved on October 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[rock music|rock]], [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], and [[country music]] singer, songwriter and musician.

She recorded her first albums in 1978 and 1980 in a traditional country and blues style and received very little attention from radio, the media, or the public. In 1988, she released her self-titled album, ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]''. This release featured "[[Passionate Kisses]]," a song later recorded by [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], which garnered Williams her first [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994.

Known for working slowly, Williams recorded and released only one other album in the next several years, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'', in 1992. Her commercial breakthrough came in 1998 with ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country and [[Americana music|Americana]] into a distinctive style that remained consistent and commercial in sound. ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', which includes the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy nominated]] track "Can't Let Go", became Williams' greatest commercial success to date. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and earned Williams a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], while being universally acclaimed by critics. Williams released the critically acclaimed ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' three years later, and the album also became a commercial success. One of the album's tracks, "Get Right With God," earned Williams the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] in 2002.

Williams has released a string of albums since that have earned her more critical acclaim and commercial success. She has won 3 [[Grammy Awards]], from 15 nominations, and received 2 [[Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards|Americana Awards]], from 12 nominations. Additionally, Williams ranked No. 97 on [[VH1]]'s [[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest Women in Rock &amp; Roll]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1999/vh1women.htm |title=VH1: 100 Greatest Women of Rock &amp; Roll |publisher=Rock On The Net |date= |accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named "America's best songwriter" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/pro.lwilliams.html "'Essence' of the South"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211061602/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/pro.lwilliams.html |date=2008-12-11 }}.

==Early life==
Williams was born in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], the daughter of poet and literature professor [[Miller Williams]] and an amateur pianist, Lucille Fern Day. Her parents divorced in the mid-1960s. Williams's father gained custody of her and her younger brother, Robert Miller, and sister, Karyn Elizabeth. Like her father, she has [[spina bifida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/magazine/01wwln-domains-t.html?_r=0/|title=Domains : Lucinda Williams : Country House|author=Lewine, Edward|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father worked as a visiting professor in Mexico and different parts of the United States, including [[Baton Rouge]]; [[New Orleans]]; [[Jackson, Mississippi]]; and [[Utah]] before settling at the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]].

==Career==

===Early years===
By her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in [[Austin]] and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], concentrating on a folk-rock-country blend. She moved to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]], in 1978 to record her first album, for [[Smithsonian]]/[[Folkways Records]]. Titled ''[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]'', it was a collection of country and [[blues]] covers. The album title was shortened to ''[[Ramblin']]'' when it was reissued. She followed it up in 1980 with ''[[Happy Woman Blues]]'', which consisted of her own material. Neither album received much attention.

In the 1980s, Williams moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] (before finally settling in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]), where, at times backed by a rock band and at others performing in acoustic settings, she developed a following and a critical reputation. While based in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]] drummer [[Greg Sowders]], whom she had met in a club. In 1988 [[Rough Trade Records]] released the self-titled ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]'', which was produced by [[Gurf Morlix]]. The single "Changed the Locks", about a broken relationship, received radio play around the country and gained fans among music insiders, including [[Tom Petty]], who would later cover the song.

Its follow-up, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'' (Chameleon, 1992), also produced by Morlix, is a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. Williams' biggest success during the early 1990s was as a songwriter. [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] recorded a cover of "[[Passionate Kisses]]" (from ''Lucinda Williams'') in 1992, and the song became a smash country hit for which Williams received the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994. Carpenter also received a Grammy for her performance of the song. She duetted with [[Steve Earle]] on the song "You're Still Standin' There" from his album ''[[I Feel Alright]]''. In 1991, the song "Lucinda Williams" appeared on [[Vic Chesnutt]]'s album ''West of Rome''.

Williams had garnered considerable critical acclaim, but her commercial success was moderate. [[Emmylou Harris]] said of Williams, "She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is, but, for some reason, she's completely out of the loop and I feel strongly that that's country music's loss." Harris recorded the title track from Williams's ''Sweet Old World'' for her career-redefining 1995 album, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]''.

Williams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists' albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.

===''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road''===
The long-awaited release, 1998's ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', was Williams' breakthrough into the mainstream and received a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Containing the single "Still I Long for Your Kiss" from the [[Robert Redford]] film ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', the album received wide critical notice and soon went gold. The single "Can't Let Go" also enjoyed considerable crossover radio play. Williams toured with [[Bob Dylan]], the [[The Allman Brothers|Allman Brothers]] and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and on her own in support of the album.  An expanded edition of the album, including three additional studio recordings and a second CD documenting a 1998 concert, was released in 2006.

In 1999, she appeared on ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'', duetting with [[David Crosby]] on the title track of the tribute album.

Williams followed up the success of ''Car Wheels'' with ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' (2001). This release features a less produced, more down-tuned approach both musically and lyrically, and moved Williams further from the country music establishment while winning fans in the alternative music world. She won the 2001 [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single "Get Right with God," an atypically uptempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release.  The title track includes a contribution on Hammond organ by [[alternative country]] musician [[Ryan Adams]].

Her seventh album, ''[[World Without Tears]]'', was released in 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues.

It addresses her mother's death and a tumultuous relationship break-up. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' praised it, saying "Lucinda Williams has made the record of a lifetime—part [[Hank Williams]], part Bob Dylan, part [[Keith Richards]] circa ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' ..."

In the fall of 2007, Williams announced a series of shows in Los Angeles and New York. Playing five nights in each city, she performed her entire catalog on consecutive nights.

It includes 13 songs—among them, "Real Love" and "Little Rock Star," the latter inspired by music celebrities in the press, like [[Pete Doherty]] and [[Amy Winehouse]]. "Little Honey" also includes a cover of AC/DC's "Long Way to the Top" and "Rarity," inspired by singer-songwriter Mia Doi Todd.&lt;ref&gt;Gamboa, Glenn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">'''Lydia Winterhalter Allison''' (September 14, 1880 - March 25, 1959), best known as '''Lydia W. Allison''' was an American [[parapsychologist]] and writer.

==Biography==

Allison was born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. In 1905, she married physician Edward Wood Allison. After the death of her husband in 1920 she became involved in psychical research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pflyceum.org/212.html "Lydia W. Allison"]. Lyceum Library.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the Secretary and Assistant Treasurer of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] and Chairman of its Committee of Publications. In 1925 she founded the Boston Society for Psychical Research with [[Walter Franklin Prince]] and others.&lt;ref name ="Occultism"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/allison-lydia-winterhalter-1880-1959 "Allison, Lydia W(interhalter) (1880-1959)"]. Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Routledge. p. 40. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allison investigated spiritualist mediums such as [[Gladys Osborne Leonard]] and Minnie M. Soule. She authored ''Leonard and Soule Experiments''  (1929). [[Gardner Murphy]] commented that "Her combination of unfailing enthusiasm for the highest quality research and solid skepticism regarding unsound methods made her a precious collaborator."&lt;ref name ="Occultism"/&gt; Psychical researcher [[George Nugent Merle Tyrrell|G. N. M. Tyrrell]] wrote that Allison was a "very experienced and scientifically cautious investigator."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Nugent Merle Tyrrell|Tyrrell, G. N. M]]. (1961). ''Science and Psychical Phenomena''. University Books. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Wenxiu was fought against by the defector to the Qing Ma Rulong. The Muslim scholar [[Ma Dexin]], who said that Neo-Confucianism was reconcilable with Islam, approved of Ma Rulong defecting to the Qing and he also assisted other Muslims in defecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John King Fairbank|title=The Cambridge History of China: Late Chʻing, 1800-1911, pt. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22029-3|pages=213–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing with [[Esporte Clube Sírio (basketball)|Sírio]] of the [[Campeonato Brasileiro de Basquete|Brazilian Basketball League]], Schmidt won both the [[Campeonato Sudamericano de Clubes|South American Club Championship]] and the [[FIBA Intercontinental Cup|FIBA World Club Championship]] in 1979.

He was drafted by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the sixth round of the [[1984 NBA Draft]], and had several other opportunities to play in the [[NBA]]{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but declined them all in order to continue to play for [[Brazil national basketball team|Brazil's national team]] (until 1989, NBA players were not allowed to play for national teams).

Schmidt won the [[Italian Basketball Cup|Italian Cup]] with [[Juvecaserta|Caserta]] in 1988.

He also [[ACB statistical leaders|led the Spanish Basketball League in scoring]] in 1994, while he was a member of [[CB Valladolid|Valladolid]].

While playing in Italy, he earned a fan in future [[NBA]] star [[Kobe Bryant]], who called Schmidt one of his childhood idols&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/22/sports/la-sp-ln-kobe-bryant-david-beckham-advice-achilles-injury-20130622 "Kobe Bryant turns to David Beckham for advice on Achilles injury"], Eric Pinkus, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  and later said Schmidt could have been one of the greatest in the NBA if he had played there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbalead.com/2016/04/13/oscar-schmidt-a-mao-santa/ "Oscar Schmidt Story: The Greatest Player Ever?"], ''The Lead''&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to his native Brazil in 1995, to play once again in the Brazilian Basketball League with [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista (basketball)|Corinthians]], and was the league's top scorer 8 times (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003). He retired on May 26, 2003.

===National team career===
With the senior [[Brazilian national basketball team]], Schmidt played in five [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] (the second player to do so after [[Teófilo Cruz]]) and was the top scorer in three of them. However, he never went past the quarterfinals. In the [[Basketball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics]], he played seven games and scored 169 points, for a 24.1 average.

He again scored 169 points in seven games in the [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics]]. His best Olympic performance was the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympics]].  He scored 338 points, for an average of 42.3 points per game.

In [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], he scored 198 points in eight games, and in [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|1996]], he scored 219 points in 8 games. In [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics#Top 10 all-time cumulative scorers in men's basketball (through 2016 Olympics)|38 career Olympic basketball games, Schmidt scored a record of 1,093 points]], for an average of 28.8 points per game.

He is the [[FIBA World Cup records#Top 10 cumulative points scorers|all-time career leader in total points scored]] in the [[FIBA World Cup]], having scored a total of 843 points in 35 games, for a scoring average of 24.1 points per game. He won the bronze medal and made [[FIBA World Cup All-Tournament Team|the All-Tournament Team]] at the [[1978 FIBA World Championship|1978 FIBA World Cup]], and made the All-Tournament Teams of both the [[1986 FIBA World Championship|1986 FIBA World Cup]] and the [[1990 FIBA World Championship|1990 FIBA World Cup]], which he also [[FIBA Basketball World Cup records#Top scorer by tournament|led in scoring, averaging 34.6 points per game]].

Schmidt played in the gold-medal match of the [[Basketball at the 1987 Pan American Games|1987 Pan American Games]] in [[Indianapolis]]. The [[United States national basketball team|US national team]], composed of college players at those games, featured two All-Americans in [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] ([[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]]) and [[Danny Manning]], two [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Championship]] Final Four [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|MVPs]], in [[Pervis Ellison]] and [[Keith Smart]], and other future [[NBA]] players, such as [[Rex Chapman]] and [[Dan Majerle]]. Brazil faced a 68–54 halftime deficit. Schmidt finished with 46 points, in a 120–115 win.

==Post athletic career==
In 2004, Schmidt started his career in management. He was the CEO of "Telemar Rio de Janeiro", a Brazilian team which played for two years and won the "Campeonato Carioca" (Rio de Janeiro Championship) in 2004 and 2005.

In 2006, Schmidt, along with other Brazilian basketball greats such as [[Maria Paula Silva|Paula]] and [[Hortência Marcari|Hortência]], (another [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]]), led the ''NLB: Nossa Liga de Basquete'' ("our basketball league"), an attempted rival to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro de Basquete|Brazilian Basketball League]]. However, the league folded a year later.

In 2016, he was one of the guests at the opening ceremony of the summer olympics "Rio 2016", alongside international celebrities such as model Gisele Bündchen, actor Gustavo Goulart, and singer Caetano Veloso among others.

==Cancer==
On May 13, 2013, Schmidt had brain surgery to excise a malignant tumor.&lt;ref name="sportsonearth2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/60026994/ |title= Oscar Winner |last1="Casey" |first1="Tim" |date=9 September 2013 |website="Sports on Earth" |access-date=5 June 2015 |quote="In the spring, he had his second brain tumor surgery in two years. He is now on chemotherapy five days a month..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, nobody knew about it except for his family. The press found out about the disease fifteen days after the surgery at a dinner celebrating the 50th anniversary of the two-time World Champion Brazilian National Team. Schmidt did not appear as he was recuperating from daily chemotherapy sessions.

The disease is now in remission.&lt;ref name="sportsonearth2015"/&gt;

He was awarded the [[Arjuna award]] in 1972 and the [[Padma Shri]] in 1982 by the Government of India. He is one of the co-founders of [[Olympic Gold Quest]], a foundation dedicated to the promotion of Olympic sports in India.

==Background and early life==
Padukone was born on 10 June 1955&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iloveindia.com/sports/badminton/players/prakash-padukone.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]. His surname, Padukone, is the name of the village [[Padukone (village)|Padukone]] from where his family originates.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Padukone got married to Ujjala, a match arranged by their parents in the Indian Hindu system. They have two daughters - [[Deepika Padukone]], a [[Bollywood]] actress, and Anisha Padukone, a golfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/I-dont-have-an-issue-marrying-an-actor-Deepika-Padukone/articleshow/33391212.cms? | title=I don't have an issue marrying an actor: Deepika Padukone | publisher=The Times of India | date=8 April 2014 | accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padukone, his wife and younger daughter Anisha reside in [[Bangalore]], whereas Deepika lives and works in [[Mumbai]].

Prakash Padukone's life story has been chronicled in the biography '[[Touch Play]]', by Dev S. Sukumar. The book is only the second biography of any badminton player.

==Career==
Prakash was initiated into the game by his father Ramesh Padukone, who was the Secretary of the "Mysore Badminton Association" for many years.

Padukone's first official tournament was the [[Karnataka]] state junior championship in 1962. Though he lost in the very first round, two years later he managed to win the state junior title. He changed his playing style into a more aggressive style in 1971, and won the Indian national junior title in 1972. He also won the senior title the same year. He won the National title consecutively for the next seven years. In 1978, he won his first major international title, the men's singles gold medal at the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]] in Edmonton, Canada.&lt;ref name="The Tribune - 24Apr2010 - Shuttlers aim for gold in the upcoming Commonwealth Games, writes M. S. Unnikrishnan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100424/spr-trib.htm|title=Shuttlers aim for gold in the upcoming Commonwealth Games, writes M. S. Unnikrishnan|date=24 April 2010|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he won the "Evening of Champions" at the Royal Albert Hall, London.

In 1980, he won the [[Denmark Open|Danish Open]], the [[Swedish Open (badminton)|Swedish Open]] and became the first Indian to win the men's singles title at the [[All-England Open Badminton Championships|All England Championship]] with a victory over Indonesian rival [[Liem Swie King]]. He spent much of his international career training in [[Denmark]], and developed close friendships with European players such as [[Morten Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badzine.net/features/profile-morten-frost/142/ | title=PROFILE – Morten Frost |publisher=Badzine.net |date=5 January 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other services==
After his retirement from competitive sports in 1991, Padukone served as the chairman of the [[Badminton Association of India]] for a short while. He also served as the coach of the Indian national badminton team from 1993 to 1996.

===Olympic gold quest===
After retirement, Padukone has sought to mentor budding young players and help them achieve glory for the country.

'''Sharabha''' ({{lang-sa|शरभ}}, {{IAST|Śarabha|Sharav}}, {{lang-kn|ಶರಭ}}, Telugu: శరభ) or '''Sarabha''' is a part-lion and part-bird beast in [[Hindu mythology]], who, according to [[Sanskrit literature]], is eight-legged and more powerful than a lion or an elephant, possessing the ability to clear a valley in one jump. In later literature, Sharabha is described as an eight-legged deer.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik"&gt;{{cite book| last = Pattanaik| first = Devdutt| title = Shiva to Shankara decoding the phallic symbol| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Oka4ekgGDRoC&amp;pg=PA29| year = 2006| publisher = Indus Source| isbn = 978-81-88569-04-5| pages = 123–124| work = Sharabha (Shiva Purana) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1057-zaryahan.jpg|title=शरभ|work=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary|page=1057|accessdate=18 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226140735/http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=%2Fscans%2FMWScan%2FMWScanjpg%2Fmw1057-zaryahan.jpg|archivedate=2012-02-26|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaiva]] scriptures narrate that god [[Shiva]] assumed the [[Avatar]] (incarnation) of Sharabha to pacify [[Narasimha]] - the fierce man-lion avatar of [[Vishnu]] worshipped by [[Vaishnava]] sect. This form is popularly known as '''Sharabeshwara''' ("Lord Sharabha") or '''Sharabeshwaramurti'''.&lt;ref name="Waradpande"&gt;{{cite book| last = Waradpande| first = N. R.| title = The mythical Aryans and their invasion| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GR1uAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 2010-01-09| year = 2000| publisher = Books &amp; Books| isbn = 978-81-85016-57-3| pages = 43, 46| work = Sharabha }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vaishnavas refute the portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Shiva-Sharabha and regard Sharabha as a name of Vishnu. Another tale narrates that Vishnu assumed the form of the ferocious [[Gandaberunda]] bird-animal to combat Sharabha. In [[Buddhism]], Sharabha appears in [[Jataka Tales]] as a previous birth of [[the Buddha]].

Sharabha also appears in the emblem of [[Government of Karnataka|State government]] of the Indian state of [[Karnataka]], [[University of Mysore]] and the [[Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited]].

==Development of character and iconography==
In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is initially described as an animal that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic [[Mahabharata]], this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount [[Krauncha]] but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount [[Gandhamadana]]. The epic also includes Sharabha in the list of edible animals - the ''mrigajatis''- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic [[Ramayana]], also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons ([[Danava (Hinduism)|danava]]s) and serpent [[Nāga]]s and one of the names of god [[Vishnu]] as well as [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name="Hopkins"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hopkins| first = E.

However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;{{cite book| last = Zimmermann| first = Francis| title = Volume 4 of Indian medical tradition Alternative Medicine Series| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V1o_PRCLOeMC&amp;pg=PA82| accessdate = 2010-01-15| year = 1999| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publishers| isbn = 978-81-208-1618-3| page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiva's incarnation===
In [[Puranas|Puranic literature]], Sharabha is associated with god [[Shiva]], who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting [[Narasimha]] - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu ([[Vaishnavite]] sect) and those of Shiva ([[Shaivite]] sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blurton"&gt;{{cite book| last = Blurton| first = T.

It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.&lt;ref name= Roy &gt;{{cite book|last= Roy |first= Janmajit |title= Bhagavata Purana |pages=93–95|accessdate=2010-01-15|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lr9pFQPwhXYC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Varaha+sarabha&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Varaha%20sarabha&amp;f=false|publisher= Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors |year=2002|isbn=978-81-269-0169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastri "&gt;{{cite book| last = Shastri| first = Biswanarayan| title = Kalika purana| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ivVToiARmkoC&amp;pg=PA25| accessdate = 2010-01-15| year = 1994| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| isbn = 978-81-208-1124-9| pages = 25–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NarasimhaHara.JPG|thumb|Two-headed Sharabha with four legs.]]
The iconography of Sharabeshwaramurti (Shiva as Sharabha) is specifically defined in texts such as ''[[Khamikagama]]'' and ''[[Sritattvanidhi]]''. In Khamikagama, Sharabha is described in the form of a bird with golden color, with two uplifted wings, two red eyes, four legs in the form of a lion touching the ground, four legs with claws upwards, and with an animal tail. The top part of the body is shown as human but with the face of a lion with an ornamented crown; side tusks are also depicted giving an overall frightening sight. It also shows the Narasimha beneath Sharabha’s legs as a lion-faced human with ''[[Añjali Mudrā|anjali]]'' (hands folded prayer gesture). (See Infobox image)&lt;ref name= "Rao p.172-173"&gt;Rao pp.172–173&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sritattvanidhi, the depiction prescribed for Sharabeshwaramurti is of thirty arms; arms on the right are to hold [[Vajra|thunderbolt]], mushti, abhaya, [[chakra]] (discus), sakti, [[danda|staff]], [[ankusha|goad]], sword, [[khatvanga]], [[parashu|axe]], akshamala, a bone, bow, musala, and fire; and the left hands to display noose, varada, [[Gada (mace)|mace]], arrow, flag, and another type of sword, a snake, a lotus flower, [[kapala|skull-cup]], pustaka, plough, and mrudanga with one hand encircling [[Durga]] in a hug. This form is extolled to usher good luck, cure all diseases and destroy all enemies.&lt;ref name="Rao p.173"&gt;Rao p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chola dynasty]] in Tamil Nadu was particularly favourable to the beliefs of Shaiva sect. It is said that the sectarian aspect got highlighted during their reign. This is evident from the four Sharabha images, the earliest at the Vikramsolishwaram temple near Kumbakonam built by [[Vikrama Chola]] (1118–35). The other images are at [[Darasuram]] and [[Kampaheswarar Temple, Thirubuvanam|Kampahareshvarar temple]], [[Thirubuvanam]] built by a Chola ruler, [[Kulottunga Chola III]] where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine.&lt;ref name="Smith "&gt;{{cite book| last = Smith| first = David| title = The Dance of Siva Religion, Art and Poetry in South India Volume 7 of Cambridge Studies in Religious Traditions| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4EvknQEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA191| accessdate = 2010-01-15| year = 2003| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-52865-8| page = 193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sculpture of Sharbeshwaramurti in the Tribhuvanam temple, a Shiva temple in [[Tanjore district]], in [[Tamil Nadu]] is seen with three legs, with body and face of a lion and a tail. It has four human arms, the right upper hand holds axe, noose is held in the lower right hand, the deer in the upper left hand and fire in the lower left hand. Narasimha is shown with eight arms in the [[Airavatesvara Temple]] at Darasuram, a rare image of the Chola period, in black basalt, depicts Shiva as Sharabha. It is deified in an exclusive small shrine, as part man, beast and bird, destroying the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu, Narasimha. This highlights the hostility between the Shaivite and Vaishnavite sects. In the [[Chennakeshava temple]] of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] (1113), [[Karnataka]], [[Gandaberunda]] (2-faced bird identified with Vishnu) depiction is a carved scene of "chain of destruction". Initially, a deer is prey to a large python, followed by being lifted by an elephant and a lion attacking the elephant, and the lion shown as devoured by Sharabha.&lt;ref name="Kamat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1149|title=Gandaberunda- The Two Headed Bird|accessdate=2010-01-10|publisher=Kamat Potpourri|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202000034/http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1149|archivedate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;In [[Maharashtra]] the stone cut Sharabha idol is placed on the outer walls of the entrance gate of many historic forts.
[[File:Peth sharabha.JPG|thumb|Sharabha idol on Kothaligad fort.]]

In iconographic representations of the myth of Shiva vis-à-vis Vishnu, Sharabha form has been built around Narasimha but substantially embellished with wings to represent [[Kali]] and [[Durga]] to denote the female powers ([[shakti]]s) of Shiva; Sharabha is also shown with a bird head and a serpent in his beak head.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kramrisch| first = Stella| title = The Presence of Siva| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&amp;pg=PA436| accessdate = 2010-01-15| year = 1994| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-01930-7| page = 436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hindu scriptures==

===In Mahabharata===
The [[Mahabharata]], the great Hindu epic, narrates: a dog, with the help of a [[Rishi]] (sage) assumes various animal forms - starting from a dog to a tiger then to an elephant followed by a lion and a sharabha - terrorized every one in the hermitage of the Rishi. Eventually, Sharabha assumed a further fiercer form. In this fierce form he wanted to devour the Rishi. The Rishi then narrating the process of change in Sharabha’s development, as a result of his benevolence, cursed Sharabha to go back to his original form of a dog.&lt;ref name="Ganguli "&gt;{{cite book| last = Ganguli| first = Kisari Mohan| title = The Mahabharata of Krishna-dwaipayana Vyasa, Book-12| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CnQVCgtmW-sC&amp;pg=PA348| accessdate = 2010-01-15| year = 2009| publisher = BiblioBazaar, LLC| isbn = 978-0-559-13713-6| pages = 347–348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The epic does not relate Shiva to Sharabha.

===Shaivite views===
[[File:Sarabha Narasinmha Kangra.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sharabha (right) with Narasimha killing [[Hiranyakashipu]] as [[Prahlada]] and his mother look on.]]
The legend of Sharabha as an incarnation of Shiva is narrated in many Hindu scriptures and each presents a different version to suit one’s religious beliefs. But one common refrain in all these depictions is that Sharabha is a combination of a huge animal-bird beast with enormous strength manifested with the purpose of pacifying similar ferocious avatars of Vishnu such as [[Narasimha]] (man-lion) or [[Varaha]] (the boar).

The Narasimha-Sharabha legend is linked to gods assuming mythical animal forms to slay or subdue as the case may be. First, Vishnu assumed the form of Narasimha to slay [[Hiranyakashipu]], an [[asura]] (demon) king, who was terrorizing the universe and devotee of Shiva.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik/&gt;&lt;ref name= Blurton/&gt; The [[Shiva Purana]] mentions: After slaying Hiranyakashipu, Narasimha’s wrath was not appeased. The world trembled, fearing what he might do. The [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s (the gods) requested Shiva to tackle Narasimha. Initially, Shiva brings forth [[Virabhadra]], one of his terrifying forms, in order to calm Narasimha. When that failed, Shiva manifested as the human-lion-bird Sharabha, with [[Pratyangira]] and Soolini, Shiva's female energies, forming his wings. Sharabha then attacked Narasimha and immobilized him by deploying Pratyangira as a weapon. He thus quelled Narasimha’s terrifying rage and restored sattva back into him.

After the mutilation, Vishnu assumed his normal form and retired to his abode, after duly praising Shiva.

The [[Skanda Purana]] considers Narasimha as a mere irritation and not a threat to the world, contrary to what was brought out in the Shiva and Linga Puranas. The perception was that Vishnu may permanently adopt the fierce form of Narasimha, which would be detrimental to his role of doing good deeds. Hence, the purpose of Shiva assuming the form of Sharabha was to ensure that the lion body of Vishnu was discarded and he got united with his original divine form. Narasimha struck Sharabha with his body, it was Vishnu who groaned in pain and not Sharabha who was in an "adamantine body". It was then that Vishnu realised that Sharabha was none other than Shiva and bowed and praised Sharabha. Shiva then blesses Vishnu and gives him a boon to kill [[daityas|demons]].&lt;ref name= Bakker &gt;{{Cite book|author = Phyllis Granoff|editor = Bakker, Hans| title=Origin and growth of the Purāṇic text corpus|pages=116–131|chapter = Saving the Saviour| accessdate=2010-01-15| url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLN0F7GGecsC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=sarabha&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=sarabha&amp;f=false|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|year=2004|isbn=8120820495}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Purana ends the story with gods fearing that Sharabha may not be able to control his rage and thus urging Shiva to give up his Sharabha form. Thereafter, Shiva dismembered Sharabha’s form; his limbs were given away and his torso became a [[Kapalika]].&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Flaherty |first=Wendy Doniger | title = Śiva, the erotic ascetic| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dnfZ_MBErlQC&amp;pg=PA282| accessdate = 2010-01-15| year = 1981| publisher = Oxford University Press US| isbn = 978-0-19-520250-2| pages = 282–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vamana Purana]] too discusses the tale, ending with Narasimha becoming the calm Vishnu again and Sharabha becoming a [[lingam]], the symbol of Shiva.&lt;ref name= Bakker/&gt;

In the [[Kalika Purana]], Varaha - Vishnu’s boar avatar - had amorous dalliance with the [[Prithvi|earth goddess]]. He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to take the form of Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu requests Shiva to destroy Varaha, unable to control his own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha first and then kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his fierce forms. Finally, Sharabha defeats Vishnu.&lt;ref name= Roy/&gt;&lt;ref name= Shastri &gt;{{Cite book|last= Shastri |first= Biswanarayan |title= Kalika purana |pages=25–27|accessdate=2010-01-15|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ivVToiARmkoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Varaha+sarabha&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Varaha%20sarabha&amp;f=false|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publ |year=1994|isbn=8120811240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frederick M.

[[File:Ashtamukha Gandaberunda Narasimha.jpg|thumb|left|Narasimha transformed into Gandaberunda, to combat Sharabha. Ashtamukha Gandaberunda Narasimha slaying Sharabha and Hiranyakashipu, depicted in his lap.]]

Vaishnava followers including [[Dvaita]] scholars, such as [[Vijayendra Tirtha]] (1514–93) refute the portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as they consider the Shaivite Puranas as [[tamasic]] - and thus not authoritative - based on their reading of [[Puranas|Sattvic Puranas]] and [[Shruti]] texts. The refutation of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends is discussed in a text by Vijayindra Tirtha called ''Shaivasarvasvakhandanam''.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite book| last = Sharma| first = B.

Some regional South-Indian scriptures narrate that Narasimha took the form of [[Gandaberunda]] (literally "the mighty two-headed"), a more ferocious two-headed bird-animal, who combats and destroys  Shiva-Sharabha.&lt;ref name="Kamat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1149|title=Gandaberunda- The Two Headed Bird|accessdate=2010-01-10|publisher=Kamat Potpourri|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202000034/http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1149|archivedate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/05-09/features1382.htm|title=Nrsimhadev-Ganda Bherunada and Shiva Sarabha |date=May 23, 2005|work=The Sampradaya Sun|publisher=HareKrsna.com|accessdate=2 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211613/http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/05-09/features1382.htm|archivedate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sharabha Upanishad mentions that ''shara'' means [[jiva]] ("soul") and [[Hari]] (Vishnu) is gleaming in the form of Sharabha, and that Hari has manifested as Sharabha who is capable of granting [[moksha]] (salvation).&lt;ref name="Rao p.174"&gt;Rao p.174&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reference to Sharabha in the [[Vishnu sahasranama]], the 1000 names of Vishnu, and the literal meaning seems to suggest the praise of Sharabha (the lion-killing animal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Swami [[Chinmayananda]]| first = Swami| title = Vishnusahasranama| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G2EfW1oiVw8C&amp;pg=PA107| publisher = [[Chinmaya Mission]]| isbn = 978-81-7597-245-2| page = 107 }} Stanza 37, line 1: "atulah '''sharabhah''' bheemah samayagno havirharih sarvalakshanalakshanyah lakshmeevaan samitinjayah."&lt;/ref&gt;

Narasimhan Krishnamachari, a scholar on [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosophy, states that the name "Sharabha" has been interpreted in two ways namely; the first interpretation means "the Destroyer (of those who transgress the bounds of ethics)," as given by the [[Sri Sampradaya|Sri Vaishnavite]] commentator, [[Parasara Bhattar]] and the second interpretation as given by Adi Sankara, among others.&lt;ref name = "Krishnamachari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahobilavalli.org/vishnu_sahasra_namam_vol2.pdf|format=PDF|title= Vishnusahsranamam, Volume II- Annotated Commentaries by Sri Narasimhan Krishnamachari|publisher=hobilavalli.org|accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is based on the [[Sanskrit]] verb SR, which means "to injure to destroy".&lt;ref name = "Krishnamachari"/&gt; According to C. V. Radhakrishna Sastri, "Sara" also refers to an arrow, and the perishable body shines if it is aimed at [[Bhagavan]], because He shines in that body."&lt;ref name="Krishnamachari"/&gt;

[[Adi Shankaracharya]], as with the reference in the Sharabha Upanishad, refers to this 356th name of Vishnu sahasranama as not mentioning the lion-killing animal at all and instead interprets the name to mean, "As the Lord shines in the body as the indwelling Self, He is called Sharabha, while the body is sara (perishable)."&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami, Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 91, Chennai: Sri Ramakrishna Math. Sanskrit and English, with an English translation of Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada's commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; As these commentaries on the Vishnu sahasranama suggest, none of them refer to the avatar of Shiva.

==In Buddhist scriptures==
[[File:Sharabha deer.jpg|thumb|Sharabha is depicted similar to a deer, folio from Jataka tales.]]

In the [[Jataka tales]] of [[the Buddha]]'s previous lives, there is narration related to his birth as [[Boddhisattva]] in a forest as a Sharabha, the eight-legged deer. This story is of one compassion of the deer shown towards the King who wanted to hunt the deer. The King, while trying to hunt the deer, fell into a precipice with his horse. The deer instead of abandoning the king to his fate rescued him. The King was deeply touched by the compassion shown by the deer and thereafter promulgated a decry stating that hunting was an illegal activity in his country.&lt;ref name="Himalaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/50215.html|title= Shakyamuni Buddha - Jataka (previous lives)|accessdate=2010-01-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031232948/http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/50215.html|archivedate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Byles Cowell|author2=Sir Robert Chalmers |author3=William Henry Denham Rouse |author4=Henry Thomas Francis |author5=Robert Alexander Neil | title = The Jātaka or stories of the Buddha's former births| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tyzjqrJ2YnwC&amp;pg=PA166| volume = 4| year = 2000| publisher = Asian Educational Services| isbn = 978-81-206-1469-7| pages = 166–74| chapter = Sarabha-Miga-Jataka| editor = Edward Byles Cowell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], sharabha is represented as a beast with a goat's head and horns, a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolizes determination, strength and speed. Sometimes, it is represented additionally with horns of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head is replaced by a lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and horns can be of a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] or dwarfs in a ''[[Torana]]'' – a six-level archway behind an enlightenment throne of a [[Buddha]] or [[Boddhisattva]]. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robert Beér| title = The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XlqeS3WjSWIC&amp;pg=PA90| year = 2004| publisher = Serindia Publications, Inc.| isbn = 978-1-932476-10-1| pages = 80, 90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robert Beer| title = The handbook of Tibetan Buddhist symbols| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA259| year = 2003| publisher = Serindia Publications, Inc.| isbn = 978-1-932476-03-3| page = 259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snap, Crackle and Pop''' are the [[cartoon]] [[mascot]]s of [[Kellogg's]] [[Crisped rice|crisped-rice]] [[breakfast cereal]] [[Rice Krispies]].

==History==
[[File:Snap Crackle Pop (old design).jpg|right|thumb|An older version of the three mascots]]
The gnomic elves&lt;!--CF. SOURCE. *NOT* ELVES.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelloggs"&gt;Kellogg's. [http://kelloggs.mediaroom.com/file.php/104/BIO+Snap!+Crackle!+Pop!.pdf "Snap! Crackle! Pop!"] 2007. Accessed 20 Aug 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; characters were originally designed by illustrator [[Vernon Simeon Plemion Grant|Vernon Grant]] in the early 1930s. The names are an [[onomatopoeia]] and were derived from a Rice Krispies [[radio]] [[advertisement|ad]]:

The first character appeared on the product's packaging in 1933, Grant added two more and named the trio Snap, Crackle and Pop.&lt;ref name="Kelloggs"/&gt; Snap is usually portrayed with a [[Toque#Culinary use|chef's toque]] on his head; Crackle often is shown wearing a red (or striped) [[tomte]]'s [[tuque]] or "sleeping cap," and Pop often wears a [[drum major]]'s [[shako]] (sometimes Pop is seen also with a chef's toque, or an odd combination of both a shako and a toque).&lt;ref name="Kelloggs"/&gt; Corporate promotional material describes their personalities as resembling brothers. Snap is the oldest and known as a problem solver, Crackle is an unsure "middle child" and known as a jokester, and Pop is a mischievous youngster and the center of attention.&lt;ref name="Kelloggs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kelloggsfamilyrewards.com/content/dam/kelloggsfamilyrewards/en_US/promotions/games/ricekrispies/frosted/puzzle.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rice Krispies Cereal Speaks to You |accessdate=2016-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From their original design as elderly gnomes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricekrispies.com/snap-crackle-pop RiceKrispies.com Snap, Crackle &amp; Pop: Everyone's Favorite Breakfast Buddies Through The Years]&lt;/ref&gt; with large noses, ears and hats, Snap, Crackle and Pop were reimagined with younger and more proportional features in 1949. Some time after 1955, their gnome-ish oversized ears became more proportional yet pointed, as seen in common [[Pointy ears#Folklore and fiction|portrayals of elves]]. They first appeared as [[animated cartoon|animated]] characters in the 1960s, targeted toward such children's shows as ''[[The Howdy Doody Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelloggs"/&gt; The voices of the original gnomes&lt;!--CF.

More recent voices have included [[Chris Evans (British broadcaster)|Chris Evans]], [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Chad Doreck]], [[Eddie Deezen]], [[Thom Adcox-Hernandez]] and [[Dino Andrade]]. As of 2009, the three gnomes&lt;!--CF.

The trio were used in conservation messages during [[World War II]] and briefly re-imagined as [[superheroes]] in the early 1990s, but later returned to their original elf-like form. Likewise, there was briefly a fourth gnome&lt;!--CF.

[[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] assigned Chicago-based cartoonist [[Don Margolis]] to do Snap, Crackle and Pop for the Rice Krispies boxes as well as other applications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} [[Davidson Marketing]] also used him for their Rice Krispies assignments.

'''Stephany Griffith-Jones''' (born June 5, 1947) is an [[economist]] specialising in [[international finance]] and [[Economic development|development]], with emphasis on reform of the [[international financial system]], specifically in relation to [[financial regulation]], [[global governance]] and international capital flows. She is currently financial markets director at the [[Initiative for Policy Dialogue]],&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://policydialogue.org/about/team/griffith-jones_stephany_team_financial_markets_program_director/ Initiative for Policy Dialogue website]&lt;/ref&gt; based at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]] and associate fellow at the [[Overseas Development Institute]]. Previously she was professorial fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] at [[Sussex University]]. She has held the position of deputy director of International Finance at the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]] and has worked at the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] and in the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]]. She started her career in 1970 at the [[Central Bank of Chile]]. Before joining the [[Institute of Development Studies]], she worked at [[Barclays]] Bank International in the UK. She has acted as senior consultant to governments in Eastern Europe and Latin America and to many international agencies, including the [[World Bank]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[European Commission]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNDP]] and [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]. She was also a member of the Warwick Commission on international financial reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/research/warwickcommission/about/commissioners/griffith-jones/ Warwick Commission bio]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has published over 20 books and written many scholarly and journalistic articles. Her latest book, edited jointly with [[José Antonio Ocampo]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], ''Time for the Visible Hand, Lessons from the 2008 crisis'', was published in 2010.

==Contributions to economic analysis and policy==
Griffith-Jones has contributed to research and policy suggestions on how to make the domestic and international financial system more stable so it can better serve the needs of inclusive economic development and the [[real economy]]. One of her first articles, ''The Growth of Multinational Banking, the Euro-currency market and their effects on developing countries''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a787129198~frm=titlelink?words=stephany|griffith-jones&amp;hash=2586186806 The growth of multinational banking, the Euro-currency market and their effects on developing countries], ''Journal of Development Studies'', Volume 16, Issue 2, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; in the Journal of Development Studies, published in 1980, warned of the risk of excessive international [[bank lending]] to [[developing economies]].

Her 1986 book with Osvaldo Sunkel, ''Debt and Development Crises in Latin America: The End of An Illusion'', showed the negative effects of the 1980s [[Latin American debt crisis]] on the region's economic development.&lt;ref&gt;''Debt and Development Crises in Latin America: The End of An Illusion'', with Osvaldo Sunkel, Oxford University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; She was an early advocate of [[debt relief]] in [[Latin America]] and [[Sub-saharan Africa]].

Writing with [[Ricardo Ffrench-Davis]] in the 1990s she contributed to the debate on how [[Latin America]] could curb and manage volatile [[capital flows]].&lt;ref&gt;''Coping With Capital Surges: The Return of Finance to Latin America'', edited with Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, Lynne Rienner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; She again warned of the risks of costly [[financial crises]] if sufficient measures such as [[capital controls]] were not implemented.

After several financial crises, mainly in [[developing countries]], she started in the mid-1990s to advocate capital flow regulations in capital source countries as a way to curb excessive and volatile [[capital flows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondad.org/uploaded/Currency%20Crises/CurrencyCrises-Griffith-Jones.pdf How Can Future Currency Crises Be Prevented or Better Managed?], in Teunissen, Jan Joost, ''Can Currency Crises Be Prevented or Better Managed? Lessons from Mexico'', FONDAD, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; She believed this would reduce the risk of major reversals of capital flows and the [[financial crises]] that result from them. This is further discussed in her 1998 book ''Global Capital Flows, should they be regulated?''&lt;ref&gt;''Global Capital Flows, should they be regulated?'' with preface by [[Nobel prize]] winner  [[James Tobin]], Macmillan and St. Martin’s Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In the discussion on reform of the [[international financial architecture]] she contributed to the analysis of crisis prevention, especially through financial regulation and more effective financial crisis management. For example, she advocated [[special drawing rights]] issues by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) as a means to provide official [[liquidity]] when private capital flows fall sharply. She also advocated expanded and less conditional IMF lending so countries do not have to unnecessarily adjust their economies, especially in the face of financial crises or other external shocks.

Writing with [[José Antonio Ocampo]] since the late 1990s&lt;ref&gt;[http://depot.gdnet.org/gdnshare/pdf2/gdn_library/annual_conferences/sixth_annual_conference/griffith_paper.pdf What Progress on International Financial Reform? Why so Limited?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814124917/http://depot.gdnet.org/gdnshare/pdf2/gdn_library/annual_conferences/sixth_annual_conference/griffith_paper.pdf |date=2011-08-14 }} - written with José Antonio Ocampo and Jacques Cailloux, EGDI, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; they expanded the concept of [[counter-cyclical]] reform of the [[international financial system]] to help stabilise capital flows and domestic private lending. The aim was to avoid frequent costly crises, facilitate [[macro-economic]] management and to achieve stable and inclusive economic growth in developing countries.

She has worked on practical policy applications of these ideas. She has advocated reform of [[compensatory financing]] at the IMF in the face of external shocks to make it larger, speedier and with less [[conditionality]]. Similarly she was an early supporter of expanding [[International financial institutions|development banks]] - nationally, regionally and multilaterally - and their role in [[counter-cyclical]] lending. She has also advocated the issue of [[GDP-linked bonds]] as a [[counter-cyclical]] mechanism to reduce the risk of [[financial crises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/b7155454-1039-11db-8f6f-0000779e2340.html "A bond that insures against instability"], with [[Robert J. Shiller]], The Financial Times, July 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; She has long supported the idea of counter-cyclical regulation. These and other practical measures are aimed at reforming the [[financial system]] so that it supports stable inclusive economic growth without costly [[financial crises]].

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Beckett was born in South Africa, and raised in [[Edinburgh, Scotland|Edinburgh]], Scotland, where her father was studying medicine. In 1946, she entered the [[Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur]], a Roman Catholic [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] of [[Religious Sister]]s dedicated to education. She was sent to England where she completed her [[novitiate]] and then studied at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] where she was awarded a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Variations of first-class honours|congratulatory first class honours]] degree&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/john-walsh-meets-sister-wendy-beckett-1338165.html John Walsh Interview, ''The Independent''] 22 June 1996; retrieved 28 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in English Literature.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Clive Anderson, BBC Radio 2, 28 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside her academic work, she lived in a [[convent]] which maintained the strict code of silence typical in convents prior to the reforms following the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65). After attending the [[Notre Dame College of Education (Liverpool)]] and earning a teaching diploma in 1954, she returned to South Africa to teach at Notre Dame Convent, a school for girls in [[Constantia, Cape Town|Constantia]], Cape Town, where she taught English and Latin. Later she moved to Johannesburg where she was appointed the [[superior (hierarchy)|superior]] of the local convent, while she also lectured at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Return to England===
In 1970, health problems forced Beckett to abandon teaching and to return to England. She obtained [[papal]] permission to leave her congregation and to become a consecrated virgin and hermit. She began living in a [[caravan (towed trailer)]] on the grounds of a [[Quidenham Hall|Carmelite monastery]] at [[Quidenham]], Norfolk, and her caravan was later replaced by a mobile home.&lt;ref name=wintle/&gt; Besides receiving the [[Carmelite]] [[prioress]] and a nun who brings her provisions, she dedicates her life solely to solitude and prayer, but allotting two hours of work per day to earn her living.

==Interest in art==
Sister Wendy spent many years translating [[Medieval Latin]] scripts before deciding, in 1980, to pursue art. Her first book, ''Contemporary Women Artists,'' was published in 1988&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Sister-Wendy-Beckett|title = Sister Wendy Beckett {{!}} British nun and art critic|website = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date = 2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.  Sister Wendy Contemplates Saint Paul in Art'' was published in 2008 to celebrate the Year of Saint Paul. In May 2009, ''Encounters with God: In Quest of the Ancient Icons of Mary'' was published, which follows Beckett's pilgrimage to see the earliest icons of Mary which had survived the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]]. Beckett continued writing about her interest in [[icon]]s in the second volume of her ''Sister Wendy Contemplates'' series, published in July 2011. This book, entitled ''The Iconic Jesus'', takes the reader through scenes from the [[New Testament]], accompanied by Sister Wendy's reflections. Her next book, published in 2011, ''The Christ Journey'', consists of her commentaries on the artwork of Greg Tricker.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Beckett (2011) ''The Christ journey: Sister Wendy Beckett reflects on the art of Greg Tricker'', St Paul's Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8543-9822-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Beckett required medical treatment as an outpatient at a local hospital, the television chef [[Delia Smith]], a Roman Catholic convert, volunteered, through a mutual friend, to drive her there each week. Smith also drove her around the country to meet the artists when Beckett was writing her book about contemporary women artists. Through this the two became good friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3341912/Delia-Smith-on-How-to-Cheat-at-Cooking.html|location=London|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Mick|last=Brown|title=Delia Smith on How to Cheat at Cooking|date=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having overheard her commentary while attending an art exhibit, a film crew asked to videotape her.  This brought her to the attention of a BBC producer and led, in 1992, to the debut ''Sister Wendy’s Odyssey''.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

==Views==
=== Same-sex marriage ===
In 2007 Beckett was asked, "You've spoken out about gay marriage. How do you balance what you believe with what you have sworn to uphold?"  She replied:
{{quote|I believe in loyalty. We should respect our church, but never believe that the church has the last word. The church is saying 'this', but I believe that sooner or later 'this' will change. 'This' is not the mind of our Lord. God is all love. It's a delicate balancing thing. The Church has changed its position over the years, and because the spirit is with the Church, in the end the Church will always get it right. But in the end. The spirit of the Church is the meaning of love, which hasn't yet, perhaps, been fully understood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/verena-von-pfetten/sister-wendy-my-semispiri_b_75338.html?

He is linked to the [[Neoclassical realism]]-school and known for his work on American unipolarity, especially in collaboration with [[Stephen Brooks (academic)|Stephen Brooks]].

'''Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili''' ({{lang-ru|Евге́ний Я́ковлевич Джугашви́ли}}; 10 January 1936 – 22 December 2016) was a [[Soviet Air Force]] colonel. He was the son of [[Yakov Dzhugashvili]], the eldest son of Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], and gained notice as a defender of his grandfather's reputation. In the [[Russian legislative election, 1999|1999 elections]] of the Russian [[State Duma]], he was one of the faces of the [[Stalin Bloc – For the USSR]], a league of [[Communist party|communist parties]]. He resided in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], his grandfather's homeland.

==Dzhugashvili vs. ''Novaya Gazeta''==
In September 2009, Dzhugashvili made international headlines when he sued the Russian newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' after the magazine published an article claiming his grandfather personally signed execution orders against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE57U4WH20090831?rpc=64|title=Grandson sues to clear Stalin over killings|work=Reuters|date=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October 2009, the Russian court rejected Dzhugashvili's case, stating that its reasons would be made public at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian court rejects Stalin case|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8305759.stm | date=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dzhugasvili was given five days to appeal.

==Criticism of Putin==
In January 2015, responding to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]’s macho acts in a video, where he appears shirtless and is seen taming and riding a horse, Dzhugashvili said it is "all a publicity stunt and only showed how the president was leading the country without brains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/register/yevgeny-dzhugashvili-2h07f5nll|title=Yevgeny Dzhugashvili (obiuary)|work=The Times|location=London|date=28 December 2016|accessdate=29 December 2016}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' additionally stated he had said "the mess in Russia would have been avoided if Stalin had lived for five more years".&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.ibtimes.com/stalins-grandson-flays-putin-calls-him-brainless-1416466 Stalin’s Grandson Flays Putin, Calls Him “Brainless”]. 31 January 2015.
