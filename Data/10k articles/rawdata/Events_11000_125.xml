The '''48th World Science Fiction Convention''' ([[Worldcon]]), was '''ConFiction''', which was held in [[The Hague]], Netherlands 23rd-27 August 1990 at the [[World Forum (The Hague)|Netherlands Congress Centre]]. This convention was one of the two [[Worldcon]]s held in continental Europe, the other being the [[28th World Science Fiction Convention]] held in [[West Germany]].

== Participants ==
The guests of honour for the convention were [[Joe Haldeman]], [[Wolfgang Jeschke]] and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], with [[Chelsea Quinn Yarbro]] as [[Toastmaster]] and [[Andrew I. Porter]] as [[science fiction fandom|Fan]] Guest of Honour. The organising committee was chaired by Kees van Toorn. The total membership of the convention was 3580, despite the preparations for the [[Gulf war]] which deterred many Americans from traveling.

This was the first [[Worldcon]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], so was the first convention which many fans, writers and editors from [[Eastern Block|Eastern European]] countries were able to attend.  The convention was opened by the then Minister of Cultural Affairs of the Netherlands, and the [[Hugo Award|Hugos]] were presented by the U.S. [[Ambassador]] to the Netherlands.

{{Campaignbox Civil Wars of the Early Caliphates}}
'''Abu Hatim al-Harith ibn Surayj ibn Yazid ibn Sawa ibn Ward ibn Murra ibn Sufyan ibn Mujashi'''&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; ({{lang-ar|أبو حاتم الحارث بن سريج}}) was an [[Arabs|Arab]] leader of a large-scale social rebellion against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in [[Khurasan]] and [[Transoxiana]]. Harith's rebellion began in 734 and represented the grievances of both the local Arab settlers as well as the native Iranian converts (''[[mawali]]''), who were not recognized as equal to the Arab Muslims, against the Umayyad regime. Harith based his revolt on religious grounds and won over a large part of both the Arab settlers and the native population, but failed twice to capture the provincial capital of [[Marw]]. The rebellion was finally suppressed by [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] in 736. Along with a few supporters, Harith escaped capture and allied himself with the heathen [[Turgesh]]. Harith accompanied the Turgesh ''khagan'' [[Suluk (Turgesh khagan)|Suluk]] in his invasion deep into Arab territory, which was decisively beaten back in the [[Battle of Kharistan]] in 737. With Turgesh power collapsing thereafter, Harith remained in Transoxiana supported by the native princes. Asad's successor, [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]], campaigned against Harith and his native supporters, but eventually, hoping to use him to bolster his position in the Arab intertribal rivalries, Nasr secured for Harith a pardon from the Caliph. Harith returned to [[Marw]] in 745. Soon however he raised a sizeable armed force and challenged Nasr's authority, until he was killed in a clash with his ally [[Juday' al-Kirmani]] in 746. His revolt weakened Arab power in Central Asia and facilitated the beginning of the [[Abbasid Revolution]] that would overthrow the Umayyads.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and start of the rebellion ===
Harith was from the [[Banu Tamim|Tamim]] tribe belonging to the north Arab ([[Mudar]]i) tribal supergroup,&lt;ref name="Hawting86"&gt;Hawting (2000), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and hailed from [[Basra]], where his father, Surayj, lived.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Kister (1971), pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; He is first mentioned in 729, when he distinguished himself for his bravery and self-sacrifice against the [[Turgesh]], [[Battle of Baykand|saving the Arab army]] from annihilation at [[Baykand]] near [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibb (1923), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Harith is next mentioned in 733, when he led a protest in Lower [[Tokharistan]] against the commandeering of supplies from the province, already plagued by drought and famine, to feed the capital of [[Khurasan]] at [[Marw]], by the governor [[Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri]]. Junayd had Harith flogged, but after Junayd died in early 734, the discontent erupted into an open rebellion, with Harith at its head.&lt;ref name="Gibb76"&gt;Gibb (1923), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of Khurasan and Transoxiana in the 8th century]]
The motives and nature of Harith's rebellion are debated. His public demands were phrased in religious terms, demanding the end of injustice through the "application of the [[Quran|Book]] and the ''[[Sunnah|sunna]]''" by the government. Harith himself is said to have been a member of the obscure pietistic group known as ''[[Murji'a]]'', and to have led an ascetic life. In the words of the Arabist [[Meir J. Kister]], he apparently had "a feeling of mission" and aimed to establish a "just government resembling that of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] and the [[Rashidun|first Caliphs]]".&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawting86"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; His movement shared many ideological and symbolic elements with contemporary [[Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijite]] agitation directed against the Umayyad regime, including the use of black flags hearkening back to the [[Black Standard|banner of the Prophet]] and even the demand for theocratic rule by a member of the [[Ahl al-Bayt|Prophet's family]]. Harith's movement was marked by an unusual idealism, however, and it is recorded that his adherents tried to persuade their opponents to join them through moral and religious invocations even during battles.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon (1990), pp. 28–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Harith advocated various reforms, the most prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (''[[mawali]]'') with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, in conformity with the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph [[Umar II]] (r. 717–720) and by the governors [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] and [[Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami]], but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous ''mawali'' would not have to pay the [[Tax per head|poll tax]]) put an end to this, leading to a first rebellion in 728 under [[Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif]]. Many of the groups and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 177, 332 (Note 57)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), pp. 80, 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon (1990), pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the ''[[ajam|ʿajam]]'' (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the [[Azd]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharon (1990), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the [[Battle of the Defile]] in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups.&lt;ref name="Gibb76"/&gt; This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20,000 [[Iraq]]i troops into the province in the aftermath of the Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 114–118&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus it was that when the news of Junayd's death reached the small town of [[Andkhuy]] in [[Guzgan]], one of the remotest Arab outposts, the local Arab garrison followed Harith in rebellion. Junayd's successor, [[Asim ibn Abdallah al-Hilali]], who had just arrived at Marw, tried to placate the rebels and sent emissaries to them, but Harith simply imprisoned them. As the revolt spread through the surrounding countryside, Harith, with a force of 4,000 men, marched on [[Balkh]], the chief city of Tokharistan, held by [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]] with 10,000 troops. Although Nasr did not support Harith's movement, such was the level of disaffection among the Khurasanis that he and his men offered little opposition. Balkh was captured by Harith's men with ease, while Nasr and his troops withdrew from the scene and gave their support to neither Harith nor Asim.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibb (1923), pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that, the Arab garrison at [[Marw al-Rudh]] also joined with Harith's forces. The autonomous native [[Hephthalite]] princes of Guzgan, [[Faryab]] and [[Talqan]] also seized the opportunity to join the revolt with their forces, hoping to re-establish their independence and perhaps reduce the Arab power in Khurasan to a dependent principality around Marw.&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

Harith now turned his sights on Marw and set out for the capital, where he also had sympathizers. However, Asim managed to cement the loyalty of the wavering Khurasanis by threatening to abandon the city for [[Naysabur]] on the western fringes of Khurasan. There he would rely on the [[Qays]]i tribesmen whose loyalty to the Umayyad regime was known, and ask for reinforcements from Syria. Coupled with the presence of the numerous natives in Harith's army, which lent it the appearance of a foreign army, the local Arab elites chose to rally behind Asim.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaban119"&gt;Shaban (1979), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; As it neared Marw, Harith's army had swelled to some 60,000 men as the ''mawali'' flocked to his banner, according to the report of [[al-Tabari]]. Asim's force was considerably smaller, and less eager: he had to pay them extra money in order to induce them to fight. Nevertheless, he marched out of Marw and took up positions behind a canal at Zarq, destroying its bridges. As Harith's army approached and repaired the bridges, more than 2,000 Arabs from his ranks deserted to Asim, evidently mistrusting the intentions of the native troops of Harith's army. In the subsequent battle, Asim gained a major victory, as many of Harith's troops drowned in the canal.&lt;ref name="Shaban119"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blankinship178"&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this failure, most of the ''mawali'' and native princes abandoned Harith, whose army was reduced to a loyal core of some 3,000 men. This forced Harith to accept a peace offer from Asim—who likewise could not count on the continued support of the Khurasani Arabs now that the danger from the natives had passed—and retired to Andkhuy. However, in the next year Harith renewed his revolt and marched again on Marw. Asim could not persuade the Khurasanis to fight for him, and was left with only some 1,000 Syrians and [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazirans]] from his personal guard. Harith's forces were not much larger either, being reduced to the garrison of Marw al-Rudh. In the ensuing battle at the village of al-Dandanqan near Marw, Asim again emerged victorious, forcing Harith to flee to Marw al-Rudh.&lt;ref name="Blankinship178"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 119–121&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his victories, Asim's position was still perilous. He was essentially reduced to Marw and the western, Qaysi regions of Khurasan around Naysabur. In addition, as he explained in a letter to the Caliph, as a Syrian, he faced difficulty in persuading the Khurasanis and even the Iraqi troops to fight under him against one of their own.&lt;ref name="Blankinship178-9"&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Asim further requested that Khurasan be placed under the governor of [[Iraq]], [[Khalid ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]], and that Syrian troops be dispatched into the province. In response, Khalid's brother Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, who had already served before as governor of Khurasan, was sent to replace him. News of this, combined probably with pressure from the Khurasanis of Marw, led Asim to again conclude a truce with Harith. According to some accounts, he even agreed to join Harith in demanding from the Caliph the "application of the Book and the ''sunna''", and revolt should the Caliph refuse. Shaban rejects this story altogether, but Blankinship regards it as reliable, although he too considers it a mere tactical ploy to gain time by Asim.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blankinship178-9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

=== End of the rebellion, the Turgesh intervention and exile ===
{{Campaignbox Muslim conquest of Transoxiana}}
Asad arrived in Khurasan with 20,000 Syrian troops, and immediately took the offensive against Harith. Asad's campaign was costly, but after his first successes the Khurasani Arabs began to flock to him. Asad's success was aided by his long-standing personal relations with the local Arab tribal leaders, as well as by the continuing tribal rivalries: as a [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Yamani]] opposed to the Mudari Harith, he could count on the support of his fellow tribesmen—thus most of the [[Rabi'ah]], the traditional enemies of Harith's Tamim tribe, son defected to him. Asad divided his forces, sending the [[Kufa]]n and Syrian troops under Abd al-Rahman ibn Na'yum towards [[Marw Rudh]], where Harith's main army was located, while he himself with the [[Basra]]ns and remaining Khurasanis marched on the fortresses of Amul and Zamm. The rebel forces at Amul surrendered and were pardoned, and the garrison of Balkh followed soon after. Harith himself abandoned Marw Rudh and retreated across the Oxus before Abd al-Rahman, finding refuge with the princes of Tokharistan. With their aid, he laid siege to the major crossing point over the Oxus at [[Tirmidh]]. In the face of Harith's forces, Asad's troops dared not cross the Oxus but retreated to Balkh. However, the Tirmidh garrison managed to defeat Harith, who was weakened after a quarrel with the king of [[Principality of Khuttal|Khuttal]], and who now retired eastwards to the mountains of [[Badakhshan]]. Asad followed up this success by persuading the garrison of Zamm to surrender on promises of amnesty and double pay, and by an unsuccessful expedition to recover [[Samarqand]], which had been lost in the aftermath of the Defile.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibb (1923), pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next year, 736, Asad's forces cleared the mountains of Upper Tokharistan from the remnants of Harith's supporters. The fortress of Tabushkhan, where many of Harith's followers and relatives had found refuge, was besieged by [[Juday' al-Kirmani]]. After they surrendered, most of the men were executed, while the rest were sold into slavery. Harith himself on the other hand continued to escape capture.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; In 737, Asad led his troops again north of the Oxus in a retaliatory campaign against Khuttal, whose ruler had allied himself with both Harith and the Turgesh. While the Arab troops were dispersed ravaging the countryside, the Turgesh ''[[khagan]]'' [[Suluk (Turgesh khagan)|Suluk]], responding to the pleas for help by the Khuttalan king, launched an attack that precipitated a headlong flight back by Asad's army across the Oxus. The Turgesh followed after them and [[Battle of the Baggage|attacked and captured]] the Arab baggage train on 1 October, before both sides settled for winter quarters. Harith now emerged from hiding and joined the ''khagan''.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibb (1923), pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Harith now counselled the ''khagan'' to take advantage of the dispersal of the Arab army to its winter quarters, and resume his advance. Following Harith's advice, in early December the ''khagan'' led the Turgesh army, 30,000 strong and comprising contingents from virtually every native ruler of Transoxiana and Upper Tokharistan, south, bypassing Balkh, into Guzgan, hoping to raise the Hephthalite princes of Lower Tokharistan in revolt as well. In this he failed, as the king of Guzgan joined Asad, who was approaching with what forces he could muster. Asad's advance caught the ''khagan'' and Harith off guard: Asad came upon them near Kharistan when they were accompanied by only 4,000 men, the rest having scattered to plunder and forage. In the ensuing [[Battle of Kharistan]], Asad routed the Turgesh. Harith, who fought with distinction, and the ''khagan'' barely escaped themselves and fled north over the Oxus.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibb (1923), pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawting87"&gt;Hawting (2000), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Asad's victory at Kharistan saved Arab rule in Central Asia. The Turgesh detachments south of the Oxus were largely destroyed piecemeal by Juday' al-Kirmani, ending the threat to Khurasan, and the loyalty of the native rulers of Tokharistan was cemented. The ''khagan''′s prestige took a serious hit, which encouraged his domestic rivals, who were backed secretly by the Chinese. In early 738, the ''[[tarkhan]]'' [[Kursul]] assassinated Suluk, whereupon the Turgesh realm collapsed in civil war. Asad too died soon after, and was succeeded by Nasr ibn Sayyar in July 738.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibb (1923), pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing is known of Harith's activities during the next two years, but he evidently remained in northern Transoxiana, based at al-Shash ([[Tashkent]]) and in close contact with the Turgesh. In 740 or 741, after having consolidated his authority in Khurasan and carried out tax reforms that eased the social unrest, Nasr ibn Sayyar advanced into the middle [[Jaxartes]] valley, making for Shash. His campaign was part of Nasr's efforts to re-establish Arab control over Transoxiana, but, according to [[H.A.R. Gibb]] and Kister, the main objective was the expulsion of Harith from Shash, who might still unite the Turgesh and the native princes against the Arabs. In the event, Nasr was prevented from crossing the Jaxartes by an army composed of Turgesh, troops from Shash and Harith's followers, and was forced to withdraw after a negotiated settlement, which among other terms stipulated the removal of Harith and his adherents to the remote town of [[Farab]].&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibb (1923), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Khurasan, second rebellion and death ===
Nasr's campaigns and reforms consolidated Muslim rule over Khurasan and much of Transoxiana, but his success was fragile: the native princes resented their loss of autonomy and the increasing assimilation of their people by their Arab conquerors and sent embassies to the Chinese court for aid, while the rivalry between the Mudari and Yamani tribal groups, evident across the Muslim world, still divided the Arabs themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Gibb (1923), pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; On the accession of the pro-Yemenite caliph [[Yazid III]] in 744, the Khurasani Yemenites supported Juday' al-Kirmani's candidature as governor, and when this did not come about, they rebelled. Consequently, Nasr felt it necessary to bring Harith and his adherents back, to both strengthen his own position—Harith and his followers had a long history of enmity towards al-Kirmani—and remove a potential source for another foreign invasion. Nasr secured a full pardon for Harith and his supporters from Yazid. Their confiscated property was returned, and the Caliph even promised to rule "according to the Book and the ''sunna''".&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 134–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon (1990), pp. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt;

When Harith arrived at Marw in early July 745, however, the situation had changed: Yazid was dead, a [[Third Fitna|full-blown civil war]] had erupted in Syria, and Nasr ibn Sayyar, although still occupying the position of governor, lacked authority. Although he recognized [[Marwan II]] (r. 744–750), most of his own followers did not accept Marwan as Caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharon45"&gt;Sharon (1990), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Harith was quick to distance himself from Nasr: he refused the offer of a district governorship, and distributed the gifts he received among his supporters.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharon45"/&gt; Harith vocally denounced Marwan II, and was soon joined by 3,000 of his fellow Tamimis, while his secretary, [[Jahm ibn Safwan]], drummed up further support. Within a short time, he had become a graver threat to Nasr than al-Kirmani. After attempts to negotiate an agreement proved fruitless, Nasr attacked Harith's forces in March 746, and scored a first victory over them, in which Jahm ibn Safwan fell. At this point, al-Kirmani joined forces with Harith, and together they forced Nasr to abandon Marw and withdraw to Naysabur. The two allies entered the capital of Khurasan, but within days fell out and began fighting each other. In these clashes, Harith was killed, leaving al-Kirmani the master of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon (1990), pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between Nasr and al-Kirmani continued, but was soon overtaken by events: exploiting the conditions of civil war, the [[Abbasids]] under [[Abu Muslim]] launched their own anti-Umayyad revolt in Khurasan. Nasr ibn Sayyar tried to conclude an alliance with al-Kirmani, but failed when the latter was murdered by one of Harith's sons in revenge. Abu Muslim managed to exploit the situation to his advantage, and in early 748, his men entered Marw, the first step in a war that would lead to the fall of the Umayyad dynasty and its replacement with the Abbasids two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), pp. 108–109, 116–118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaban (1979), pp. 137ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon (1990), pp. 49ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta''' is a yearly [[hot air balloon festival]] that takes place in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]],  during early October. The Balloon Fiesta is a nine-day event from October 6th to October 14th, and has over 500 [[hot air balloon]]s each year. The event is the largest balloon festival in the [[world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/travel/escapes/20Ahead.html | work=The New York Times | first=Chris | last=Dixon | title=Up, Up and Gently Away | date=July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
[[Image:AIBF Big green cat.jpg|thumb|Big Green Cat, 2007 Fiesta]]
[[Image:AIBF, The Approach, 2007.jpg|thumb|Close Encounter, 2007 Fiesta]]

The Balloon Fiesta began in 1972 as the highlight of a 50th birthday celebration for [[KKOB (AM)|770 KOB Radio]]. Radio station manager Dick McKee asked Sid Cutter, owner of [[Cutter Flying Service]] and the first person to own a hot air balloon in New Mexico, if KOB could use his new hot-air balloon as part of the festivities. The two began discussing ballooning, along with conversation and help from Oscar Kratz, and McKee asked what the largest gathering of hot air balloons to date had been. 19 balloons in England, Cutter replied. Kratz asked "Can we get 19 here?" Cutter agreed to try. He got commitments from 21 pilots, but bad weather kept some of them from arriving in time. The first fiesta ended up as a gathering of 13 balloons on April 8, 1972, sponsored by KOB. The first event was located in the parking lot of the Coronado Center Shopping Mall with 20,000 spectators and with balloonists from Arizona, California, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Texas taking part. McKee, Cutter, and Kratz are the three men who had originally started the balloon races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destination360.com/north-america/us/new-mexico/albuquerque-balloon-festival.php Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, Albuquerque Hot Air Balloon Rides, Albuquerque Balloon F&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The first fiesta incorporated a "Roadrunner-Coyote Balloon Race" (a "hare-and-hounds" race elsewhere in the world) with 1 balloon being the "[[Wile E. Coyote|Roadrunner]]" and the others being "[[Wile E. Coyote|Coyote]]" balloons (the "Roadrunner" balloon was actually emblazoned with likenesses of both Warner Bros. characters). The winner of the race - the "Coyote" that landed closest to the Roadrunner - was Don Piccard of the noted aerostation dynasty, flying a balloon of his company's design and construction (his wife also placed in the race). This race has continued as part of the Balloon Fiesta today.

The next year Albuquerque hosted the first World Hot-Air Balloon Championships in February and the fiesta became an international event. In 1975 Albuquerque was looking at hosting the World Championships again, but the event was scheduled for October. So the fiesta was moved to correspond with the championships. To maintain interest in Albuquerque’s bid to host the championships, a balloon rally was held in February of that year. Autumn being a far better flying time than February, the event has remained in early October to the present day.

The Balloon Fiesta grew each year for decades, and today is the largest [[Hot air balloon festivals|balloon convention]] in the world. The number of registered balloons reached a peak of 1,019 in 2000, prompting the Balloon Fiesta Board to limit the number to 750 starting in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On any given day during the festival, up to 100,000 spectators may be on the launch field where they are provided the rare opportunity to observe inflation and take off procedures. Countless more people gather at landing sites all over the city to watch incoming balloons.

[[Image:Albuquerque BalloonFiesta.jpg|thumb|Mass ascension, 2006]]
[[Image:AIBF special shapes, 2008.jpg|thumb|Special Shapes Rodeo, 2008]]

===Dawn Patrol===
The Dawn Patrol began at the Balloon Fiesta in 1978, when two California balloonists developed position lighting systems that allowed them to fly at night. Dawn Patrol pilots take off before sunrise and fly until it is light enough to see landing sites. Fellow balloonists appreciate the Dawn Patrol because they can watch the balloons and get an early idea of wind speeds and directions at different altitudes.

===Mass Ascensions===
One of the biggest events of the fiesta, where all participating balloons launch in two waves, filling the sky with hundreds of balloons at once. Launch directors, also known as “zebras” because of their black-and-white-striped outfits, serve as “traffic cops,” coordinating the launch so balloons leave the field in a safe and coordinated manner.

===Artistic Vision===
Many local artists take advantage of the balloons as favorite subject matter [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081045/http://www.taospaint.com/Warm/HerUp.html for their paintings]. Balloons often land in Albuquerque [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081036/http://www.taospaint.com/BalloonsOver/OurHouse.html neighborhoods]. Many residents watch the balloons from the comfort of their backyards.

===Special Shape Rodeo===
Many non-traditional, uniquely shaped balloons are launched at the same time. Some of the most famous shapes include a milk cow, a wagon coach, twin bees, and many others like soda pop cans and animals. This is the most popular part of the event as families can see how balloons can be all different in shapes and sizes.

===Balloon Glows===
Large numbers of balloons are illuminated at night by their propane burners. They stand static and do not take off during these events. The "Glowdeo" is a night glow for the special shapes balloons.

===Special Events and Competitions===
Various events like:

*The Fiesta Challenge, a game where balloonists attempt to drop a marker closest to a target.
*America's Challenge Gas Balloon Race, where special long-distance gas balloons are inflated and then launched. The winner of the race is the balloon that travels the farthest. Some balloons in the race have gone as far as [[Canada]] and the U.S. East Coast.
*The Flight of the Nations Mass Ascension, where balloonists from each nation launch, one at a time, to their national anthem and waving their nation's flag.
*Other piloting, skill, and speed competitions.

== Local impact ==
The convention has also become a major showcase of [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] culture and history and features numerous cultural exhibitions .The fiesta is one of Albuquerque's largest tourist attractions and constitutes a major source of income for the city and local businesses. In 2015, the fiesta logged 955,703 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/blog/morning-edition/2015/11/by-the-numbersballoon-fiesta-saw-big-visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, tourists and fiesta visitors take thousands of pictures of the balloons, so it is no surprise that for several years the fiesta was sponsored by [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] and was given the title, the ''Kodak Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta'', though that title was usually only used in print ads and on official memorabilia. In 2018 the fiesta was presented by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], a Japanese camera and imaging company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balloonfiesta.com/|title=Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta presented by Canon|publisher=© 2017-2018 Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, Inc.|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albuquerque box ==
[[Image:Albuquerquebox.png|thumb|Diagram of the Albuquerque Box Effect when conditions are optimal]]

The success of the Fiesta depends in part on the cool Albuquerque morning temperatures in October and the ''Albuquerque box''. The "box" is a set of predictable wind patterns that can be exploited to navigate the balloons. At low elevations the winds tend to be [[Wind#Measurement|northerly]] (from the north), but at higher elevations they tend to be  [[Wind#Measurement|southerly]]. Balloonists use these winds to navigate in a vertical box: they ascend slightly from the launch park, move south, ascend further, move north, descend, and repeat the box or land back in the launch park or quite nearby.  During events involving on-field targets, such as the "Key Grab" (where pilots attempt to grab prizes, including a set of keys to a new vehicle, from atop tall, flexible poles), it's not uncommon to see the same balloon make 5 or 6 passes at the targets, simply by working the "Box" to keep returning to the field.

== Location ==
Balloon Fiesta Park, from which the balloons are launched, is located on the northern edge of the city. In 2005, the [[Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum]] was opened on the grounds. The museum is dedicated to the history, science, sport, and art of [[Balloon (aircraft)|ballooning]] and other innovative forms of flight.

'''Atamalqualiztli''' ('''The Eating of Water Tamales''' or the '''Festival of the Water Pancakes''') was an [[Aztec]] festival held every eight years, either in the month of [[Quecholli]] (late October-early November) or in [[Tepeilhuitl]] (beginning of October). It involved a week-long period of fasting, in which people ate nothing except for a daily midday portion of unseasoned [[tamales]] soaked in water. The festival was celebrated in order to allow the food to rest from being treated and cooked, with the belief that in this way the food would be revitalised. It was believed that those who did not celebrate the festival would be struck with [[leprosy]], and thus anyone who did not participate was disciplined. The morning after the festival was known as 'It is sprinkled with the acid of pepper', in honour of the end of the fast.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''basilar skull fracture''' is a [[bone fracture|break of a bone]] in the [[base of skull|base of the skull]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; Symptoms may include [[Battle sign|bruising behind the ears]], [[periorbital ecchymosis|bruising around the eyes]], or [[hemotympanum|blood behind the ear drum]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; A [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) leak occurs in about 20% of cases and can result in [[rhinorrhea|fluid leaking from the nose]] or [[otorrhea|ear]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; [[Meningitis]] is a complication in about 14% of cases.&lt;ref name=Nel2014/&gt; Other complications include [[cranial nerve]] or blood vessel injury.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
They typically require a significant degree of trauma to occur.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; The break is of at least one of the following bones: [[temporal bone]], [[occipital bone]], [[sphenoid bone]], [[frontal bone]], or [[ethmoid bone]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; They are divided into [[anterior fossa]], [[middle fossa]], and [[Posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]] fractures.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; [[Facial fractures]] often also occur.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; Diagnosis is typically by [[CT scan]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment is generally based on the injury to structures inside the head.&lt;ref name=Bau2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baugnon|first1=KL|last2=Hudgins|first2=PA|title=Skull base fractures and their complications|journal=Neuroimaging Clinics of North America|date=August 2014|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–65, vii–viii|doi=10.1016/j.nic.2014.03.001|pmid=25086806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery may be done for a CSF leak that does not stop or an injury to a blood vessel or nerve.&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt; Preventative [[antibiotics]] are of unclear use.&lt;ref name=Ra2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ratilal |first1=Bernardo O |last2=Costa |first2=João |last3=Pappamikail |first3=Lia |last4=Sampaio |first4=Cristina |last5=Ratilal |first5=Bernardo O |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=4 |issue= 4|pages=CD004884 |year=2015 |pmid=25918919 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004884.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nel2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nellis|first1=JC|last2=Kesser|first2=BW|last3=Park|first3=SS|title=What is the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in basilar skull fractures?|journal=The Laryngoscope|date=January 2014|volume=124|issue=1|pages=8–9|doi=10.1002/lary.23934|pmid=24122671}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in about 12% of people with a severe [[head injury]].&lt;ref name=Bau2014/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes).jpg|thumb|Bilateral raccoon eyes]]

*[[Battle's sign]] – [[ecchymosis|bruising]] of the [[mastoid process]] of the temporal bone.
*[[Raccoon eyes]] – bruising around the eyes, i.e. "[[black eye]]s"
*[[Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea]]
*[[Cranial nerve]] [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]]
*Bleeding (sometimes profuse) from the nose and ears
*[[Hemotympanum]]
*Conductive or perceptive [[deafness]], [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[vomitus]]
*In 1–10% of patients, [[optic nerve]] entrapment occurs.&lt;ref name="singh"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|907273|Pediatric Head Trauma}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optic nerve is compressed by the broken skull bones, causing irregularities in vision.
*Serious cases usually result in [[death]]

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:BasSkullFracMark.png|thumb|A basilar skull fracture as seen on CT]]
[[File:Cranial bones en.svg|thumb|Diagram showing bones that may be involved in a basilar skull fracture]]
Basilar skull fractures include breaks in the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[skull base]] or [[Anterior (anatomy)|anterior]] skull base. The former involve the occipital bone, temporal bone, and portions of the sphenoid bone; the latter, superior portions of the sphenoid and ethmoid bones. The [[temporal bone fracture]] is encountered in 75% of all basilar skull fractures and may be longitudinal, transverse or mixed, depending on the course of the fracture line in relation to the longitudinal axis of the [[petrous part of the temporal bone|pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|248108|Skull Fracture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bones may be broken around the [[foramen magnum]], the hole in the base of the skull through which the [[brain stem]] exits and becomes the [[spinal cord]], creating the risk that blood vessels and nerves exiting the hole may be damaged.&lt;ref name="BAIUSA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Brain Injury Association of America |url=http://www.biausa.org/about-brain-injury.htm |title=About Brain Injury |date=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the proximity of the [[cranial nerve]]s, injury to those nerves may occur.&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt; This can cause loss of function of the [[facial nerve]] or [[oculomotor nerve]] or hearing loss due to damage of [[cranial nerve VIII]].&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt;

==Management==
Evidence does not support the use of preventative [[antibiotic]]s regardless of the presence of a [[cerebrospinal fluid]] leak.&lt;ref name=Ra2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nel2014/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Non-displaced fractures usually heal without intervention. Patients with basilar skull fractures are especially likely to get [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name="Dagi"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dagi |first1=T.Forcht |last2=Meyer |first2=Frederick B. |last3=Poletti |first3=Charles A. |title=The incidence and prevention of meningitis after basilar skull fracture |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=295–8 |year=1983 |pmid=6680635 |doi=10.1016/0735-6757(83)90109-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in these cases is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=96|title = Antibiotics in base of skull fractures|accessdate = 2014-03-22|website = BestBets|last = Butler|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal bone fractures===
Acute injury to the internal [[carotid artery]] ([[carotid dissection]], occlusion, [[pseudoaneurysm]] formation) may be asymptomatic or result in life-threatening bleeding. They are almost exclusively observed when the [[carotid canal]] is fractured, although only a minority of carotid canal fractures result in vascular injury. Involvement of the petrous segment of the carotid canal is associated with a relatively high incidence of carotid injury.&lt;ref name="Resnick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Resnick |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Subach |first2=Brian R. |last3=Marion |first3=Donald W. |title=The Significance of Carotid Canal Involvement in Basilar Cranial Fracture |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1177–81 |year=1997 |pmid=9179890 |doi=10.1097/00006123-199706000-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Basilar skull fractures are a common cause of death in many [[motor racing]] accidents. Drivers who have died as a result of basilar skull fractures include [[Formula One]] drivers [[Roland Ratzenberger]] and [[Ayrton Senna]]; [[IndyCar]] drivers [[Bill Vukovich]] Sr., [[Tony Bettenhausen]] Sr., [[Floyd Roberts]], and [[Scott Brayton]]; [[NASCAR]] drivers [[Dale Earnhardt Sr.]], [[Adam Petty]], [[Tony Roper (racing driver)|Tony Roper]], [[Kenny Irwin Jr.]], [[Neil Bonnett]], [[John Nemechek]], [[J.D. McDuffie]], and [[Richie Evans]]; [[Champ Car|CART]] drivers [[Jovy Marcelo]], [[Greg Moore (race car driver)|Greg Moore]], and [[Gonzalo Rodríguez (racing driver)|Gonzalo Rodriguez]]; and [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] drivers [[Blaise Alexander]] and [[Slick Johnson]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

To prevent this injury many motor sports sanctioning bodies mandate the use of head and neck restraints, such as the [[HANS device]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIA makes HANS device mandatory|url=https://www.autosport.com/other/news/48615/fia-makes-hans-device-mandatory|website=Autosport|publisher=Autosport Media UK|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=9 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASCAR mandates HANS for 3 series|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/oct/18/20011018-030130-9993r/|website=The Washington Times|publisher=The Washington Times LLC|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=18 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSA confirms Motor Sports Council decisions regarding Frontal Head Restraints|url=https://www.msauk.org/MSA-confirms-Motor-Sports-Council-decision-regarding-Frontal-Head-Restraints|website=MSA|publisher=[[Motor Sports Association]]|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Head and Neck Restraints Mandatory!|url=https://www.scca-nnjr.com/index.php/member-services/region-news/53-head-and-neck-restraints-mandatory|website=NNJR SCCA|publisher=Sports Car Club of America|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HANS device has demonstrated its life-saving abilities multiple times, including Jeff Gordon at the 2006 Pocono 500, Michael McDowell at the Texas Motor Speedway in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2008/07/07/105709346/how-safe-is-racing|title=HOW SAFE IS RACING?|last=ANDERSON|first=LARS|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Robert Kubica at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, and [[Elliott Sadler]] at the Pocono Red Cross 500 in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/cup/news/story?id=5435268|title=Sadler: Sunday's crash hardest in Cup history|date=2010-08-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proprietor was Tom Miller, an aggressive businessman who would buy several neighboring properties as well. 

Bella Union Saloon was a relatively upscale establishment where town meetings came to be held.

In November 1878, Tom Miller went bankrupt and the Bella Union became a grocery store downstairs and a meeting hall named [[Mechanics Hall, Deadwood|Mechanics' Hall]] upstairs.

A fictionalized version of the saloon appeared in the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', where the owner was the character [[List of Deadwood characters#Cy_Tolliver|Cy Tolliver]]. In the 1953 musical, [[Calamity Jane (film)|''Calamity Jane'']], the character Henry Miller (not Tom), is the proprietor of the town's saloon and theater.

The '''Birkenhead dock disaster'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Damburst-Birkenhead-Dock-Disaster-March/dp/1901231747 Damburst], by Tom McCarthy (Countyvise, 2006). {{ISBN|1-901231-74-7}} {{ISBN|978-1901231748}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] that happened when a temporary [[dam]] collapsed during construction of the [[Vittoria Dock]] in [[Birkenhead]], [[Wirral Peninsula]], [[England]], on 6 March 1909. It left 14 workers (or "[[navvies]]")  dead and three injured. The disaster led to a huge public outpouring of sympathy and grief in the local area. However, the Government refused to hold a [[public inquiry]] and the cause of the disaster was never definitively established. Very little evidence or documentation surrounding the event now exists.

==Building the Vittoria Dock==
The £206,000 contract to build a dock on the Vittoria Wharf area of Birkenhead was awarded by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in 1905 to John Scott of Darlington. Scott was the son of [[Walter Scott (1st Baronet of Beauclerc)|Sir Walter Scott]] (1826-1910), one of the greatest regional [[civil engineering]] contractors of his era, and had recently built an extension to the docks in [[Middlesbrough]].
The Vittoria Dock - sited at the northern end of Vittoria Street - was to serve as an accessible, organised berthing facility for vessels, which were increasing in size.
Work began in 1905 and was due to be finished by the end of 1909. However, by March 1909 it was nine months ahead of schedule. The whole project was merely a few hours from completion when the disaster occurred.

==Disaster strikes==
Just after midnight on 6 March 1909, during a blinding snowstorm, disaster struck. A gang of navvies were working in a {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep pit}} which formed the entrance channel to the new dock. They were clearing away rubble and timber, which was hauled up to the dockside by a crane which straddled the excavation. The waters of the neighbouring [[Great Float|East Float]] were held back from the entrance channel by a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} temporary coffer dam, formed from pilings rammed with mud and cement, which had been built in 1907. There was only a small amount of work left to do, and the whole four-year dock project would be finished by the following evening.

High-tide in the River Mersey had been about 11:15 pm and the East Float was full of water. At around 12:25 am the foundation of the coffer dam gave way without warning; the fifteen workers were overwhelmed by water and debris.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; A platform carrying the crane, engine and boiler collapsed into the excavation, and, it is believed, trapped the men underwater.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; Fourteen men were killed, but one survived by clinging on the dock wall until he was rescued.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; The engine-driver and a boy acting as a signaller were swept into the water but were rescued; the boy being trapped between baulks of timer later had his leg amputated.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; The disaster widowed seven women and left 13 children fatherless. It took a month for divers to recover all the bodies, and the victims were buried in three mass graves in [[Flaybrick Hill Cemetery]], Birkenhead, now known as Flaybrick Memorial Gardens.

==Aftermath==
At the ensuing inquest, John Scott's chief engineer claimed that the disaster was probably caused when the base of the coffer dam shifted after pilings from the old dock wall were removed, and this event could not have been foreseen. However, this explanation was never independently tested or verified. One man—John Jones, the operator of the piledriving machine used to build the dam—bravely spoke out at the inquest, claiming there had been shoddy workmanship and rotten building materials had been used on the project. But his evidence was disregarded and the jury, heavily influenced by the coroner's summing-up, returned a verdict that no one was to blame. The Vittoria Dock opened for business four months after the disaster and is still in operation today.

==Facts==
In June 1997, Sheila White was the only woman working in the [[Maintenance of Way]] department at [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]]’s [[Tennessee]] Yard. When she applied for the job at BNSF, her previous experience operating forklifts was noted by Marvin Brown, her interviewer at BNSF. White was hired as a “track laborer,” a job that involves removing and replacing track components, transporting track material, cutting brush, and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the right-of-way. Soon after White arrived on the job, she was assigned to operate the forklift. While she also performed some of the other track laborer tasks, operating the forklift was White’s primary responsibility.

In September 1997, White complained to BNSF officials that her immediate supervisor, Bill Joiner, had repeatedly told her that women should not be working in the Maintenance of Way department. Joiner, White said, had also made insulting and inappropriate remarks to her in front of her male colleagues. After an internal investigation, Burlington suspended Joiner for 10 days and ordered him to attend a sexual-harassment training session.

On September 26, Brown told White about Joiner’s discipline. At the same time, he told White that he was removing her from forklift duty and assigning her to perform only standard track laborer tasks. Brown explained that the reassignment reflected co-worker’s complaints that, in fairness, a “‘more senior man’” should have the “less arduous and cleaner job” of forklift operator. 

On October 10, White filed a complaint with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)]]. She claimed that the reassignment of her duties amounted to unlawful gender-based discrimination and retaliation for her having earlier complained about Joiner. In early December, White filed a second retaliation charge with the Commission, claiming that Brown had placed her under surveillance and was monitoring her daily activities. That charge was mailed to Brown on December 8.

A few days later, White and her immediate supervisor, Percy Sharkey, disagreed about which truck should transport White from one location to another. Some aspects of this conversation are disputed, however later that day Sharkey told Brown that White had been insubordinate. Brown immediately suspended White without pay. White invoked internal grievance procedures. Those procedures led Burlington to conclude that White had not been insubordinate. Burlington reinstated White to her position and awarded her back pay for the 37 days she was suspended. White filed an additional retaliation charge with the EEOC based on the suspension.

[[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII]]’s anti-retaliation provision forbids employer actions that “discriminate against” an employee (or job applicant) because he has “opposed” a practice that Title VII forbids or has “made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in” a Title VII “investigation, proceeding, or hearing.” {{UnitedStatesCode|42|2000e–3}}(a).

==Judgment==
===First Instance===
After exhausting administrative remedies, White filed suit in federal court, where a jury rejected her claims of sex discrimination but awarded her damages of $43,000 after finding{{when?|date=September 2017}} that she had been retaliated against in violation of Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/04a0102p-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixth Circuit===
On appeal, Burlington Northern argued that White had not suffered "adverse employment action," and therefore could not bring the suit, because she had not been fired, demoted, denied a promotion, or denied wages. In November 2002, a panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] initially agreed, where Judge [[James S. Gwin]] was joined by Judge [[Robert B. Krupansky]], over the dissent of Judge [[Eric L. Clay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2634417903252430437&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''White v. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.], 310 F. 3d 443 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was reheard [[en banc]], however, and, in April 2004, the full court found for White, holding that the suspension without pay - even if back pay was eventually awarded - was an "adverse employment action," as was the change of responsibilities within the same job category.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13016717361869928651&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''White v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.''], 364 F.3d 789, 792 (6th Cir. 2004) (en banc).&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges differed as to the standard they should apply in assessing such claims.&lt;ref&gt;364 F. 3d, at 795–800, with id., at 809 (Clay, J., concurring)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court===
One hour of oral arguments were heard on April 17, 2006, where [[Gregory G. Garre]], the Deputy [[Solicitor General of the United States]], appeared as a friend for the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/05-259|website=[[Oyez Project]]|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2006, the Supreme Court delivered judgment unanimously in favor of Sheila White.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Totenberg|first1=Nina|title=Supreme Court Sides with Worker in Retaliation Suit|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5505828|accessdate=14 October 2017|work=[[Morning Edition]]|agency=[[NPR]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affirmed the decision of the Sixth Circuit, but for different reasons than those used by the lower court. Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] wrote for the majority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/burlington_northern_v_white.pdf ''The Supreme Court, 2005 Term — Leading Cases,''] 120 Harv. L. Rev. 312 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Alito concurred in the judgment, but disagreed with the majority’s interpretation of the antiretaliation provision of Title VII, writing that "[t]he practical consequences of the test that the majority adopts strongly suggest that this test is not what Congress intended."

==Significance==
It is claimed that this case radically changed the standard regarding what constitutes a “materially adverse action”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=533348566&lt;/ref&gt; regarding employees.

'''Computer security''', '''cybersecurity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schatz|first=Daniel|last2=Bashroush|first2=Rabih|last3=Wall|first3=Julie|date=2017|title=Towards a More Representative Definition of Cyber Security|url=https://commons.erau.edu/jdfsl/vol12/iss2/8/|journal=Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=|issn=1558-7215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''information technology security''' ('''IT security''') is the protection of [[computer system]]s from theft or damage to their [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]] or [[Data (computing)|electronic data]], as well as from [[denial-of-service attack|disruption]] or [[botnet|misdirection]] of the services they provide.

The field is growing in importance due to increasing reliance on computer systems, the [[Internet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs"], 7 May 2013, The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wireless network]]s such as [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]], and due to the growth of [[smart devices|"smart" devices]], including [[smartphone]]s, [[television]]s and the various tiny devices that constitute the [[Internet of things]]. Due to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, it is also one of the major challenges of the contemporary world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Tim |title=Global Cybersecurity: New Directions in Theory and Methods |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1569 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerabilities and attacks==
{{Main|Vulnerability (computing)}}

A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control. Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVE) database.

An ''exploitable'' vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or "[[Exploit (computer security)|exploit"]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Computer Security and Mobile Security Challenges |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979_Computer_Security_and_Mobile_Security_Challenges |website=researchgate.net |accessdate=2016-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012010519/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979_Computer_Security_and_Mobile_Security_Challenges |archivedate=12 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vulnerabilities are often hunted or exploited with the aid of [[Automated threat|automated tools]] or manually using customized scripts.

To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these [[threat (computer)|threats]] can typically be classified into one of these categories below:

===Backdoor===
A [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] in a computer system, a [[cryptosystem]] or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal [[authentication]] or security controls. They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.

===Denial-of-service attacks===
[[Denial of service attacks]] (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attack |url=https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |website=csa.gov.sg |accessdate=12 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806080013/https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |archivedate=6 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of [[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|Distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points – and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the [[zombie computer]]s of a [[botnet]], but a range of other techniques are possible including [[Distributed Reflection Denial of Service|reflection and amplification attacks]], where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.

===Direct-access attacks===
An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making [[operating system]] modifications, installing software [[computer worm|worms]], [[keystroke logging|keyloggers]], [[covert listening device]]s or using wireless mice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgtecs.com/2016/03/30/wifi-mouse-leave-billions-risk-computer-hack/ Wireless mouse leave billions at risk of computer hack: cyber security firm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403050123/http://gadgtecs.com/2016/03/30/wifi-mouse-leave-billions-risk-computer-hack/ |date=3 April 2016 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a [[CD-ROM]] or other bootable media. [[Disk encryption]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] are designed to prevent these attacks.

===Eavesdropping===
[[Eavesdropping]] is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] and [[Narus (company)|NarusInSight]] have been used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to eavesdrop on the systems of [[internet service provider]]s. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint [[electromagnetism|electro-magnetic]] transmissions generated by the hardware; [[TEMPEST]] is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.

=== Multivector, polymorphic attacks ===
Surfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Multi-Vector Attacks Demand Multi-Vector Protection |work=MSSP Alert |date=July 24, 2018 |url=https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-guests/multi-vector-attacks-demand-multi-vector-protection/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; polymorphic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Renee |last=Millman |title=New polymorphic malware evades three quarters of AV scanners |work=SC Magazine UK |date=December 15, 2017 |url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/new-polymorphic-malware-evades-three-quarters-of-av-scanners/article/718757/  }}&lt;/ref&gt; cyber threats surfaced that combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread. These threats have been classified as fifth generation cyberattacks.&lt;ref name=ovum&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Ovum |title=Thinking about cyberattacks in generations can help focus enterprise security plans |first=Rik |last=Turner |date=May 22, 2018 | work=Informa PLC | url=https://ovum.informa.com/resources/product-content/int003-000164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phishing===
[[Phishing]] is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.case.edu/its/kba/its-kba-27196-phishing-attempt/ |title=Identifying Phishing Attempts |publisher=Case |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913200707/http://www.case.edu/its/kba/its-kba-27196-phishing-attempt/ |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phishing is typically carried out by [[email spoofing]] or [[instant messaging]], and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of [[Social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]].

===Privilege escalation===
[[Privilege escalation]] describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to fool the system into giving them access to restricted data; or even to "[[superuser|become root]]" and have full unrestricted access to a system.

===Social engineering===
{{Main|Social engineering (security)}}

[[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Arcos Sergio |title=Social Engineering |url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043630/http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scam involves fake CEO emails sent to accounting and finance departments. In early 2016, the [[FBI]] reported that the scam has cost US businesses more than $2bn in about two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scannell|first1=Kara|title=CEO email scam costs companies $2bn|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/83b4e9be-db16-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html#axzz41pN5YBV4|accessdate=7 May 2016|work=Financial Times|issue=25 Feb 2016|date=24 Feb 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623105523/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/83b4e9be-db16-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html#axzz41pN5YBV4|archivedate=23 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] [[NBA]] team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president [[Peter Feigin]], resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 [[Form W-2|W-2]] tax forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bucks leak tax info of players, employees as result of email scam|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15615363/milwaukee-bucks-leak-tax-information-players-employees-result-email-scam|accessdate=20 May 2016|agency=Associated Press|date=20 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520144908/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15615363/milwaukee-bucks-leak-tax-informatiopn-players-employees-result-email-scam|archivedate=20 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spoofing===
{{Main|Spoofing attack}}
[[Spoofing attack|Spoofing]] is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data (such as an [[IP address]] or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.&lt;ref name="techopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5398/spoofing|title=What is Spoofing? – Definition from Techopedia|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630134737/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5398/spoofing|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199688975.001.0001/acref-9780199688975-e-4987|title=spoofing|access-date=8 October 2017|work=Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several types of spoofing, including:

* [[Email spoofing]], where an attacker forges the sending (''From'', or source) address of an email.
* [[IP address spoofing]], where an attacker alters the source IP address in a [[network packet]] to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system.
* [[MAC spoofing]], where an attacker modifies the [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]] of their [[network interface]] to pose as a valid user on a network.
* [[Biometrics|Biometric]] spoofing, where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Marcel|editor1-first=Sébastien|editor2-last=Nixon|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Li|editor3-first=Stan|year=2014|title=Handbook of Biometric Anti-Spoofing: Trusted Biometrics under Spoofing Attacks|url=https://link-springer-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4471-6524-8.pdf|format=PDF|language=English|location=London|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-6524-8|isbn=978-1-4471-6524-8|issn=2191-6594|lccn=2014942635|access-date=8 October 2017|via=Penn State University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tampering===
[[Tampering (crime)|Tampering]] describes a malicious modification of products. So-called [[Evil Maid attack|"Evil Maid" attacks]] and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Sean |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant |publisher=Ars Technica |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804130416/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |archivedate=4 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information security culture==
Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. ″Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture″ provides the following definition of information security culture: ″ISC is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contribute to the protection of information of all kinds.″&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Joo S., et al. "Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture." Australian Information Security Management Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security "effort" and often take actions that ignore organizational Information Security best interests.&lt;ref name=Reimers2017&gt;K. Reimers, D. Andersson (2017) [https://library.iated.org/view/REIMERS2017POS POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION NETWORK SECURITY: THE END USER CHALLENGE AND EVOLVING THREATS], ICERI2017 Proceedings, pp. 1787-1796.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows Information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In ″Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change″, authors commented, ″It′s a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.″ To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: Pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schlienger | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Teufel | first2 = Stephanie | year = 2003 | title = Information security culture-from analysis to change | url = | journal = South African Computer Journal | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 46–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policy.
*Strategic Planning: to come up with a better awareness program, clear targets need to be set. Clustering{{definition needed|date=July 2018}} people is helpful to achieve it.
*Operative Planning: a good security culture can be established based on internal communication, management-buy-in, and security awareness and a training program.&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"/&gt;
*Implementation: four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. They are:
# Commitment of the management
# Communication with organizational members
# Courses for all organizational members
# Commitment of the employees&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"/&gt;

==Systems at risk==
The growth in the number of computer systems, and the increasing reliance upon them of individuals, businesses, industries and governments means that there are an increasing number of systems at risk.

===Financial systems===

The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], SWIFT, investment banks, and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2996896|title=The New Market Manipulation|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=3 July 2017|publisher=|ssrn=2996896|journal= Emory Law Journal |volume=66|p=1253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Web sites and apps that accept or store [[credit card number]]s, brokerage accounts, and [[bank account]] information are also prominent hacking targets, because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money, making purchases, or selling the information on the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Financial Weapons of War |journal=Minnesota Law Review|year= 2016|ssrn=2765010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-store payment systems and [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and [[Personal identification number|PINs]].

===Utilities and industrial equipment===

Computers control functions at many utilities, including coordination of [[telecommunications]], the [[power grid]], [[nuclear power plant]]s, and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks.  The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected, but the [[Stuxnet]] worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable. In 2014, the [[Computer Emergency Readiness Team]], a division of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pagliery |first1=Jose |title=Hackers attacked the U.S. energy grid 79 times this year |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/18/technology/security/energy-grid-hack/ |website=CNN Money |publisher=Cable News Network |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218070238/http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/18/technology/security/energy-grid-hack |archivedate=18 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vulnerabilities in [[smart meter]]s (many of which use local radio or cellular communications) can cause problems with billing fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.securestate.com/blog/2012/02/16/vulnerabilities-in-smart-meters | title=Vulnerabilities in Smart Meters and the C12.12 Protocol | date=2012-02-16 | accessdate=4 November 2016 | publisher=SecureState | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017100223/https://www.securestate.com/blog/2012/02/16/vulnerabilities-in-smart-meters | archivedate=17 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity, [[air traffic control]] outages, loss of aircraft, and even loss of life.

===Consumer devices===
Desktop computers and laptops are commonly targeted to gather passwords or financial account information, or to construct a [[botnet]] to attack another target. [[Smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[smart watch]]es, and other [[mobile devices]] such as [[quantified self]] devices like [[activity tracker]]s have sensors such as cameras, microphones, GPS receivers, compasses, and [[accelerometers]] which could be exploited, and may collect personal information, including sensitive health information. Wifi, Bluetooth, and cell phone networks on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors, and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breach.&lt;ref name="nestwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/08/06/338334508/is-your-watch-or-thermostat-a-spy-cyber-security-firms-are-on-it|title=Is Your Watch Or Thermostat A Spy?

Vehicles are increasingly computerized, with engine timing, [[cruise control]], [[anti-lock brakes]], seat belt tensioners, door locks, [[airbag]]s and [[advanced driver-assistance systems]] on many models. Additionally, [[connected car]]s may use WiFi and Bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt; [[Self-driving car]]s are expected to be even more complex.

All of these systems carry some security risk, and such issues have gained wide attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | url=http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-02-06_MarkeyReport-Tracking_Hacking_CarSecurity%202.pdf | title=Tracking &amp; Hacking: Security &amp; Privacy Gaps Put American Drivers at Risk | date=2015-02-06 | accessdate=4 November 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109040112/http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-02-06_MarkeyReport-Tracking_Hacking_CarSecurity%202.pdf | archivedate=9 November 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=AOL|title=Cybersecurity expert: It will take a 'major event' for companies to take this issue seriously|url=https://www.aol.com/article/news/2016/12/26/expert-warns-major-event-will-need-to-happen-for-cybersecurity/21632630/|website=AOL.com|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120180918/https://www.aol.com/article/news/2016/12/26/expert-warns-major-event-will-need-to-happen-for-cybersecurity/21632630/|archivedate=20 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The problem with self-driving cars: who controls the code?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/the-problem-with-self-driving-cars-who-controls-the-code|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 January 2017|date=23 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316152605/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/the-problem-with-self-driving-cars-who-controls-the-code|archivedate=16 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples of risk include a malicious [[compact disc]] being used as an attack vector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf|title=Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces|year=2011|conference=SEC'11 Proceedings of the 20th USENIX conference on Security|pages=6–6|publisher=USENIX Association|location=Berkeley, CA, US|author1=Stephen Checkoway|author2=Damon McCoy|author3=Brian Kantor|author4=Danny Anderson|author5=Hovav Shacham|author6=Stefan Savage|author7=Karl Koscher|author8=Alexei Czeskis|author9=Franziska Roesner|author10=Tadayoshi Kohno|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221064614/http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the car's onboard microphones being used for eavesdropping.

=== Energy sector ===
In distributed generation systems, the risk of cyber attacks is real, according to ''Daily Energy Insider''. An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time, and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster. The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Authority within the city, with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility, [[Pepco]], the chance to better estimate energy demand. The D.C. proposal, however, would "allow third-party vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution, which could potentially create more opportunities for cyberattackers to threaten the electric grid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/13110-d-c-distributed-energy-proposal-draws-concerns-of-increased-cybersecurity-risks/|title=D.C. distributed energy proposal draws concerns of increased cybersecurity risks|last=Brandt|first=Jaclyn|date=2018-06-18|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of security breaches==
Serious financial damage has been caused by [[security breaches]], but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. "Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to [[computer virus|virus]] and [[computer worm|worm]] attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). The reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal."&lt;ref&gt;Cashell, B., Jackson, W. D., Jickling, M., &amp; Webel, B. (2004). The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attacks. Congressional Research Service, Government and Finance Division. Washington DC: The Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; Security breaches continue to cost businesses billions of dollars but a survey revealed that 66% of security staffs do not believe senior leadership takes cyber precautions as a strategic priority.&lt;ref name="secureworks"/&gt;{{third-party inline|date=October 2017}}

However, reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions. According to the classic [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the [[expected value]] of the loss resulting from a cyber/information [[security breach]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Lawrence |last2=Loeb |first2=Martin |title=The Economics of Information Security Investment |journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security |date=November 2002 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=438–457 |doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacker motivation==
As with [[physical security]], the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. Some are thrill-seekers or [[Vandalism|vandals]], some are activists, others are criminals looking for financial gain. State-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced, but started with amateurs such as [[Markus Hess]] who hacked for the [[KGB]], as recounted by [[Clifford Stoll]],  in ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.

A standard part of [[threat modelling]] for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system, and who might be motivated to breach it. The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured. A home [[personal computer]], [[bank]], and [[Classified information|classified]] military [[computer network|network]] face very different threats, even when the underlying technologies in use are similar.

==Computer protection (countermeasures)==
In computer security a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a [[Threat (computer)|threat]], a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]], or an [[attack (computing)|attack]] by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;{{IETF RFC|2828}} Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009&gt;[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227163121/http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf |date=27 February 2012 }} dated 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf|title=InfosecToday Glossary|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120041536/http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common countermeasures are listed in the following sections:

===Security by design===
{{Main|Secure by design}}

[[Secure by design|Security by design]], or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure.  In this case, security is considered as a main feature.

Some of the techniques in this approach include:
* The [[principle of least privilege]], where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] gains access to that part, they have only limited access to the whole system.
* [[Automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.
* [[Code review]]s and [[unit testing]], approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.
* [[Defense in depth (computing)|Defense in depth]], where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.
* Default secure settings, and design to "fail secure" rather than "fail insecure" (see [[fail-safe]] for the equivalent in [[safety engineering]]). Ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.
* [[Audit trail]]s tracking system activity, so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.
* [[Full disclosure (computer security)|Full disclosure]] of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the "[[vulnerability (computing)|window of vulnerability]]" is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.

===Security architecture===
The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture as "the design [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall [[information technology architecture]]. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes: confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and [[assurance services]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture Definitions: IT Security Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315012754/http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture |date=15 March 2014 }}. SecurityArchitecture.org, Jan, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Techopedia defines security architecture as "a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible." The key attributes of security architecture are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jannsen |first1=Cory |title=Security Architecture |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |website=Techopedia |publisher=Janalta Interactive Inc |accessdate=9 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003064643/http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |archivedate=3 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other.
* the determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practice, finances, and legal matters.
* the standardization of controls.

===Security measures===
A state of computer "security" is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response.  These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:

* [[User account]] [[access control]]s and [[cryptography]] can protect systems files and data, respectively.
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services, and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering.  Firewalls can be both hardware- or software-based.
* [[Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack [[forensics]], while [[audit trail]]s and [[data logging|logs]] serve a similar function for individual systems.
* "Response" is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of [[legal]] authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, a complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.

Today, computer security comprises mainly "preventive" measures, like firewalls or an [[exit procedure]]. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the [[Internet]], and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the [[network stack]] (or, in the case of most [[UNIX]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]], built into the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]) to provide real-time filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so-called "physical firewall", which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the [[Internet]].

Some organizations are turning to [[big data]] platforms, such as [[Apache Hadoop]], to extend data accessibility and [[machine learning]] to detect [[advanced persistent threat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|title=Cybersecurity at petabyte scale|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713120506/http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|archivedate=13 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|title=Why ONI May Be Our Best Hope for Cyber Security Now|last=Woodie|first=Alex|date=9 May 2016|work=|access-date=13 July 2016|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015812/https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organized response mechanisms in place. As a result, as Reuters points out: "Companies for the first time report they are losing more through electronic theft of data than physical stealing of assets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018 |title=Firms lose more to electronic than physical theft |publisher=Reuters |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925113829/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018 |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary obstacle to effective eradication of cyber crime could be traced to excessive reliance on firewalls and other automated "detection" systems. Yet it is basic evidence gathering by using [[packet capture appliance]]s that puts criminals behind bars.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Vulnerability management===
{{main|Vulnerability management}}
Vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying, and remediating or mitigating [[Software vulnerability|vulnerabilities]],&lt;ref&gt;Foreman, P: ''Vulnerability Management'', page 1. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-0150-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[software]] and [[firmware]]. Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and [[network security]].

Vulnerabilities can be discovered with a [[vulnerability scanner]], which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities,&lt;ref name="Codenomicon"&gt;Anna-Maija Juuso and Ari Takanen ''Unknown Vulnerability Management'', Codenomicon whitepaper, October 2010 {{cite web |url=http://www.codenomicon.com/solutions/unknown-vulnerability-management/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227073552/http://www.codenomicon.com/solutions/unknown-vulnerability-management/ |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[open port]]s, insecure software configuration, and susceptibility to [[malware]].

Beyond vulnerability scanning, many organisations contract outside security auditors to run regular [[penetration test]]s against their systems to identify vulnerabilities. In some sectors this is a contractual requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1-84928-554-4|title=PCI DSS: A Pocket Guide, 3rd Edition|author=Alan Calder and Geraint Williams|quote=network vulnerability scans at least quarterly and after any significant change in the network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reducing vulnerabilities===
While [[formal verification]] of the correctness of computer systems is possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/LICS.2003.1210044 |year=2003 |last1=Harrison |first1=J. |pages=45–54|journal=18th Annual IEEE Symposium of Logic in Computer Science, 2003. Proceedings |title=Formal verification at Intel |isbn=0-7695-1884-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Zerksis D. |last=Umrigar |first2=Vijay |last2=Pitchumani |chapter=Formal verification of a real-time hardware design |chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=800667 |title=Proceeding DAC '83 Proceedings of the 20th Design Automation Conference |publisher=IEEE Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-8186-0026-8 |pages=221–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not yet common. Operating systems formally verified include [[seL4]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sel4.systems/Docs/seL4-spec.pdf |title=Abstract Formal Specification of the seL4/ARMv6 API |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521171234/https://sel4.systems/Docs/seL4-spec.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SYSGO]]'s [[PikeOS]]&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Baumann, Bernhard Beckert, Holger Blasum, and Thorsten Bormer [http://www-wjp.cs.uni-saarland.de/publikationen/Ba10EW.pdf Ingredients of Operating System Correctness? Lessons Learned in the Formal Verification of PikeOS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719110932/http://www-wjp.cs.uni-saarland.de/publikationen/Ba10EW.pdf |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganssle.com/rants/gettingitright.htm "Getting it Right"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504191958/http://www.ganssle.com/rants/gettingitright.htm |date=4 May 2013 }} by Jack Ganssle&lt;/ref&gt; – but these make up a very small percentage of the market.

[[Two factor authentication]] is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information. It requires "something you know"; a password or PIN, and "something you have"; a card, dongle, cellphone, or other piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.

Social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information.  Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk, but even in a highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.

Enoculation, derived from [[inoculation theory]], seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Treglia, J., &amp; Delia, M. (2017). Cyber Security Inoculation. Presented at NYS Cyber Security Conference, Empire State Plaza Convention Center, Albany, NY, 3–4 June.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates, using a security scanner{{definition needed|date=July 2018}} or/and hiring competent people responsible for security.(This statement is ambiguous. Even systems developed by "competent" people get penetrated) The effects of data loss/damage can be reduced by careful [[backup|backing up]] and [[insurance]].

===Hardware protection mechanisms===
{{see also|Computer security compromised by hardware failure}}

While hardware may be a source of insecurity, such as with microchip vulnerabilities maliciously introduced during the manufacturing process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hacker-in-your-hardware/|title=The Hacker in Your Hardware: The Next Security Threat|work=Scientific American|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312221955/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hacker-in-your-hardware/|archivedate=12 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Waksman |first1=Adam |last2=Sethumadhavan |first2=Simha |title=Tamper Evident Microprocessors |volume= |pages= |periodical=Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy |location=Oakland, California |url=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf |year=2010 |issn= |doi= |isbn= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055451/http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; hardware-based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Using devices and methods such as [[dongle]]s, [[trusted platform module]]s, intrusion-aware cases, drive locks, disabling USB ports, and mobile-enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access (or sophisticated [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor access]]) required in order to be compromised.  Each of these is covered in more detail below.

* USB [[dongle]]s are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-spincorp.com/espinv3/index.php/solutions/3-solutions/174-sentinel-hasp-hl |title=Sentinel HASP HL |publisher=E-Spin |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220549/http://www.e-spincorp.com/espinv3/index.php/solutions/3-solutions/174-sentinel-hasp-hl |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device's software.  The dongle, or key, essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key.  The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) provides a stronger measure of security, since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it.  Another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing web-based content such as cloud software or [[Virtual Private Networks]] (VPNs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safenet-inc.com/multi-factor-authentication/authenticators/pki-usb-authentication/etoken-5200-token-based-authentication/ |title=Token-based authentication |publisher=SafeNet.com |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320234026/http://www.safenet-inc.com/multi-factor-authentication/authenticators/pki-usb-authentication/etoken-5200-token-based-authentication/ |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a USB dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewindowsclub.com/lock-protect-your-windows-pc-using-a-usb-drive-with-predator |title=Lock and protect your Windows PC |publisher=TheWindowsClub.com |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220321/http://www.thewindowsclub.com/lock-protect-your-windows-pc-using-a-usb-drive-with-predator |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trusted platform module]]s (TPMs) secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices, through the use of microprocessors, or so-called computers-on-a-chip.  TPMs used in conjunction with server-side software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices, preventing unauthorized network and data access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf |title=Intel Trusted Execution Technology: White Paper |year=2012 |accessdate=2013-12-18 |author=James Greene |publisher=Intel Corporation |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611161421/http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Computer case#Intrusion detection|Computer case intrusion detection]] refers to a device, typically a push-button switch, which detects when a computer case is opened.  The firmware or BIOS is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time.
* Drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives, making them inaccessible to thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmagazine.com/safenet-protectdrive-84/review/2596/ |title=SafeNet ProtectDrive 8.4 |publisher=SCMagazine.com |date=2008-10-04 |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220133/http://www.scmagazine.com/safenet-protectdrive-84/review/2596/ |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342798,00.asp |title=Secure Hard Drives: Lock Down Your Data |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2009-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621202140/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342798,00.asp |archivedate=21 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disabling USB ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer.  Infected USB dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine Network World as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks.
* Disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices ( like camera, GPS, removable storage  etc.), that are not in use. &lt;ref&gt; NIST 800-124  https://www.nist.gov/publications/guidelines-managing-security-mobile-devices-enterprise &lt;/ref&gt;
* Mobile-enabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones.  Built-in capabilities such as [[Bluetooth]], the newer [[Bluetooth low energy]] (LE), [[Near field communication]] (NFC) on non-iOS devices and [[biometrics|biometric]] validation such as thumb print readers, as well as [[QR code]] reader software designed for mobile devices, offer new, secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems.  These control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2804966490001/forget-ids-use-your-phone-as-credentials/?playlist_id=937116503001#sp=show-clips |title=Forget IDs, use your phone as credentials |publisher=[[Fox Business Network]] |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320215829/http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2804966490001/forget-ids-use-your-phone-as-credentials/?playlist_id=937116503001#sp=show-clips |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure operating systems===
{{Main|Security-evaluated operating system}}
One use of the term "computer security" refers to technology that is used to implement secure [[operating system]]s. In the 1980s the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) used the [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria|"Orange Book"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Lipner |title=The Birth and Death of the Orange Book |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=19–31 |year=2015 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2015.27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; standards, but the current international standard ISO/IEC 15408, "[[Common Criteria]]" defines a number of progressively more stringent [[Evaluation Assurance Level]]s. Many common operating systems meet the EAL4 standard of being "Methodically Designed, Tested and Reviewed", but the [[formal verification]] required for the highest levels means that they are uncommon. An example of an EAL6 ("Semiformally Verified Design and Tested") system is [[INTEGRITY-178B|Integrity-178B]], which is used in the [[Airbus A380]]&lt;ref name=darkreading&gt;{{cite web |author=Kelly Jackson Higgins |url=http://www.darkreading.com/applications/secure-os-gets-highest-nsa-rating-goes-c/212100421 |title=Secure OS Gets Highest NSA Rating, Goes Commercial |publisher=Dark Reading |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203031833/http://www.darkreading.com/applications/secure-os-gets-highest-nsa-rating-goes-c/212100421 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and several military jets.&lt;ref name="VITA Technologies Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board or bored?

===Secure coding===
{{Main|Secure coding}}
In software engineering, [[secure coding]] aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities. It is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure. Such systems are "[[secure by design]]". Beyond this, [[formal verification]]  aims to prove the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]] of the [[algorithms]] underlying a system;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanghavi|first=Alok|title=What is formal verification?|journal=EE Times_Asia|date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
important for [[cryptographic protocol]]s for example.

===Capabilities and access control lists===
{{Main|Access control list|Capability (computers)}}

Within computer systems, two of many [[Computer security model|security models]] capable of enforcing privilege separation are [[access control list]]s (ACLs) and [[capability-based security]]. Using ACLs to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations, such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access, an issue known as the [[confused deputy problem]]. It has also been shown that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice. Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities. This does not mean practical flaws exist in all ACL-based systems, but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Capabilities have been mostly restricted to research [[operating system]]s, while commercial OSs still use ACLs. Capabilities can, however, also be implemented at the language level, leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard object-oriented design. An open source project in the area is the [[E programming language|E language]].

===End user security training===
The end-user is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Studies prove once again that users are the weakest link in the security chain |url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/2137210/security-awareness/studies-prove-once-again-that-users-are-the-weakest-link-in-the-security-chain.html |website=CSO Online |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is estimated that more than 90% of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Role of Human Error in Successful Security Attacks |url=https://securityintelligence.com/the-role-of-human-error-in-successful-security-attacks/ |website=IBM Security Intelligence |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=90% of security incidents trace back to PEBKAC and ID10T errors |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2910316/90-of-security-incidents-trace-back-to-pebkac-and-id10t-errors.html |website=Computerworld |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management, the inability to recognize misleading URLs and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments.

As the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Human Component of Cyber Risk |url=https://www.coruscan.com/cyber-risk/human-component |website=The Coruscan Project |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization is facing, security awareness training, at all levels, does not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Risky business: why security awareness is crucial for employees |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/feb/12/business-cyber-security-risks-employees |website=The Guardian |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats.

The focus on the end-user represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners, who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective, and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Developing a Security Culture |url=https://www.cpni.gov.uk/developing-security-culture |website=CPNI - Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization, recognizing that a security aware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks.

===Response to breaches===
Responding forcefully to attempted [[security breaches]] (in the manner that one would for attempted physical security breaches) is often very difficult for a variety of reasons:
* Identifying attackers is difficult, as they are often in a different [[jurisdiction]] to the systems they attempt to breach, and operate through proxies, temporary anonymous dial-up accounts, wireless connections, and other anonymizing procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in yet another jurisdiction.  If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete [[Data logging|logs]] to cover their tracks.
* The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organisations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., [[cable modem]]) connection will be attacked at least several times per day, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated [[vulnerability scanner]]s and [[computer worm]]s.
* [[Law enforcement officer]]s are often unfamiliar with [[information technology]], and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers.  There are also budgetary constraints.  It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as [[DNA]] testing, and improved [[forensics]] mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a [[network administrator]] or a [[system administrator]]) requires a [[search warrant]] and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.
* The United States government spends the largest amount of money every year on cyber security. The United States has a yearly budget of 28 billion dollars. Canada has the 2nd highest annual budget at 1 billion dollars. Australia has the third highest budget with only 70 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://macategroup.wordpress.com/2016/07/07/top-3-leading-cybersecurity-countries/|title=Top 3 Leading Cybersecurity Countries|date=7 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident response planning==
Incident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack. An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion, typically escalates to a more impactful event such as a data breach or system failure. The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to limit damage and reduce recovery time and costs. Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities, restore services and processes and minimize impact and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://talatek.com/risk-management-services/incident-response/|title=TalaTek Incident Response Services|last=Alsinawi|first=Baan|work=TalaTek, LLC|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage. Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organization’s response to a cyberattack. Without a documented plan in place, an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles, processes and procedures during an escalation, slowing the organizations response and resolution.

There are four key components of a computer security incident response plan:  

# '''Preparation''': Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises
# '''Detection &amp; Analysis''': Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident, prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident
# '''Containment, Eradication &amp; Recovery''': Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact, pinpointing the genesis of the incident, removing malware, affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains
# '''Post Incident Activity''': Post mortem analysis of the incident, its root cause and the organization’s response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://talatek.com/risk-management-services/incident-response/|title=TalaTek Incident Response Services|last=Alsinawi|first=Baan|work=TalaTek, LLC|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below.
&lt;!-- We don't want to list every breach ever – and please keep the descriptions short --&gt;

===Robert Morris and the first computer worm===
{{Main|Morris worm}}
In 1988, only 60,000 computers were connected to the Internet, and most were mainframes, minicomputers and professional workstations. On 2 November 1988, many started to slow down, because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers – the first internet "[[computer worm]]".&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Jonathan Zittrain, 'The Future of The Internet', Penguin Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The software was traced back to 23-year-old [[Cornell University]] graduate student [[Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.]] who said 'he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet'.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

===Rome Laboratory===
In 1994, over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the [[Rome Laboratory]], the US Air Force's main command and research facility. Using [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]], hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Rome's networking systems and remove traces of their activities. The intruders were able to obtain classified files, such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some Defense contractors, and other private sector organizations, by posing as
a trusted Rome center user.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/gao/aim96084.htm Information Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140354/http://fas.org/irp/gao/aim96084.htm |date=6 March 2016 }}. United States Department of Defense, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===TJX customer credit card details===
In early 2007, American apparel and home goods company [[TJX Companies|TJX]] announced that it was the victim of an [[Hacker (computer security)|unauthorized computer systems intrusion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

===Stuxnet attack===
In 2010 the computer worm known as [[Stuxnet]] reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran's [[nuclear centrifuge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stuxnet-was-far-more-dangerous-than-previous-thought-2013-11 |title=The Stuxnet Attack On Iran's Nuclear Plant Was 'Far More Dangerous' Than Previously Thought |publisher=Business Insider |date=20 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509020404/http://www.businessinsider.com/stuxnet-was-far-more-dangerous-than-previous-thought-2013-11 |archivedate=9 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It did so by disrupting industrial [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) in a targeted attack.

===Global surveillance disclosures===
{{Main|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}
In early 2013, documents provided by [[Edward Snowden]] were published by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 August 2013|quote=Exclusive: Top secret court order requiring [[Verizon]] to hand over all call data shows scale of domestic surveillance under [[Barack Obama|Obama]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816045641/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order|archivedate=16 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ARDinterview&gt;{{cite web |last=Seipel |first=Hubert |title=Transcript: ARD interview with Edward Snowden |url=https://www.freesnowden.is/fr/2014/01/27/video-ard-interview-with-edward-snowden/ |work=La Foundation Courage |accessdate=11 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174333/https://www.freesnowden.is/fr/2014/01/27/video-ard-interview-with-edward-snowden/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; exposing the massive scale of [[NSA]] global surveillance. There were also indications that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor in a [[NIST]] standard for encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lily Hay |last=Newman |date=9 October 2013 |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/can-you-trust-nist |title=Can You Trust NIST? |journal=IEEE Spectrum |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201095426/http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/can-you-trust-nist |archivedate=1 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard was later withdrawn due to widespread criticism.&lt;ref name="nist_abandonment"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/sp800-90-042114.cfm | work=National Institute of Standards and Technology | title=NIST Removes Cryptography Algorithm from Random Number Generator Recommendations | date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA additionally were revealed to have tapped the links between [[Google]]'s data centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2013/10/30/nsa-google-yahoo-data-centers/ "New Snowden Leak: NSA Tapped Google, Yahoo Data Centers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709131535/http://mashable.com/2013/10/30/nsa-google-yahoo-data-centers/ |date=9 July 2014 }}, 31 Oct 2013, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, mashable.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Target and Home Depot breaches===

In 2013 and 2014, a [[Russia]]n/[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] hacking ring known as "Rescator" broke into [[Target Corporation]] computers in 2013, stealing roughly 40 million credit cards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-13/target-missed-alarms-in-epic-hack-of-credit-card-data |title=Target Missed Warnings in Epic Hack of Credit Card Data – Businessweek |author1=Michael Riley |author2=Ben Elgin |author3=Dune Lawrence |author4=Carol Matlack |work=Businessweek.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127015928/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-13/target-missed-alarms-in-epic-hack-of-credit-card-data |archivedate=27 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Home Depot]] computers in 2014, stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/53-million-emails-stolen-in-home-depot-breach/|title=Home Depot says 53 million emails stolen|date=6 November 2014|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209035159/http://www.cnet.com/news/53-million-emails-stolen-in-home-depot-breach/|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Warnings were delivered at both corporations, but ignored;  physical security breaches using [[Self-checkout|self checkout machine]]s are believed to have played a large role.  "The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting," says Jim Walter, director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee – meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing [[antivirus software]] had administrators responded to the warnings.  The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing.

===Office of Personnel Management data breach===
In April 2015, the [[United States Office of Personnel Management|Office of Personnel Management]] [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|discovered it had been hacked]] more than a year earlier in a data breach, resulting in the theft of approximately 21.5 million personnel records handled by the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709|title=Millions more Americans hit by government personnel data hack|date=2017-07-09|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2017-02-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228005352/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709|archivedate=28 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Office of Personnel Management hack has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About four (4) Million People's Records, Officials Say|last=Barrett|first=Devlin|date=|website=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604215718/http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888|archivedate=4 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data targeted in the breach included [[personally identifiable information]] such as [[Social Security number|Social Security Numbers]], names, dates and places of birth, addresses, and fingerprints of current and former government employees as well as anyone who had undergone a government background check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/05/china-suspected-in-theft-of-federal-employee-records|title=China Suspected in Theft of Federal Employee Records|last=Risen|first=Tom|date=5 June 2015|website=US News &amp; World Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606064331/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/05/china-suspected-in-theft-of-federal-employee-records|archive-date=2015-06-06|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/09/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709|title=Estimate of Americans hit by government personnel data hack skyrockets|last=Zengerle|first=Patricia|date=2015-07-19|website=Reuters|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710075449/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/09/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709|archivedate=10 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed the hack was perpetrated by Chinese hackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/us/breach-in-a-federal-computer-system-exposes-personnel-data.html|title=Hacking Linked to China Exposes Millions of U.S. Workers|last=Sanger|first=David|date=5 June 2015|website=New York Times|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605135158/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/us/breach-in-a-federal-computer-system-exposes-personnel-data.html|archivedate=5 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashley Madison breach===
{{main|Ashley Madison data breach{{!}}Ashley Madison Data Breach}}

In July 2015, a hacker group known as "The Impact Team" successfully breached the extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison, created by [[Avid Life Media]]. The group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well. After the breach, The Impact Team dumped emails from the company's CEO, to prove their point, and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Legal issues and global regulation==
International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature. There is no global base of common rules to judge, and eventually punish, [[Cybercrime|cyber crimes]] and cyber criminals - and where security firms or agencies do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of [[malware]] or form of [[Cyber-Attacks|cyber attack]], often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute.&lt;ref name="ted.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mikko Hypponen: Fighting viruses, defending the net |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html |publisher=TED |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116010603/http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mikko Hypponen – Behind Enemy Lines |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4 |publisher=Hack In The Box Security Conference |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125075257/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4 |archivedate=25 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proving attribution for cyber crimes and cyber attacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agencies. "[[Computer viruses]] switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another – moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone [had] given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world."&lt;ref name="ted.com" /&gt; The use of techniques such as [[dynamic DNS]], [[fast flux]] and [[Bulletproof hosting|bullet proof servers]] add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement.

==Role of government==
The role of the government is to make [[Cyber-security regulation|regulations]] to force companies and organizations to protect their systems, infrastructure and information from any [[cyberattack]]s, but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national [[Power grid|power-grid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ensuring the Security of Federal Information Systems and Cyber Critical Infrastructure and Protecting the Privacy of Personally Identifiable Information |url=http://www.gao.gov/highrisk/protecting_the_federal_government_information_systems/why_did_study |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119221200/http://www.gao.gov/highrisk/protecting_the_federal_government_information_systems/why_did_study |archivedate=19 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government's regulatory role in [[cyberspace]] is complicated. For some, cyberspace was seen [[virtual space]] that was to remain free of government intervention, as can be seen in many of today's libertarian [[blockchain]] and [[bitcoin]] discussions.&lt;ref name="King ref"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/1284178/almost-half-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoin-bros-identify-as-libertarian/|work=Quartz|first=Georgia |last=King |title=The Venn diagram between libertarians and crypto bros is so close it’s basically a circle |date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Many government officials and experts think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation, mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem. [[Richard A. Clarke|R. Clarke]] said during a panel discussion at the [[RSA Conference|RSA Security Conference]] in [[San Francisco]], he believes that the "industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If the industry doesn't respond (to the threat), you have to follow through."&lt;ref name="Clarke ref"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-02-17/business/17361991_1_rsa-security-conference-cybersecurity-counterpane-internet-security |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |first=Carrie |last=Kirby |title=Former White House aide backs some Net regulation / Clarke says government, industry deserve 'F' in cyber security |date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary, but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently. Daniel R. McCarthy analyzed this public-private partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCarthy |first1=Daniel |title=Privatizing Political Authority: Cybersecurity, Public-Private Partnerships, and the Reproduction of Liberal Political Order |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1335 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International actions==
Many different teams and organisations exist, including:

[[China]]'s [[Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization]] ({{lang-zh|中央网络安全和信息化领导小组}}) was established on 27 February 2014. This Leading Small Group (LSG) of the [[Communist Party of China]] is headed by [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] himself and is staffed with relevant Party and state decision-makers. The LSG was created to overcome the incoherent policies and overlapping responsibilities that characterized China's former cyberspace decision-making mechanisms. The LSG oversees policy-making in the economic, political, cultural, social and military fields as they relate to network security and IT strategy. This LSG also coordinates major policy initiatives in the international arena that promote norms and standards favored by the [[Chinese government]] and that emphasize the principle of national sovereignty in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;"6.16 Internet security: National IT independence and China’s cyber policy," in: [[Sebastian Heilmann]], editor, [{{cite web |url=https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323234015/https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |archivedate=23 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }} China''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Political System'']'','' Lanham, Boulder, New York, London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers (2017)   {{ISBN|978-1442277342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computer emergency readiness team====
"[[Computer emergency response team]]" is a name given to expert groups that handle computer security incidents.
In the US, two distinct organization exist, although they do work closely together.
* [[US-CERT]]: part of the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref name=Computerworld&gt;{{cite news |author=Verton, Dan |title=DHS launches national cyber alert system |url=http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,89488,00.html |date=28 January 2004 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG |accessdate=2008-06-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831162039/http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,89488,00.html |archivedate=31 August 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern warfare==
{{Main|Cyberwarfare}}

There is growing concern that cyberspace will become the next theater of warfare. As Mark Clayton from the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' described in an article titled "The New Cyber Arms Race":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the future, wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs. They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities, transportation, communications, and energy. Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops, the path of jet fighters, the command and control of warships.&lt;ref name="The new cyber arms race"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clayton |first1=Mark |title=The new cyber arms race |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race |website=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416090310/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race |archivedate=16 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has led to new terms such as ''[[cyberwarfare]]'' and ''[[cyberterrorism]]''. The [[United States Cyber Command]] was created in 2009&lt;ref name="Nakashima"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nakashima, Ellen |date=13 September 2016 |title=Obama to be urged to split cyberwar command from NSA |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-to-be-urged-to-split-cyberwar-command-from-the-nsa/2016/09/12/0ad09a22-788f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html |archiveurl=

==Terminology==
The following terms used with regards to computer security are explained below:
* Access [[authorization]] restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of [[authentication]] systems. These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive [[login]] screen, or individual services, such as a [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [[passwords]], [[identification card|identification cards]], [[smart card|smart cards]], and [[biometric]] systems.
* [[Anti-virus software]] consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate [[computer viruses]] and other malicious software ([[malware]]).
* [[Application software|Applications]] are [[executable|executable code]], so general practice is to [[Superuser|disallow users the power]] to install them; to install only those which are known to be reputable – and to reduce the [[attack surface]] by installing as few as possible. They are typically run with [[least privilege]], with a robust process in place to identify, test and install any released [[security patch]]es or updates for them.
* [[Authentication]] techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.]
* [[Automated theorem proving]] and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.
* [[Backup|Backups]] are one or more copies kept of important computer files. Typically, multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged, other copies will still exist.
* [[Capability (computers)|Capability]] and [[access control list]] techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [[Computer security#Capabilities vs. ACLs|Capabilities vs. ACLs]] discusses their use.
* [[Chain of trust]] techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.
* [[Confidentiality]] is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confidentiality |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confidentiality |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.
* [[Cyberwarfare]] is an internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. Such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems.
* [[Data integrity]] is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data Integrity |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106055944/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|300px|[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message; ideally, eavesdroppers cannot.]]
* [[Encryption]] is used to protect the confidentiality of a message. [[Cryptography|Cryptographically]] secure [[cipher|ciphers]] are designed to make any practical attempt of [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] them infeasible. [[symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric-key]] ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [[shared key|shared keys]], and [[public-key encryption]] using [[digital certificate|digital certificates]] can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.
* [[Endpoint security]] software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and USB drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Endpoint Security |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |accessdate=2014-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316021605/http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] serve as a gatekeeper system between networks, allowing only traffic that matches defined rules. They often include detailed [[Logfile|logging]], and may include [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection]] and [[Intrusion detection system#Intrusion prevention|intrusion prevention]] features. They are near-universal between company [[local area networks]] and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if [[network segmentation]] is configured.
* A [[Security hacker|hacker]] is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network. 
* [[Honeypot (computing)|Honey pots]] are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques.
* [[Intrusion-detection system|Intrusion-detection systems]] are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.
* A [[microkernel]] is an approach to operating system design which has only the near-minimum amount of code running at the most privileged level – and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers, protocol stacks and file systems, in the safer, less privileged [[user space]].
* [[Ping (networking utility)|Pinging]]. The standard "ping" application can be used to test if an IP address is in use. If it is, attackers may then try a [[port scan]] to detect which services are exposed.
* A [[port scan]] is used to probe an IP address for [[Port (computer networking)|open ports]] with the purpose of identifying accessible network services.
* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security.

One iteration of this dance is performed on the eve of [[Losar]], the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] new year to commemorate the assassination of the cruel Tibetan king, '[[Langdarma]]' in the 9th century [[Common Era|CE]]. It is a dance symbolising the victory of good over evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shubhyatra.com/himachal-pradesh/lossar.html |title=Lossar Festival |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120154519/http://www.shubhyatra.com/himachal-pradesh/lossar.html |archivedate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Diethylstilbestrol''' ('''DES'''), also known as '''stilbestrol''' or '''stilboestrol''', is an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] medication which is mostly no longer used.&lt;ref name="Elks2014"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Elks J | title = The Dictionary of Drugs: Chemical Data: Chemical Data, Structures and Bibliographies | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0vXTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA396 | date = 14 November 2014 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-1-4757-2085-3 | pages = 396– }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhl H | title = Pharmacology of estrogens and progestogens: influence of different routes of administration | journal = Climacteric | volume = 8 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 3–63 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16112947 | doi = 10.1080/13697130500148875 | url = http://hormonebalance.org/images/documents/Kuhl%2005%20%20Pharm%20Estro%20Progest%20Climacteric_1313155660.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, it was widely used for a variety of indications including [[pregnancy]] support for women with a history of [[recurrent miscarriage]], [[hormone therapy]] for [[menopausal symptoms]] and [[estrogen deficiency]] in women, treatment of [[prostate cancer]] in men and [[breast cancer]] in women, and other uses. While most commonly taken [[oral administration|by mouth]], DES was available for use by other [[routes of administration|routes]] as well, for instance [[vaginal administration|vaginal]], [[topical medication|topical]], and by [[injection (medicine)|injection]].

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
DES is an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]], or an [[agonist]] of the [[estrogen receptor]]s, the [[biological target]] of estrogens like [[estradiol]].&lt;ref name="Kuhl_2005" /&gt; It is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] and [[nonsteroidal estrogen]] of the [[stilbestrol]] group, and differs from the [[natural product|natural]] estrogen [[estradiol (medication)|estradiol]] in various ways.&lt;ref name="Kuhl_2005" /&gt; Compared to estradiol, DES has greatly improved [[bioavailability]] when taken by mouth, is more resistant to [[metabolism]], and shows relatively increased effects in certain parts of the body like the [[liver]] and [[uterus]].&lt;ref name="Kuhl_2005" /&gt; These differences result in DES having an increased risk of [[blood clot]]s, [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular issues]], and certain other adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Kuhl_2005" /&gt;

&lt;!-- History, society, and culture --&gt;
DES was discovered in 1938.&lt;ref name="pmid16096877"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veurink M, Koster M, Berg LT | title = The history of DES, lessons to be learned | journal = Pharm World Sci | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 139–43 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16096877 | doi = 10.1007/s11096-005-3663-z | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1940 to 1971, the medication was given to pregnant women in the incorrect belief it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses.&lt;ref name="pmid16096877" /&gt; In 1971, DES was shown to cause [[clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina|clear cell carcinoma]], a rare [[vaginal tumor]], in girls and women who had been exposed to this medication ''[[in utero]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid16096877" /&gt; The [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] subsequently withdrew approval of DES as a treatment for pregnant women.&lt;ref name="pmid16096877" /&gt; Follow-up studies have indicated that DES also has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse medical complications during the lifetimes of those exposed.&lt;ref name="pmid16096877" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urlDES Update: For Consumers.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Estrogenic activity====
DES is an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]; specifically, it is a highly potent [[full agonist]] of both of the [[estrogen receptor]]s (ERs).&lt;ref name="Jordan2013"&gt;{{cite book | first = V.

A dosage of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/day DES is approximately equivalent to a dosage of 50&amp;nbsp;µg/day ethinylestradiol in terms of systemic estrogenic potency.&lt;ref name="ChabnerLongo1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce Chabner|author2=Dan Louis Longo|title=Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZNrAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Lippincott-Raven Publishers|isbn=978-0-397-51418-2|page=186|quote=Piperazine estrone sulfate and micronized estradiol were equipotent with respect to increases in SHBG, whereas [...] DES was 28.4-fold more potent [...]. With respect to decreased FSH, [...] DES was 3.8-fold, and ethinyl estradiol was 80 to 200-fold more potent than was piperazine estrone sulfate. The dose equivalents for ethinyl estradiol (50 µg) and DES (1 mg) reflect these relative potencies.220 [...] DES, a potent synthetic estrogen (Fig. 6-12), is absorbed well after an oral dosage. Patients given 1 mg of DES daily had plasma concentrations at 20 hours ranging from 0.9 to 1.9 ng per mL. The initial half-life of DES is 80 minutes, with a secondary half-life of 24 hours.222 The principal pathways of metabolism are conversion to the glucuronide and oxidation. The oxidative pathways include aromatic hydroxylation of the ethyl side chains and dehydrogenation to (Z,Z)-dienestrol, producing transient quinone-like intermediates that react with cellular macromolecules and cause genetic damage in eukaryotic cells.223 Metabolic activation of DES may explain its well-established carcinogenic properties.224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to [[ethinylestradiol]], DES shows a marked and disproportionately strong effect on [[Liver#Synthesis|liver protein synthesis]].&lt;ref name="Kuhl_2005" /&gt; Whereas its systemic estrogenic potency was about 3.8-fold of that of [[estropipate]] (piperazine estrone sulfate), which has similar potency to [[micronized estradiol]], the hepatic estrogenic potency of DES was 28.4-fold that of estropipate (or about 7.5-fold stronger potency for a dosage with equivalent systemic estrogenic effect).&lt;ref name="ChabnerLongo1996" /&gt;

DES has at least three [[mechanisms of action]] in the treatment of prostate cancer in men.&lt;ref name="DenisGriffiths1999" /&gt; It suppresses [[gonad]]al androgen production and hence circulating androgen levels due to its [[antigonadotropic]] effects; it stimulates hepatic [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG) production, thereby increasing circulating levels of SHBG and decreasing the free fraction of testosterone and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) in the [[circulatory system|circulation]]; and it may have direct [[cytotoxic]] effects in the [[testicle|testes]] and [[prostate gland]].&lt;ref name="DenisGriffiths1999" /&gt; DES has also been found to decrease [[DNA synthesis]] at high doses.&lt;ref name="DenisGriffiths1999" /&gt;

====Antigonadotropic effects====
Due to its estrogenic activity, DES has [[antigonadotropic]] effects.&lt;ref name="DenisGriffiths1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salam2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16406864" /&gt; That is, it exerts [[negative feedback]] on the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]] (HPG axis), suppresses the [[secretion]] of the [[gonadotropin]]s, [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), and suppresses [[sex hormone]] [[biosynthesis|production]] as well as [[gamete]] production or maturation in the [[gonad]]s.&lt;ref name="DenisGriffiths1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salam2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16406864" /&gt; DES suppresses testosterone levels in men into the castrate range (&lt;50&amp;nbsp;ng/dL) within 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;weeks at doses of 3&amp;nbsp;mg/day and above.&lt;ref name="pmid16406864"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam JS, Leppert JT, Vemulapalli SN, Shvarts O, Belldegrun AS | title = Secondary hormonal therapy for advanced prostate cancer | journal = J.

====Other activities====
In addition to the ERs, an ''[[in vitro]]'' study found that DES also possesses activity, albeit relatively weak, at a variety of other [[steroid hormone receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid22294742"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coss CC, Jones A, Parke DN, Narayanan R, Barrett CM, Kearbey JD, Veverka KA, Miller DD, Morton RA, Steiner MS, Dalton JT | title = Preclinical characterization of a novel diphenyl benzamide selective ERα agonist for hormone therapy in prostate cancer | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 1070–81 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22294742 | doi = 10.1210/en.2011-1608 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the study found [[EC50|EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] values of 0.18&amp;nbsp;nM and 0.06&amp;nbsp;nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, the drug showed significant [[glucocorticoid]] activity at a concentration of 1&amp;nbsp;μM that surpassed that of 0.1&amp;nbsp;nM [[dexamethasone]] as well as significant [[receptor antagonist|antagonism]] of the [[androgen receptor|androgen]], [[progesterone receptor|progesterone]], and [[mineralocorticoid receptor]]s (75%, 85%, and 50% inhibition of positive control stimulation, respectively, at a concentration of 1&amp;nbsp;μM).&lt;ref name="pmid22294742" /&gt; It also showed approximately 25% inhibition of the activation of [[PPARγ]] and [[LXRα]] at a concentration of 10&amp;nbsp;μM.&lt;ref name="pmid22294742" /&gt; The researchers stated that, to the best of their knowledge, they were the first to report such actions of DES, and hypothesized that these actions could be involved in the clinical effects of DES, for instance, in prostate cancer (notably in which particularly high dosages of DES are employed).&lt;ref name="pmid22294742" /&gt; However, they also noted that the importance of the activities requires further study in [[animal model]]s at [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] relevant doses.&lt;ref name="pmid22294742" /&gt;

DES has been identified as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of all three [[isoform|isotypes]] of the [[estrogen-related receptor]]s (ERRs), the [[ERRα]], [[ERRβ]], and [[ERRγ]].&lt;ref name="pmid15161930"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greschik H, Flaig R, Renaud JP, Moras D | title = Structural basis for the deactivation of the estrogen-related receptor gamma by diethylstilbestrol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen and determinants of selectivity | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 32 | pages = 33639–46 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15161930 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M402195200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Synthesis===
DES was first synthesized in early 1938 by Leon Golberg, then a graduate student of [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] at the [[Dyson Perrins Laboratory]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Golberg's research was based on work by Wilfrid Lawson at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry, (led by [[Charles Dodds|Sir Edward Charles Dodds]] at [[Middlesex Hospital#Middlesex Hospital Medical School|Middlesex Hospital Medical School]] now part of [[University College London]]). A report of its synthesis was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 5 February 1938.&lt;ref name=Dodds_1938&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dodds EC, Goldberg L, Lawson W, Robinson R | year =1938 | title = Estrogenic activity of certain synthetic compounds | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 141 | issue = 3562 | pages = 247–8 | doi = 10.1038/141247b0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dodds2&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Dodds EC | year = 1957 | title = Biochemical contributions to endocrinology; experiments in hormonal research | location = Stanford | publisher = Stanford University Press | oclc = 1483899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meyers&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Meyers R | year = 1983 | title = D.E.S., the bitter pill | location = New York | publisher = Seaview/Putnam | isbn = 0-399-31008-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DES research was funded by the UK Medical Research Council [[Medical Research Council (UK)|(MRC)]], which had a policy against patenting drugs discovered using public funds. Because it was not patented, DES was produced by more than 200 pharmaceutical and chemical companies worldwide.

===Clinical use===
DES (in tablets up to 5&amp;nbsp;mg) was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] on September 19, 1941 for four indications: [[gonorrhea]]l [[vaginitis]], [[atrophic vaginitis]], [[menopausal]] symptoms, and postpartum [[breastfeeding|lactation]] suppression to prevent breast engorgement.&lt;ref name=meyers/&gt; The gonorrheal vaginitis indication was dropped when the [[antibiotic]] [[penicillin]] became available. From its very inception, the drug was highly controversial.&lt;ref name=langston&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Langston N | year = 2010 | title = Toxic bodies: Hormone disruptors and the legacy of DES |location=New Haven, CT | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 978-0-300-13607-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seaman&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Seaman B | year = 2003 | title = The greatest experiment ever performed on women: Exploding the estrogen myth | location = New York | publisher = Hyperion | isbn = 978-0-7868-6853-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Charles Huggins]] and Clarence Hodges at the [[University of Chicago]] found DES to be the first effective drug for the treatment of metastatic [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name="pmid4625049"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huggins C, Hodges CV | title = Studies on prostatic cancer.

[[Orchiectomy]] or DES or both were the standard initial treatment for symptomatic advanced prostate cancer for over 40 years, until the [[GnRH agonist]] [[leuprorelin]] was found to have efficacy similar to DES without estrogenic effects and was approved in 1985.&lt;ref name="pmid6436700"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((The Leuprolide Study Group)) | title = Leuprolide versus diethylstilbestrol for metastatic prostate cancer. | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 311 | issue = 20 | pages = 1281–6 | date = November 1984 | pmid = 6436700 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198411153112004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1940s until the late 1980s, DES was FDA-approved as [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|estrogen-replacement therapy]] for estrogen deficiency states such as [[gonadal dysgenesis|ovarian dysgenesis]], [[premature ovarian failure]], and after [[oophorectomy]].

In the 1940s, DES was used off-label to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of miscarriage. On July 1, 1947, the FDA approved the use of DES for this indication. The first such approval was granted to [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], allowing use of 25&amp;nbsp;mg (and later 100&amp;nbsp;mg) tablets of DES during pregnancy. Approvals were granted to other pharmaceutical companies later in the same year.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Dutton DB | year = 1988 | title = Worse than the disease: pitfalls of medical progress | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-34023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommended regimen started at 5&amp;nbsp;mg per day in the seventh and eighth weeks of pregnancy (from first day of last menstrual period), increased every other week by 5&amp;nbsp;mg per day through the 14th week, and then increased every week by 5&amp;nbsp;mg per day from 25&amp;nbsp;mg per day in the 15th week to 125&amp;nbsp;mg per day in the 35th week of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=pdr1961&gt;{{cite book | year = 1961 | title = Physicians' desk reference to pharmaceutical specialties and biologicals | edition = 15th | location = Oradell NJ | publisher = Medical Economics | page = 625 | isbn = 0-00-093447-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
DES was originally considered effective and safe for both the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman and the developing baby. It was aggressively marketed and routinely prescribed. Sales peaked in 1953.

In the early 1950s, a [[double-blind]] clinical trial at the University of Chicago assessed pregnancy outcomes in women who were assigned to either receive or not receive DES.&lt;ref name=dieckmann&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dieckmann WJ, Davis ME, Rynkiewicz LM, Pottinger RE | title = Does the administration of diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy have therapeutic value? | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 1062–81 | date = November 1953 | pmid = 13104505 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9378(16)38617-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The study showed no benefit of taking DES during pregnancy; adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reduced in the women who were given DES. By the late 1960s, six of seven leading textbooks of obstetrics said DES was ineffective at preventing miscarriage.&lt;ref name=dutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=apfel&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Apfel RJ, Fisher SM | year = 1984 | title = To do no harm: DES and the dilemmas of modern medicine | location = New Haven | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 0-300-03192-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite an absence of evidence supporting the use of DES to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, DES continued to be given to pregnant women through the 1960s. In 1971, a report published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' showed a probable link between DES and vaginal [[Clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina|clear cell adenocarcinoma]] in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug ''in utero''. Later in the same year, the FDA sent an FDA Drug Bulletin to all U.S. physicians advising against the use of DES in pregnant women. The FDA also removed prevention of miscarriage as an indication for DES use and added pregnancy as a contraindication for DES use.&lt;ref name=fr1971&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((United States Food and Drug Administration)) | year = 1971 | title = Certain estrogens for oral or parenteral use. Drugs for human use; drug efficacy study implementation | journal = Fed Regist | volume = 36 | issue = 217 | pages = 21537–8 }}; {{Federal Register|36|21537}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 5, 1975, the FDA ordered 25&amp;nbsp;mg and 100&amp;nbsp;mg tablets of DES withdrawn, effective February 18, 1975.&lt;ref name=des25mg/&gt; The number of persons exposed to DES during pregnancy or ''in utero'' during 1940–1971 is unknown, but may be as high as 2 million in the [[United States]]. DES was also used in other countries, most notably France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain.

From the 1950s through the beginning of the 1970s, DES was prescribed to prepubescent girls to begin puberty and thus stop growth by closing growth plates in the bones. Despite its clear link to cancer, doctors continued to recommend the hormone for "excess height".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Zuger A | date = 2009-07-27 | title = At What Height, Happiness? A Medical Tale | publisher = NY Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/health/28book.html?ref=science | work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, DES was found to be more effective than [[androgen]]s in the treatment of advanced [[breast cancer]] in postmenopausal women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Council on Drugs |year=1960 |title=Androgens and estrogens in the treatment of disseminated mammary carcinoma: retrospective study of nine hundred forty-four patients |journal=JAMA |volume=172 |issue=12 |pages=1271–83 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1960.03020120049010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DES was the hormonal treatment of choice for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women until 1977, when the FDA approved [[tamoxifen]], a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] with efficacy similar to DES but fewer side effects.&lt;ref name="pmid7001242"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ingle JN, Ahmann DL, Green SJ, Edmonson JH, Bisel HF, Kvols LK, Nichols WC, Creagan ET, Hahn RG, Rubin J, Frytak S | title = Randomized clinical trial of diethylstilbestrol versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 304 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–21 | date = January 1981 | pmid = 7001242 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198101013040104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sources from medical literature in the 1970s and 1980s indicate that DES was used for treatment of transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodwin WE, Cummings RH | title = Squamous metaplasia of the verumontanum with obstruction due to hypertrophy: long-term effects of estrogen on the prostate in an aging male-to-female transsexual | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 553–4 | date = March 1984 | pmid = 6199525 | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5347(17)50493-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehrman KL | title = Pulmonary embolism in a transsexual man taking diethylstilbestrol | journal = JAMA | volume = 235 | issue = 5 | pages = 532–3 | date = February 1976 | pmid = 946104 | doi=10.1001/jama.1976.03260310046024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seyler LE, Canalis E, Spare S, Reichlin S | title = Abnormal gonadotropin secretory responses to LRH in transsexual women after diethylstilbestrol priming | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–83 | date = July 1978 | pmid = 122396 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-47-1-176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, in an attempt to restrict [[off-label use]] of DES as a [[emergency contraceptive|postcoital contraceptive]] (which had become prevalent at many university health services following publication of an influential study in 1971 in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'') to emergency situations such as rape, an ''FDA Drug Bulletin'' was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES.&lt;ref name="pmid5171004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuchera LK | title = Postcoital contraception with diethylstilbestrol | journal = JAMA | volume = 218 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–3 | date = October 1971 | pmid = 5171004 | doi = 10.1001/jama.218.4.562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the FDA said it had not actually given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a FDA final rule published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = FDA | year = 1975 | title = Diethylstilbestrol as posticoital oral contraceptive; patient labeling | journal = Fed Regist | volume = 40 | issue = 25 | pages = 5451–5 }}; {{Federal Register|40|5451}}&lt;/ref&gt; To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25&amp;nbsp;mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5&amp;nbsp;mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: "This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive" in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label.&lt;ref name=des25mg&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = FDA | year = 1975 | title = Certain estrogens for oral use.

Drugs for human use; drug efficacy study; amended notice | journal = Fed Regist | volume = 40 | issue = 39 | page = 8242}}; {{Federal Register|39|8242}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, off-label use of the [[Yuzpe regimen]] of certain regular [[combined oral contraceptive]] pills superseded off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Hatcher RA, Stewart GK, Stewart F, Guest F, Josephs N, Dale J | year = 1982 | title = Contraceptive Technology 1982–1983 | location = New York | publisher = Irvington Publishers | isbn = 0-8290-0705-9 | pages = 152–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the FDA removed postpartum [[lactation suppression]] to prevent breast engorgement from their approved indications for DES and other estrogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = FDA | year = 1978 | title = Estrogens for postpartum breast engorgement | journal = Fed Regist | volume = 43 | issue = 206 | pages = 49564–7 }}; {{Federal Register|43|49564}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the only approved indications for DES were treatment of advanced prostate cancer and treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The last remaining U.S. manufacturer of DES, [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], stopped making and marketing it in 1997.

===Lawsuits===
In the 1970s, the negative publicity surrounding the discovery of DES's long-term effects resulted in a huge wave of lawsuits in the United States against its manufacturers. These culminated in a landmark 1980 decision of the [[Supreme Court of California]], ''[[Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]]'', in which the court imposed a [[rebuttable presumption]] of [[market share liability]] upon all DES manufacturers, proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff.

A lawsuit was filed in Boston Federal Court by 53 DES daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of DES being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them. Their cases survived a [[Daubert]] hearing. In 2013, the Fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancer/DES link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial. The remaining litigants have received various settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lavoie | first = Denise | name-list-format = vanc |title=DES Pregnancy Drug Lawsuit: Settlement Reached Between Melnick Sisters And Eli Lilly And Co.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/des-pregnancy-drug-lawsuit-melnick-sisters_n_2442937.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130110093212/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/des-pregnancy-drug-lawsuit-melnick-sisters_n_2442937.html | archive-date = 10 January 2013 | dead-url = yes |accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
[[Alan Turing]], the ground breaking cryptographer, founder of computing science and programmable computers, who also proposed the actual theoretical model of biological morphogenesis, was forced onto the medication to induce chemical castration as a punitive "treatment" for homosexual behaviour, shortly before he died in ambiguous circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = West-Taylor | first1 = Zoe | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Alan Turing Law – a Formal Pardon for Unpardonable Homophobia | url = http://affinitymagazine.us/2016/09/24/the-alan-turing-law-a-formal-pardon-for-unpardonable-homophobia/|website=Affinity magazine | accessdate = 3 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veterinary use==

===Canine incontinence===
DES has been very successful in treating female canine incontinence stemming from poor sphincter control. It is still available from compounding pharmacies, and at the low (1&amp;nbsp;mg) dose, does not have the carcinogenic properties that were so problematic in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urinary Incontinence|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/191024.htm|work=Merck Veterinary Manual|publisher=[[Merck Veterinary Manual]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally administered once a day for seven to ten days and then once every week as needed.

===Livestock growth promotion===
The greatest usage of DES was in the livestock industry, used to improve [[Feed conversion ratio|feed conversion]] in beef and poultry. During the 1960s, DES was used as a [[growth hormone]] in the beef and poultry industries. It was later found to cause cancer by 1971, but was not phased out until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris RM, Waring RH | title = Diethylstilboestrol--a long-term legacy | journal = Maturitas | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–12 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22464649 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlenvirocancer.cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/factsheet/diet/fs37.hormones.cfm | title = Consumer Concerns About Hormones in Food | vauthors = Gandhi R, Snedeker S | date = 2000-06-01 | work = Fact Sheet #37, June 2000 | publisher = Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors, Cornell University | accessdate = 2011-07-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175735/http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/Factsheet/Diet/fs37.hormones.cfm | archivedate = 2011-07-19 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When DES was discovered to be harmful to humans, it was moved to veterinary use.

'''Digital film festivals''' emerged in the mid to late 1990s, to showcase artists and filmmakers utilizing the nascent tools of desktop [[digital filmmaking]].

[[Digital film]]s and [[animation]] are now commonly found in mainstream [[film festival]]s, but these events laid the groundwork for pioneering works in the area as useful nexus points for digital artists and debates on digital distribution and creation.

The earliest digital film festivals included the MiniDV Festival (now called The Digital Video Festival) in Los Angeles, Low Res (later to split into the DFilm and [[RESFest]] events), [[onedotzero]], and Exploding Cinema (the International Film Festival Rotterdam digital cinema sidebar). Other digital film festivals include .Mov (Japan), Darklight (Ireland), Bifilm (Germany), MP4Fest at [[Silver Lake Film Festival]] (Los Angeles, CA), 0110 (India), Clone (Norway), as well as [[onedotzero]]'s international network of events across 60 cities worldwide, among others.

These festivals stretch the traditional boundaries of 'film festivals' by including hybrid works from [[internet art]], [[Computer-generated imagery|web animation]], [[computer game|computer and video gaming]], [[streaming video]], [[music video]], etc.

In 2008, the Paso Digital Film Festival set new standards and for the past 6 years has moved between #1 and #3 on all the
major search engines when you enter "digital film festivals".  The Event was held in November 2008, and was attended by the likes of [[Clint Eastwood]] and 20 people from Eastwood's film company [[Malpaso Productions|Malpaso]] including his Academy Award-winning editor [[Joel Cox]], also attending was Sir [[Nigel Sinclair]], Cass Warner the granddaughter of [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]], musicians [[Johnny Rivers]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Kyle Eastwood]] (Clint's son), TV actors [[Gary Conway]] and Max Gail, [[Kevin Bacon]] and his band [[The Bacon Brothers]], and many others.  The festival included a day of 3-D with some of the early pioneers in 3-D from LA attend and show independent 3D movies.  Elements of the festival was streamed live online from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thePDFF.com|title=Virtual Digital Festival|publisher=Paso Digital Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Digital Media Festival in [[Silicon Valley]] set another standard with a full shift from the world of "film" to the new age of "Digital Media" and staged in the Digital Capitol of the world Silicon Valley, California.  Attended by some great filmmakers from San Francisco and Los Angeles, including Cass Warner, from the great [[Warner Brothers]] family, Len Dell'Amico long time music video producer working with the greats and known as "the [[Grateful Dead]]'s Video Guy", author and photographer [[Chris Felver]], author and Stanford U. professor [[Fred Turner (author)|Fred Turner]], actor [[Max Gail]] and others...

[[Image:Djurgarden.jpg|thumb|250px|Nordic Museum at Djurgården, facing south-west with [[Skeppsholmen]], [[Gamla stan]] and [[Södermalm]] in the background.]]

'''Djurgårsdteatern''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "Djurgården Theatre"), was an historical Swedish theatre, active at [[Djurgården]] in [[Stockholm]] between 1801 and 1929 (from 1863 in a new building).

It was the only theatre in Stockholm outside the royal theatres during the monopol of the royal theatres between 1799 and 1842, and it also played an important part in abolishing this royal monopol. Until 1842, it was a "summer theatre", but later, it became an all-year theatre and an important one, called the "theatre of the people". It was described as a wood building with the same exterior of a barn, and was painted yellow.

== History ==

In 1795, Abraham de Broen (1759–1804), actor at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], asked for the permission to build and run a theatre, and a theatre-privilege were given to himself, his wife and their children for as long as they wished to use it. In 1798, a new theatre monopoly was stated, which banned all theatres except the royal ones inside the city border of Stockholm.

When the Djurgårdsteatern was opened in 1801, however, it was located on Djurgården, at the time an island outside the city itself, and furthermore, it was not what was counted as a "real theatre"; it was what was called a "summer theatre", active only in summers, and often called "The Summer stage". Thereby, it did not threaten the royal monopoly.

The staff at the theatre was described as "former footmen and maids", and it was often used as a stage for travelling theatre troupes passing through Stockholm, but many of the actors from the Royal Dramatic theatre and the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] made guest performances, making their débuts and started their careers here. The actors at Djurgårsteatern also toured on the country side. It was described as a smaller, more informal and less high pitched theatre. After the death of Abraham de Broen, it was managed by his widow Maria Elisabeth Grundt and his son, actor Isaac de Broen.

In the 1830s, Djurgårdsteatern entered a new age when it was the place of the abolishment of the royal theatre privilege in Stockholm. After the great theatre strike on the Royal Dramatic theatre by the actor couple [[Ulrik Torsslow]] and [[Sara Torsslow]] in 1834, the Torsslow couple left the royal theatre along with many other stars, who started to perform the Djurgårdsteatern in summer and in ''Kirsteinska huset'', a concert house, in winter. The director of the Djurgården theatre, Isaac de Broen's brother-in-law Karl Wildner, married to Debora Aurora de Broen, then transferred the old theatre privilege of the de Broen-family on Torsslow and [[Pierre Deland]], who worked on abolishing the old theatre regulation. In the 1841-1842 season, Torsslow stated, that he would start to play on Djurgårsteatern in the winters as well, no matter if he was stopped or not, and as the government did not wish to stop him, the old regulation was formally abolished in 1842. This quickly led to the establishment of several new theatres, such as ''[[Mindre teatern]]'' (or ''[[Nya teatern]]'') in 1842, ''[[Södra teatern]]'' (1852) and ''[[Ladugårdslandsteatern]]'' (1856).

In 1863, Djurgårdsteatern burnt down, and the de Broen's privilege was abolished, but it was rebuilt again in 1866-67 and continued with its activity until it burnt down again in 1929.

'''East-East''' is a multiplex architectural event jointly held by the Lithuanian and Japanese architects and students of architecture.

== History ==
The concept of the Lithuania-Japan architectural event was conceived and its implementation coordinated by [[Dainius Kamaitis]], a Lithuanian diplomat and former ambassador to Japan. He paved the way for the bilateral exchange in the field of architecture by approaching both sides with a proposal to establish links which had not existed before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jia.or.jp/english/Lithuania.htm Tutlytė, Jūratė. "Lithuania-Japan Architecture Event "EAST-EAST"], [[Japan Institute of Architects]] website, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kunihiro, George. "Kenchiku bunka ni yoru kokkakan kouryuu no datousei",
[http://www.shinkenchiku.net/sk Shinkenchiku], November 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;019 (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was successfully implemented in [[Kaunas]] in cooperation with the Kaunas City Municipality and the Kaunas Section of the Architects Association of Lithuania in 2002. As the event enjoyed a considerable acclaim on both sides, following new initiatives by D.Kamaitis, subsequent architectural forums were implemented in [[Vilnius]], Tokyo and [[Kaunas]], in 2009, 2011 and 2013, accordingly. All the events received full support from the Architects Association of Lithuania and [[Japan Institute of Architects]].

== Origin of name ==
The name East-East is derived from the concept that [[Lithuania]] is located in the east of Europe, while Japan lies in the east of Asia. It implies mutual understanding, close cooperation and harmony.

== Objectives and structure ==
The initial target of establishing the links between the Lithuanian and Japanese architects has been achieved already. The long-term objectives are to strengthen the ties and make the joint events into a tradition, in order to foster continuous interaction not only between architects, but between students of architecture as well. The students' exchange is recognized by both sides as bearing particular importance to developing the future relations.

East-East spans almost a week and is built on three pillars:
* exhibition of architectural works
* public seminar
* students workshop.

== East-East 1 ==
The first event was held between July 30 and August 1, 2002, in [[Kaunas]], at Mykolas Žilinskas Art Gallery. The Japanese delegation was led by the 1993 [[Pritzker Prize]]  (often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture) winner [[Fumihiko Maki]]&lt;ref name = "maki1"&gt;[http://www.maki-and-associates.co.jp/ Maki and Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; and included seven leading Japanese architects Taro Ashihara,&lt;ref name="taro"&gt;[http://www.t-ashihara.co.jp/index.php Taro Ashihara Architects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218103352/http://www.t-ashihara.co.jp/index.php |date=February 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiaki Arai,&lt;ref name = "arai"&gt;[http://www.chiaki-arai.com/ Chiaki Arai Urban &amp; Architecture Design]&lt;/ref&gt; Tetsuo Furuichi,&lt;ref name = "furu1"&gt;[http://www1.odn.ne.jp/furuichiarch/ Furuichi and Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; George Kunihiro,&lt;ref name = "kuni"&gt;[http://www.george-kunihiro.com/index.html George Kunihiro Architect and Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; Koh Kitayama,&lt;ref name = "koh"&gt;[http://www.archws.com/ architecture WORKSHOP]&lt;/ref&gt; Hidetoshi Ohno&lt;ref name = "ohno"&gt;[http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/hidetoshi_ohno/hidetoshi_ohno.htm Hidetoshi Ohno]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kengo Kuma]].&lt;ref name = "kuma"&gt;[http://www.kkaa.co.jp/ Kengo Kuma and Associates]&lt;/ref&gt;

The keynote presentation by Fumihiko Maki who was awarded with the honorary membership of the Architects Association of Lithuania, aroused considerable public interest. On behalf of the host side, Linas Tuleikis, Chairman of the Kaunas Section of the Architects Association of Lithuania, gave a lecture on the contemporary Lithuanian architecture.

=== Exhibition ===

Joint exhibition of works by the Lithuanian and Japanese architects kicked off at the very outset of the event. It was honoured by the very presence of [[Valdas Adamkus]], [[President of Lithuania]]. Besides the works of the Japanese architects present at the event, those of Nobuaki Furuya,&lt;ref name = "flab"&gt;[http://www.studio-nasca.com/en/company/furuya.html Studio NASCA]&lt;/ref&gt; Kazuo Iwamura,&lt;ref name = "iwam"&gt;[http://www.iwamura-at.com/ Iwamura Atelier]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atsushi Kitagawara]], [[Hiroshi Naito]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naitoaa.co.jp/ Naito Architect &amp; Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; Tadasu Ohe&lt;ref name = "ohe"&gt;[http://www.plantec-associates.co.jp/ Plantec Associates] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; and Ken Yokogawa&lt;ref name = "kya"&gt;[http://www.kenyokogawa.co.jp/profile.html Ken Yokogawa Architect &amp; Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; were exhibited as well. On the Lithuanian side of the exhibition, the works of Vilius Adomavičius,&lt;ref name = "abvp"&gt;[http://www.abvp.lt/ Vilius ir partneriai]&lt;/ref&gt; Audrius Ambrasas,&lt;ref name = "amb"&gt;[http://www.ambrasas.lt/en/ Audrius Ambrasas Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; Artūras Asauskas,&lt;ref name = "vas"&gt;[http://www.vas.lt/ Vilniaus architektūros studija]&lt;/ref&gt; Gintaras Čaikauskas,&lt;ref name = "caik"&gt;[http://www.architekturoslinija.lt/ Architektūros linija]&lt;/ref&gt; Darius Čiuta, Gediminas Jurevičius, Algimantas Kančas,&lt;ref name = "kanc"&gt;[http://www.kancas.lt/ Kančo studija]&lt;/ref&gt; Audrys Karalius, Šarūnas Kiaunė, Kęstutis Kisielius,&lt;ref name = "vas" /&gt; Sigitas Kuncevičius,&lt;ref name = "kunce"&gt;[http://www.asa-arch.lt/ a.s.a]&lt;/ref&gt; Saulius Mikštas, Gintautas Natkevičius,&lt;ref name = "nat"&gt;[http://www.natkevicius.lt/ G.Natkevičius ir partneriai]&lt;/ref&gt; Rolandas Palekas,&lt;ref name = "pal"&gt;[http://www.palekas.lt/ R.Paleko ARCH-studija]&lt;/ref&gt; Saulius Pamerneckis, Kęstutis Pempė,&lt;ref name = "vas" /&gt; Ramūnas Raslavičius were presented.

=== Seminar ===

A public seminar was held on July 30–31. It was divided into the following five sessions:
* New program
* New building type
* New order
* New material
* East meets East.

A broad and interesting discussion on the above topics evolved. The Japanese architects presented their ideas featuring their own practical applications, while their Lithuanian counterparts Tomas Grunskis,&lt;ref name = "tomas"&gt;[http://www.grunskis.net/ Tomas Grunskis]&lt;/ref&gt; Jūratė Tutlytė, Vytautas Petrušonis and Jonas Audėjaitis were more concerned with theoretical generalization.

=== Students workshop ===

The workshop was held between July 27 and August 1 at Kaunas Art Institute of Vilnius Academy of Arts, dealing with the acute issue which Kaunas is facing in relation to adjacent rivers. During the Soviet period of the [[History of Lithuania|Lithuanian history]], rapidly developing industry in Kaunas city left a significant trace in its urban fabric. After the restoration of independence, most of the bigger industrial plants built on the bank of [[Nemunas]] river were closed. As a result, and also due to the transport reorganization scheme implemented during the Soviet period, despite its unique location on the confluence of two rivers, the city has virtually lost any contact with them.

The workshop groups were given the task to find effective points and propose a unique architectural concept which would facilitate the return of picturesque but desolated riverside areas back to the city.

A group of 17 Japanese and 19 Lithuanian students were split into 6 mixed teams. Design named "Tunnels" (by Io Kato, Shunsuke Tomida, Hiroaki Kishimoto, Tomas Kučinskas, Aurėja Leskauskaitė, Eivaras Rastauskas) was selected as the winning entry. "Parasite" was awarded with the second prize, and the third award went to "Magic Box".

The students represented the following higher institutions:
* in Japan – [[Tokyo University of the Arts]], [[Yokohama National University]], [[Nihon University]], [[University of Tokyo]], [[Kokushikan University]], [[Chiba Institute of Technology]] and [[Tokyo University of Science]]
* in Lithuania – [[Kaunas University of Technology]], [[Vilnius Academy of Arts]], Kaunas Art Faculty of Vilnius Academy of Arts, [[Vilnius Gediminas Technical University]].

== East-East 2 ==

The second event took place in [[Vilnius]] and was held at Vilnius City Municipality&lt;ref&gt;[[Vilnius city municipality|Vilnius City Municipality]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Contemporary Art Centre (Vilnius)|Contemporary Art Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cac.lt/en Contemporary Art Centre, Vilnius]&lt;/ref&gt; between June 30 and July 4, 2009. The renowned architect [[Riken Yamamoto]]&lt;ref name = "riken"&gt;[http://www.riken-yamamoto.co.jp Riken Yamamoto &amp; FIELDSHOP]&lt;/ref&gt; led the Japanese delegation which included [[Taro Ashihara]],&lt;ref name = "taro" /&gt; George Kunihiro,&lt;ref name = "kuni" /&gt; Ken Yokogawa,&lt;ref name = "kya" /&gt; [[Nobuaki Furuya]],&lt;ref name = "flab" /&gt; [[Takaharu Tezuka]],&lt;ref name = "tez"&gt;[http://www.tezuka-arch.com/ Tezuka Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taira Nishizawa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nszw.com/ Taira Nishizawa Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manabu Chiba]]&lt;ref name = "chiba"&gt;[http://www.chibamanabu.co.jp/ Chiba Manabu Architects] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hiroshi Sambuichi]]. At the opening of the event, Riken Yamamoto delivered the keynote lecture at Vilnius City Municipality.

=== Exhibition ===

Five Japanese architects Takaharu Tezuka, Taira Nishizawa, Manabu Chiba, Hiroshi Sambuichi and Shuhei Endo&lt;ref name = "end"&gt;[http://www.paramodern.com/ Endo Shuhei Architect Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; (the latter was not present at the event himself) exhibited their works under the title "New Wave of Japanese Architecture 2009" at Vilnius City Municipality.

=== Seminar ===

On July 1, a public seminar was held at Contemporary Art Centre, featuring lectures by two speakers from each side, followed by a discussion. Taro Ashihara&lt;ref name = "taro" /&gt; and Tomas Grunskis&lt;ref name = "tomas" /&gt; presented their views on public space as the focus of life in a city, and the philosophy of the traditional house was introduced by Ken Yokogawa&lt;ref name = "kya" /&gt; and Gintaras Čaikauskas.&lt;ref name = "caik" /&gt;

Discussion on architecture was continued on July 3 at the international conference "Architecture: a Part of Culture (?)" held at [[Town Hall, Vilnius|Vilnius Town Hall]]. George Kunihiro&lt;ref name = "kuni" /&gt; and Nobuaki Furuya&lt;ref name = "flab" /&gt; were among the lecturers.

=== Students workshop ===

Four mixed groups comprising 10 students each from Japan and Lithuania generated ideas aimed at the recovery of a problematic area. The point at issue – Park of Architecture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archparkas.vilnius.lt/ Park of Architecture] (in Lithuanian)&lt;/ref&gt; an area of about 58 hectares in one of the most beautiful locations in close proximity to [[Vilnius Old Town]]. Since the 19th century, noxious and polluting industries were developed there, which resulted in the loss of interface between the area and its natural environment, architectural integrity and broken functional and social links with the city. The workshop was therefore tasked with proposing "hot spots" which would help in resurrecting the Park of Architecture and give new life to this socially degraded part of Vilnius city.

On July 4, during the presentation of works at Cultural Platform KultFlux located next to [[Mindaugas Bridge]], the design named "Valley" (by Hiroshi Yamada, Hiroyuki Nogami, Ježi Stankevič, Marius Ščerbinskas and Rasa Chmieliauskaitė, consultant architects George Kunihiro&lt;ref name = "kuni" /&gt; and Gintaras Čaikauskas&lt;ref name = "caik" /&gt;) was selected as the winner. The idea of a valley was proposed as a public space, part of which would have to be flooded with water. Thus the once industrial plants surrounded with water would be turned into buildings for public use: swimming pool, theater, cinema etc. Elevated horizontal surfaces would be erected between the buildings in order to link the former plants with the land, serving as public spaces for communication and leisure.

The students represented the following higher institutions:
* in Japan – [[Waseda University]], [[Tokai University]], [[Kyoto Institute of Technology]], [[Kokushikan University]]
* in Lithuania – [[Kaunas University of Technology]], [[Vilnius Academy of Arts]], Kaunas Art Faculty of Vilnius Academy of Arts, [[Vilnius Gediminas Technical University]].

== East-East 3 ==

The third event was held in Tokyo at [[Japan Institute of Architects]], Ginza TS Building and Gyoko-dori Underground Gallery&lt;ref name = "gyoko"&gt;[http://www.gyokochika.com/ Gyoko-dori Underground Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; between May 31 and June 4, 2011. The Lithuanian delegation included ten leading architects Gražina Janulytė-Bernotienė,&lt;ref name = "jan"&gt;[http://www.janulyte.lt/ G.Janulytės-Bernotienės studija]&lt;/ref&gt; Gintaras Balčytis, Linas Tuleikis, Algimantas Kančas,&lt;ref name = "kanc" /&gt; Gintaras Čaikauskas,&lt;ref name = "caik" /&gt; Linas Naujokaitis,&lt;ref name = "urb"&gt;[http://www.urbanistika.lt/ Urbanistika]&lt;/ref&gt; Rolandas Palekas,&lt;ref name = "pal" /&gt; Marius Šaliamoras, Donaldas Trainauskas,&lt;ref name = "plius"&gt;[http://www.4plius.com/ 4PLIUS]&lt;/ref&gt; Gintautas Vieversys&lt;ref name = "lgp"&gt;[http://www.lgprojektai.lt/ L &amp; G Projektai]&lt;/ref&gt; and 10 students of architecture.

=== Exhibition ===

Japanese and Lithuanian architects exhibited their designs at Gyoko-dori Underground Gallery&lt;ref name = "gyoko" /&gt; between June 1 and 29. It was a part of an exhibition UIA2011 TOKYO 111 Days Before&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asai.org/Assets/3744/1/111DaysBeforeExhibition.pdf Exhibition UIA2011 TOKYO 111 Days Before] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415173257/http://www.asai.org/Assets/3744/1/111DaysBeforeExhibition.pdf |date=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which kicked off as a pre-event to the 24th World Congress of Architecture in Tokyo (UIA2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia2011tokyo.com/en/ UIA2011 Tokyo]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seminar ===

On June 4, a public seminar under the title 'Billows Over the Architecture and Cities in the 21st century' was held at [[Japan Institute of Architects]]. It provided a platform to exchange ideas for a better future of architecture, emerging from the need to address the issues of climate change, population decrease in industrialized countries, economic conflict between the old developed countries and rising economies and safety of nuclear power. These changes are on par with the industrial revolution in the 19th century, and will be followed by the paradigm shift in the fundamentals of knowledge, economy and society.

The seminar featured lectures by three speakers from each side. Gintaras Čaikauskas,&lt;ref name = "caik" /&gt; Linas Naujokaitis&lt;ref name = "urb" /&gt; and Linas Tuleikis presented the Lithuanian views, while Hidetoshi Ohno,&lt;ref name = "ohno" /&gt; Nobuaki Furuya&lt;ref name = "flab" /&gt; and Manabu Chiba&lt;ref name = "chiba" /&gt; discussed the topic from the Japanese perspective.

=== Students workshop ===

The workshop was held between May 31 and June 3 at Ginza TS Building. 10 Lithuanian and 11 Japanese students were split into four mixed groups and tasked with creating an attractive Ginza District in central Tokyo by means of new urban interventions.

For that purpose, each group made research and design proposals on one of the four themes: conservation and contemporary interpretation of historical buildings, vertical circulation between small-sized commercial buildings, facade/skin design of a humongous redeveloped building, and open space utilization of public/private properties. The completed designs were presented at the seminar on June 4.

The students represented the following higher institutions:

* in Japan – [[Meiji University]], [[Keio University]], [[Shibaura Institute of Technology]], [[Tama Art University]]
* in Lithuania – [[Kaunas University of Technology]], [[Vilnius Academy of Arts]], Kaunas Art Faculty of Vilnius Academy of Arts, [[Vilnius Gediminas Technical University]].

For the first time, the fourth East-East forum was incorporated in the framework of another event and was held on September 23–27, 2013 in [[Kaunas]] at [[Žalgiris Arena]] as part of Kaunas Architecture Festival (KAFe),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kafe2013.lt/ KAFe 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; an international event of contemporary architecture spanning two months.

Notably, East-East 4 received support from the [[Asia-Europe Foundation]] (ASEF) and its partners under the second edition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asef.org/index.php/projects/themes/arts-culture/2592-creative-encounters-2012-2013-second-edition Creative Encounters - Second Edition (2012-13)]&lt;/ref&gt; of Creative Encounters – Cultural Partnerships between Asia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asef.org/index.php/projects/programmes/2130-creative-encounters Creative Encounters: Cultural Partnerships between Asia and Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; Creative Encounters is a programme developed by ASEF in partnership with Arts Network Asia (ANA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsnetworkasia.org/main.html Arts Network Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; an Asia-wide network of artists and arts organisations, and in cooperation with [[Trans Europe Halles]] (TEH), the European Network of Creative Arts Spaces.

The Japanese delegation included architects Manabu Chiba,&lt;ref name = "chiba" /&gt; Nobuaki Furuya,&lt;ref name = "flab" /&gt; Kazuko Akamatsu,&lt;ref name = "c and a"&gt;[http://c-and-a.co.jp/ C+A - Coelacanth and Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; Masahiro Harada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www14.plala.or.jp/mfas/fuji.htm Mount Fuji Architects Studio]&lt;/ref&gt; Koichi Yasuda,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.titech.ac.jp/yasuda/index.html Yasuda Koichi Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt; Toshikatsu Ienari,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dotarchitects.jp/ dot architects]&lt;/ref&gt; Akiko Miya&lt;ref&gt;[http://studio2a.jp/ STUDIO 2A]&lt;/ref&gt; and Takeshi Hosaka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hosakatakeshi.com/ Takeshi Hosaka Architects]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the closing of the event, [[Ryue Nishizawa]], laureate of the [[Pritzker Prize]] (2010), delivered a keynote lecture on behalf of Sejima and Nishizawa and Associates ([[SANAA]]).

=== Exhibition ===

On September 24, Japanese and Lithuanian architects unveiled their works at a joint exhibition which lasted until October 16.

=== Seminar ===

For the first time, the usual public seminar was substituted by two sets of lectures by the Japanese architects. On September 24, Toshikatsu Ienari, Akiko Miya and Koichi Yasuda presented their views on architecture, while Nobuaki Furuya and Manabu Chiba lectured on September 27.

=== Students workshop ===

The workshop was held between September 24 and 26. 11 Lithuanian and 7 Japanese students formed four mixed groups to challenge the task "The City Centre and Its Relationship With Rivers".

The idea of re-designing the waterfront area of Kaunas city was revisited after 11 years since East-East 1. Kaunas has exceptional features, as it had been built on the confluence of two large rivers. However, this authentic geographic context remains almost unused in the urban life. Therefore, finding ways to bring the waterfront to the center of everyday life was the core architectural task for the workshop.

On September 27, the presentation and exhibition of completed designs was held. The jury made of Japanese and Lithuanian architects selected the winning proposal "Floating Towers" (by Ayako Motai, Medeina Kurtinaitytė, Simon Tsing Shan Mok, Antanas Šarkauskas and Vytautas Lelys).

The students represented the following higher institutions:

* in Japan – [[Waseda University]], [[University of Tokyo]], [[Shibaura Institute of Technology]], [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]], [[Japan Women's University]]
* in Lithuania – [[Kaunas University of Technology]], [[Vilnius Academy of Arts]], Kaunas Art Faculty of Vilnius Academy of Arts, [[Vilnius Gediminas Technical University]].

[[File:Enfarinats.JPG|thumb|right|Els Enfarinats]]
The annual [[festival]] of '''Els Enfarinats''' ({{IPA-ca|elz amfaɾiˈnats|va}}) takes place in the town of [[Ibi, Spain|Ibi]] in [[Alicante]], Spain on December 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.ca.msn.com/international/photogallery.aspx?cp-documentid=23884777&amp;page=9|title=Els Enfarinats - The world's greatest food fights|work=[[MSN]]|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of celebrations related to the [[Day of the Innocents]]. Els enfarinats comes from the Valencian word for "breading", and roughly translate to "the breaded ones" or "the floured ones". In the day-long festival, participants known as the Els Enfarinats dress in mock [[military dress]] and stage a mock ''[[coup d'état]]''. Meanwhile, the Casats i Fadrins, accompanied by a band of street musicians called the Rondalla, known by the name of Sonet, Xirimita and Tabal, tour the city.
At 8am, the Els Enfarinats take the city under the slogan "New Justice", and at 9am the Race for Mayor will take place in which it will be decided who is to be Mayor of the Els Enfarinats. Then, the act of ''L'Aixavegó'' is carried out in the ''Plaça de l'Església'' (Church Square), where the Els Enfarinats reside. Here, it is decided that those who do not pay the fine will go to jail. At midday, a collection called the Arreplegada dels Enfarinats takes place through the streets of the old quarter and of the city centre of Ibi, terminating in the Sant Joaquim Sanctuary. They exercise their authority under a blaze of fireworks, flour bombs and eggs. At five o'clock in the afternoon the authority of Els Enfarinats comes to an end giving way to the celebration of the traditional ''Dansà''.

The tradition is over 200 years old.

{{Battles involving Assyria}}
The '''Fall of [[Assur]]''' occurred when the first city and old capital of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] fell to [[Medes|Median]] forces. The sack of the city that followed utterly destroyed the city; it would never recover from the destruction.&lt;ref name="Healy3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy|first=Mark|title=The Ancient Assyrians|location=New York|publisher= Osprey|year=1991|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Ever since the end of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s reign (and some speculate years before) the Neo-Assyrian Empire was in exposed and critical position; revolts in [[Babylon]] and in the [[Levant]] coupled with [[Medes|Median]] invasions proved too much for an empire torn with civil war. In 616 BC, the Babylonians established their ''de facto'' independence.

==Assault on the city==

In 615 BC, the Medes conquered Arrapha.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=nhsmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=assur-uballit+ii+failed+attempt+harran+a+companion+to+assyria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gABGmUREtv&amp;sig=EUE0CCN34UoSLw9gNX4Q7GGNr1A&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjctaH8zoDbAhUDyqQKHYXTDD4Q6AEIODAB#v=onepage&amp;q=assur-uballit%20ii%20failed%20attempt%20harran%20a%20companion%20to%20assyria&amp;f=false/ A companion to Assyria] : page 192&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, they began a terrible siege of Assur. Much of what was left of the Assyrian army was in Nineveh, unable to assist. Finally, after a bloody hand-to-hand combat (many skulls and skeletons were later found), it appears that the city was taken in 614 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=nhsmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=assur-uballit+failed+attempt+harran+a+companion+to+assyria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gABGlXXEww&amp;sig=CTDhwA2qXU8uLn4mKEhVFqFJSZA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAt83V4P7aAhWFsxQKHXXQC4UQ6AEINTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=assur-uballit%20failed%20attempt%20harran%20a%20companion%20to%20assyria&amp;f=false/ A Companion to Assyria] : page 192&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fantasia International Film Festival''' (also known as Fantasia-fest, FanTasia, Fant-Asia) is a [[genre film]] festival that has been based mainly in [[Montreal]] since its founding in 1996. Regularly held in July of each year, it is valued by both hardcore genre film fans, and distributors, who take advantage of the eclectic line up to select foreign and domestic films for release across North America.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} By virtue of the reputation developed over the last 15 years, this festival has been described as perhaps the "most outstanding and largest genre film festival in North America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Win A Trip To The Fantasia Film Festival This Summer |url=http://www.soundonsight.org/win-a-trip-to-the-fantasia-film-festival-this-summer/ |work=soundonsight.org |year=2011 |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The history of the Fantasia Festival has roots in the Asian Film scene in Montreal. Beginning in 1996 where it screened Asian films from Hong Kong and Anime from Japan, the festival later expanded its international repertoire and screened genre films from all across the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Since this time many world and international premieres have featured at Fantasia fest, including ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', ''[[Perfect Blue]]'', ''[[Millennium Actress]]'', ''[[Midnight Meat Train]]'', ''[[Dread (film)|Dread]]'', ''The Sorcerer’s Apprentice'' and ''[[Uzumaki]]''.

*FanTasia 2007
:The edition was held from July 5 to July 23, 2007 at the [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]]. In addition to the Hall hall and DeSeve hall, a third screening room has been added at the ''D.B. Clarke Theatre''. There were, however, no outdoor shows this year. Montreal film ''[[Flutter (animated short)|Flutter]]'' received the award for best Quebec short feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasiafest.com/2007/en/news/release.php?id=59|title=FANTASIA 2007 PRIZES ANNOUNCED|date=July 25, 2007|work=News release|publisher=Fantasia Festival|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*FanTasia 2006 (10th edition/10th anniversary)
:Fantsasia's 10th anniversary and 10th edition, the 2006 edition, is the first to feature free outdoor shows. The outdoors shows are at [[Parc de la Paix]] and are free. Outdoor projections included films from the previous editions: [[Kamikaze Girls]], the last four episodes of [[Goldorak]], [[Night of the Living Dorks]] and [[Attack the Gas Station]]. The indoor shows use the same [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] facilities as since the move to Concordia. The outdoor shows are several kilometres away from the indoor shows.

:With the 10th anniversary, Fantasia is helping to launch an associated but separate Toronto festival [[Toronto After Dark Film Festival]].

*Fantasia 2005
:'''Fantasia''' is now 10 years old. However, this is the 9th edition of the festival, due to a missed year in 2002. The festival is again held at Concordia University. This year, a trailer-filled DVD is provided as part of the festival guide book and not a separate purchase.

*Fantasia 2004
:The 2004 Fantasia was held at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] using the Hall Auditorium and deSeve Cinema. Unlike the 2003 event, no DVD filled with trailers was available.

*FanTasia 2003 (move to Concordia University)
:Fantasia 2003 was held for the first time on the [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] campus, using the ''DeSeve Cinema'' and ''Henry F. Hall Alumni Auditorium''. The venue change was instigated by the lack of consideration that the Imperial Theatre gave in informing the festival organizers on the status of Imperial. This was also the first year that a DVD filled with movie trailers of movies shown at the festival was available for purchase with the festival guide book.

*FanTasia 2002 (missed year)
:Fantasia 2002 was cancelled due to problems with the Imperial Cinema. The air conditioning system was broken, and it could not be fixed in time for Fantasia. Indeed, the theatre was not repaired until 2004. Due to the lack of assurance that the theater would be available, and the fact that it broke four months before the festival, meant that alternate bookings were not available. The lack of assurance for the 2003 festival meant a change in venue.

*FanTasia 2001
:The 2001 edition was the last held in the Imperial Cinema. It was also the last time the festival was jointly held with [[Comedia (festival)|Comedia]].

*FanTasia 2000
:The 2000 edition of Fantasia featured the debut of the [[Just For Laughs]] film festival, [[Comedia (festival)|Comedia]], as a selection of comedy films were shown with the regular Fantasia fare. This was also the final year that a Toronto edition of the festival was presented.

*Fantasia International Film Festival 1999

'''John Peter Petrucci''' (born July 12, 1967) is an American [[guitarist]], [[composer]] and [[record producer|producer]]. He is best known as a founding member of the [[progressive metal]] band [[Dream Theater]]. With his former bandmate [[Mike Portnoy]], he [[Record producer|produced]] all Dream Theater albums from 1999's ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]'' to 2009's ''[[Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings]]''. He has been the sole producer of the band's albums released since Portnoy's departure in 2010. Petrucci was named as the third player on the [[G3 tour]] seven times, more than any other invited guitarist. [[Joel McIver]]'s 2009 book ''The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists'' ranks Petrucci second, after [[Dave Mustaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dave Mustaine Discusses 'The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists'|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/dave_mustaine_discusses_the_100_greatest_metal_guitarists.html|publisher=Ultimate-Guitar}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named as one of the "Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time" by ''GuitarOne'' magazine.&lt;ref name="top 10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randyciak.com/guitar/top_shredders_of_all_time.htm|title=Top Shredders of All Time|accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher=RandyCiak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Petrucci was ranked the 17th greatest guitarist of all time by a ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine reader's poll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitarworld.com/readers-poll-results-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time "Readers Poll Results: The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"]. ''Guitar World''. Retrieved 13 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
John Peter Petrucci was born on July 12, 1967, in [[Kings Park, New York|Kings Park]], New York, to an Italian-American family. He picked up the guitar at the age of eight because his older sister was allowed to go to bed later in order to practice the piano. However, he decided to quit the guitar when his attempts to stay up late were unsuccessful. He picked up the guitar again at the age of 12. Petrucci has said he committed to practicing guitar 6 hours a day when he discovered it was his passion. His early influences were bands like [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[AC/DC]], and later developed an interest in progressive rock and heavy metal, exemplified by [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Dixie Dregs]] and [[Metallica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with John Petrucci (Dream Theater)|url=http://wikimetal.uol.com.br/site/interview-with-john-petrucci-dream-theater/|publisher=Wikimetal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133221/http://wikimetal.uol.com.br/site/interview-with-john-petrucci-dream-theater/|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnpetrucci.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Petrucci: Biography |url=http://www.johnpetrucci.com/biography.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991127140620/http://www.johnpetrucci.com/biography.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1999-11-27 |publisher=johnpetrucci.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, his childhood friend and future [[Dream Theater]] keyboardist [[Kevin Moore]] invited Petrucci to join his cover band. Petrucci attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]] with childhood friend [[John Myung]] (bass), where they met future bandmate [[Mike Portnoy]] (drums). While in Berklee they often covered two of their biggest influences, [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. These three, in addition to Kevin Moore, formed the band Majesty. Because there was already another band with the same name, the group later became Dream Theater.

While Petrucci is most commonly associated with Dream Theater, he is also in the project band [[Liquid Tension Experiment]], and has appeared as a guest on records by other artists, such as the ''[[Age of Impact]]'' album by the [[Explorers Club (artist)|Explorer's Club]].

Petrucci has released a guitar instructional video, ''Rock Discipline'', which covers warm-up exercises, exercises to avoid injury while playing, alternate picking, sweep picking, chords and other techniques for developing one's guitar playing. Petrucci also has a book named "Guitar World presents John Petrucci's Wild Stringdom", which was compiled from columns he wrote for Guitar World magazine under that title.

In 2001, [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Steve Vai]] invited Petrucci to tour with them on the popular [[G3 (tour)|G3 guitar tour]], which exposed him to a massive number of new fans and inspired a solo album. The album, ''[[Suspended Animation (John Petrucci album)|Suspended Animation]]'', was released on March 1, 2005, and was available for order from his web site. Petrucci also appeared on the 2005 and 2006 G3 tours, and in 2007, went on G3 tour again, this time with [[Paul Gilbert]] and [[Joe Satriani]]. In a recent video with Larry DiMarzio, Petrucci announced that he is working on a follow up to his 2004 album, ''Suspended Animation'' and a new Dream Theater album.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|-v0M_tSllDI|John Petrucci and his DiMarzio® Pickups.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrucci also wrote and recorded two instrumental soundtrack songs for a [[Sega Saturn]] game titled ''Digital Pinball: Necronomicon''. Each track is roughly two minutes long, and are named simply ''Prologue'' and ''Epilogue''. In a spoof rock band, [[Nightmare_Cinema_(parody_rock_band)|Nightmare Cinema]] (which was the Dream Theater members changing instruments for encores), he used the "alternate stage name" Johnny James.

In 2012, Petrucci was invited once again to join Joe Satriani on the G3 tour, along with Steve Morse. He was accompanied by bassist [[Dave LaRue]] and drummer and Dream Theater bandmate [[Mike Mangini]].

Dream Theater bandmate [[Jordan Rudess]] revealed in an interview that Petrucci is a practicing [[Catholic]].&lt;ref name="dtfaq1"&gt;[http://faq.dtnorway.com/question/114 The Dream Theater official FAQ &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418031206/http://faq.dtnorway.com/question/114 |date=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in [[St. James, New York]], with his wife [[Rena Sands]], a guitarist in the all-female heavy metal band [[Meanstreak (band)|Meanstreak]], and they have three children—twins Samantha and Renato, and Kiara. He is the uncle of Jake Bowen, a guitarist in the progressive metal band [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]]. He is also an avid fan of [[bodybuilding]] and dedicates much of his off time to [[weight training]]. He is a voting member of [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|NARAS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnpetrucci.com/biography.htm The Official John Petrucci Web Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711011925/http://www.johnpetrucci.com/biography.htm |date=2008-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Petrucci joined Joe Satriani on the G3 tour. They were accompanied by [[Uli Jon Roth]] on the European leg of the tour, and [[Phil Collen]] in North America.

==Musical style==

===Guitar technique===
[[File:John Petrucci - 01.jpg|thumb|right|240px|John Petrucci during a concert in 2012.]]
Petrucci is respected for his variety of guitar styles and skills. One of the most notable of these is his high-speed [[alternate picking]] which, as he himself claims, requires a "strong sense of synchronization between the two [playing] hands." John is notable for frequent use of the [[Seven-string guitar|seven-string electric guitar]], which he says he uses as a writing tool, taking advantage of the extended range for heavier riffing and to play extended range runs as part of a solo. Moreover, Petrucci often combines his metal [[shred guitar|shredding]] technique with a slower, emotive soloing style. His influences as a guitarist include [[Jimmy Page]],&lt;ref name="almusic"&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-petrucci-mn0000812741/related]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian May]],&lt;ref name="almusic" /&gt; [[Eddie Van Halen]],&lt;ref name="almusic" /&gt; [[Steve Morse]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]], [[Allan Holdsworth]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Steve Vai]], [[Alex Lifeson]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] and [[David Gilmour]].&lt;ref name = "johnpetrucci.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Petrucci Talks About the New Dream Theater Album in the November 2011 Issue of Guitar World|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/john-petrucci-talks-about-new-dream-theater-album-november-2011-issue-guitar-world|publisher=guitarworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyrics===

Petrucci is the only band member in Dream Theater to have contributed lyrics to every album, and his lyrics have been used for at least three songs on each. These include, among others, "Metropolis, Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper", "The Spirit Carries On", "The Great Debate", "In the Presence of Enemies", and "Through Her Eyes". Petrucci uses real-life experiences for lyrical inspiration, as can be heard in the songs "The Count of Tuscany", "A Nightmare to Remember" and "Endless Sacrifice".

===Singing===
Petrucci has acted as a backing vocalist live since the ''Awake'' Tour. He is a [[baritone]], producing a sound darker than that of [[James LaBrie]]'s tenor voice. He has also written vocal melodies for Dream Theater. Petrucci's role as a vocalist expanded following the departure of [[Mike Portnoy]], who had been Dream Theater's primary backing vocalist and occasionally even shared lead vocals with LaBrie. In live performances, Petrucci now replicates some vocal parts originally sung by Portnoy, with others being recorded samples.

== Equipment ==
Petrucci is a long-time user of Musicman guitars and Mesa Boogie amplifiers. His pedalboard setup has changed a little over the years, usually changing to different modulation or overdrive pedals, while maintaining a similar setup and sound throughout - the key to his tone still remaining the Mesa Boogie distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnpetrucci.com/gear.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126220435/http://www.johnpetrucci.com/gear.htm |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Rig_Rundown_Dream_Theaters_John_Petrucci&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playguitarlive.com/john-petrucci-live-rig-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kingdom of Italy''' ({{lang-it|Regno d'Italia}}; {{lang-fr|Royaume d'Italie}}) was a French [[client state]] founded in [[Northern Italy]] by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], fully influenced by [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]], that ended with his defeat and fall. Formally in [[personal union]] with the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], with Napoleon I reigning as its king throughout its existence, direct governance was conducted by Napoleon's step-son, [[Eugène de Beauharnais]], who served as [[Viceroy]] for his step-father.

==Constitutional statutes==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|right|280px|[[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]]]
{{see also|Constitutional Statute of Italy}}
The Kingdom of Italy was born on March 17, 1805, when the [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]], whose president was Napoleon Bonaparte, became the ''Kingdom of Italy'', with the same man (now styled Napoleon I) as [[King of Italy]], and the 24-year-old [[Eugène de Beauharnais]] his [[viceroy]]. Napoleon I was crowned at the [[Milan Cathedral|Duomo di Milano]], [[Milan]] on May 26, with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. His title was "Emperor of the French and King of Italy" ({{lang-fr|Empereur des Français et Roi d'Italie}}), showing the importance of this Italian Kingdom for him.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Gregory, ''Napoleon's Italy'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the republican Constitution was never formally abolished, a series of ''Constitutional Statutes'' completely altered it. The first one was proclaimed two days after the birth of the kingdom, on March 19,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dircost.unito.it/cs/docs/regnoitali.htm Text of the Constitution] {{It icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the Consulta declared Napoleon as king and established that one of his natural or adopted sons would succeed him once the Napoleonic Wars were over, and once separated the two thrones were to remain separate. The second one, dating from March 29, and regulated the regency, the Great Officials of the kingdom, and the oaths.

The most important was the third, proclaimed on June 5, being the real constitution of the kingdom: Napoleon was the head of State, and had the full powers of government; in his absence, he was represented by the Viceroy, Eugène de Beauharnais. The Consulta, Legislative Council, and Speakers, were all merged in a Council of State, whose opinions became only optional and not binding for the king.

The Legislative Body, the old parliament, remained in theory, but it never summoned after 1805; the [[Napoleonic Code]] was introduced.

The fourth Statute, decided on February 16, 1806, indicated Beauharnais as the heir to the throne.

The fifth and the sixth Statutes, on March 21, 1808, separated the Consulta from the Council of State, and renamed it the Senate, with the duty of informing the king about the wishes of the most important subjects.

The seventh Statute, on September 21, created a new nobility of dukes, counts and barons; the eighth and the ninth, on March 15, 1810, established the annuity for the members of the royal family. In 1812, a [[Court of Accounts]] was added.

The government had seven ministers:
* [[Minister of War]] was at first General [[Marie-François Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga|Augusto Caffarelli]], later General [[Giuseppe Danna]] for a year, and then, from 1811, General [[Achille Fontanelli]];
* [[Minister of Interior]] was at first [[Ludovico Arborio di Breme]] and then, from 1809, [[Luigi Vaccari]];
* [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]] was [[Ferdinando Marescalchi]];
* [[Minister of Justice]] and Great Judge was [[Giuseppe Luosi]];
* [[Minister of Treasury]] was [[Antonio Veneri]] and the, from 1811, [[Ambrogio Birago]];
* [[Minister of Finance]] was [[Giuseppe Prina]];
* Minister of Religion was [[Giovanni Bovara]].

==Territory==
[[Image:1807KingdomItaly.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Kingdom of Italy in 1807, with Istria and Dalmatia, ''shown in yellow'']]
[[File:1french-empire1811.jpg|right|thumb|180px|right|Kingdom of Italy in 1811, ''shown in pink'']]

Originally, the Kingdom consisted of the territories of the Italian Republic: former [[Duchy of Milan]], [[Duchy of Mantua]], [[Duchy of Modena]], the western part of the [[Republic of Venice]], part of the [[Papal States]] in [[Romagna]], and the province of [[Novara]].

After the defeat of the [[Third Coalition]] and the consequent [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], on May 1, 1806, the Kingdom was given by Austria the eastern and remaining part of the Venetian territories, including [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] down to [[Kotor]] (then called Cattaro), even if it had to give [[Province of Massa-Carrara|Massa and Carrara]] to [[Elisa Bonaparte]]'s [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino]]. The [[Duchy of Guastalla]] was annexed on May 24.

With the Convention of Fontainebleau with Austria of October 10, 1807, Italy ceded [[Monfalcone]] to Austria and gained [[Gradisca]], putting the new border on the [[Isonzo River]].

The conquered [[Republic of Ragusa]] was annexed in spring 1808 by General [[Auguste de Marmont]]. On April 2, 1808, following the dissolution of the [[Papal States]], the Kingdom annexed the present-day [[Marche]]s. At its maximum extent, the Kingdom had 6,700,000 inhabitants and was composed by 2,155 communes.

The final arrangement arrived after the new defeat of Austria: Emperor Napoleon and King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria]] signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]] on February 28, 1810, deciding an exchange of territories involving Italy too.

On rewards in Germany, [[Bavaria]] ceded southern [[County of Tyrol|Tirol]] to the Kingdom of Italy, which in its turn ceded Istria and Dalmatia (with Ragusa) to France, incorporating the Adriatic territories into newly created the French [[Illyrian Provinces]]. Small changes to the borders between Italy and France in [[Garfagnana]] and [[Friuli]] came in act on August 5, 1811.

In practice, the Kingdom was a dependency of the French Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, "The Economy of the Empire in Italy: Instructions from Napoleon to Eugène, Viceroy of Italy," ''Exploring the European Past: Texts &amp; Images'', Second Edition, ed. Timothy E. Gregory (Mason: Thomson, 2007), 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom served as a theater in Napoleon's operations against Austria during the wars of the various [[coalitions]]. Trading with the [[United Kingdom]] was forbidden.

[[Image:Napoleone 5 lire 76001838.jpg|thumb|right|140px|''5 lire'' coin of the&lt;BR&gt;''Regno d'Italia'' (1812)]]
The kingdom was given a new national currency, replacing the local coins circulating in the country: the [[Italian lira]], of the same size, weight, and metal of the [[French franc]].&lt;ref&gt;Equal to franc, the new Napoleonic lira had a different value face to the old, ancient [[Milanese lira]]. Distinguishing the two different coins, people began to refer to the new coin as ''franc''. So, through the years, people in north-western Italy continued to call ''franc'' the lira in their local dialects until the changeover with [[euro]] in 2002. [http://www.dialettando.com/poesie/detail_new.lasso?id=5036]&lt;/ref&gt; Mintage being decided by Napoleon with an imperial decree on March 21, 1806, the production of the new coins began in 1807. The monetary unit was the [[silver]] lira, which was 5 [[gram]]s heavy. There were multiples of £2 (10&amp;nbsp;grams of silver) and £5 (25&amp;nbsp;grams of silver), and precious coins of £20 (6.45&amp;nbsp;grams of [[gold]]) and £40 (12.9&amp;nbsp;grams of gold). The lira was basically divided in 100 cents, and there were coins of 1 cent (2.1&amp;nbsp;grams of [[copper]]), 3 cents (6.3&amp;nbsp;grams of copper), and 10 cents (2&amp;nbsp;grams of poor silver), but following the tradition, there was a division in 20 [[shilling|soldi]], with coins of 1 soldo (10.5&amp;nbsp;grams of copper, in practice 5 cents), 5 soldi (1.25&amp;nbsp;grams of silver), 10 soldi (2.5&amp;nbsp;grams of silver), and 15 soldi (3.75&amp;nbsp;grams of silver).

==Army==
The army of the kingdom, inserted into the ''[[Grande Armée]]'', took part in all of [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleon's campaigns]].
In the course of its existence from 1805 to 1814 the ''Kingdom of Italy'' provided [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] with roughly around 200,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=SAR&gt;{{cite book|title=Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the Present |first=Roland |last=Sarti |year=2004 |place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DES&gt;{{cite book|title=Napoleon's Italy: Desmond Gregory |first=Desmond |last=Gregory |year=2001 |place=AUP Cranbury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805 Italian troops served on garrison duty along the [[English Channel]], during 1806-1807 they took part in the sieges of [[Siege of Kolberg (1807)|Kolberg]] and [[Siege of Danzig (1807)|Danzig]] and fought in [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name=JRE/&gt; From 1808 to 1813 whole Italian divisions served in [[Peninsular War|Spain]], especially distinguishing themselves under [[Louis Gabriel Suchet|Suchet]] at [[Siege of Tarragona (1811)|Tarragona]] and [[Battle of Saguntum (1811)|Saguntum]].&lt;ref name=SWS&gt;{{cite book|title=Life of Napoleon Buonaparte: Vol.4 |first=Sir Walter |last=Scott |year=1843 |place=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ATH&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the consulate and the empire of France under Napoleon: Vol.13 |first=Adolphe |last=Thiers |year=1856 |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809, [[Eugène de Beauharnais|Eugène]]'s ''Army of Italy'' formed the right wing of Napoleon I's invasion of the [[Austrian Empire]], winning a considerable victory at [[Battle of Raab|Raab]] and having a respectable share in the victory at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]].&lt;ref name=JRE&gt;{{cite book|title=Swords around a throne |first=John R. |last=Elting |year=1988 |place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JRA&gt;{{cite book|title=Napoleon conquers Austria: the 1809 campaign for Vienna |first=James R. |last=Arnold |year=1995 |place=Westport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative system of the Kingdom was firstly drawn by a law on June 8, 1805. The state was divided, following the French system, in 14 ''[[départements]]'', the twelve ones inherited from the republican era plus Adda ([[Province of Sondrio|Sondrio]]) and Adige ([[Province of Verona|Verona]]). The chief of the department, the [[prefect]], was the State's representative in each province, improved the administrative decisions of the central government, controlled the local authorities, led of the police and, differently from the republican era, had all the executive powers in its territory. The local legislative body was the [[General councils (France)|General Council]], composed by the representatives of the communes.

The departments were divided in districts, equivalent to the French ''[[arrondissements]]''. The chief of the district was the vice-prefect, which had similar powers to the prefect, but over a smaller area. The local legislative body was the District Council, composed by eleven members. The districts were divided, as in France, in ''[[Cantons of France|cantons]]'', seats of Tax collectors and [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the peace]].

The cantons were divided in ''[[Communes of Italy|communes]]''. The communes had a City Council (''Consiglio Comunale'') of fifteen, thirty or forty members, chosen by the king or the prefect depending by the commune size. The Council elected two, four or six Elders for the ordinary administration, helped by a City Secretary. The chief of biggest communes was the royal ''[[Podestà]]'', when in smaller communes there was a prefectoral [[Mayor]]. All the city offices were held only by owners and traders, and the leadership of the owners was assured.

During the kingdom's life, the administrative system of the State changed for domestic and international reasons. Following the defeat of Austria and the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], Napoleon annexed to Italy the territory of former [[Republic of Venice]], as announced on March 30, 1806, and ratified on May 1. Seven new departments were created, six in the Venetian mainland, and one in Istria ([[Istria County|Capodistria]]), whereas [[Dalmatia]] received special institutions led by the General Provider Mr. Dandolo, and maintained its own laws. On July 14, 1807, the government passed a decree that reduced the number of the communes. Following the dissolution of the [[Papal States]], the kingdom was extended along the Adriatic coast, and on April 20, 1808, three new departments were established. The final territorial change came in action on June 10, 1810, when, as announced by Napoleon on previous May 28, Italy lost Istria and the never fully incorporated Dalmatia, gaining as reward all the southern [[County of Tyrol|Tirol]] up to the city of [[Bolzano]], creating the 24th and last department: [[Department of Alto Adige|Haut Adige]].&lt;ref&gt;Historical name changes can create confusion: the present-day Italian province of ''[[South Tyrol]]'' (called in Italian Alto Adige) does not cover the same area as the Napoleonic ''Alto Adige'', which mainly correspondeds to the province of ''[[Trentino]]'' including the city of ''[[Bolzano]]'' with its Southern surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and education===
The language used officially in the Kingdom of Italy was [[Italian language|Italian]]. The French language was used for ceremonies and in all relationships with France.

Education was made universal for all children, which was also conducted in Italian. By decree of the governor [[Vincenzo Dandolo]], this was so even in Istria and Dalmatia, where local populations were more heterogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;Sumrada, Janez. ''Napoleon na Jadranu / Napoleon dans l'Adriatique''.pag.37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and fall==
[[File:Prina lynched.jpg|thumb|right|The murder of finance minister Prina in Milan marked the effective end of the kingdom]]
When Napoleon abdicated to both the thrones of France and Italy on April 11, 1814, [[Eugène de Beauharnais]] was lined up the [[Mincio River]] with his army against the German invasion, and he attempted to be crowned king. The Senate of the Kingdom was summoned on April 17, but the senators showed themselves undecided in that chaotic situation. When a second session of the assembly took place on April 20, the Milan insurrection foiled the Viceroy's plan. In the riots, finance minister Count [[Giuseppe Prina]] was massacred by the crowd, and the Great Electors disbanded the Senate and called the Austrian forces to protect the city, while a ''Provisional Regency Government'' under the presidency of [[Carlo Verri]] was appointed.

Eugène surrendered on April 23, and was exiled to [[Bavaria]] by the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]], who occupied Milan on April 28. On April 26, the Empire appointed [[Annibale Sommariva]] as ''Imperial Commissioner'' of Lombardy, while many taxes were abolished or reduced by the Provisional Regency. Finally, on May 25, the Supreme Imperial Commissioner [[Count Heinrich von Bellegarde]] took all the powers in Lombardy, and former monarchies in [[Modena]], [[Romagna]] and [[Piedmont]] were gradually re-established; on May 30, the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, and the remains of the kingdom were annexed by the [[Austrian Empire]], as announced by Count Bellegarde on June 12.

The '''''lex Publilia''''', also known as the '''Publilian Rogation''', was a law traditionally passed in 471 BC, transferring the election of the [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunes of the plebs]] to the ''[[Tribal Assembly|comitia tributa]]'', thereby freeing their election from the direct influence of the Senate and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]].&lt;ref name="Livy ii 56"&gt;Livy, ii. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', p. 696 ("Publilia Lex").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berger1968"&gt;Berger, pp. 558 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raaflaub2008"&gt;Raaflaub, pp. 26 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 473 BC, the tribune [[Gnaeus Genucius]] ordered the arrest and trial of [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso (consul 474 BC)|Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] and [[Lucius Furius Medullinus Fusus (consul 474 BC)|Lucius Furius Medullinus]], the [[Roman consul|consuls]] of the previous year, for having used their power to obstruct [[agrarian law|agrarian reforms]].&lt;ref name="Livy ii 54"&gt;Livy, ii. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Genucius was already hated by the patricians; Titus Genucius, probably his brother, having brought to trial Titus Menenius Lanatus, who as consul in 477 had failed to intervene to prevent the disaster at the [[Battle of the Cremera|Cremera]], and Spurius Servilius Priscus Structus, who during his consulship in 476 had nearly lost his entire army due to his recklessness.  Before their trial, Manlius and Furius appeared in public in mourning dress, bewailing their fates, which they claimed had already been ordained by the tyranny of the plebeian tribunes, which rendered anyone elected to high office little more than sacrificial animals.  Their appeal to their supporters succeeded, for on the day of the trial Genucius was found murdered in his house.{{efn-lr|Such is the account given by Livy, who is followed by most modern historians.  Dionysius, however, denies that Genucius was murdered, stating that no sign of violence was found on the tribune's body.}}

The new consuls, [[Lucius Aemilius Mamercus]] and [[Vopiscus Julius Iulus]],{{efn-lr|Some sources give [[Opiter Verginius Tricostus Esquilinus (consul 478 BC)|Opiter Verginius Tricostus]] in place of Vopiscus Julius Iulus.&lt;ref name="Livy ii 54"/&gt;}} were ordered to levy troops as a distraction from the murder, and the other tribunes were too fearful to intervene.  When a former [[centurion]] named [[Volero Publilius]] refused to be enlisted as a common soldier, the consuls had him arrested and ordered him to be scourged by the [[lictor]]s.  Breaking free, Publilius appealed to the crowd for protection, and suddenly the tables were turned against the consuls, who fled for their lives and took refuge in the [[Curia Hostilia]].  Faced with the prospect of imminent revolt, the Senate refrained from taking any further action against the plebeians, and Publilius was elected tribune for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ii. 54, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, ix. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, xi. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publilius' Rogation==
As tribune of the plebs in BC 472, Publilius proposed a law transferring the election of the plebeian tribunes from the ''[[Curiate Assembly|comitia curiata]]'' (or possibly the ''[[Centuriate Assembly|comitia centuriata]]'') to the ''comitia tributa''.{{efn-lr|[[Cicero]] says that the tribunes were originally elected by the ''comitia curiata'', which is implied, but not explicitly stated by passages in Livy and Dionysius.  Niebuhr, however, argues that they were probably elected by the ''comitia centuriata'', and that the ''comitia curiata'' merely confirmed the choice of the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, vol. i. p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', p. 1150 ("Tribunus").&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The significance of this measure was that it would prevent the patricians from influencing the election through the votes of their ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientes]]''.  The proposal was debated throughout the year, but never passed.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ii. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Publilius brought the law forward for the second time.  The debate was marked by a confrontation between the consul [[Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis (consul 471 BC)|Appius Claudius Sabinus]] and Gaius Laetorius, one of the other plebeian tribunes, in which Laetorius tried to have Claudius removed before a vote could be held, and the consul ordered the tribune's arrest.  Bloodshed was averted when the other consul, [[Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus]], convinced a group of senators to hurry Claudius from the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], while he himself calmed the crowd.  In the Senate, Quinctius urged the senators to defer to the will of the people rather than risk tearing the state apart.  Despite his colleague's angry words, the opinion of Quinctius prevailed, and no further action was taken to obstruct the passage of the tribune's law.&lt;ref name="Livy ii 56"/&gt;

==Historicity==
Some scholars doubt that the patricians would have permitted the election of the plebeian tribunes to pass into the hands of the ''comitia tributa'' as early as traditionally reported.  Instead, they argue that this was probably accomplished by the ''lex Publilia'' of 339 BC, which included three major provisions: opening the [[Roman censor|censorship]] to the plebeians; making ''plebiscita'' binding on the entire community, rather than just the plebeians; and reducing the power of the ''comitia curiata'' to obstruct laws before they were sent to the ''comitia centuriata''.  In this case, the ''lex Publilia'' of 471 BC would be merely an anticipation of the later law.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', p. 899 ("Publilius Volero" and "Quintus Publilius Philo").&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MCI, Inc.''' ([[doing business as|d/b/a]] '''Verizon Business''') was an American [[telecommunication]] corporation, currently a subsidiary of [[Verizon Communications]], with its main office in [[Ashburn, Virginia]]. The corporation was formed originally as a result of the merger of '''WorldCom''' and [[MCI Communications]] corporations, and used the name '''MCI WorldCom''', succeeded by '''WorldCom''', before changing its name to the present version on April 12, 2003, as part of the corporation's ending of its bankruptcy status. The company traded on [[NASDAQ]] as WCOM (pre-bankruptcy) and MCIP (post-bankruptcy). The corporation was purchased by Verizon Communications with the deal finalizing on January 6, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/Verizon-closes-book-on-MCI-merger/2100-1037_3-6003498.html Verizon closes book on MCI merger].

Retrieved on 2011-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now identified as that company's '''[[Verizon Enterprise Solutions]]''' division with the local residential divisions being integrated slowly into local Verizon subsidiaries.

For a time, WorldCom was the United States's second largest long distance telephone company (after [[AT&amp;T]]). WorldCom grew largely by acquiring other telecommunications companies, most notably MCI Communications in 1998. In 1996, it acquired [[UUNET]], a [[Tier 1 ISP]] that forms a major part of the [[Internet backbone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/12/business/john-sidgmore-52-dies-headed-worldcom.html |title=John Sidgmore, 52, Dies; Headed WorldCom|date=December 12, 2003|work=NY Times|first=Barnaby J.|last=Feder}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally headquartered in [[Clinton, Mississippi]] before relocating to Ashburn, Virginia.&lt;ref name="HQInfo"&gt;"[http://www.secinfo.com/dr8Pp.25j.htm  MCI Inc – SC 13D/A – LCC International Inc ]."

== History ==

=== Corporate founding ===
The company began as '''Long Distance Discount Service''', Inc. (LDDS) during 1983, based in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. In 1985, LDDS selected [[Bernard Ebbers]] to be its [[chief executive officer|CEO]]. The company became traded publicly as a corporation in 1989 as a result of a merger with Advantage Companies Inc. The company name was changed to '''LDDS WorldCom''' in 1995, and relocated to [[Clinton, Mississippi]].

The company grew rapidly in the 1990s. Among the companies that were bought or merged with WorldCom were Advanced Communications Corp. (1992), [[Metromedia]] Communication Corp. (1993), Resurgens Communications Group (1993), IDB Communications Group, Inc (1994), Williams Technology Group, Inc. (1995), and MFS Communications Company (1996), and MCI in 1998. The acquisition of MFS included UUNET Technologies, Inc., which had been acquired by MFS shortly before the merger with WorldCom. In February 1998, WorldCom purchased—by a complex transaction—online pioneer company [[CompuServe]] from its parent company [[H&amp;R Block]]. WorldCom then retained the CompuServe Network Services Division, sold its online service to [[America Online]], and received AOL's network division, ANS. The acquisition of [[Digex]] (DIGX) during June 2001 was also complex; WorldCom acquired Digex's corporate parent, Intermedia Communications, and then sold all of Intermedia's non-Digex assets to Allegiance Telecom.

===MCI acquisition===
[[Image:Mci-Worldcom logo.png|thumb|280px|right|MCI WorldCom logo (used from 1998–2000)]]
On November 4, 1997, WorldCom and MCI Communications announced their US$37 billion merger to form MCI WorldCom, making it the largest corporate merger in U.S. history. On September 15, 1998, the new company, '''MCI WorldCom''', opened for business, after MCI divested itself of its successful "internetMCI" business to gain approval from the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/1829.htm |title=JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CLEARS WORLDCOM/MCI MERGER AFTER MCI AGREES TO SELL ITS INTERNET BUSINESS |date=July 15, 1998 |work=US Department of Justice |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601034716/http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/1829.htm |archivedate=June 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed Sprint merger ===
[[Image:Worldcom-logo.png|thumb|280px|right|WorldCom logo (used from 2000–2003)]]
On October 5, 1999, [[Sprint Corporation]] and MCI WorldCom announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies. Had the deal been completed, it would have been the largest corporate merger in history. The merged company would have surpassed AT&amp;T as the largest communications company in the [[United States]]. However, the deal floundered due to opposition from the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] and the [[European Union]] on concerns that it would create a monopoly. On July 13, 2000, the boards of directors of both companies terminated the merger. Later that year, MCI WorldCom renamed itself "WorldCom".

=== Accounting scandals ===
CEO [[Bernard Ebbers]] became very wealthy from the increasing price of his holdings in WorldCom common stock.&lt;ref name=sec&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723527/000093176303001862/dex991.htm|title=Report of Investigation by The Special Investigative Committee of the Board of Directors of Worldcom, Inc.|publisher=SEC| accessdate=2008-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the year 2000 the telecommunications industry was in decline. &lt;!-- page 33 of Worldcom report --&gt; WorldCom’s aggressive growth strategy suffered a serious setback when, in July 2000, it was forced by the U.S. Justice Department to abandon its proposed merger with Sprint.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt; By that time, WorldCom’s stock price was decreasing, and banks were placing increasing demands on Ebbers to cover [[margin call]]s on his WorldCom stock that were used to finance his other businesses ([[lumber]] and yachting, among others).&lt;ref name=sec /&gt; In 2001, Ebbers persuaded WorldCom’s board of directors to provide him corporate loans and guarantees in excess of $400 million to cover his margin calls.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt; The board hoped that the loans would avert the need for Ebbers to sell substantial amounts of his WorldCom stock, as his doing so would result in a further decrease of the stock's price. However, this strategy failed. In April 2002, Ebbers resigned as CEO and was replaced by [[John W. Sidgmore|John Sidgmore]], former CEO of [[UUNET Technologies Inc]].

Beginning modestly during mid-1999 and continuing at an accelerated pace through May 2002, the company—directed by Ebbers (as CEO), [[Scott Sullivan (executive)|Scott Sullivan]] (CFO), David Myers ([[Controller (accounting)|Controller]]), and Buford "Buddy" Yates (Director of General Accounting)—used [[fraud]]ulent accounting methods to disguise its decreasing earnings to maintain the price of WorldCom’s stock.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt;

The fraud was accomplished primarily in two ways:

#Booking "line costs" (interconnection expenses with other telecommunication companies) as [[capital expenditure]]s on the balance sheet instead of [[expense]]s.
#Inflating revenues with bogus accounting entries from "corporate unallocated revenue accounts".

In 2002, a small team of internal auditors at WorldCom worked together, often at night and secretly, to investigate and reveal $3.8 billion worth of fraud.&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournal&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Pulliam |author2=Deborah Soloman  |title=How Three Unlikely Sleuths Exposed Fraud at WorldCom: Firm's Own Employees Sniffed Out Cryptic Clues and Followed Hunches |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1035929943494003751 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time2002b&gt;{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Ripley |authorlink=Amanda Ripley |title=The Night Detective |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003990,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2008-11-08 | date=December 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExtraCircPatsyLee&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper|first=Cynthia |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Extraordinary Circumstances: The Journey of a Corporate Whistleblower |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0470124296/ref=sib_dp_pt# |accessdate=2008-11-08|series= |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] |location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] |isbn=978-0-470-12429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, the company’s audit committee and board of directors were notified of the fraud and acted swiftly: Sullivan was dismissed, Myers resigned, [[Arthur Andersen]] withdrew its audit opinion for 2001, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) began an investigation into these matters on June 26, 2002 (see [[accounting scandal]]).

By the end of 2003, it was estimated that the company's total assets had been inflated by about $11 billion.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt;  This made the WorldCom scandal the largest accounting fraud in American history until the exposure of [[Bernard Madoff]]'s [[Madoff investment scandal|$64 billion Ponzi scheme]] in 2008.

=== Bankruptcy ===
On July 21, 2002, WorldCom filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in the largest such filing in [[United States]] history at the time (since overtaken by the bankruptcies of both [[Lehman Brothers]] and [[Washington Mutual]] in a span of eleven days during September 2008). The WorldCom bankruptcy proceedings were held before U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Judge [[Arthur Gonzalez|Arthur J. Gonzalez]], who simultaneously heard the [[Enron]] bankruptcy proceedings, which were the second largest bankruptcy case resulting from one of the largest corporate fraud scandals. None of the criminal proceedings against WorldCom and its officers and agents were originated by referral from Gonzalez or the Department of Justice lawyers. By the bankruptcy reorganization agreement, the company paid $750 million to the SEC in cash and stock in the new MCI, which was intended to be paid to wronged investors.

Effective December 16, 2002, [[Michael Capellas]] became chairman and chief executive officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= WorldCom, Inc. Annual Report |date= March 12, 2004 |publisher= Securities and Exchange Commission |work= Edgar form 10-K  |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723527/000119312504039709/d10k.htm |accessdate= August 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 2003, WorldCom changed its name to '''MCI''', and relocated its corporate headquarters from [[Clinton, Mississippi]], to [[Dulles, Virginia]].

During May 2003, the company was given a [[no-bid contract]] by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to build a [[cellular telephone]] network in [[Iraq]]. The deal has been criticized by competitors and others, who cite the company's lack of experience with that technology.{{Update inline|date=May 2015}}

The SEC and WorldCom concluded a deal in which WorldCom agreed to pay a civil penalty of $2.25 billion. The deal was approved by federal judge [[Jed Rakoff]] during July 2003.&lt;ref name=DoJ030707&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-81.htm The Honorable Jed Rakoff Approves Settlement of SEC'S Claim for a Civil Penalty Against Worldcom], ''[[US Department of Justice]]'', July 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a sweeping consent decree, the SEC and Rakoff essentially took control of WorldCom.  Rakoff appointed former SEC chairman [[Richard C. Breeden]] to oversee WorldCom's compliance with the SEC agreement. Breeden actively involved himself with the management of the company, and prepared a report for Rakoff, titled Restoring Trust, in which he proposed extensive corporate governance reforms, as part of an effort to "cast the new MCI into what he hoped would become a model of how shareholders should be protected and how companies should be run".&lt;ref name=RTrust&gt;[http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/rulings/02cv4963_082603.pdf Restoring Trust: Corporate Governance for the future of MCI].

=== Post-bankruptcy ===
[[Image:Bernard Ebbers.jpg|120px|thumb|right|Bernard Ebbers]]
The company emerged from [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy during 2004 with about $5.7 billion in debt and $6 billion in cash. About half of the cash was intended to pay various claims and settlements.  Previous [[Bond (finance)|bondholders]] ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar, in bonds and stock in the new MCI company.  The previous stockholders' [[stock]] was cancelled, making it totally worthless.

It had yet to pay many of its creditors, who had waited for two years for a portion of the money owed. Many of the small creditors included former employees, primarily those who were dismissed during June 2002 and whose severance and benefits were withheld when WorldCom filed for bankruptcy.

On August 7, 2002, the ''exWorldCom 5100'' group was formed. It was composed of former WorldCom employees with a common goal of seeking full payment of severance pay and benefits based on the WorldCom Severance Plan. The "5100" stands for the number of WorldCom employees dismissed on June 28, 2002 before WorldCom filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcomnews.com/ |title=WorldCom News |publisher=WorldCom News |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2005, [[Verizon Communications]] agreed to acquire MCI for $7.6 billion.

On March 15, 2005, [[Bernard Ebbers]] was found guilty of all charges and convicted of fraud, conspiracy and filing false documents with regulators — all related to the $11 billion accounting scandal. Other former WorldCom officials charged with criminal penalties in relation to the company's financial misstatements include former CFO Scott Sullivan (entered a guilty plea on March 2, 2004, to one count each of securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and filing false statements),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/02/technology/ebbers/ | work=CNN | title=Ebbers indicted, ex-CFO pleads guilty | date=March 2, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; former controller David Myers (pleaded guilty to securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and filing false statements on September 27, 2002),&lt;ref&gt;John Geralds [https://web.archive.org/web/20061118125828/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2120212/former-worldcom-exec-pleads-guilty Former WorldCom exec pleads guilty]. vnunet.com. 27 Sep 2002&lt;/ref&gt; former accounting [[Board of directors|director]] Buford Yates (pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges on October 7, 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/telecom/2002-10-07-yates-plea_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Another guilty plea in WorldCom fraud case | first1=Andrew | last1=Backover | date=October 7, 2002 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former accounting managers Betty Vinson and Troy Normand (both pleading guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud on October 10, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/05/national/main528148.shtml 2 More WorldCom Execs Plead Guilty].

On July 13, 2005, Bernard Ebbers received a sentence that would keep him imprisoned for 25 years.  At time of sentencing, Ebbers was 63 years old.  On September 26, 2006, Ebbers surrendered himself to the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] prison at [[Oakdale, Louisiana]], the [[Oakdale Federal Correctional Institution]], to begin serving his sentence.

In December 2005, Microsoft Corporation announced that MCI will join it by providing [[Windows Live Messenger]] customers "Voice Over Internet Protocol" ([[VoIP]]) service to make telephone calls. This was MCI's last new product—- called "MCI Web Calling". After the merger, this product was renamed "Verizon Web Calling".

In March 2007, 16 of [[WorldCom]]'s 17 former underwriters reached settlements with the investors.&lt;ref&gt;Rovella, David E..

'''[[Melodifestivalen]] 1974''' was the selection for the 15th song to represent [[Sweden]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was the 14th time that this system of picking a song had been used. 10 songwriters were selected by [[Sveriges Radio|SR]] for the competition. The final was broadcast on [[SVT1|TV1]] but was not broadcast on radio. ABBA went on to win that year's Eurovision Song Contest in [[Brighton]], Sweden's first Eurovision win.

'''Mobilization''', in military terminology, is the act of assembling and readying [[troops]] and supplies for [[war]]. The word ''mobilization'' was first used, in a military context, to describe the preparation of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] during the 1850s and 1860s. Mobilization theories and techniques have continuously changed since then. The opposite of mobilization is [[demobilization]].

Mobilization became an issue with the introduction of [[conscription]], and the introduction of the railways in the 19th century. Mobilization institutionalized the mass levy of forces that was first introduced during the [[French Revolution]], and that had changed the character of war. A number of technological and societal changes promoted the move towards a more organized way of assembling armies. These included the [[telegraph]] to provide rapid communication, the railways to provide rapid movement and concentration of troops, and conscription to provide a trained [[Military reserve force|reserve]] of soldiers in case of war.

==Roman Empire==
The [[Roman Empire]] was able to mobilize at various times sizeable forces, which including poorly trained [[militia]] totaled between 6% (81–83 BCE) to, in emergency and for short periods, as much as 10% (210s BCE) of total Roman population (which included as many as 75% of males aged 17–45).&lt;ref name="LigtNorthwood2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Luuk de Ligt|author2=S. J. Northwood|title=People, Land, and Politics: Demographic Developments and the Transformation of Roman Italy 300 BC-AD 14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4toKjuTLOQUC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-17118-5|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
The [[Confederate States of America]] is estimated to have mobilized about 11% of its free population in [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865).&lt;ref name="LigtNorthwood2008"/&gt; The [[Kingdom of Prussia]] mobilized about 6–7% of its total population in the years 1760 and 1813.&lt;ref name="LigtNorthwood2008"/&gt; The [[Swedish Empire]] mobilized 7.7% in 1709.&lt;ref name="LigtNorthwood2008"/&gt;

Armies in the seventeenth century possessed an average of 20,000 men.&lt;ref name="Onorato"&gt;Onorato, Massimiliano G., Kenneth Scheve, and David Stasavage. Technology and the Era of the Mass Army. Thesis. IMT Lucca, Stanford University, and New York University, 2013. Retrieved from http://www.politics.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/5395/mobilization-July-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A military force of this size requires around 20 tons of food per day, shelter, as well as all the necessary munitions, transportation (typically horses or mules), tools, and representative garments.&lt;ref name="Onorato"/&gt; Without efficient transportation, mobilizing these average-sized forces was extremely costly, time-consuming, and potentially life-threatening.&lt;ref name="Onorato"/&gt; Soldiers could traverse the terrain to get to war fronts, but they had to carry their supplies.&lt;ref name="Onorato"/&gt; Many armies decided to forage for food;&lt;ref name="Onorato"/&gt; however, [[foraging]] restricted movement because it is based on the presumption that the land the army moves over possesses significant agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Onorato"/&gt;

However, due to new policies (like conscription), greater populations, and greater national wealth, the nineteenth-century army was composed of an average of 100,000 men. For example, in 1812 Bonaparte led an army of 600,000 [[French invasion of Russia|to Moscow]] while feeding off plentiful agricultural products introduced by the turn of the century, such as potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Vincennes, Archive de l’Armèe de Terre (AAT), 7N848, Gaston Bodart, “Die Starkeverhaltnisse in den bedeutesten Schlachten.” Craig, ''The Battle of Königgrätz''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the advantages of mass armies, mobilizing forces of this magnitude took much more time than it had in the past.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Michael Howard, The Franco-Prussian War (1961; London: Granada, 1979), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Italian War of Independence]] illustrated all of the problems in modern army mobilization. Prussia began to realize the future of mobilizing mass armies when [[Napoleon III]] transported 130,000 soldiers to Italy by [[military railways]].&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt; French caravans that carried the supplies for the French and [[Piedmont|Piedmontese]] armies were incredibly slow, and the arms inside these caravans were sloppily organized.&lt;ref name="Vincennes_845"&gt;Vincennes, AAT, MR 845, Anon., “Précis historique de la campagne d’Italie en 1859.” Wolf Schneider von Arno, “Der österreichisch-ungarische Generalstab,” (Kriegsarchiv Manuscript), vol. 7, pp. 18, 54, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; These armies were in luck, however, in that their Austrian adversaries experienced similar problems with sluggish supply caravans (one of which apparently covered less than three miles per day).&lt;ref name="Vincennes_845"/&gt;

Not only did Prussia take note of the problems in transporting supplies to armies, but it also took note of the lack of communication between troops, officers, and generals. Austria’s army was primarily composed of [[Slavs]], but it contained many other ethnicities as well.&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;D. N., “Über die Truppensprachen unserer Armee,” Österreichische Militärische Zeitschrift (ÖMZ) 2 (1862), pp. 365-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian military instruction during peacetime utilized nine different languages, accustoming Austrian soldiers to taking orders only in their native language.&lt;ref name="DN"/&gt; Conversely, in an effort to augment the efficacy of the new “[[precision rifle]]” developed by the monarchy, officers were forced to only speak German when giving orders to their men.&lt;ref name="DN"/&gt; Even one Austrian officer commented at [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]] that his troops could not even comprehend the command, “Halt.”&lt;ref name="DN"/&gt; This demonstrates the ''communicative'' problems that arose quickly with the advent of the mass army.

==Mobilization in World War I==
[[Image:Schlieffen Plan.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] and planned French counter-offensives]]

Intricate plans for mobilization contributed greatly to the beginning of [[World War I]], since in 1914, under the laws and customs of warfare then observed (not to mention the desire to avoid compromising national security), general mobilization of one nation's military forces was invariably considered an [[Casus belli|act of war]] by that country's likely enemies.

In 1914, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] was the only [[Europe]]an [[Great Power]] without [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscription]]. The other Great Powers ([[Austria-Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) all relied on compulsory military service to supply each of their armies with the millions of men they believed they would need to win a major war. France enacted the “[[Conscription in France|Three Year Law]]” (1913) to extend the service of conscripted soldiers to match the size of the German army, as the French population of 40 million was smaller than the German population of 65 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keegan|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/germany.htm
 |title=Population of Germany
 |publisher=Tacitus.nu |date=2008-08-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglo-German naval arms race]] began, sparked by the German enactment of the [[German Naval Laws|Second Naval Law]]. Each of the Great Powers could only afford to keep a fraction of these men in uniform in peacetime, the rest were [[military reserve|reservists]] with limited opportunities to train. Maneuvering formations of millions of men with limited military training required intricate plans with no room for error, confusion, or discretion after mobilization began. These plans were prepared under the assumption of [[scenario|worst-case scenarios]].

For example, German military leaders did not plan to mobilize for war with Russia whilst assuming that France would not come to her ally's aid, or vice versa. The [[Schlieffen Plan]] therefore dictated not only mobilization against both powers, but also the order of attack—France would be attacked first regardless of the diplomatic circumstances. To bypass the fortified Franco-German frontier, the German forces were to be ordered to march through [[Belgium]]. Whether or not Russia had committed the first provocation, the German plan agreed to by [[William II, German Emperor|Emperor William II]] called for the attack on Russia to take place only after France was defeated.

[[File:Mobilisatiezakboekje van Joseph-Nicolas-François Vandebroek, item 3.jpg|thumb|left|Belgian army mobilisation papers to join a [[Lancers|Lanciers]] regiment]]
Similarly, the Russian [[Stavka]]'s war planning assumed that war against either Austria-Hungary or Germany would mean war against the other power. Although the plan allowed flexibility as to whether the main effort would be made against Germany or Austria-Hungary, in either case units would be mobilized on the frontiers of both Powers. On July 28, 1914, [[Tsar Nicholas II]] of Russia (William's cousin) ordered partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary only. While war with Austria-Hungary seemed inevitable, Nicholas [[Willy–Nicky correspondence|engaged in a personal dialogue with the German Emperor]] in an attempt to avoid war with Germany. However, Nicholas was advised that attempts to improvise a partial mobilization would lead to chaos and probable defeat if, as pessimists on the Russian side expected, no amount of diplomacy could convince the Germans to refrain from attacking Russia whilst she was engaged with Germany's ally. On July 29, 1914, the Tsar ordered full mobilization, then changed his mind after receiving a telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm. Partial mobilization was ordered instead.

The next day, the Tsar's [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|foreign minister]], [[Sergey Sazonov]] once more persuaded Nicholas of the need for general mobilization, and the order was issued that day, July 30.  In response, Germany declared war on Russia.

Germany mobilized under [[Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke|von Moltke the Younger]]'s revised version of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], which assumed a [[two-front war]] with Russia and France. Like Russia, Germany decided to follow its two-front plans despite the one-front war. Germany declared war on France on August 3, 1914, one day after issuing an ultimatum to Belgium demanding the right of German troops to pass through as part of the planned pincer action of the military. Finally, Britain declared war on Germany for violating Belgian neutrality.

Thus the entangling alliances of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and the [[Triple Entente]] directed the intricate plans for mobilization. This brought all of the Great Powers of Europe into the Great War without actually utilizing the provisions of either alliance.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-022-19A, Mobilmachung, Truppentransport mit der Bahn.jpg|thumb|right|German soldiers in a railway [[Passenger car (rail)|car]] on the way to the front in August 1914. The message on the car reads '''Von München über Metz nach Paris'''. (From [[Munich]] via [[Metz]] to [[Paris]]).]]

The mobilization was like a holiday for many of the inexperienced soldiers; for example, some Germans wore flowers in the muzzles of their rifles as they marched. Trains brought soldiers to the front lines of battle. The Germans timetabled the movements of 11,000 trains as they brought troops across the [[Rhine River]]. The French mobilized around 7,000 trains for movement. [[Horse]]s were also mobilized [[Horses in World War I|for war]]. The British had 165,000 horses prepared for [[cavalry]], the Austrians 600,000, the Germans 715,000, and the Russians over a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keegan|1999|loc=(footnote points to Bucholz, p. 163) pp. 73-74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's [[Dominion]]s including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] were compelled to go to war when Britain did. However, it was largely left up to the individual Dominions to recruit and equip forces for the war effort. Canadian, Australian and New Zealand mobilizations all involved the creation of new field forces for overseas service rather than using the existing regimental structures as a framework. In the case of Canada, the Militia Minister, Sir [[Sam Hughes]], created the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] from whole cloth by sending telegrams to 226 separate reserve unit commanders asking for volunteers to muster at [[Valcartier]] in Quebec. The field force served separately from the [[Permanent Active Militia|Militia]] (Canada's peace time army); in 1920 the [[Otter Commission]] was compelled to sort out which units would perpetuate the units that served in the trenches—the CEF or the prewar Militia. A unique solution of perpetuations was instituted, and mobilization during the Second World War did not repeat Sir Sam Hughes' model, which has been described by historians as being more closely akin to ancient Scottish clans assembling for battle than a modern, industrialized nation preparing for war.

"Colonials" served under British command though, perhaps owing to the limited autonomy granted to the Dominions regarding their respective mobilizations, the Dominions eventually compelled the British government to overrule the objections of some British commanders and let the Dominion forces serve together instead of being distributed amongst various British divisions. The "colonials" would go on to be acknowledged by both the British and German high commands as being elite British units. In May 1918, when command of the [[Australian Corps]] passed from [[William Birdwood]] to [[John Monash]], it became the first British Empire formation commanded totally free of British officers.

On May 23, 1915, Italy entered World War I on the Allied side. Despite being the weakest of the big four Allied powers, the Italians soon managed to populate its army from 560 to 693 infantry battalions in 1916; the army had grown in size from 1 million to 1.5 million soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keegan|1999|p=275}} (note also: field artillery pieces went from 1,788 to 2,068)&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 1916, [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] entered the war on the Allied side, mobilizing an army of 23 divisions. Romania was quickly defeated however by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Bulgaria went so far as to ultimately mobilize 1.2 million men, more than a quarter of its population of 4.3 million people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.

The production of supplies gradually increased throughout the war. In Russia, the expansion of industry allowed a 2,000 percent increase in the production of artillery shells - by November 1915, over 1,512,000 artillery shells were being produced per month. In France, a massive mobilization by the female population to work in factories allowed the rate of shell production to reach 100,000 shells a day by 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keegan|1999|pp=275-276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sides also began drawing on larger numbers of soldiers. The British Secretary of State for War, [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], appealed for hundreds of thousands of soldiers, which was met with an enthusiastic response. 30 new British divisions were created. The response by volunteers allowed the British to put off the introduction of conscription until [[Military Service Act 1916|1916]]. New Zealand [[Conscription in New Zealand|followed suit]], with Canada also eventually introducing conscription with the [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]] in 1917.

On April 6, 1917, the [[United States]] entered the war on the Allied side. At the entrance, the U.S. only could mobilize its army of 107,641 soldiers, ranked only seventeenth in size worldwide at the time. The [[United States Navy]] quickly mobilized, adding 5 [[dreadnoughts]] to the Allied navy. However, conscription quickly ensued. By March 1918, 318,000 U.S. soldiers had been mobilized to France. Eventually, by October 1918, a force of  2 million U.S. soldiers joined in the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keegan|1999|pp=351-353, 372-374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobilization in World War II==
[[File:Hevosia lähdössä talvisotaan.jpg|thumb|Horses and carriages requisitioned in the mobilization before [[Winter War]]]]
[[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] partly mobilized its troops on August 24, 1939, and fully mobilized on August 30, 1939, following the increased confrontations with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] since [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|March 1939]]. On September 1, 1939 Germany invaded Poland, which prompted both France and Britain to [[British and French declaration of war on Germany|declare war]] on Germany. However, they were slow to mobilize, and by the time Poland had been overrun by the Axis powers, only [[Phoney War|minor operations]] had been carried out by the French at the [[Saar River]].

Canada actually carried out a partial mobilization on August 25, 1939, in anticipation of the growing [[diplomatic crisis]]. On September 1, 1939, the [[Canadian Active Service Force]] (a corps-sized force of two divisions) was mobilized even though war was not declared by Canada until September 10, 1939. Only one division went overseas in December 1939, and the government hoped to follow a "limited liability" war policy. When France was invaded in May 1940, the Canadian government realized that would not be possible and mobilized three additional divisions, beginning their overseas employment in August 1940 with the dispatch of the [[2nd Canadian Division]] (some units of which were deployed to [[Iceland in World War II|Iceland]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] for garrison duty before moving to the UK). Canada also enacted the [[National Resources Mobilization Act]] in 1940, which among other things compelled men to serve in the military, though conscripts mobilized under the NRMA did not serve overseas until 1944. Conscripts did, however, serve in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] in 1943 though the anticipated Japanese defense never materialized due to the evacuation of the enemy garrison before the landings. Service in the Aleutians was not considered "overseas" as technically the islands were part of North America.

The United Kingdom mobilized 22% of its total population for direct military service, more than any other nation of WWII era.&lt;ref name="Axelrod2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Axelrod|title=Encyclopedia of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbWFgjW6KX8C&amp;pg=PA399|year=2007|publisher=H W Fowler|isbn=978-0-8160-6022-1|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobilization during the Cold War==

{{Main|Cold War}}
Full scale mobilizations were not enacted by the United States and the Soviet Union or their respective allies, during the Cold War, as the era was characterized as "[[Proxy war|war by proxy]]". While many leading nations participated in military actions, some of significant size, national mobilization in the historical sense never occurred. Examples of this would be US involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], though their enemies may be said to have mobilized, as well as the [[Falklands War]] between the UK and Argentina.

==Economic mobilization==
Economic mobilization is the preparation of resources for usage in a [[national emergency]] by carrying out changes in the organization of the national economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usmilitary.about.com/od/glossarytermsd/g/economicmob.htm "Economic mobilization"]. About.com. Accessed on May 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reorganizing the functioning of the national economy to use resources most effectively in support of the [[total war]] effort. Typically, the available resources and productive capabilities of each nation determined the degree and intensity of economic mobilization. Thus, effectively mobilizing economic resources to support the war effort is a complex process, requiring superior coordination and productive capability on a national scale.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Mark. The Economics of World War II: Six great powers in international comaprison. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, some scholars have argued that such large scale mobilization of society and its resources for the purposes of warfare have the effect of aiding in state building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbst|first=Jeffrey|date=Spring 1990|title=War and the State in Africa|url=|journal=International Security|volume=14|pages=117|doi=10.2307/2538753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbst argues that the demands of reacting to an external aggressor provides a strong enough impetus to force structural changes and also forge a common national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbst|first=Jeffrey|date=|title=War and the State in Africa|url=|journal=International Security|volume=14|pages=113|doi=10.2307/2538753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Napoleonic Wars''' (1803&amp;ndash;1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its allies, led by [[Napoleon I]], against a fluctuating array of [[Coalition forces of the Napoleonic Wars|European powers formed into various coalitions]], financed and usually led by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the [[French Revolution]] and its [[French Revolutionary Wars|resultant conflict]]. The wars are often categorised into five conflicts, each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon: the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] (1805), the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth]] (1806–07), [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Fifth]] (1809), [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth]] (1813), and the [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh and final]] (1815). 

Napoleon, upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799, had inherited a [[First French Republic|chaotic republic]]; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. In 1805, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] waged war against France. In response, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in December 1805, which is considered his greatest victory. At sea, the British severely defeated the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on October 1805. 
This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented the [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|invasion of Britain itself]]. [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] concerns about increasing French power led to a resumption of war in October 1806. Napoleon [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|quickly defeated the Prussians]], and [[Battle of Friedland|defeated Russia]] in June 1807, bringing an [[Treaties of Tilsit|uneasy peace]] to the continent. The peace failed, though, as war broke out in 1809, and a new coalition was [[Battle of Wagram|soon defeated]]. 

Hoping to [[Continental System|isolate Britain economically]], Napoleon invaded [[Iberia]], declaring his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] king of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and Portuguese revolted with British support, and, after [[Peninsular War|six years of fighting]], expelled the French from Iberia in 1814. Concurrently, Russia, unwilling to bear economic consequences of reduced trade, routinely violated the [[Continental System]], enticing Napoleon to launch a [[French invasion of Russia|massive invasion of Russia]] in 1812. The resulting campaign ended with the dissolution and withdrawal of the French ''[[Grande Armée]]''. Encouraged by the defeat, Prussia, Austria, and Russia began a new campaign against France, decisively defeating Napoleon at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in October 1813 after several inconclusive engagements. The Allies then invaded France, capturing Paris at the end of March 1814 and forcing Napoleon to abdicate in early April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]], and the [[Bourbon restoration|Bourbons were restored to power]]. However, Napoleon escaped in February 1815, and reassumed control of France. The Allies responded with the Seventh Coalition, defeating Napoleon permanently at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in June 1815 and exiling him to [[St Helena]], a British territory midway between [[Africa]] and [[Brazil]], where he died six years later.&lt;ref name="zamoy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zamoyski |first1=Adam |title=Napolean: A Life |date=16 October 2018 |publisher=Basic Books |location=London |isbn=9780465055937 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congress of Vienna]] redrew the borders of Europe, and brought a lasting peace to the continent. The wars had profound consequences on global history, including the spread of [[nationalism]] and [[liberalism]], the rise of the [[British Empire]] as the world's [[Pax Britannica|foremost power]], the appearance of [[Latin American wars of independence|independence movements]] in [[Latin America]] and subsequent collapse of the [[Spanish Empire]], the fundamental reorganisation of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods of conducting warfare.

==Overview==
Napoleon [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|seized power]] in 1799, creating a ''de facto'' [[military dictatorship]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43294-4|pages=193–194|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of opinions on the date to use as the formal beginning of the Napoleonic Wars; 18 May 1803 is often used, when Britain and France ended the only short period of peace between 1792 and 1814.&lt;ref name="Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43"&gt;Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801-1805'' (2007) pp 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; The Napoleonic Wars began with the [[War of the Third Coalition]], which was the first of the [[Coalition Wars]] against the [[First French Republic]] after Napoleon's accession as leader of [[France]].

Britain ended the [[Treaty of Amiens]] and declared war on France in May 1803. Among the reasons were Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of [[Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|control over Switzerland]]. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] was an [[Prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers.&lt;ref name="Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43"/&gt;

The British quickly enforced a [[naval blockade]] of France to starve it of resources. Napoleon responded with [[Continental System|economic embargoes against Britain]], and sought to eliminate Britain's Continental allies to break the coalitions arrayed against him. The so-called ''[[Continental System]]'' formed a [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|league of armed neutrality]] to disrupt the blockade and enforce [[free trade]] with France. The British responded by [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|capturing the Danish fleet]], breaking up the league, and later [[Battle of Trafalgar|secured dominance over the seas]], allowing it to freely continue its strategy. Napoleon won the [[War of the Third Coalition]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing the [[Austrian Empire]] [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|out of the war]] and formally dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Within months, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] declared war, triggering a [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. This war ended disastrously for Prussia, [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|defeated and occupied]] within 19 days of the beginning of the campaign. Napoleon subsequently defeated the [[Russian Empire]] at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], creating powerful client states in Eastern Europe and ending the fourth coalition.

Concurrently, the refusal of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] to commit to the Continental System, and [[Spanish Empire|Spain's]] failure to maintain it, led to the [[Peninsular War]] and the outbreak of the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]]. The French occupied Spain and formed a [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spanish client kingdom]], ending the alliance between the two. Heavy British involvement in the Iberian Peninsula soon followed, while a [[Walcheren Expedition|British effort to capture Antwerp]] failed. Napoleon oversaw the situation in Iberia, [[Battle of Somosierra|defeating the Spanish]], and [[Battle of Corunna|expelling the British]] from the Peninsula. Austria, keen to recover territory lost during the [[War of the Third Coalition]], invaded France's client states in Eastern Europe. Napoleon defeated the fifth coalition at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]].

Attempts to disrupt the British blockade led to the United States [[War of 1812|declaring war on Britain]], while grievances over control of Poland, and Russia's withdrawal from the [[Continental System]], led to [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon invading Russia]] in June 1812. The invasion was an unmitigated disaster for Napoleon; [[Scorched-earth|scorched earth]] tactics, [[desertion]], [[Battle of Borodino|French strategic failures]] and the onset of the Russian winter [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|compelled Napoleon to retreat with massive losses]]. Napoleon suffered further setbacks; French power in the Iberian Peninsula was broken at [[Battle of Vitoria]] the following summer, and a new coalition began the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].

The coalition defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], precipitating his fall from power and eventual abdication on 6 April 1814. The victors exiled Napoleon to [[Elba]] and [[Bourbon Restoration|restored the Bourbon monarchy]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, gathering enough support to overthrow the monarchy of [[Louis XVIII]], triggering a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|seventh, and final, coalition against him]]. Napoleon was [[Battle of Waterloo|decisively defeated at Waterloo]], and he abdicated again on 22 June. On 15 July, he surrendered to the British at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], and was exiled to [[Saint Helena]], where he died in 1821.

==Background==
{{Seealso|French Revolutionary Wars}}
[[File:Valmy Battle painting.jpg|thumb|French victory over the Prussians at the [[Battle of Valmy]] in 1792]]
The outbreak of the French Revolution had been received with great alarm by the rulers of Europe's continental powers, which had been further exacerbated by the [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution of Louis XVI of France]], and the [[French First Republic|overthrow of the French monarchy]]. In 1793, the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[Enlightenment Spain|Spanish Empire]], and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] formed the [[First Coalition]] to curtail the growing unrest in France. Measures such as [[Levée en masse|mass conscription]], military reforms, and total war allowed France to defeat the coalition, despite the [[War in the Vendée|concurrent civil war in France]]. [[Napoleon]], then a general in the French army, forced the Austrians to sign the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], leaving only Great Britain opposed to the fledgling French Republic.

A [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]] formed in 1798 by Great Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Papal States]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]]. The French Republic, under the [[French Directory|Directory]], suffered from heavy levels of corruption and [[Chouannerie|internal strife]]. The new republic also lacked funds, and no longer enjoyed the services of [[Lazare Carnot]], the minister of war who had guided France to its victories during the early stages of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolution]]. Bonaparte, commander of the [[Armée d'Italie]] in the latter stages of the First Coalition, had [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|launched a campaign in Egypt]], intending to disrupt the British economic powerhouse of [[British India|India]]. Pressed from all sides, the Republic suffered a string of successive defeats against revitalised enemies, supported by Britain's financial help.

[[File:Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte defeats the Austrians at the [[Battle of Rivoli]] in 1797]]
Bonaparte returned to France from Egypt on 23 August 1799, his [[Battle of the Nile|campaign there having failed]]. He seized control of the French government on 9 November, in [[coup of 18 Brumaire|a bloodless coup d'état]], replacing the Directory with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and transforming the republic into a ''de facto'' dictatorship.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt; He further reorganised the French military forces, establishing a large reserve army positioned to support campaigns on the [[Rhine]] or in [[Italy]]. [[Second Battle of Zurich|Russia had already been knocked out of the war]], and, under Napoleon's leadership, the French [[Battle of Marengo|decisively defeated the Austrians in June 1800]], crippling Austrian capabilities in Italy. Austria was [[Battle of Hohenlinden|definitively defeated that December]], by Moreau's forces in Bavaria. The Austrian defeat was sealed by the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] early the following year, further compelling the British to sign the [[Treaty of Amiens]] with France, establishing a tenuous peace.

===Start date and nomenclature===
No consensus exists as to when the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] ended and the Napoleonic Wars began. Possible dates include 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|seized power on 18 Brumaire]], the date according to the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]] then in use;&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, ''Napoleon'' (1998). p 215.&lt;/ref&gt; 18 May 1803, when Britain and France ended the one short period of peace between 1792 and 1814; or 2 December 1804, when Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of the War Of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VljA5QEI9_wC&amp;pg=PA499|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British historians occasionally refer to the nearly continuous period of warfare from 1792 to 1815 as the Great French War, or as the final phase of the Anglo-French [[Second Hundred Years' War]], spanning the period 1689 to 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur H. Buffinton, ''The Second Hundred Years' War, 1689–1815''  (1929). See also: Francois Crouzet, "The Second Hundred Years War: Some Reflections". ''French History'' 10 (1996), pp. 432–450. and H. M. Scott, "Review: The Second 'Hundred Years War' 1689–1815". ''The Historical Journal'' 35 (1992), pp. 443–469.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Mike Rapport (2013) suggested to use the term "French Wars" to unambiguously describe the entire period from 1792 to 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rapport |first=Mike |date=2013 |title=The Napoleonic Wars: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPK7XxVwF6YC&amp;pg=PA4 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=4 |isbn=9780191642517 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the Napoleonic Wars are generally integrated with the French Revolutionary Wars: ''{{lang|fr|Les guerres de la Révolution et de l'Empire}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herodote.net/histoire/synthese.php?ID=560 France - Les guerres de la Révolution et de l'Empire]. Herodote.net. Retrieved on 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

German historiography may count the War of the Second Coalition (1798/9–1801/2), during which Napoleon seized power, as the ''Erster Napoleonischer Krieg'' ("First Napoleonic War").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rabich |first=Adalbert |date=2011 |title=Die Regionalgeschichte von Dülmen und Umgebung, Teil 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmA1lqBCMlwC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq="erster+napoleonischer+krieg"&amp;hl=en |location=Norderstedt |publisher=GRIN Verlag |page=37 |isbn=9783640805846 |accessdate=29 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dutch historiography, it is common to refer to the seven major wars between 1792 and 1815 as the [[Coalition Wars]] (''coalitieoorlogen''), referring to the first two as the French Revolution Wars (''Franse Revolutieoorlogen'').&lt;ref name="Encarta coalitieoorlogen"&gt;{{nl icon}} Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v.

===Napoleon's tactics===
Napoleon was, and remains, famous for his battlefield victories, and historians have spent enormous attention in analysing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chandler |title=The Campaigns of Napoleon. The Mind and Method of History's Greatest Soldier |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Donald Sutherland wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ideal Napoleonic battle was to manipulate the enemy into an unfavourable position through manoeuvre and deception, force him to commit his main forces and reserve to the main battle and then undertake an enveloping attack with uncommitted or reserve troops on the flank or rear. Such a surprise attack would either produce a devastating effect on morale, or force him to weaken his main battle line. Either way, the enemy's own impulsiveness began the process by which even a smaller French army could defeat the enemy's forces one by one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald M. G. |last=Sutherland |title=The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuwHSN9QTroC&amp;pg=PA356 |year=2008 |publisher=Wiley |page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After 1807, Napoleon's creation of a highly mobile, well-armed artillery force gave artillery usage increased tactical importance. Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, could now use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line. Once that was achieved he sent in infantry and cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bruce |last=McConachy |title=The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered |journal=[[Journal of Military History]] |year=2001 |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=617–640 |jstor=2677528 }} McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
[[File:Battle of zurich.jpg|thumb|French victory over the Austrians and Russians at the [[Second Battle of Zurich|Second Battle of Zürich]]]]
Britain was irritated by several French actions following the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. Bonaparte had annexed [[Piedmont]] and [[Elba]], made himself President of the [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]], a state in northern Italy that France had set up, and failed to evacuate Holland. France continued to interfere with British trade despite peace having been made and complained about Britain harbouring certain individuals and not cracking down on the anti-French press.&lt;ref name=register&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NNU7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA646&amp;dq=annual+register+1803&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IQS8VNa2Lo2TsQS04YDoDg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Annual Register... for the Year 1803] (1805)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220–239}} In fighting, Napoleon focused on penetration, gaining a central position, and surrounding small groups of enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|pages=92|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Napoleon, penetration meant "You engage, and then you wait and see." Central Positioning aimed to divide enemy forces into weaker smaller groups.

[[Malta]] had been captured by Britain during the war and was subject to a complex arrangement in the 10th article of the Treaty of Amiens where it was to be restored to the [[Knights of St. John]] with a Neapolitan garrison and placed under the guarantee of third powers. The weakening of the Knights of St. John by the confiscation of their assets in France and Spain along with delays in obtaining guarantees prevented the British from evacuating it after three months as stipulated in the treaty.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|239–247}}

[[File:Philip James de Loutherbourg - The Battle of Alexandria, 21 March 1801 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|British victory over the French at the [[Battle of Alexandria]], resulted in the end of [[Napoleon]]'s military presence in Egypt.]]
The [[Helvetic Republic]] had been set up by France when it [[French invasion of Switzerland|invaded Switzerland in 1798]]. France had withdrawn its troops, but [[Stecklikrieg|violent strife broke out against the government]], which many Swiss saw as overly centralised. Bonaparte reoccupied the country in October 1802 and [[Act of Mediation|imposed a compromise settlement]]. This caused widespread outrage in Britain, which protested that this was a violation of the Treaty of Lunéville. Although continental powers were unprepared to act, the British decided to send an agent to help the Swiss obtain supplies, and also ordered their military not to return [[Cape Colony]] to Holland as they had committed to do in the Treaty of Amiens.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|248–252}}

Swiss resistance collapsed before anything could be accomplished, and after a month Britain countermanded the orders not to restore Cape Colony. At the same time Russia finally joined the guarantee with regards to Malta. Concerned that there would be hostilities when Bonaparte found out that Cape Colony had been retained, the British began to procrastinate on the evacuation of Malta.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|252–258}} In January 1803 a government paper in France published a report from a commercial agent which noted the ease with which Egypt could be conquered. The British seized on this to demand satisfaction and security before evacuating Malta, which was a convenient stepping stone to Egypt. France disclaimed any desire to seize Egypt and asked what sort of satisfaction was required but the British were unable to give a response.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|258–264}} There was still no thought of going to war; Prime Minister Addington publicly affirmed that Britain was in a state of peace.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|265}}

In early March 1803 the Addington ministry received word that Cape Colony had been re-occupied by the British army in accordance with the orders which had subsequently been countermanded. On 8 March they ordered military preparations to guard against possible French retaliation, and justified them by falsely claiming that it was only in response to French preparations and that they were conducting serious negotiations with France. In a few days it was known that Cape Colony had been surrendered in accordance with the counter-orders, but it was too late. Bonaparte berated the British ambassador in front of 200 spectators over the military preparations.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|264–268}}

The Addington ministry realised they would face an inquiry over their false reasons for the military preparations, and during April unsuccessfully attempted to secure the support of [[William Pitt the Younger]] to shield them from damage.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|277}} In the same month the ministry issued an ultimatum to France demanding the retention of Malta for at least ten years, the permanent acquisition of the island of [[Lampedusa]] from the Kingdom of Sicily, and the evacuation of Holland. They also offered to recognise French gains in Italy if they evacuated Switzerland and compensated the King of Sardinia for his territorial losses. France offered to place Malta in the hands of Russia to satisfy British concerns, pull out of Holland when Malta was evacuated, and form a convention to give satisfaction to Britain on other issues. The British falsely denied that Russia had made an offer and their ambassador left Paris.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|268–278}} Desperate to avoid war, Bonaparte sent a secret offer where he agreed to let Britain retain Malta if France could occupy the Otranto peninsula in Naples.&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, A.T. [https://archive.org/stream/influenceofsea02maha#page/106/mode/1up The influence of sea power on the French Revolution and Empire] Vol. II (1892) pp. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; All efforts were futile and Britain declared war on 18 May 1803.

==War between Britain and France, 1803–1814==
{{Main article|The United Kingdom in the Napoleonic Wars}}

===British motivations===
Britain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it declared war on France in May 1803. The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan argues that Britain was especially alarmed by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. Britons felt insulted when Napoleon said it deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire), and sought to restrict the London newspapers that were vilifying him.&lt;ref name="Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43"/&gt;

[[File:Maniac-Ravings-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|left|"Maniac-raving's-or-Little Boney in a strong fit" by [[James Gillray]]. His caricatures ridiculing Napoleon greatly annoyed the Frenchman, who wanted them suppressed by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014) p 316&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Britain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a "mixture of economic motives and national neuroses – an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions." McLynn concludes that it proved to be the right choice for Britain, because in the long run Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest. Napoleon was not ready for war and so this was the best time for Britain to stop them. Britain seized upon the Malta issue, refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014) p 309&lt;/ref&gt;

The deeper British grievance was their perception that Napoleon was taking personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;John D.  Grainger, ''Amiens Truce: Britain &amp; Bonaparte, 1801-1803'' (2004) has a well-balanced analysis of both sides&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Bryant, ''Years of victory: 1802-1812'' (1944), pp 1-52, although older, is a well-regarded interpretation from the British perspective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801-1805'' (2007) pp 1-50 stresses Napoleon's initiatives.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European politics 1763-1848'' (1994) pp 231-45 is highly analytical and hostile to Napoleon&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars have argued that Napoleon's aggressive posture made him enemies and cost him potential allies.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Tulard, ''Napoleon: The Myth of the Saviour'' (1984) p 351.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1808, the continental powers affirmed most of his gains and titles, but the continuing conflict with Britain led him to start the [[Peninsular War]] and the [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]], which many scholars see as a dramatic miscalculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin S.

[[File:Battle of the Pyrenees, July 28th 1813 - Fonds Ancely - B315556101 A HEATH 035.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of the Pyrenees]], July 1813]]

There was one serious attempt to negotiate peace with France during the war, made by [[Charles James Fox]] in 1806. The British wanted to retain their overseas conquests and have Hanover restored to George III in exchange for accepting French conquests on the continent. The French were willing to cede Malta, Cape Colony, [[Tobago]], and [[French India]]n posts to Britain but wanted to obtain Sicily in exchange for the restoration of Hanover, a condition the British refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9g7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA692|title=The Annual Register, Or, A View of the History, Politics, and Literature for ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike its many coalition partners, Britain remained at war throughout the period of the Napoleonic Wars. Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] to the House of Lords "I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea"), Britain maintained low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The British government paid out large sums of money to other European states, so that they could pay armies in the field against France. These payments are colloquially known as the [[Golden Cavalry of St George]]. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808–1814, assisted by Spanish [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] supported the Spanish, which campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain and allowing Britain to invade southern France. By 1815, the British Army played the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.

Beyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as the [[Seven Years' War]], which historians term a "[[world war]]".

===Economic warfare===
In response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the [[Berlin Decree]] on 21 November 1806, which brought into effect the [[Continental System]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763–1848'' (1994) pp&amp;nbsp;307–10&lt;/ref&gt; This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Britain maintained a standing army of 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, of whom less than half were available for campaigning. The rest were necessary for garrisoning Ireland and the colonies, and providing security for Britain. France's strength peaked at around 2,500,000 full-time and part-time soldiers including several hundred thousand National Guardsmen whom Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Both nations enlisted large numbers of sedentary militia who were unsuited for campaigning, and were mostly employed to release regular forces for active duty.&lt;ref name="Paul Kennedy 1989 pp. 128"&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers – economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128–9&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy disrupted France's extra-continental trade by seizing and threatening French shipping and colonial possessions, but could do nothing about France's trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain. Britain had the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade. This ensured that France could never consolidate its control over Europe in peace. Many in the French government believed that cutting Britain off from the Continent would end its economic influence over Europe and isolate it.

===Financing the war===
A key element in British success was its ability to mobilise the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million against France's 30 million, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for many of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 men in 1813.&lt;ref name="Paul Kennedy 1989 pp. 128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. Sherwig, ''Guineas and Gunpowder British Foreign Aid in the War with France, 1793–1815'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1803, Britain paid a subsidy of £1.5 million for every 100,000 Russian soldiers in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Alexander I'' (1974) p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

British national output remained strong, and the well-organised business sector channeled products into what the military needed. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of [[frigate]]s, adding 50% more large [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], and increasing the number of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France saw its navy shrink by more than half.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783–1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) p 143&lt;/ref&gt; The smuggling of finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to weaken the British economy by cutting off markets. Subsidies to Russia and Austria kept them in the war. The British budget in 1814 reached £66 million, including £10 million for the Royal Navy, £40 million for the army, £10 million for the allies, and £38 million as interest on the national debt, which soared to £679 million, more than double the GDP. This debt was supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and taxpayers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The cost of the war came to £831 million.{{refn|£3 trillion in modern economic cost terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/relativevalue.php?use2=a%3A5%3A{i%3A0%3Bs%3A3%3A%22CPI%22%3Bi%3A1%3Bs%3A6%3A%22DEFIND%22%3Bi%3A2%3Bs%3A4%3A%22WAGE%22%3Bi%3A3%3Bs%3A5%3A%22GDPCP%22%3Bi%3A4%3Bs%3A4%3A%22GDPC%22%3B}&amp;amount=0.831&amp;year_source=1815&amp;year_result=2016&amp;button=Submit|title=Measuring Worth - Purchase Power of the Pound|accessdate=15 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601215026/https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/relativevalue.php?use2=a%3A5%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A3%3A%22CPI%22%3Bi%3A1%3Bs%3A6%3A%22DEFIND%22%3Bi%3A2%3Bs%3A4%3A%22WAGE%22%3Bi%3A3%3Bs%3A5%3A%22GDPCP%22%3Bi%3A4%3Bs%3A4%3A%22GDPC%22%3B%7D&amp;amount=0.831&amp;year_source=1815&amp;year_result=2016&amp;button=Submit|archive-date=1 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} In contrast, the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.&lt;ref&gt;Élie Halévy, ''A History of the English People in 1815'' (1924) vol 2 p&amp;nbsp;205–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Knight, ''Britain Against Napoleon: The Organisation of Victory, 1793–1815''  (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

Before he could invade, he needed to achieve naval superiority—or at least to pull the British fleet away from the [[English Channel]]. A complex plan to distract the British by threatening their possessions in the [[West Indies]] failed when a Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles de Villeneuve|Villeneuve]] turned back after an indecisive action off [[battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Cape Finisterre]] on 22 July 1805. The Royal Navy blockaded Villeneuve in [[Cádiz]] until he left for Naples on 19 October; the British squadron caught and overwhelmingly defeated the combined enemy fleet in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October (the British commander, [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], died in the battle). Napoleon never again had the opportunity to challenge the British at sea, nor to threaten an invasion. He again turned his attention to enemies on the Continent.

[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1805.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|European strategic situation in 1805 before the War of the Third Coalition]]

In April 1805, Britain and Russia signed a treaty with the aim of removing the French from the [[Batavian Republic]] (roughly present-day Netherlands) and the [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Swiss Confederation]]. Austria joined the alliance after the annexation of [[Genoa]] and the proclamation of Napoleon as [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|King of Italy]] on 17 March 1805. Sweden, which had already agreed to lease [[Swedish Pomerania]] as a military base for British troops against France, entered the coalition on 9 August.

The Austrians began the war by invading [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] with an army of about 70,000 under [[Karl Mack von Leiberich]], and the French army marched out from [[Boulogne]] in late July 1805 to confront them. At [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]] (25 September&amp;nbsp;– 20 October) Napoleon surrounded Mack's army, forcing its surrender without significant losses. With the main Austrian army north of the [[Alps]] defeated (another army under [[Archduke Charles of Austria|Archduke Charles]] manoeuvred inconclusively against [[André Masséna]]'s French army in Italy), Napoleon occupied [[Vienna]]. Far from his supply lines, he faced a larger Austro-Russian army under the command of [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], with the Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] personally present. On 2 December, Napoleon crushed the Austro-Russian force in [[Moravia]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (usually considered his greatest victory). He inflicted 25,000 casualties on a numerically superior enemy army while sustaining fewer than 7,000 in his own force.

[[File:Charles Thévenin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|Surrender of the town of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]], 20 October 1805]]

Austria signed the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] (26 December 1805) and left the coalition. The treaty required the Austrians to give up [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] to the French-dominated [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] to Bavaria. With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued. Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play. Napoleon had now consolidated his hold on France, had taken control of Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most of Western Germany and northern Italy. His admirers say that Napoleon wanted to stop now, but was forced to continue in order to gain greater security from the countries that refused to accept his conquests. Esdaille rejects that explanation and instead says that it was a good time to stop expansion, for the major powers were ready to accept Napoleon as he was:
: in 1806 both Russia and Britain had been positively eager to make peace, and they might well have agreed to terms that would have left the Napoleonic imperium almost completely intact. As for Austria and Prussia, they simply wanted to be left alone. To have secured a compromise peace, then, would have been comparatively easy. But...Napoleon was prepared to make no concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Esdaille, ''Napoleon's Wars, pp 252-53&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of the Fourth Coalition 1806–1807==
{{Main article|War of the Fourth Coalition}}
[[File:Charles Meynier - Napoleon in Berlin.png|thumb|''Napoleon in Berlin'' (Meynier). After defeating Prussian forces at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]], the French Army entered Berlin on 27 October 1806.]]

Within months of the collapse of the Third Coalition, the [[Fourth Coalition]] (1806–07) against France was formed by Britain, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden. In July 1806, Napoleon formed the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] out of the many tiny German states which constituted the [[Rhineland]] and most other western parts of Germany. He amalgamated many of the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies, and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother. Napoleon elevated the rulers of the two largest Confederation states, [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], to the status of kings.

In August 1806, the Prussian king, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], decided to go to war independently of any other great power. The army of Russia, a Prussian ally, in particular was too far away to assist. On 8 October 1806, Napoleon unleashed all the French forces east of the Rhine into Prussia. Napoleon defeated a Prussian army at [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] (14 October 1806), and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] defeated another at [[Battle of Auerstädt|Auerstädt]] on the same day. 160,000 French soldiers (increasing in number as the campaign went on) attacked Prussia, moving with such speed that they destroyed the entire Prussian army as an effective military force. Out of 250,000 troops the Prussians sustained 25,000 casualties, lost a further 150,000 as prisoners, 4,000 artillery pieces, and over 100,000 muskets. At Jena, Napoleon had fought only a detachment of the Prussian force. The battle at Auerstädt involved a single French corps defeating the bulk of the Prussian army. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806. He visited the tomb of [[Frederick the Great]] and instructed his marshals to remove their hats there, saying, "If he were alive we wouldn't be here today". Napoleon had taken only 19 days from beginning his attack on Prussia to knock it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies at Jena and Auerstädt. Saxony left Prussia, and together with small states from north Germany, allied with France.

[[File:Friedland mazurovsky.jpg|thumb|left|Charge of the Russian [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] cavalry against French cuirassiers at the [[Battle of Friedland]], 14 June 1807]]

In the next stage of the war, the French drove Russian forces out of Poland and employed many Polish and German soldiers in several sieges in [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]], with the assistance of Dutch and Italian soldiers in the latter case. Napoleon then turned north to confront the remainder of the Russian army and to try to capture the temporary Prussian capital at [[Königsberg]]. A tactical draw at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] (7–8 February 1807), followed by capitulation at [[Siege of Danzig (1807)|Danzig]] (24 May 1807) and the [[Battle of Heilsberg]] (10 June 1807), forced the Russians to withdraw further north. Napoleon decisively beat the Russian army at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (14 June 1807), following which Alexander had to make peace with Napoleon at [[Treaty of Tilsit|Tilsit]] (7 July 1807). In Germany and Poland, new Napoleonic client states, such as the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Republic of Danzig]], were established.

By September, [[Guillaume Brune|Marshal Guillaume Brune]] completed the occupation of [[Swedish Pomerania]], allowing the Swedish army to withdraw with all its munitions of war.

Britain's first response to Napoleon's Continental System was to launch a major naval attack against Denmark. Although ostensibly neutral, Denmark was under heavy French and Russian pressure to pledge its fleet to Napoleon. London could not take the chance of ignoring the Danish threat. In August 1807, the Royal Navy [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|besieged and bombarded Copenhagen]], leading to the 
capture of the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Dano-Norwegian fleet]], and assuring use of the sea lanes in the North and Baltic seas for the British merchant fleet. Denmark joined the war on the side of France, but without a fleet it had little to offer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=A.

Denmark also committed themselves to participate in a war against Sweden together with France and Russia.

At Tilsit, Napoleon and Alexander had agreed that Russia should force Sweden to join the Continental System, which led to a [[Finnish War|Russian invasion of Finland]] in February 1808, followed by a [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808-09|Danish declaration of war]] in March. Napoleon also sent an auxiliary corps, consisting of troops from France, [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]], led by Marshal [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], to Denmark to participate in the invasion of Sweden. But British naval superiority prevented the armies from crossing the [[Øresund]] strait, and the war came mainly to be fought along the Swedish-Norwegian border. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] (September–October 1808), France and Russia further agreed on the division of Sweden into two parts separated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], where the eastern part became the Russian [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. British voluntary attempts to assist Sweden with humanitarian aid remained limited and did not prevent Sweden from adopting a more Napoleon-friendly policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Götz|first=Norbert|date=2014-06-06|title=The Good Plumpuddings' Belief: British Voluntary Aid to Sweden During the Napoleonic Wars|journal=The International History Review|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=519–539|doi=10.1080/07075332.2014.918559|issn=0707-5332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war between Denmark and Britain effectively ended with a British victory at the [[battle of Lyngør]] in 1812, involving the destruction of the last large Dano-Norwegian ship—the [[frigate]] ''[[HDMS Najaden (1811)|Najaden]]''.

===Poland===
{{main article|Duchy of Warsaw}}
[[File:January Suchodolski, Bitwa pod Somosierrą.jpg|thumb|[[Polish cavalry]] at the [[Battle of Somosierra]] in Spain, 1808]]

In 1807 Napoleon created a powerful outpost of his empire in Central Europe. [[History of Poland|Poland]] had recently been partitioned by its three large neighbours, but Napoleon created the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, which depended on France from the very beginning. The duchy consisted of lands seized by Austria and Prussia; its Grand Duke was Napoleon's ally the king of Saxony, but Napoleon appointed the intendants who ran the country. The population of 4.3 million was released from occupation and by 1814 sent about 200,000 men to Napoleon's armies. That included about 90,000 who marched with him to Moscow; few marched back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Pivka|title=Napoleon's Polish Troops|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETYsTuIaKkQC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians strongly opposed any move towards an independent Poland and one reason Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 was to punish them. The Grand Duchy was dissolved in 1815 and Poland did not become a state until 1918. Napoleon's impact on Poland was huge, including the Napoleonic legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.&lt;ref&gt;J. P.

==War of the Fifth Coalition 1809==
{{Main article|War of the Fifth Coalition|Peninsular War}}
[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 décembre 1808.jpg|thumb|''Surrender of Madrid'' (Gros), 1808. Napoleon enters Spain's capital during the Peninsular War.]]

The Fifth Coalition (1809) of Britain and Austria against France formed as Britain engaged in the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain and Portugal. The sea became a major [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] against Napoleon's allies. During the time of the Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French colonies. On land the major battles included [[Battle of Raszyn]], [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]], and [[Battle of Wagram]].

On land, the Fifth Coalition attempted few extensive military endeavours. One, the [[Walcheren Expedition]] of 1809, involved a dual effort by the British Army and the Royal Navy to relieve Austrian forces under intense French pressure. It ended in disaster after the Army commander, [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham]], failed to capture the objective, the naval base of French-controlled [[Antwerp]]. For the most part of the years of the Fifth Coalition, British military operations on land (apart from the Iberian Peninsula) remained restricted to hit-and-run operations executed by the Royal Navy, which dominated the sea after having beaten down almost all substantial naval opposition from France and its allies and blockading what remained of France's naval forces in heavily fortified French-controlled ports. These rapid-attack operations were aimed mostly at destroying blockaded French naval and mercantile shipping and the disruption of French supplies, communications, and military units stationed near the coasts. Often, when British allies attempted military actions within several dozen miles or so of the sea, the Royal Navy would arrive, land troops and supplies, and aid the coalition's land forces in a concerted operation. Royal Navy ships even provided artillery support against French units when fighting strayed near enough to the coastline. The ability and quality of the land forces governed these operations. For example, when operating with inexperienced guerrilla forces in Spain, the Royal Navy sometimes failed to achieve its objectives because of the lack of manpower that the Navy's guerrilla allies had promised to supply.
[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1809.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The European strategic situation in February 1809]]

Economic warfare continued: the French [[Continental System]] against the British naval blockade of French-controlled territory. Due to military shortages and lack of organisation in French territory, many breaches of the Continental System occurred as French-dominated states tolerated or even encouraged trade with British smugglers. In terms of economic damage to Great Britain, the blockade was largely ineffective. As Napoleon realised that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries. He tied down his forces in Spain, and lost very badly in Russia in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Thompson, ''Napoleon Bonaparte: His rise and fall '' (1951) pp 235-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sides entered further conflicts in attempts to enforce their blockade; the British fought the United States in the [[War of 1812]] (1812–15), and the French engaged in the [[Peninsular War]] (1808–14) to prevent smuggling into Spain. The Iberian conflict began when Portugal continued trade with Britain despite French restrictions. When Spain failed to maintain the Continental System, the uneasy Spanish alliance with France ended in all but name. French troops gradually encroached on Spanish territory until they occupied [[Madrid]], and installed a client monarchy. This provoked an explosion of [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|popular rebellions]] across Spain. Heavy British involvement soon followed.
[[File:El dos de mayo de 1808 en Madrid.jpg|thumb|width=300|[[The Second of May 1808|The Second of May 1808: The Charge of the Mamelukes]]'', by [[Francisco de Goya]] (1814)]]

Austria, previously an ally of France, took the opportunity to attempt to restore its imperial territories in Germany as held prior to Austerlitz. Austria achieved some initial victories against the thinly spread army of Marshal [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]]. Napoleon had left Berthier with only 170,000 men to defend France's entire eastern frontier (in the 1790s, 800,000 men had carried out the same task, but holding a much shorter front).

After defeats in Spain suffered by France, Napoleon took charge and enjoyed success, retaking Madrid, defeating the Spanish and forcing a withdrawal of the heavily out-numbered British army from the Iberian Peninsula ([[Battle of Corunna]], 16 January 1809). But when he left, the [[guerrilla war]] against his forces in the countryside continued to tie down great numbers of troops. Austria's attack prevented Napoleon from successfully wrapping up operations against British forces by necessitating his departure for Austria, and he never returned to the Peninsular theatre. The British then sent in a fresh army under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington)]] whom the French could not stop.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars (3): The Peninsular War 1807-1814'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peninsular war proved a major disaster for France. Napoleon did well when he was in direct charge, but severe losses followed his departure, as he severely underestimated how much manpower would be needed. The effort in Spain was a drain on money, manpower and prestige. Historian David Gates called it the "Spanish ulcer."&lt;ref&gt;David Gates, ''The Spanish Ulcer: A History of the Peninsular War'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; France lost the Peninsular War, and Napoleon realised it had been a disaster for his cause, writing later, "That unfortunate war destroyed me ... All the circumstances of my disasters are bound up in that fatal knot."&lt;ref&gt;John Lawrence Tone, "Partisan Warfare in Spain and Total War," in {{cite book|author=Roger Chickering and Stig Förster, eds.|title=War in an Age of Revolution, 1775–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2WtMq4LF90C&amp;pg=PA243|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peninsular War|Peninsular campaigns]] witnessed 60 major battles and 30 major sieges, more than any other of the Napoleonic conflicts, and lasted over six years, far longer than any of the others. France and her allies lost at least 91,000 killed in action and 237,000 wounded in the peninsula.&lt;ref name=clodfelter&gt;{{cite book|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492-2015|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europe 1812 map en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The French Empire in Europe in 1812, near its peak extent]]

In the east, the Austrians drove into the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] but suffered defeat at the [[Battle of Raszyn]] on 19 April 1809. The Polish army captured [[West Galicia]] following its earlier success. Napoleon assumed personal command and bolstered the army for a counter-attack on Austria. After a few small battles, the well-run campaign forced the Austrians to withdraw from Bavaria, and Napoleon advanced into Austria. His hurried attempt to cross the [[Danube]] resulted in the major [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (22 May 1809) — Napoleon's first significant tactical defeat. But the Austrian commander, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], failed to follow up on his indecisive victory, allowing Napoleon to prepare and seize Vienna in early July. He defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], on 5–6 July. (It was during the middle of that battle that [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Marshal Bernadotte]] was stripped of his command after retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders. Shortly thereafter, Bernadotte took up the offer from Sweden to fill the vacant position of Crown Prince there. Later he actively participated in wars against his former Emperor.)

The War of the Fifth Coalition ended with the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] (14 October 1809). In the east, only the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]ese rebels led by [[Andreas Hofer]] continued to fight the French-Bavarian army until finally defeated in November 1809. In the west the Peninsular War continued. The British and Portuguese remained restricted to the area around Lisbon (behind their impregnable [[lines of Torres Vedras]]) but [[Siege of Cádiz|besieged Cadiz]].

In 1810, the French Empire reached its greatest extent. Napoleon married [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]], an Austrian Archduchess, with the aim of ensuring a more stable alliance with Austria and of providing the Emperor with an heir (something his first wife, Josephine, had failed to do). As well as the French Empire, Napoleon controlled the Swiss Confederation, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Italy. Territories allied with the French included:
* the [[Denmark-Norway|Kingdom of Denmark]] 
* the [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Spain]] (under [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's elder brother)
* the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] ([[Jérôme Bonaparte]], Napoleon's younger brother)
* the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples|Kingdom of Naples]] (under [[Joachim Murat]], husband of Napoleon's sister [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline]])
* the [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino]] (under [[Elisa Bonaparte]] (Napoleon's sister) and her husband [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice Baciocchi]]);
and Napoleon's former enemies, Sweden, Prussia and Austria.

==Subsidiary wars==
The Napoleonic Wars were the direct cause of wars in the Americas and elsewhere.

===War of 1812===
{{Main article|War of 1812}}
The [[War of 1812]] coincided with the War of the Sixth Coalition. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, while Europeans often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. The United States declared war on Britain because of British interference with American merchant ships and [[Impressment#Conflict with the United States|forced enlistment]] into the British Royal Navy. France had interfered as well, and the US considered declaring war on France. The war ended in a military stalemate, and there were no boundary changes at the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in early 1815 when Napoleon was on Elba.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Latin American Revolutions===
{{main article|Spanish American wars of independence|War of Independence of Brazil|Haitian Revolution}}

The abdication of kings [[Charles IV of Spain|Carlos IV]] and [[Ferdinand VII|Fernando VII]] of Spain and the installation of Napoleon's brother as [[Joseph Bonaparte|King José]] provoked civil wars and revolutions leading to the independence of most of Spain's mainland American colonies. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII, whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]],  ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800-1850''. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1992, pp. 402–403.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Portuguese [[House of Braganza|royal family]] escaped to [[Brazil]] and established the court there, resulting in political stability for Portuguese America. With the defeat of Napoleon and the return of the Braganza monarchy to Portugal, the heir remained in Brazil and declared Brazilian independence, achieving it peacefully with the territory intact.

The [[Haitian Revolution]] began in 1791, just before the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and continued until 1804. France's defeat resulted in the independence of [[Saint-Domingue]] and led Napoleon to sell the territory making up the [[Louisiana Purchase]] to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Battle of Borodino 1812.png|thumb|The [[Battle of Borodino]] as depicted by [[Louis-François, Baron Lejeune|Louis Lejeune]]. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars.]]

The [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 resulted in the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807–1812)|Anglo-Russian War]] (1807–12). Emperor Alexander I declared war on Britain after the British attack on Denmark in September 1807. British men-of-war supported the Swedish fleet during the [[Finnish War]] and won victories over the Russians in the [[Gulf of Finland]] in July 1808 and August 1809. The success of the Russian army on land, however, forced Sweden to sign peace treaties with Russia in 1809 and with France in 1810, and to join the blockade against Britain. But Franco-Russian relations became progressively worse after 1810, and the Russian war with Britain effectively ended. In April 1812, Britain, Russia and Sweden signed secret agreements directed against Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Alexander I: Tsar of War and Peace'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The central issue for both Napoleon and Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] was control over Poland. Each wanted a semi-independent Poland he could control. As Esdaile notes, "Implicit in the idea of a Russian Poland was, of course, a war against Napoleon."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Esdaile, ''Napoleon's Wars: An International History, 1803–1815'' (2007) p 438&lt;/ref&gt; Schroeder says Poland was "the root cause" of Napoleon's war with Russia but Russia's refusal to support the Continental System was also a factor.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics: 1763 – 1848'' (1994) p 419&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, at the height of his power, Napoleon invaded Russia with a pan-European [[La Grande Armée|''Grande Armée'']], consisting of 650,000 men (270,000 Frenchmen and many soldiers of allies or subject areas). The French forces crossed the [[Niemen River]] on 24 June 1812. Russia proclaimed a [[Patriotic War of 1812|Patriotic War]], and Napoleon proclaimed a Second Polish war. The Poles supplied almost 100,000 men for the invasion force, but against their expectations, Napoleon avoided any concessions to Poland, having in mind further negotiations with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Richard =K. |last=Riehn |title=1812: Napoleon's Russian campaign |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Grande Armée'' marched through Russia, winning some relatively minor engagements and the major [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Battle of Smolensk]] on 16–18 August. In the same days, part of the French Army led by [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Oudinot]] was stopped in the [[First Battle of Polotsk|Battle of Polotsk]] by the right wing of the Russian Army, under command of General [[Peter Wittgenstein]]. This prevented the French march on the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]]; the fate of the invasion was decided in Moscow, where Napoleon led his forces in person.

[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Napoleon]]'s withdrawal from Russia'', a painting by [[Adolph Northen]]]]

Russia used [[scorched-earth]] tactics, and harried the ''Grande Armée'' with light [[Cossack]] cavalry. The ''Grande Armée'' did not adjust its operational methods in response.&lt;ref&gt;Riehn 1990, pp. 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to most of the losses of the main column of the ''Grande Armée'', which in one case amounted to 95,000 men, including deserters, in a week.&lt;ref&gt;Reihn 1990, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main Russian army retreated for almost three months. This constant retreat led to the unpopularity of [[Field Marshal]] [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly]] and a veteran, Prince [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], was made the new Commander-in-Chief by [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. Finally, the two armies engaged in the [[Battle of Borodino]] on 7 September,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Haythornthwaite, ''Borodino 1812; Napoleon's great gamble'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; in the vicinity of Moscow. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 men and resulting in at least 70,000 casualties. It was indecisive; the French captured the main positions on the battlefield, but failed to destroy the Russian army. Logistical difficulties meant that French casualties could not be replaced, unlike Russian ones.

Napoleon entered Moscow on 14 September, after the Russian Army had retreated yet again.&lt;ref&gt;Reihn, ''1812,''  pp. 253–254&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the Russians had largely evacuated the city and released criminals from the prisons to inconvenience the French; the governor, Count [[Fyodor Rostopchin]], ordered the city [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|to be burnt]].&lt;ref&gt;''With Napoleon in Russia, The Memoirs of General Coulaincourt,'' Chapter VI 'The Fire' pp. 109–107 Pub. William Morrow and Co 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander I refused to capitulate, and the peace talks attempted by Napoleon failed. In October, with no sign of clear victory in sight, Napoleon began the disastrous Great Retreat from Moscow.

[[File:Minard's Map (vectorized).svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s graph of the decreasing size of the Grande Armée represented by the width of the line as it marches to Moscow (tan) and back (black)]]

At the [[Battle of Maloyaroslavets]] the French tried to reach [[Kaluga]], where they could find food and forage supplies. The replenished Russian Army blocked the road, and Napoleon was forced to retreat the same way he had come to Moscow, through the heavily ravaged areas along the [[Smolensk]] road. In the following weeks, the ''Grande Armée'' was dealt a catastrophic blow by the onset of the [[Russian Winter]], the lack of supplies and constant [[guerrilla warfare]] by Russian peasants and irregular troops.

When the remnants of the Napoleon's army [[Battle of Berezina|crossed the Berezina River]] in November, only 27,000 fit soldiers survived, with 380,000 men dead or missing and 100,000 captured.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wordsworth Pocket Encyclopedia,'' page 17, Hertfordshire 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon then left his men and returned to Paris to prepare the defence against the advancing Russians. The campaign effectively ended on 14 December 1812, when the last enemy troops left Russia. The Russians had lost around 210,000 men, but with their shorter supply lines, they soon replenished their armies.

==War of the Sixth Coalition 1812–1814==
{{Main article|Sixth Coalition}}

Seeing an opportunity in Napoleon's historic defeat, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, and several German states re-entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon in Power'' (2013), pp 431-74&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon vowed that he would create a new army as large as the one he had sent into Russia, and quickly built up his forces in the east from 30,000 to 130,000 and eventually to 400,000. Napoleon inflicted 40,000 casualties on the Allies at [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Lützen]] (2 May 1813) and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]] (20–21 May 1813). Both battles involved forces of over 250,000, making them some of the largest conflicts of the wars so far. Metternich in November 1813 offered Napoleon the [[Frankfurt proposals]]. They would allow Napoleon to remain Emperor but France would be reduced to its "natural frontiers" and lose control of most of Italy and Germany and the Netherlands. Napoleon still expected to win the wars, and rejected the terms. By 1814, as the Allies were closing in on Paris, Napoleon did agree to the Frankfurt proposals, but it was too late and he rejected the new harsher terms proposed by the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J.

[[File:MoshkovVI SrazhLeypcigomGRM.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Leipzig]] involved over 600,000 soldiers, making it the largest battle in Europe prior to World War I.]]
In the [[Peninsular War]], [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], renewed the [[Anglo-Portuguese Army|Anglo-Portuguese]] advance into Spain just after New Year in 1812, besieging and capturing the fortified towns of [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Badajoz]], and in the [[Battle of Salamanca]] (which was a damaging defeat of the French). As the French regrouped, the Anglo–Portuguese entered Madrid and advanced towards Burgos, before retreating all the way to Portugal when renewed French concentrations threatened to trap them. As a consequence of the Salamanca campaign, the French were forced to end their long siege of Cadiz and to permanently evacuate the provinces of [[Andalusia]] and [[Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Young and James Philip Lawford, ''Wellington's masterpiece: the battle and campaign of Salamanca'' (outledge, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a strategic move, Wellesley planned to move his supply base from Lisbon to [[Santander, Spain|Santander]]. The Anglo–Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos. On 21 June, at [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]], the combined Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish armies won against [[Joseph Bonaparte]], finally breaking French power in Spain. The French had to retreat out of the Iberian peninsula, over the [[Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Glover, ''Wellington's Peninsular Victories: Busaco, Salamanca, Vitoria, Nivelle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

The belligerents declared an armistice from 4 June 1813 (continuing until 13 August) during which time both sides attempted to recover from the loss of approximately a quarter of a million men in the preceding two months. During this time coalition negotiations finally brought Austria out in open opposition to France. Two principal Austrian armies took the field, adding 300,000 men to the coalition armies in Germany. The Allies now had around 800,000 front-line soldiers in the German theatre, with a strategic reserve of 350,000 formed to support the front-line operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. P. Riley|title=Napoleon and the World War of 1813: Lessons in Coalition Warfighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beq3AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:General Nansouty at the battle of Hanau.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Hanau]] (30–31 October 1813), took part between Austro-Bavarian and French forces.]]
Napoleon succeeded in bringing the imperial forces in the region to around 650,000—although only 250,000 came under his direct command, with another 120,000 under [[Nicolas Charles Oudinot]] and 30,000 under Davout. The remainder of imperial forces came mostly from the Confederation of the Rhine, especially Saxony and Bavaria. In addition, to the south, Murat's Kingdom of Naples and [[Eugène de Beauharnais]]'s Kingdom of Italy had 100,000 armed men. In Spain, another 150,000 to 200,000 French troops steadily retreated before Anglo–Portuguese forces numbering around 100,000. Thus around 900,000 Frenchmen in all theatres faced around 1,800,000 coalition soldiers (including the strategic reserve under formation in Germany). The gross figures may mislead slightly, as most of the German troops fighting on the side of the French fought at best unreliably and stood on the verge of defecting to the Allies. One can reasonably say that Napoleon could count on no more than 450,000 men in Germany—which left him outnumbered about four to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. P. Riley|title=Napoleon and the World War of 1813: Lessons in Coalition Warfighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beq3AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the armistice, Napoleon seemed to have regained the initiative at [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]] (August 1813), where he once again defeated a numerically superior coalition army and inflicted enormous casualties, while sustaining relatively few. The failures of his marshals and a slow resumption of the offensive on his part cost him any advantage that this victory might have secured. At the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in Saxony (16–19 October 1813), also called the "Battle of the Nations", 191,000 French fought more than 300,000 Allies, and the defeated French had to retreat into France. After the French withdrawal from Germany, Napoleon's remaining ally, [[Denmark-Norway]], became isolated and [[Treaty of Kiel|fell to the coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hofschroer, ''Leipzig 1813: The Battle of the Nations'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russparis.jpg|thumb|''The Russian army enters Paris in 1814'']]
Napoleon then fought a series of battles in France, including the [[Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube]], but the overwhelming numbers of the Allies steadily forced him back. The Allies [[Battle of Paris (1814)|entered Paris]] on 30 March 1814. During this time Napoleon fought his [[Six Days' Campaign]], in which he won multiple battles against the enemy forces advancing towards Paris. During this entire campaign he never managed to field more than 70,000 men against more than half a million coalition soldiers. At the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] (9 March 1814), the Allies agreed to preserve the coalition until Napoleon's total defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon In Power'' (2013) pp 464-98&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon determined to fight on, even now, incapable of fathoming his fall from power. During the campaign he had issued a decree for 900,000 fresh conscripts, but only a fraction of these materialised, and Napoleon's schemes for victory eventually gave way to the reality of his hopeless situation. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Occasional military actions continued in Italy, Spain, and Holland in early 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon In Power'' (2013) pp 464-98&lt;/ref&gt;

The victors exiled Napoleon to the island of [[Elba]], and restored the French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the person of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. They signed the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (11 April 1814) and initiated the [[Congress of Vienna]] to redraw the map of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon In Power'' (2013) pp 464-98&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of the Seventh Coalition 1815==&lt;!-- [[Battle of Waterloo]] links to this section --&gt;
:''See also: [[Hundred Days]] and the [[Neapolitan War]] between the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Austrian Empire]]''
[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|left|''Wellington at Waterloo'' by [[Robert Alexander Hillingford]]]]

The [[Seventh Coalition]] (1815) pitted Britain, Russia, Prussia, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and several German states against France. The period known as the [[Hundred Days]] began after Napoleon escaped from Elba and landed at [[Cannes]] (1 March 1815). Travelling to Paris, picking up support as he went, he eventually overthrew the restored [[Louis XVIII]]. The Allies rapidly gathered their armies to meet him again. Napoleon raised 280,000 men, whom he distributed among several armies. To add to the 90,000-strong standing army, he recalled well over a quarter of a million veterans from past campaigns and issued a decree for the eventual draft of around 2.5&amp;nbsp;million new men into the French army, which was never achieved. This faced an initial coalition force of about 700,000—although coalition campaign plans provided for one million front-line soldiers, supported by around 200,000 garrison, logistics and other auxiliary personnel.

Napoleon took about 124,000 men of the Army of the North on a pre-emptive strike against the Allies in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hofschroer, ''The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to attack the coalition armies before they combined, in hope of driving the British into the sea and the Prussians out of the war. His march to the frontier achieved the surprise he had planned, catching the Anglo-Dutch Army in a dispersed arrangement. The Prussians had been more wary, concentrating {{fraction|3|4}} of their army in and around Ligny. The Prussians forced the [[Armée du Nord]] to fight all the day of the 15th to reach Ligny in a delaying action by the Prussian 1st Corps. He forced Prussia to fight at [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]] on 16 June 1815, and the defeated Prussians retreated in disorder. On the same day, the left wing of the Armée du Nord, under the command of Marshal [[Michel Ney]], succeeded in stopping any of Wellington's forces going to aid Blücher's Prussians by fighting a blocking action at [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]]. Ney failed to clear the cross-roads and Wellington reinforced the position. But with the Prussian retreat, Wellington too had to retreat. He fell back to a previously reconnoitred position on an [[escarpment]] at Mont St Jean, a few miles south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]].

[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]

Napoleon took the reserve of the Army of the North, and reunited his forces with those of Ney to pursue Wellington's army, after he ordered Marshal [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]] to take the right wing of the Army of the North and stop the Prussians re-grouping. In the first of a series of miscalculations, both Grouchy and Napoleon failed to realise that the Prussian forces were already reorganised and were assembling at the village of Wavre. The French army did nothing to stop a rather leisurely retreat that took place throughout the night and into the early morning by the Prussians. As the 4th, 1st, and 2nd Prussian Corps marched through the town towards Waterloo the 3rd Prussian Corps took up blocking positions across the river, and although Grouchy engaged and defeated the Prussian rearguard under the command of Lt-Gen [[Johann von Thielmann|von Thielmann]] in the [[Battle of Wavre]] (18–19 June) it was 12 hours too late. In the end, 17,000 Prussians had kept 33,000 badly needed French reinforcements off the field.

Napoleon delayed the start of fighting at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on the morning of 18 June for several hours while he waited for the ground to dry after the previous night's rain. By late afternoon, the French army had not succeeded in driving Wellington's forces from the escarpment on which they stood. When the Prussians arrived and attacked the French right flank in ever-increasing numbers, Napoleon's strategy of keeping the coalition armies divided had failed and a combined coalition general advance drove his army from the field in confusion.

Grouchy organised a successful and well-ordered retreat towards Paris, where Marshal Davout had 117,000 men ready to turn back the 116,000 men of Blücher and Wellington. Davout was defeated at the [[Battle of Issy]] and negotiations for surrender had begun.

[[File:Charge of the French Cuirassiers at Waterloo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The charge of the French [[Cuirassier]]s at the Battle of Waterloo against a square of [[Scottish regiment|Scottish Highlanders]]]]

On arriving at Paris three days after Waterloo, Napoleon still clung to the hope of a concerted national resistance; but the temper of the [[Parliament of France|legislative chamber]]s, and of the public generally, did not favour his view. Lacking support Napoleon abdicated again on 22 June 1815, and on 15 July he surrendered to the British squadron at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. The Allies exiled him to the remote South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], where he died on 5 May 1821.

In Italy, [[Joachim Murat]], whom the Allies had allowed to remain King of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] after Napoleon's initial defeat, once again allied with his brother-in-law, triggering the [[Neapolitan War]] (March to May 1815). Hoping to find support among Italian nationalists fearing the increasing influence of the Habsburgs in Italy, Murat issued the [[Rimini Proclamation]] inciting them to war. The proclamation failed and the Austrians soon crushed Murat at the [[Battle of Tolentino]] (2 May to 3 May 1815), forcing him to flee. The [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] returned to the throne of Naples on 20 May 1815. Murat tried to regain his throne, but after that failed, he was executed by firing squad on 13 October 1815.

==Political effects==
The Napoleonic Wars brought radical changes to Europe, but the reactionary forces returned to power and tried to reverse some of them&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Godechot, et al. ''The Napoleonic era in Europe'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Bourbon Restoration|restoring the Bourbon house]] on the French throne. Napoleon had succeeded in bringing most of Western Europe under one rule. In most European countries, subjugation in the French Empire brought with it many liberal features of the French Revolution including democracy, [[due process]] in courts, abolition of serfdom, reduction of the power of the Catholic Church, and a demand for constitutional limits on monarchs. The increasing voice of the middle classes with rising commerce and industry meant that restored European monarchs found it difficult to restore pre-revolutionary [[absolute monarch|absolutism]] and had to retain many of the reforms enacted during Napoleon's rule. Institutional legacies remain to this day in the form of [[Civil Law (legal system)|civil law]], with clearly defined [[code of law|codes of law]]—an enduring legacy of the [[Napoleonic Code]].
 
[[File:Europe 1815 map en.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The national boundaries within Europe are set by the Congress of Vienna, 1815]]

France's constant warfare with the combined forces of the other major powers of Europe for over two decades finally took its toll. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, France no longer held the role of the dominant [[historical powers|power]] in Continental Europe, as it had since the times of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], as the [[Congress of Vienna]] produced a "[[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]" by resizing the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace. In this regard, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was restored in its former borders, and also received large chunks of [[Grand Duchy of Warsaw|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]. Greatly enlarged, Prussia became a permanent [[Great Power]]. In order to drag Prussia's attention towards the west and France, the Congress also gave the [[Prussian Rhineland|Rhineland]] and [[Prussian Westphalia|Westphalia]] to Prussia. These industrial regions transformed agrarian Prussia into an industrial leader in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEDKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=napoleonic+wars+rise+of+prussia&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMI04rzlPTNxwIVCrUUCh2IsA9Y#v=onepage&amp;q=napoleonic%20wars%20rise%20of%20prussia&amp;f=false|title=The Rise of Prussia 1700-1830|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain emerged as the most important economic power, and its [[Royal Navy]] held unquestioned naval superiority across the globe well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511494/The-Royal-Navy|title=The Royal Navy|work=Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Napoleonic period, nationalism, a relatively new movement, became increasingly significant. This shaped much of the course of future European history. Its growth spelled the beginning of some states and the end of others, as the map of Europe changed dramatically in the hundred years following the [[Napoleonic Era]]. Rule by fiefdoms and aristocracy was widely replaced by national ideologies based on shared origins and culture. Bonaparte's reign over Europe sowed the seeds for the founding of the nation-states of [[Unification of Germany|Germany]] and [[Italian unification|Italy]] by starting the process of consolidating city-states, kingdoms and principalities. At the end of the war Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden, but because Norway had signed its own constitution on 17 May 1814, Sweden was forced to fight for the right to own Norway. The resulting union between Sweden and Norway gave Norway more independence than under Denmark and ended with Norway becoming an independent country in 1905. The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] created as a [[buffer state]] against France dissolved rapidly with the independence of Belgium in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqyJ5mYmxSUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=The+united+kingdom+of+the+netherlands+buffer+state&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIrIX1oYnOxwIVjGkUCh3PcAGP#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20united%20kingdom%20of%20the%20netherlands%20buffer%20state&amp;f=false|title=Les Transformations des Universités du Xiiie Au Xxie Siècle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Napoleonic wars also played a key role in the independence of the Latin American colonies from Spain and Portugal. The conflict weakened the authority and military power of Spain, especially after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. There were many uprisings in Spanish America, leading to the [[Spanish American wars of independence|wars of independence]]. In [[Portuguese America]], Brazil experienced greater autonomy as it now [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|served as seat of the Portuguese Empire]] and ascended politically to the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|status of Kingdom]]. These events also contributed to the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Portuguese Liberal Revolution]] in 1820 and the [[Independence of Brazil]] in 1822.&lt;ref name="Keith Haynes 2012"/&gt;

The century of relative transatlantic peace, after the Congress of Vienna, enabled the “greatest intercontinental migration in human history”&lt;ref&gt;Drew Keeling, “The Transportation Revolution and Transatlantic Migration," ''Research in Economic History'' 19 (1999), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with "a big spurt of immigration after the release of the dam erected by the Napoleonic Wars."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin D. Scott, ''The Peopling of America: Perspectives of Immigration'' (1984), p. 24. Marcus Hansen, ''The Atlantic Migration'' (1940), pp. 79-106, termed this a "new beginning" for American immigration. For further background context, see {{cite web|title=North Atlantic, 1815-19|url=http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-processes/other-time-periods/north-atlantic-1815-19/|publisher=Migration as a travel business|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration inflows relative to the US population rose to record levels (peaking at 1.6% in 1850-51)&lt;ref&gt;Drew Keeling, “Transport Capacity Management and Transatlantic Migration, 1900-1914." ''Research in Economic History'' 25 (2008), pp. 267-68.&lt;/ref&gt; as 30 million Europeans relocated to the United States between 1815 and 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Maldwyn Jones, ''American Immigration'' (1992, 2nd ed.)‚ p. 79. Jones referred to this unprecedented migration as “one of the wonders of the age” (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concept emerged from the Congress of Vienna – that of a unified Europe. After his defeat, Napoleon deplored the fact that his dream of a free and peaceful "European association" remained unaccomplished. Such a European association would share the same principles of government, system of measurement, currency and [[Civil Code]]. One-and-a-half centuries later, and after two world wars several of these ideals re-emerged in the form of the [[European Union]].

==Military legacy==

===Enlarged scope===
[[File:Lejeune - Bataille de Marengo.jpg|thumb|In 1800 Bonaparte took the French Army across the Alps, eventually defeating the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]].]]

Until the time of Napoleon, European states employed relatively small armies, made up of both national soldiers and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. These regulars were highly drilled professional soldiers. [[Ancien Régime]] armies could only deploy small field armies due to rudimentary staffs and comprehensive yet cumbersome logistics. Both issues combined to limit field forces to approximately 30,000 men under a single commander.

Military innovators in the mid-18th century began to recognise the potential of an entire nation at war: a "nation in arms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html|title=Napoleon's Total War|publisher=HistoryNet.com|accessdate=18 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401054136/http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html|archivedate=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale of warfare dramatically enlarged during the Revolutionary and subsequent Napoleonic Wars. During Europe's major pre-revolutionary war, the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756–1763, few armies ever numbered more than 200,000 with field forces often numbering less than 30,000. The French innovations of separate corps (allowing a single commander to efficiently command more than the traditional command span of 30,000 men) and living off the land (which allowed field armies to deploy more men without requiring an equal increase in supply arrangements such as depots and supply trains) allowed the French republic to field much larger armies than their opponents. Napoleon ensured during the time of the French republic that separate French field armies operated as a single army under his control, often allowing him to substantially outnumber his opponents. This forced his continental opponents to increase the size of their armies as well, moving away from the traditional small, well drilled Ancien Régime armies of the 18th century to mass conscript armies.

[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Napoleon on the field of [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]]]]

The Battle of Marengo, which largely ended the War of the Second Coalition, was fought with fewer than 60,000 men on both sides. The Battle of Austerlitz which ended the War of the Third Coalition involved fewer than 160,000 men. The Battle of Friedland which led to peace with Russia in 1807 involved about 150,000 men.

After these defeats, the continental powers developed various forms of mass conscription to allow them to face France on even terms, and the size of field armies increased rapidly. The battle of Wagram of 1809 involved 300,000 men, and 500,000 fought at Leipzig in 1813, of whom 150,000 were killed or wounded.

About a million French soldiers became casualties (wounded, invalided or killed), a higher proportion than in the First World War. The European total may have reached 5,000,000 military deaths, including disease.&lt;ref&gt;David A.Bell, ''The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It'' (2007) p 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1987) pp&amp;nbsp;99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

France had the second-largest population in Europe by the end of the 18th century (27&amp;nbsp;million, as compared to Britain's 12 million and Russia's 35 to 40&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;Colin McEvedy and Richard M. Jones, ''Atlas of World Population History'' (1978) pp&amp;nbsp;41–222&lt;/ref&gt; It was well poised to take advantage of the ''[[levée en masse]]''. Before Napoleon's efforts, [[Lazare Carnot]] played a large part in the reorganisation of the French army from 1793 to 1794—a time which saw previous French misfortunes reversed, with Republican armies advancing on all fronts.

The French army peaked in size in the 1790s with 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Frenchmen enlisted although battlefield strength was much less. Haphazard bookkeeping, rudimentary medical support and lax recruitment standards ensured that many soldiers either never existed, fell ill or were unable to withstand the physical demands of soldiering.

About 2.8&amp;nbsp;million Frenchmen fought on land and about 150,000 at sea, bringing the total for France to almost 3 million combatants during almost 25 years of warfare.&lt;ref name="John France 2011 351"&gt;{{cite book|author=John France|title=Perilous Glory: The Rise of Western Military Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8-CHCRbISkC&amp;pg=PT351|year=2011|publisher=Yale UP|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trafalgar Crepin mg 0578.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Trafalgar]]]]
Britain had 750,000 men under arms between 1792 and 1815 as its army expanded from 40,000 men in 1793&lt;ref name="Chappell8"&gt;Chappell, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; to a peak of 250,000 men in 1813.&lt;ref name="Oxford132"&gt;Chandler &amp; Beckett, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Over 250,000 sailors served in the [[Royal Navy]]. In September 1812, Russia had 900,000 enlisted men in its land forces, and between 1799 and 1815 2.1&amp;nbsp;million men served in its army. Another 200,000 served in the Russian Navy. Out of the 900,000 men, the field armies deployed against France numbered less than 250,000.

There are no consistent statistics for other major combatants. Austria's forces peaked at about 576,000 (during the War of the Sixth Coalition) and had little or no naval component yet never fielded more than 250,000 men in field armies. After Britain, Austria proved the most persistent enemy of France; more than a million Austrians served during the long wars. Its large army was overall quite homogeneous and solid and in 1813 operated in Germany (140,000 men), Italy and the Balkans (90,000 men at its peak, about 50,000 men during most of the campaigning on these fronts). Austria's manpower was becoming quite limited towards the end of the wars, leading its generals to favour cautious and conservative strategies, to limit their losses.

[[File:Baschkiren gegen Franzosen.jpg|thumb|French soldiers in skirmish with [[Bashkirs]] and [[Cossacks]] in 1813]]
Prussia never had more than 320,000 men under arms at any time. In 1813–1815, the core of its army (about 100,000 men) was characterised by competence and determination, but the bulk of its forces consisted of second- and third-line troops, as well as militiamen of variable strength. Many of these troops performed reasonably well and often displayed considerable bravery but lacked the professionalism of their regular counterparts and were not as well equipped. Others were largely unfit for operations, except sieges. During the 1813 campaign, 130,000 men were used in the military operations, with 100,000 effectively participating in the main German campaign, and about 30,000 being used to besiege isolated French garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;''Blücher, scourge of Napoleon'', Leggiere&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain's armies also peaked at around 200,000 men, not including more than 50,000 guerrillas scattered over Spain. In addition the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha Confederation]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] each had more than 100,000 men under arms. Even small nations now had armies rivalling the size of the [[Great Powers]]' forces of past wars but most of these were poor quality forces only suitable for garrison duties. The size of their combat forces remained modest yet they could still provide a welcome addition to the major powers. The percentage of French troops in the Grande Armee which Napoleon led into Russia was about 50% while the French allies also provided a significant contribution to the French forces in Spain. As these small nations joined the coalition forces in 1813–1814, they provided a useful addition to the coalition while depriving Napoleon of much needed manpower.

===Innovations===
The initial stages of the [[Industrial Revolution]] had much to do with larger military forces—it became easy to mass-produce weapons and thus to equip larger forces. Britain was the largest single manufacturer of armaments in this period. It supplied most of the weapons used by the coalition powers throughout the conflicts. France produced the second-largest total of armaments, equipping its own huge forces as well as those of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and other allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher David Hall|title=British Strategy in the Napoleonic War, 1803–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ue8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28|year=1992|publisher=Manchester U.P.|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon showed innovative tendencies in his use of mobility to offset numerical disadvantages, as demonstrated in the rout of the Austro-Russian forces in 1805 in the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. The French Army redefined the role of artillery, forming independent, mobile units, as opposed to the previous tradition of attaching artillery pieces in support of troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Wawro|title=Warfare and Society in Europe, 1792–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtuAhd9qARkC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Semaphore line|semaphore system]] had allowed the French War-Minister, Carnot, to communicate with French forces on the frontiers throughout the 1790s. The French continued to use this system throughout the Napoleonic wars. [[Aerial surveillance]] was used for the first time when the French used a hot-air balloon to survey coalition positions before the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], on 26 June 1794.&lt;ref name="R. R. Palmer 1941 81–83"/&gt;

===Total war===
{{Main article|Total war}}
[[File:Goya-Guerra (32).jpg|thumb|right|[[Francisco Goya|Goya's]] ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', showing French atrocities against Spanish civilians]]
Historians have explored how the Napoleonic wars became total wars. Most historians argue that the escalation in size and scope came from two sources. First was the ideological clash between revolutionary/egalitarian and conservative/hierarchical belief systems. Second was the emerging [[nationalism]] in France, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere that made these "people's wars" instead of contests between monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Stoker|title=Conscription in the Napoleonic Era: A Revolution in Military Affairs?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iks6rVhTHrwC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|pages=24, 31–32, 38|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell has argued that even more important than ideology and nationalism were the intellectual transformations in the culture of war that came about through [[the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, ''The First Total War'' (2008) pp&amp;nbsp;7–13&lt;/ref&gt; One factor, he says, is that war was no longer a routine event but a transforming experience for societies—a total experience. Secondly the military emerged in its own right as a separate sphere of society distinct from the ordinary civilian world. The French Revolution made every civilian a part of the war machine, either as a soldier through universal conscription, or as a vital cog in the home front machinery supporting and supplying the army. Out of that, says Bell, came "militarism," the belief that the military role was morally superior to the civilian role in times of great national crisis. The fighting army represented the essence of the nation's soul.&lt;ref&gt;Many historians say it was not the "first" total war; for a critique of Bell see {{cite book|author=Frederick C. Schneid|title=Napoleonic Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V086MVIushMC&amp;pg=PA1802|year=2012|publisher=Potomac Books|page=1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Napoleon proclaimed, "It is the soldier who founds a Republic and it is the soldier who maintains it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Harvey|title=The War of Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB1SXLBGP18C&amp;pg=PT328|year=2013|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Cybersnare''' was a [[United States Secret Service]] operation in 1995 targeted at [[hacker (computer security)|computer hackers]].

In January 1995, the Secret Service set up an undercover [[bulletin board]] system in [[Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]]. This was the first undercover Internet sting of its kind. With the help of an undercover informant, they advertised the bulletin board across the Internet. The topics for discussion were [[cellular telephone]] cloning and computer hacking.

In September, twelve raids across the country resulted in the arrest of six hackers. From the press release, those arrested were:

*Richard Lacap, of [[Katy, Texas]], who used the computer alias of "Chillin" and Kevin Watkins, of [[Houston, Texas]], who used the computer alias of "Led". Lacap and Watkins were charged by criminal complaint with conspiring to break into the computer system of an Oregon Cellular Telephone company.
*Jeremy Cushing, of [[Huntington Beach]], [[California]], who used the computer alias of "Alpha Bits", was charged with trafficking in cloned cellular telephone equipment and stolen access devices used to program cellular telephones.
*Frank Natoli, of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], used the computer alias of "Mmind". He was charged with trafficking in stolen access devices used to program cellular telephones.
*Al Bradford, of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], who used the computer alias of "Cellfone", was charged with trafficking in unauthorized access devices used to program cellular telephones.
*Michael Clarkson, of Brooklyn, New York, who used the computer alias of "Barcode", was charged with possessing and trafficking in hardware used to obtain unauthorized access to telecommunications services.

'''''Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast''''' was a one-hour, [[Television advertisement|commercial]]-free [[benefit concert]] [[television special]] that aired [[simulcast]] worldwide on September 9, 2005 at 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CT]] [[live television|live]] (with a 30-second tape delay) from [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] and [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]ed in the [[Mountain Time Zone]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s. The special raised money for the relief efforts from the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. It was broadcast in over 100 different countries. All proceeds went to the [[American Red Cross]] or [[The Salvation Army]].

==Production==
The concert was a cooperative and collaborative global effort between [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], [[UPN]], and [[The WB Television Network|The WB]]. Several cable stations have also cleared space for the concert. It featured appearances and musical performances by celebrities from the world of film, television and music. Approximately $30 million was raised for the [[American Red Cross]] and [[The Salvation Army]].

The event was [[television producer|produced]] by [[Joel Gallen]] and followed very closely in the footprints of ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'', which raised money for the relief efforts from the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] (both telethons had the [[Los Angeles]] segments at [[CBS Television City]]).  It featured performances by popular musicians along with commentary by various actors and other celebrities.  Celebrities also answered phone calls to help collect donations.

[[Image:Argentine map of Argentina.png|thumb|150px|right|Territories and exclusive economic Zones claimed by Argentina]] 
The '''sinking of the ''Chian-der 3''''' was an incident occurred on 28 May 1986, when the Taiwanese-flagged [[naval trawler|trawler]] ''Chian-der 3'' was detected, tracked, fired upon, set on fire and eventually sunk by the Coast Guard [[Mantilla class patrol vessel|Mantilla class patrol]] vessel [[PNA Prefecto Derbes (GC-28)|''Prefecto Derbes'' (GC-28)]] of the [[Prefectura Naval Argentina]], at a location {{convert|24|nmi|km mi}} outside the United Kingdom's [[Total Exclusion Zone]], which covers a circle of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi}} from the centre of the [[Falklands Islands]]. Two Taiwanese fishermen were killed; four others were injured.

== Background ==
The overlapping of the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of the Argentine mainland and the Falklands and the British exclusion zone for Argentine ships is used by fishing fleets in order to fish without permission, said the Argentine government.&lt;ref name="elpais30mai1986" /&gt;

According to an Argentine statement the trawler ''Chi-Fu 6'' was detected fishing in the Argentine zone at 11:45, but she took refuge in the British zone. At 18:25 the trawler ''Chian-der 3'' was spotted again within the Argentine zone of {{convert|200|nmi|mi}}. Despite requests to stop and warning shots being fired by ''Prefecto Derbes'', the trawler escaped and was chased. At 21:05 the Argentine commander stated that he saw that the trawler stopped and emitting smoke from the engine room. He ordered the rescue of the trawler's crew. According to official sources, the trawler was hit by non-explosive rounds. As a result of the incident, one Taiwanese fisherman was killed and four others wounded. Another member of the crew became missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1986/05/31/internacional/517874414_850215.html|title=Argentina culpa al capitán del pesquero taiwanés y a Londres por el suceso del Atlántico|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=1986-05-31|language=es|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taiwan fishermen's union called it a "barbaric act" and the British government condemned it as "unjustifiable and excessive".&lt;ref name="elpais30mai1986"&gt;Article [http://elpais.com/diario/1986/05/30/internacional/517788024_850215.html "Un guardacostas argentino hunde un pesquero de Taiwan en aguas reclamadas por Buenos Aires"].

Since 1912, this chapter has continually supplied the largest percentage of athletes that comprise the [[United States at the Olympics]].

The organization dates back to 1919, and was formerly titled the [[Southern California]] Olympian chapter.
The membership area includes areas in Southern California from [[Fresno, California]], to the Southern California border with [[Mexico]], a distance of over 300 miles.

The current chapter was founded on March 19, 1949, with its first president, [[Fred Kelly (athlete)|Fred Kelly]] of [[Orange, California]]. Since that time the SoCal Olympians and Paralympians has sought to perpetuate Southern California's outstanding Olympic heritage which dates back to 1904.

The SoCal Olympians &amp; Paralympians help fund the dreams of future USA Olympians, Paralympians, coordinate member appearances at youth, community and corporate events, offer fellowship to members of past and current Olympic teams, and support the creation of an active, visible worldwide Olympian organization.

More than 800 USA Olympians and Paralympians from past and present United States Olympic Teams who live and work in Southern California draw upon their athletic experiences to inspire and pass on the Olympic ideals of the [[Olympic Charter]] to its communities and to enrich the lives of the youth of Southern California.

The organization stages a Welcome Home Dinner for Olympians after each summer [[Olympic Games]], and provides sports motivational speakers to local community groups.  They participate in celebrity [[Golf]] tournaments and provide grants to Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls through their 501C3 charity, the Koroibos Foundation.

The SoCal Olympicians support the international Olympic Day by hosting sports clinics during the month of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homedepotcenter.com/contentright.php?section=aboutus&amp;page=news_article&amp;news_id=779 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723174433/http://www.homedepotcenter.com/contentright.php?section=aboutus&amp;page=news_article&amp;news_id=779 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tahir Jalil Habbush al Takriti''' ({{lang-ar|طاهر جليل حبوش التكريتي}}; born 1950) is a former [[Iraq]]i intelligence official who served under the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]]; in 2001, he was Iraq's head of intelligence and as such, informed [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] in January 2003 (shortly before the start of the [[Iraq War]]) that Iraq had no [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|WMD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/panorama-iraq-fresh-wmd-claims |title=MI6 and CIA heard Iraq had no active WMD capability ahead of invasion &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Jack of Diamonds in [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21786506 |title=Iraq: The spies who fooled the world - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still a fugitive with up to $1 million reward for information leading to his capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/index.cfm?page=Tahir&amp;language=English | title=Rewards for Justice | accessdate=March 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215223524/http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/index.cfm?page=Tahir&amp;language=english |archivedate=February 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forged 2003 Habbush letter==
{{Main|Habbush letter}}

According to the London Sunday ''Telegraph'', [[Mohamed Atta]] is mentioned in a [[Habbush letter|letter]] allegedly discovered in Iraq handwritten by Tahir Jalil Habbush al Takriti, former chief of the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]]. Habbush's July 1, 2001, memo is labeled "Intelligence Items" and is addressed: "To the President of the Ba'ath Revolution Party and President of the Republic, may God protect you."
It continues:
:’’[[Mohamed Atta]], an Egyptian national, came with Abu Ammer [the real name behind this Arabic alias remains a mystery] and we hosted him in Abu Nidal's house at al-Dora under our direct supervision.’’
:’’We arranged a work program for him for three days with a team dedicated to working with him...He displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy.’’  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200312150842.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513004902/http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200312150842.asp |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memo is believed to be a forgery.  According to [[Newsweek]], "U.S. officials and a leading Iraqi document expert [say] the document is most likely a forgery, part of a thriving new trade in dubious Iraqi documents that has cropped up in the wake of the collapse of Saddam's regime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3741646/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516150018/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3741646/ |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Way of the World (book)|The Way of the World]]'', author [[Ron Suskind]] alleges that the Bush administration itself ordered the forgery. Habbush then supposedly signed the letter, having already been resettled in Jordan with $5 million from the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen |first=Mike |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12308.html |title=Book says White House ordered forgery |publisher=Politico |date= |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TubaChristmas''' is a music concert held in cities worldwide that celebrates those who play, teach, and compose music for instruments in the [[tuba]] family, including the tuba, [[sousaphone]], [[baritone horn|baritone]], and [[euphonium]], though some participants bring rarer members of the family such as the [[Helicon (instrument)|helicon]], [[ophicleide]], [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and [[double bell euphonium]].

The first TubaChristmas was organized by [[Harvey G. Phillips]] to honor his tuba teacher [[William Bell (tuba player)|William Bell]], who was born on [[Christmas Day]] 1902, and was held December 22, 1974, in the [[ice skating rink]] at New York City's [[Rockefeller Center]]; [[Paul Lavalle]] conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It was not easy to convince Rockefeller Center to let hundreds of tubas play on the ice rink. Phillips had to provide the unlisted telephone numbers of some of his friends: [[Leopold Stokowski]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Andre Kostelanetz]], and [[Morton Gould]]. He was given free rein after his references were checked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

TubaChristmas concerts vary in size from a quartet (two euphoniums and two tubas), to several hundred at their largest events. Any musician can play in a TubaChristmas concert as long as he or she plays an instrument in the tuba family (conical bore). There is a nominal participant registration fee.

The TubaChristmas version of "[[Jingle Bells]]", arranged by Norlan Bewley, incorporates the trio section of the "[[National Emblem]]" march by [[Edwin Eugene Bagley]] before returning to the "Jingle Bells" melody.

TubaChristmas coordinators in New York City include Michael Salzman, one of Harvey Phillips' former students at [[Indiana University]]. Salzman is the tuba and euphonium professor at [[Hofstra University]].

'''The Vancouver Pop Festival''' was a [[Canadian]] [[rock festival]] held at the Paradise Valley Resort in [[Squamish, British Columbia]]. The dates of the festival were August 22, 23 and 24, 1969.&lt;ref name="vs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=18db9fd0-716a-4afb-9ae1-62afa2d4b8c0|title=This Day In History: August 24, 1969|work=Vancouver Sun|date=August 24, 2012|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Candi Promotions.

Neither the Grateful Dead nor Strawberry Alarm Clock played. A band named [[Crow (band)|Crow]] was the surprise hit for those who liked hard rock. Bikers provided an uncomfortable, "avoid taking hallucinogens" vibe.

==Lineup==
Due to problems with paid attendance, only some of the acts listed below performed. It has been claimed that the Grateful Dead did not perform&lt;ref name="vs"/&gt; but [[Jerry Garcia]] biographer Blair Jackson disputed this, and speculated the Dead took the gig to move on from their poor performance at the [[Woodstock festival]] a week earlier.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; The groups playing at the festival included (in alphabetical order):

It is a non-competitive, non-commercial and non-profitable event, with free admission to the general public in all sessions.

The main objective of the [http://verciencia.com.br '''VerCiência Project'''] is to encourage and promote the dissemination of [[knowledge]] and scientific culture through television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceoffice.org/en/a-quimica-das-coisas-na-verciencia/ |title=The Chemistry of Things in VerCiência « Science Office |publisher=Scienceoffice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the support of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Brazil)|Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation]] of Brazil as part of the Brazilian [http://www.mcti.gov.br/noticias/-/asset_publisher/IqV53KMvD5rY/content/tema-da-snct-2015-remete-ao-ano-internacional-da-luz National Week of Science and Technology]. The main sponsor of VerCiência is [[Petrobras]].

The annual '''VerCiência''' exhibitions take place simultaneously in several Brazilian cities, such as [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]] and [[Brasília]], usually in the third week of October (coinciding with the National Week of Science and Technology) and consist in the exhibition of a selection of science TV programmes produced in Brazil and other countries.

Among main traditional international participants of the Ver Ciência exhibitions are the [[BBC]] (UK) and [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] (US), with programmes such as ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' and ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'', good examples of how science and technology can be conveyed in an interesting and informative manner to the general public.

'''Ward Memorial Hall''' is an 1880s [[theater]] building within the [[Northwestern Branch, National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers Historic District]], located in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. It is part of the Milwaukee Soldiers Home complex, designated Building No. 41, on the present day Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center grounds.

The 900 seat [[theater]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984, as part an effort to renovate and preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landmarkhunter.com/137442-ward-memorial-hall/|title=Ward Memorial Hall|publisher=Landmark Hunter.com|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ward Memorial Hall was built in 1881-82 during a period of expansion for the [[Northwestern Branch, National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers Historic District|Northwestern Branch]] of the [[National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers]] facilities, originally the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (1867−1873).  On its completion theatrical entertainment moved from the chapel in the 1869 Main Building.

Koch]] designed Ward Memorial Hall in the High Victorian [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] and [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival style]]s, with a theater/meeting room, [[commissary]] store, restaurant, and railroad passenger station.&lt;ref name=habs&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/wi/wi0600/wi0681/data/wi0681data.pdf LOC−HABS: History and description of Ward Memorial Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; This unusual combination of building uses was to serve the growing recreational needs of the Milwaukee Soldiers Home.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt; It has a wide veranda wrapping around three sides.

It is one of the oldest theaters in [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiershome.org/theater|title=Our Buildings - Ward Memorial Hall|publisher=Soldiers Home.org|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Renaissance style" frescoes were designed by J. H. Harding and created under his supervision on the theater's ceiling.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt; They was covered over by a barrel vaulted ceiling when the theater was expanded, but still remain.  In 1888 a large [[stained glass window]] depicting General [[U. S. Grant]] depicted astride his horse was donated by the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], installed on second floor of the east façade, reconfiguring two preexisting windows.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

Gradually functions such as the train depot, post office, and store were moved to different structures and the theater facilities were expanded. In 1898 the theater space was entirely reconfigured to have a sloped floor, balcony, and boxes flanking the proscenium stage, and more fire exits.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

It was the Milwaukee Soldiers Home's venue for professional entertainments, including lectures, concerts, minstrel and theater companies, and regional [[vaudeville]] circuit productions. It has featured performers such as [[Will Rogers]], [[Sophie Tucker]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Liberace]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]],  [[Bob Hope]], and [[Burns and Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMAAWP_Ward_Memorial_Hall_Milwaukee_WI|title=Ward Memorial Hall - Milwaukee, WI|publisher=Waymarking.com|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the theater gradually fell into disuse by resident veterans.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

==Conservation==
From 1981 through 1992 the Milwaukee Players, a local theater company, used the theater for rehearsals and offices.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt; A movement led by the Soldiers Home Foundation, Inc., the [[American Legion]], and other groups began to raise funds to renovate the theater in the early 1980s. Milwaukee native and famous performer [[Liberace|Wladziu "Walter" Liberace]] (1919-1987) offered limited help. When young in the 1920s he had performed at the theater, when visiting veterans with his mother.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

Ambitious fundraising efforts by the Soldiers Home Foundation floundered and currently Ward Memorial Hall sits vacant. The building is deteriorating, mainly due to water infiltration and lack of climate control.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

The Milwaukee Soldiers Home's vacant buildings, including Ward Memorial Hall, are on the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] List of 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.&lt;ref name=nthphd&gt;[http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/11-most-endangered/locations/national-soldiers-home.html  National Trust for Historic Preservation: National Soldiers Home Historic District], NTHP List of 11 Most Endangered Historic Places . accessed 12.1.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Invitational Hula Festival''' is a three-day event that perpetuates [[Hawaiian culture]] as a celebration of the artistic rendering of the Hawaiian [[hula]] dance. The festival is in its 20th year of production and is the largest and farthest reaching event of its kind.

Thousands of participants from 16 countries have honed their hula skills throughout the years and participated in hundreds of events to secure travel to Hawaii each November. Hula artists from [[American Samoa]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Guam]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]] (14+ cities), [[Korea]], [[Marianas]], [[Mexico]], [[Namibia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[Sweden]], the continental [[United States|U.S.]] (12+ cities), [[Western Samoa]], and Hawaii participate in this on-going celebration of Hawaiian culture, art, music, dance, language, history and all natural things in the Hawaiian environment.

'''Ioannis Georgiou "Yanis" Varoufakis''' ({{lang-el|Ιωάννης Γεωργίου "Γιάνης" Βαρουφάκης|Ioánnis Georgíou "Giánis" Varoufákis}}, {{IPA-el|ˈʝanis varuˈfacis|pron}}; born 24 March 1961)&lt;ref&gt;officially {{lang|el|Ιωάννης Γεωργίου Βαρουφάκης}} ({{transl|el|Ioánnis Georgíou Varoufákis}}), [https://www.webcitation.org/6ZozxWl15 Hellenic Parliament: MPs' contact details]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae of Yanis Varoufakis |url=http://www.econ.uoa.gr/fileadmin/econ.uoa.gr/en/uploads/CV_Varoufakis_2014_eng.pdf |publisher=UOA Economics department}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Greek economist, academic and politician, who served as the Greek [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]] from January to July 2015, when he resigned. Varoufakis was a [[Syriza]] member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] (MP) for [[Athens B]] from January to September 2015.

Varoufakis was born in [[Athens]] in 1961 and attended [[Moraitis School]] before moving to the United Kingdom, where he studied mathematics at the [[University of Essex]] before attaining a postgraduate degree in mathematical statistics at [[University of Birmingham]] and a [[PhD]] in economics at Essex. He began a career in academic economics, teaching at the universities of Essex, [[University of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] between 1982 and 1988. Following [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s third election victory in 1987, Varoufakis left the UK and moved to Australia, where he taught at the [[University of Sydney]] until 2000. He returned to Greece that year to teach at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], where he led a doctoral program and was promoted to full professor in 2005. Following this, Varoufakis had periods of advising [[George Papandreou]] and working as the economist-in-residence for [[Valve Corporation]] before moving to the [[United States]] to teach at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Varoufakis has published a number of texts on economics and [[game theory]], such as ''[[The Global Minotaur]]''.

In January 2015, Varoufakis was appointed Greek Minister of Finance, and led negotiations with Greece's creditors during the [[Greek government-debt crisis]]. However, he failed to reach an agreement with the [[European troika]], leading to the [[Greek bailout referendum, 2015|2015 Greek bailout referendum]]. While the referendum rejected the troika bailout terms, the day following the referendum Varoufakis resigned as Minister of Finance and was replaced by [[Euclid Tsakalotos]]. On 24 August, Varoufakis voted against the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third bailout package]], and in the ensuing [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September snap election]], did not stand for re-election. Varoufakis has since appeared in numerous debates, lectures, and interviews. In February 2016, he launched the [[Democracy in Europe Movement 2025]] (DiEM25), and subsequently backed a Remain vote in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|UK's European Union membership referendum 2016]].

In late October 2018, Varoufakis announced the upcoming launch of Progressive International with U.S. Senator [[Bernie Sanders]].

==Early life and education==
Varoufakis was born in [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Athens]], on 24 March 1961, to Georgios and Eleni Varoufakis.&lt;ref name=Efimerida2013&gt;{{cite web |script-title=el:Βαρουφάκης στο iefimerida.gr: Είμαι απαισιόδοξος για την πορεία της Ελλάδας. Τα χειρότερα έρχονται. Δυστυχώς... |trans-title= |work=Efimerida|url=http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/89099 |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varoufakis's father, Georgios Varoufakis, was a [[Greeks in Egypt|Greek Egyptian]] who emigrated from [[Cairo]] to Greece in the 1940s, arriving in the midst of the [[Greek Civil War]]. One day, he was "roughed up" by the police and asked to sign a denunciation of communism. In response, he said: "Look I am not a Buddhist, but I would never sign a denunciation of Buddhism".&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hansen|first1=Suzy|title=A Finance Minister Fit for a Greek Tragedy?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/magazine/a-finance-minister-fit-for-a-greek-tragedy.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 October 2015|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore ended up spending several years imprisoned on the island of [[Makronisos]], which was used for the political re-education of people who fought on the communist side in the war.&lt;ref name=bft /&gt; After being released in 1950, he completed his university studies and found employment as the personal assistant to the owner of [[Halyvourgiki S.A.|Halyvourgiki]], Greece's biggest steel producer. He is now, at the age of 90, Chairman of Halyvourgiki's Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=bft /&gt;&lt;ref name=usb /&gt;

Varoufakis's mother, a student at the [[University of Athens]] School of Chemistry at the time she met Georgios, abandoned her conservative background&lt;ref name=Efimerida2013 /&gt; after meeting her husband who was, at the time, allied to [[United Democratic Left]] (EDA). In the mid-1970s Eleni Varoufaki became an activist for the Women's Union of Greece, which promoted gender equality and had been set up by members of [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]].&lt;ref name=bft /&gt; By the early-1980s, the couple had converged politically to the same political centre-left views and engaged with the socialist PASOK.&lt;ref name=Efimerida2013 /&gt; Eleni was elected Deputy Mayor of Palaio Faliro a few years before she died in 2008.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Varoufakis was six years old when the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|military coup d'état of April 1967]] took place. Varoufakis later said that the military junta showed him a "sense of what it means to be both unfree and, at once, convinced that the possibilities for progress and improvement are endless". The junta collapsed when Varoufakis was in junior high school.&lt;ref name=beginnings&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varoufakis|first1=Yanis|title=Beginnings: From the dictatorship of the Colonels to the tyranny of economics|url=http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/about/beginnings-from-the-dictatorship-of-the-colonels-to-the-tyranny-of-economics/|website=Yanis Varoufakis|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attending the private [[Moraitis School]], Varoufakis decided early to spell his first name with one 'n', rather than the standard two, for "[[aesthetic]]" reasons. When his teacher gave him a low mark for that, he became angry and has continued spelling his first name with one 'n' ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christides|first1=Giorgos|title=Profile: Yanis Varoufakis, Greek bailout foe|url=http://m.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31452402|work=BBC|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varoufakis finished his secondary education around 1976, when his parents deemed it too dangerous for him to continue his education in Greece. Therefore, he moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1978 where he entered the [[University of Essex]]. His "initial urge was to study physics" but he decided that "the lingua franca of political discourse was economics". He therefore enrolled in the economics course at Essex, but it has also been suggested that he decided to enroll in economics after meeting [[Andreas Papandreou]].&lt;ref name=bft&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barber|first1=Tony|last2=Hope|first2=Kerin|title=Yanis Varoufakis, Greek finance minister|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e449635a-ad3a-11e4-a5c1-00144feab7de.html|accessdate=24 October 2015|work=The Financial Times|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After only a few weeks of lectures, Varoufakis switched his degree to mathematics.&lt;ref name=beginnings /&gt; Whilst at the University of Essex he joined a variety of political organisations including ComSoc (the University Communist Society) and the [[Troops Out Movement]], which campaigned for a British withdrawal from [[Northern Ireland]]. He also became involved with the [[African National Congress]], [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], and other organisations such as those in solidarity with [[Chile]]. Varoufakis was also elected as secretary of the Black Students Alliance, a choice that caused some controversy, given that he is not black, to which he responded by telling them, according to his PhD supervisor Monojit Chatterjee, "that black was a political term and, as a Greek, on the grounds of ethnicity he had as much reason to be there as anyone else."&lt;ref name=usb&gt;{{cite news|last1=Usborne|first1=Simon|title=Yanis Varoufakis: The Finance Minister who cooks a mean Thai meal, chats about art, and shoots hoops|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/yanis-varoufakis-the-finance-minister-who-cooks-a-mean-thai-meal-chats-about-art-and-shoots-hoops-10021859.html|accessdate=24 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varoufakis also took part in student debates, where one of his rivals was [[John Bercow]], who later became the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=usb /&gt;

He moved to the [[University of Birmingham]] in October 1981, obtaining an [[Master of Science|MSc]] in [[mathematical statistics]] in October 1982. He completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[economics]], writing a thesis on Optimization and Strikes, back at the University of Essex, where his PhD supervisor was Monojit Chatterjee. He completed his PhD in 1987.&lt;ref name="IT ALL BEGAN WITH A STRANGE EMAIL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varoufakis|first1=Yanis|title=IT ALL BEGAN WITH A STRANGE EMAIL|url=http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/it-all-began-with-a-strange-email/|website=Valve Economics|publisher=Valve Software|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
[[File:Yanis Varoufakis on Subversive Festival.jpg|thumb|right|Varoufakis at [[Subversive Festival]] 2013 in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]]]

Between 1982 and 1988, Varoufakis taught economics and econometrics at the [[University of Essex]] and the [[University of East Anglia]], and also taught at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He did not wish to return to Greece for fear of conscription, and so accepted an offer to lecture at the [[University of Sydney]], where he remained until 2000. From 1989 to 2000, he taught as senior lecturer in economics at the Department of Economics of the University of Sydney, with short stints at the [[University of Glasgow]] and the [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. Varoufakis, during his time in Sydney, had his own slot on a local television show where he was critical of [[John Howard]]'s conservative government. He also acquired Australian citizenship.&lt;ref name=bft /&gt;&lt;ref name=acpath /&gt;

In 2000, a combination of "nostalgia and abhorrence of the conservative turn of the land Down Under", led Varoufakis to return to Greece where he was unanimously elected an associate professor of economic theory at the [[University of Athens]].&lt;ref name=bft /&gt; In 2002, Varoufakis established ''The University of Athens Doctoral Program in Economics'' (UADPhilEcon), which he directed until 2008. In 2005 he was promoted to full professor of economic theory.&lt;ref name=acpath&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varoufakis|first1=Yanis|title=Early academic path: From England to Australia to Greece|url=http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/about/early-academic-path-from-england-to-australia-to-greece/|website=Yanis Varoufakis|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 2004 to December 2006, Varoufakis served as economic advisor to [[George Papandreou]], of whose government he was to become an ardent critic a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/28/finmin-gr-idUSL6N0V742820150128 Reuters (2015-01-28): Profile: Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis]: "Varoufakis was an adviser to former centre-left Prime Minister George Papandreou until he resigned in 2006." [http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/4767/Yanis_Varoufakis:__There_is_no_such_thing_as_a_debt_crisis_.html OECD Observer: Yanis Varoufakis (2013-03-01): "There is no such thing as a debt crisis"]: "Between 2004 and 2007 Mr Varoufakis served as economic adviser to George Papandreou, before he became Prime Minister of Greece."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in March 2012, Varoufakis became economist-in-residence at [[Valve Corporation]]. He researched the [[virtual economy]] on the Steam digital delivery platform, specifically looking at exchange rates and trade deficits. In June 2012, he began a blog about his research at Valve. In February 2013 his function at Valve was to work on a game for predicting trends in gaming.&lt;ref name=Twitter /&gt;&lt;ref name=ValueBlog /&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;&lt;ref name=FT /&gt; From January 2013 he taught at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as a visiting professor. In November 2013, he was appointed guest professor at Stockholm University, Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, to work within game and decision theory at the eGovLab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsv.su.se/en/research/profilearea/egov/yanis-varoufakis-will-be-guest-professor-at-dsv-1.152364|title=Yanis Varoufakis will be guest professor at DSV - DSV, Department of Computer and Systems Sciences - Stockholm University|first=Jannecke|last=Schulman|date=|website=dsv.su.se|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he was appointed the Athens desk editor of the online magazine ''WDW Review'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdwreview.org/|title=WdW Review|work=wdwreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he contributed until January 2015. On 22 January 2015,{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} the [[International University College of Turin]] awarded to Varoufakis an honorary professorship in comparative law economics and finance for his extraordinary theoretical contribution to the understanding of the global economic crisis.{{r|iuct}} Veroufakis is a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2015.

==Minister of Finance and the Syriza government (January–August 2015)==
{{Greek economic crisis}}
Varoufakis was elected to the Greek parliament, gathering the largest number of votes (more than 142 thousand) of any Greek MP, representing [[Syriza]],{{r|guardiansyriza}} and took office in the new government of [[Alexis Tsipras]] two days later, on 27 January 2015.{{r|ibtimes}} He was appointed [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Finance Minister]] by Tsipras shortly after the election victory. The party promised to renegotiate Greece's debt and significantly curtail the austerity measures which had led to the longest recession in post-war global history.{{r|bbcreduce}}{{r|wsjreduce}}

The new government had to negotiate an extension on its loan agreement, due to expire on the 28th February 2015. Had it expired without renewal, the [[European Central Bank]] would have pulled its liquidity provisions from Greece's commercial banks, ensuring that they closed their doors to the public. Varoufakis led this negotiation at the Eurogroup and with the [[International Monetary Fund]]. On 20 February, at the Eurogroup, an agreement to extend the Greek loan "facility" for four months, until 30 June 2015, was struck and Varoufakis hailed it as crucial – because it represented a fresh start by specifying that the terms of the loan would be renegotiated and its conditions would be re-drawn on the basis of a new list of reforms to be provided by the Greek government. That list was submitted by Varoufakis on 23 February and was approved by the Eurogroup on 24 February. On those grounds, Varoufakis signed the official document by which the loan agreement's expiry date was to be extended from 28 February to 30 June 2015 – a four-month period during which a new agreement was to be negotiated.

Varoufakis' view on Greece's public debt, and the 2010 crisis which began as a result of the Greek governments' inability to fund it, was that EU bailouts were attempts to take on the largest loan in history on condition of austerity measures that would shrink the incomes from which old, un-serviceable loans and new bailout debts would have to be repaid. Varoufakis argued that the "bailout" loans of 2010 and 2012, before restructuring the debt properly and putting in place a developmental program (including reforming the oligarchy, creating a development bank and dealing with the banks' non-performing loans) would lead to deeper bankruptcy, a great depression and a harder default in the future. His explanation of why the troika of Greece's lenders (the IMF, the ECB, and the [[European Commission]]) insisted on these bailout loans was that they represented a transfer of losses from the private banks to Greece's and Europe's taxpayers. In his view, the 20 February 2015 Eurogroup agreement that he negotiated, "was an excellent opportunity to move forward."&lt;ref name=blog2 /&gt;

However, the troika of lenders were not happy to let the new Greek government change the previous terms of the agreement, nor to agree to a debt restructuring. Varoufakis claims that, soon after the extension was granted at the end of February, the troika reneged on its alleged promise to consider a new fiscal and reform program for Greece, demanding of the Greek government that it implement the old one (which the Syriza government was elected to re-write). In March 2015, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' pointed to several tensions between Greece and the other Eurozone countries, saying that some countries feel they have taken the "tough medicine" and the €195 billion owed is not insignificant. Further, they stated other governments have philosophical differences with Varoufakis and his [[Anglosphere]] and [[Keynesian]] leanings. [[Peter Ludlow (historian)|Peter Ludlow]] said Varoufakis and his colleagues "turned instinctively... to the U.K. and the U.S. even before they called on the European Left."&lt;ref name=wsj2 /&gt;

In a discussion with Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]] on invitation of U.S. economic think tank [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]], Varoufakis stated on 9 April 2015 that "the Greek state does not have the capacity to develop public assets." Therefore, he announced that his government was "restarting the privatization process." However, unlike the former governments they would insist on establishing [[public–private partnership]]s with the state retaining a minority stake to generate state revenues. They would also require a minimum investment on behalf of the bidder, and "decent working conditions" for workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|OY3Qxm6BoUI&amp;t{{=}}52m23s|Yanis Varoufakis and Joseph Stiglitz}}, live stream, 9 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Varoufakis also said that although the government needed to avoid a [[Government budget balance|primary budget deficit]], the bailout program's target of a surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP was outlandish and should be reduced to no more than 1.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Greece to restart privatization program: Varoufakis |agency=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/09/us-eurozone-greece-finmin-idUSKBN0N01DB20150409 |date=9 April 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |first=Ingrid |last=Melander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many weeks of negotiations during which the Greek government, often against Varoufakis' advice, made many concessions to the troika of Greece's lenders, no agreement was in sight. One reason was that the members of the troika did not have a unified position. For example, the IMF insisted that the Greek government's demand for a public debt restructure should be granted, while powerful finance ministers in the Eurogroup (Germany's, for instance) refused this. Another alleged reason was that, with elections approaching in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal, various politicians within the EU did not want to see Greece's radical new government emerge as successful. Moreover, the differences in economic ideology will have contributed to the lack of progress towards a mutually-agreeable solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Greek Debt Crisis: background and developments in 2015 |url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07114#fullreport |date=13 October 2015 |accessdate=16 November 2017 |first=Daniel |last=Harari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2015, Varoufakis was presented with an ultimatum in the Eurogroup. It included a fiscal proposal, a reform agenda, and a funding formula that Varoufakis, his government, and several other ministers of finance sitting in the Eurogroup, considered to be non-viable. The next day, the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, called for a referendum on the Eurogroup's proposal on 5 July.

On 5 July 2015, the [[Greek bailout referendum, 2015|bailout referendum]] took place. Varoufakis had campaigned vigorously in favour of the 'No' vote, against the united support for the 'Yes' of Greece's media. To make his position clear, he declared on television that he would resign as finance minister if Greeks voted 'Yes'.{{r|yes-quit}} The outcome of the vote was a resounding 61.5 percent vote in favour of 'No'. Varoufakis went on television, soon after the result was announced, and declared that the government was determined to honour this new mandate for a different agreement with its creditors. However, a few hours later, Varoufakis resigned. In his resignation statement the following morning he claimed that "other European participants" had expressed a wish for his absence.{{r|neg}} Later he explained that he decided to resign during a meeting with the prime minister, on the night of the referendum, during which he discovered that the prime minister, instead of being energised by the "No" vote, declared to Varoufakis his decision to acquiesce to the troika's terms. Unwilling to sign such a "surrender" document, Varoufakis chose to resign.

His explanation, published later by Harry Lambert, ''[[New Statesman]]'', 13 July 2015, was this: "I'm not going to betray my own view, that I honed back in 2010, that this country must stop extending and pretending, we must stop taking on new loans pretending that we've solved the problem, when we haven't; when we have made our debt even less sustainable on condition of further austerity that even further shrinks the economy; and shifts the burden further onto the have nots, creating a humanitarian crisis. It's something I'm not going to accept, I'm not going to be party to."

In a 16 July teleconference with private investors that was later made public, Varoufakis described a five-month clandestine project he ran as finance minister involving hacking into Greece's independent tax service's computers. The project's goal was to develop a parallel payment system that could be implemented as a contingency plan if the Greek system failed, and was dubbed "Plan B". In it, individuals' private identification numbers were accessed and copied to a computer controlled by a "childhood friend" of Varoufakis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d44a92c0-3454-11e5-bdbb-35e55cbae175.html|title=Yanis Varoufakis defends 'Plan B' tax hack|first=Peter|last=Spiegel|date=27 July 2015|work=|via=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday 14 August, the government (without Varoufakis) pushed successfully through parliament the third Greek bailout agreement. The bailout bill received 222 votes to 64 (as the conservative opposition voted in favour). Up to 40 Syriza members including Varoufakis voted against the bailout.{{r|guardianthrash}} Just prior to that vote, Varoufakis rose in parliament to offer the [[Prime Minister of Greece]] his resignation from his parliamentary seat, saying that this was the only way he knew how to combine his strong opposition to the new bailout with loyalty to the party and the prime minister. On 20 August, the prime minister himself resigned and called a [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|snap election]] due to the loss of support from rebelling [[Syriza]] MPs.{{r|quit}} Varoufakis had already declared that he was not interested in standing again for Syriza. At the same time, Syriza announced that any MP who voted against the bailout package would not be standing for the party. Varoufakis did not go on to represent [[Popular Unity (Greece)|Popular Unity]], unlike many of his ex-Syriza colleagues, as he considered the party too [[isolationism|isolationist]]. Varoufakis choose not to stand in the election, saying he would focus on creating European network that would 'restor[e] democracy' in Europe.{{r|network}} A month later, the national election was held and despite a low voter turnout, Tsipras and his Syriza Party won just over 35 percent of the vote. Combining with the [[Independent Greeks|Independent Greeks Party]], a majority was achieved and Tsipras was returned to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34307795|title=Greece election: Alexis Tsipras hails 'victory of the people'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on appointment===

The [[Adam Smith Institute]], a leading [[free-market]] [[think tank]] in the [[United Kingdom]],  "enthusiastically" supported Varoufakis's debt-swap plan and asked the then British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to support it. Varoufakis had proposed debt swap measures, including bonds pegged to economic growth, which would replace the existing bonds of the European bailout programme.&lt;ref name="City A.M."&gt;{{cite web|first=Guy |last=Bentley|title=Adam Smith Institute calls on Osborne to back Varoufakis's Greek debt-swap plan|url=http://www.cityam.com/208589/adam-smith-institute-calls-osborne-back-varoufakiss-greek-debt-swap-plan |work=cityam.com|quote=Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has found an enthusiastic backer for his debt restructuring plans in one of Britain's premier free-market think-tanks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] said that Varoufakis was a "brilliant economist", but he had difficult interactions with other politicians and the media.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg News"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Carol Matlack|title=Greece's New Finance Minister Is Brilliant.

== Later political career (2015–present) ==
In September 2015, Varoufakis appeared on the British topical debate show, ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', and was praised for his performance by Mark Lawson in ''[[The Guardian]]'', who wrote: "...several of the sentences he spoke in a second language were more impressive than most that his fellow panellists managed in their native tongue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/sep/25/question-time-review-yanis-varoufakis-wins-the-audience-vote|title = Question Time review – Yanis Varoufakis wins the audience vote|last = Lawson|first = Mark|date = 25 September 2015|work = The Guardian|access-date = 17 January 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on the show again in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-department-staffed-by-people-of-very-low-iq_uk_58094e2ae4b056572d81ff81|title = Brexit dept. staffed by people of "very low IQ" says Varoufakis|last = Gill|first = Martha|date = 21 October 2016|work = Huffington Post UK|access-date = 17 November 2017|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varoufakis attended an event in London hosted by ''The Guardian'' on 23 October 2015, where he spoke about the UK's upcoming [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|European Union membership referendum]]. He said that the UK should remain in the EU, but also campaign to democratise it: "My message is simple yet rich: those of us who disdain the democratic deficit in Brussels, those of us who detest the authoritarianism of a technocracy which is incompetent and contemptuous of democracy, those of us who are most critical of Europe have a moral duty to stay in Europe, fight for it, and democratise it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/24/eu-referendum-yanis-varoufakis-says-britons-should-vote-to-stay-in-union|title=EU referendum: Yanis Varoufakis says Britons should vote to stay in union|last=Keenan|first=John|date=24 October 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 March 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would return to the UK, in May 2016, in the final stages of the campaigning to again urge a remain vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/yanis-varoufakis-tour-urging-leftwingers-vote-stay-eu|title=Yanis Varoufakis to join tour urging leftwingers to vote to stay in EU|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=16 May 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 November 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 9 February 2016, Varoufakis launched the [[Democracy in Europe Movement 2025]] (DiEM25) at the [[Volksbühne]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/10/yanis-varoufakis-launches-pan-european-leftwing-movement-diem25|title=Yanis Varoufakis launches pan-European leftwing movement DiEM25|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|date=10 February 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2016, in reaction to tension between German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and the IMF, Varoufakis said there was underway "an attrition war between a reasonably numerate villain (the IMF) and a chronic procrastinator (Berlin)" as to Greek debt relief.

In April 2016, Varoufakis publicly supported the idea of a [[basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basicincome.org/news/2016/04/basic-income-essential-approach-varoufakis/|title=Varoufakis: Basic income is an essential approach for social democracy|date=4 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 Varoufakis announced the launch of his own political party MeRA 25, with a stated aim of freeing Greece from "debt bondage". He stated that he hoped the party would be based on an alliance of "people of the left and liberalism, greens and feminists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/26/greece-ex-minister-yanis-varoufakis-launches-political-party |title=Greek ex-minister Yanis Varoufakis launches political party |last=Smith |first=Helena |date=26 March 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party, whose name stands for "European Realistic Disobedience Front", is affiliated to DiEM 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/01/yanis-varoufakis-greece-is-a-debtors-prison-new-party-mera25 |title=Yanis Varoufakis: 'Greece is a debtors' prison' |last=Smith |first=Helena |date=1 April 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Varoufakis penned an op-ed piece in the Guardian about the need for an international progressive movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2018/sep/13/our-new-international-movement-will-fight-rising-fascism-and-globalists|title=Our new international movement will fight rising fascism and globalists {{!}} Yanis Varoufakis|last=Varoufakis|first=Yanis|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a similar piece by fellow progressive U.S. Senator [[Bernie Sanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2018/sep/13/bernie-sanders-international-progressive-front|title=A new authoritarian axis demands an international progressive front {{!}} Bernie Sanders|last=Sanders|first=Bernie|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of October, Varoufakis announced, in Rome, the official launch of Progressives International - described as a "common blueprint for an International [[New Deal]], a progressive New [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]]" - on November 30th in Sanders' home state of Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/26/sanders-and-varoufakis-announce-alliance-craft-common-blueprint-international-new|title=Sanders and Varoufakis Announce Alliance to Craft 'Common Blueprint for an International New Deal'|last=Corbett|first=Jessica|date=2018-10-26|work=Common Dreams|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/442390-sanders-varoufakis-team-up/|title=Berniefakis vs. Bannovini: Progressives unite to take down establishment, fend off Bannon &amp; Co|last=|first=|date=2018-10-26|work=RT International|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lesterfeder/bernie-sanders-yanis-varoufakis-european-spring-movement|title=Bernie Sanders Is Partnering With A Greek Progressive To Build A New Leftist Movement|last=Feder|first=J.

On the 25th of November 2018 Varoufakis was selected to head the list of [[Democracy in Motion|Democracy in Europe]] (the German section of [[Democracy in Europe Movement 2025|DiEM25]]) for the [[European Parliament election, 2019|2019 European elections]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-election-germany/greeces-varoufakis-to-run-in-european-election-in-germany-idUSKCN1NU0QA|title=Greece's Varoufakis to run in European election - in Germany|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Personal life==
Varoufakis is married to [[installation art]]ist [[Danae Stratou]] and has a daughter who is growing up in [[Sydney]], from his first marriage to academic Margarite Anagnostopoulou (Poulos).

==Works==
Varoufakis is the author of several books on the European debt crisis, the financial imbalance in the world and [[game theory]]. He is also a recognised speaker and often appears as an analyst for national news media.
A film is planned based on his book ''Adults in the Room'' directed by [[Costa-Gavras]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrysopoulos, Phillip. "Book to Big Screen." ''News from Greece'', 10 Oct. 2017, [http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/10/10/director-costa-gavras-to-take-varoufakis-book-to-big-screen/].&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|any English language?|date=December 2017}}

===''A Modest Proposal''===
In November 2010, he and [[Stuart Holland]], a former British Labour Party MP and economics professor at the [[University of Coimbra]] (Portugal), published ''A Modest Proposal,'' a set of economic policies aimed at overcoming the euro crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Yanis Varoufakis: ''[http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/euro-crisis/ Euro Crisis]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Version 4.0 of ''A Modest Proposal'' appeared with the American economist [[James K. Galbraith]] as a third co-author. This version was published in late 2013 in French with a supporting foreword by [[Michel Rocard]], former Prime Minister of France. {{As of|2011|9|since=y}}, Truman Factor features select articles by Varoufakis in English and in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Shorto]]: ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/the-way-greeks-live-now.html?_r=2&amp;exprod=myyahoo&amp;pagewanted=all The Way Greeks Live Now].'' In: ''[[The New York Times]].'' 13 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Global Minotaur''===
First published in 2011, ''The Global Minotaur'' constructs a historical narrative and metaphor which Varoufakis uses to describe the world economy from the mid-1970s to the 2008 crash and beyond. He argues that the global economy since the 1970s can be viewed as being built around the financing of the twin deficits of the United States – its trade deficit and government deficit. Varoufakis argues that the United States powered the global economy by consuming the exports of the rest of the world, and then the surpluses flowed back to the United States by going to institutions on Wall Street or being used to buy U.S Treasury debt. He suggests the recycling back to the U.S happened naturally due to the status of the dollar as the global reserve currency, and because of the profitability of U.S corporations and returns on Wall Street. However, when the U.S economy and banking system faltered in 2008, the United States' ability to consume vast quantities of imports decreased, and investing in Wall Street became a much less inviting prospect, so the system seized up. This explains why the 2008 recession was felt so heavily around the world. The metaphor of the Minotaur is used as Varoufakis characterizes the flows back to the U.S as a "tribute" to a great power.

===''The Globalizing Wall''===
In 2005 and 2006, Varoufakis travelled extensively with his partner, artist [[Danae Stratou]], along seven dividing lines around the world (in Palestine, Ethiopia-Eritrea, Kosovo, Belfast, Cyprus, Kashmir and the US–Mexico border). Stratou produced the installation ''CUT: 7 dividing lines,'' while Varoufakis wrote texts that then became a political-economic account of these divisions, entitled ''The Globalizing Wall.'' In 2010 Stratou and Varoufakis founded the project ''Vital Space.''&lt;ref&gt;Vital Space: ''[http://www.vitalspace.org/mission Mission]'' and ''[http://www.vitalspace.org/texts/biographies Biographies]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yellow Jack''''' is a 1934 [[docudrama]] play produced by [[Guthrie McClintic]] and a [[Yellow Jack|1938]] Hollywood movie by the same name. Both were co-written by [[Sidney Howard]] and [[Paul de Kruif]] (the former a [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]- and [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning playwright and screenwriter; the latter a well-known [[microbiologist]] and [[author]]). The play is the work of Sidney Howard and is based on a chapter in Paul de Kruif’s 1927 book ''Microbe Hunters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=De Kruif |first=Paul | title=Microbe Hunters | publisher=Jonathan Cape | year=1927 | ISBN=0156027771 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P7NCAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Stewart]] in his first dramatic role stars as Pvt. John O'Hara, a role reprised by [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] in the 1938 film.  Stewart later stated this role convinced him to continue his acting career during a time he recalled that "From 1932 through 1934...I'd only worked three months. Every play I got into folded."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Mark. ''Jimmy Stewart: A Biography''. New York: Random House, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-40005-222-6}} (pg. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; The experience led him to stay with acting and he first entered movies later that year in ''[[The Murder Man]]''. Caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]] while covering the play for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' drew his first of 13 drawings (and only one from a play) he made over the course of Stewart's career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alhirschfeldfoundation.org/piece/yellow-jack#result_info_7396&lt;/ref&gt;

The play opened at the opulent [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre|Martin Beck Theatre]] on March 6, 1934, and ran for 79 performances. The Martin Beck was renamed in 2003 for Al Hirschfeld, who drew the caricature for ''Yellow Jack''. Prior to its debut, [[Herman Bernstein]]'s ''[[Jewish Daily Bulletin]]'' covered the play, thereby giving it approval for not containing anti-semitic elements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/1934/03/06/archive/yellow-jack&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the high cost of [[Repertory theatre|repertory production]], in 1947 New York's American Repertory Theatre revived ''Yellow Jack'' for a four-week run at the International Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9903E1DE103EEE3BBC4F51DFB466838C659EDE&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
After the Spanish–American War, in which more U. S. soldiers were killed by yellow fever (known as Yellow Jack) than in battle, the War Department sent a medical commission to Cuba to find, if possible, the cause and cure of this deadly tropical disease. The commission was headed by Dr. [[Walter Reed]]. With him was Dr. [[James Carroll (scientist)|James Carroll]]. In Cuba they found Dr. [[Jesse Lazear]], European-trained microbiologist, and Cuban Dr. [[Aristides Agramonte]].

Limited in its experiments by the fact that animals are immune to Yellow Jack and embroiled in government interference, Reed decides that the only way to test the theory is to expose his own men to the disease.  Needing human volunteers, Private John O'Hara is willing to allow Dr, Reed to experiment on him.

==Reception==
Debuting on 6 Mar, 1934, the play ran through May for a modest 79 performances.  It generally received positive reviews, but the subject had limited popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the American Theatre&lt;/ref&gt;
