'''''A Nightmare on Elm Street''''' is a 2010 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Samuel Bayer]], and written by [[Wesley Strick]] and [[Eric Heisserer]]. The film stars [[Jackie Earle Haley]], [[Kyle Gallner]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[Kellan Lutz]]. It is the ninth film in [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|Elm Street franchise]], and a [[remake]] of [[Wes Craven]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|1984 film of the same name]]; produced by [[Michael Bay]] and [[Platinum Dunes]], it is designed to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]]. The film centers around a group of teenagers living on one street in a [[Fictional location|fictitious town]] of [[Ohio]] being stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named [[Freddy Krueger]], ultimately discovering they all share a common link from their childhood that is making them targets for Krueger.

''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was originally going to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', with the writers taking the best elements from each of the films in the original series and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a simple child killer. The decision was also made to bring Freddy's physical appearance closer to that of an actual burn victim, and the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] was used in certain sections of Haley's face to further assist in that vision. ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was primarily filmed in Illinois because of the positive experience the producers of Platinum Dunes had when filming other films in the same area.

Craven has expressed his displeasure with the remaking of his film, primarily because he was not consulted on the project as has been done on previous films of his that have been remade. [[Robert Englund]], who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy. ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was officially released in North America on April 30, 2010, and later released in foreign markets on May 8, 2010. The film was met with primarily negative reviews from film critics, as well as audience members who scored the film a "C+" according to [[CinemaScore]] polls. Regardless, ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film, and was able to gross more in its opening weekend than the entire theatrical gross for four other ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' films. The film has brought in over $63 million at the domestic box office, and over $115 million worldwide.

==Plot==
&lt;!--STOP. Wikipedia is not a substitute for watching a movie, and plot summaries should not contain every minor detail. They are here to SUMMARIZE the basic events. For a horror movie, we don't need to explain how every single character was killed, and what everyone is doing that isn't relevant to the overall plot. Thank you. !--&gt;
[[Tina Gray (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Kris Fowles|Kris Fowles]] goes to the Springwood Diner to meet with her friend, Dean Russell, who falls asleep at the table. In Dean's dream, he meets a severely burned man, who wears dirty fedora, red-and-green striped sweater, and a bladed gardener's glove on his right hand. He cuts Dean's throat but in reality, it appears that Dean did it himself as Kris and their classmate, waitress [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Nancy Holbrook|Nancy Holbrook]], look on. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die like Dean. Jesse Braun, Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in her blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having nightmares about the same man: [[Freddy Krueger]]. Jesse tells Nancy that they need to stop Krueger and warns her not to fall asleep then runs off.

Jesse is apprehended by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris. He tries not to fall asleep but failed and is killed by Krueger in his jail cell. With her friends dying, Nancy begins to question what everyone's connection is to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that all of them attended Badham Preschool. Nancy's mother, Gwen, reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a groundskeeper at the preschool, Fred Krueger, who was accused of abusing the children.  Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite, and that she came home one day telling her mother about the things Krueger did to her in a secret location. Gwen alerted the parents including Quentin's father Alan and Kris's mother Nora,  but she claims Krueger escaped before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. She discovers that all of the other kids have been killed, most of them in their sleep and after Jesse’s death, only she and Quentin are left.

Quentin tries to accept that his nightmares are nothing more than [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]], but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger: Everyone's parents tracked Krueger to an industrial park and burned him alive. Quentin and Nancy believe that Krueger, now a [[vengeful ghost]], wants revenge on them for lying as children. As a result of their [[insomnia]], they begin sporadically dreaming while they are still awake, experiencing [[microsleep]]s. To try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can. On the way, Nancy is attacked by Krueger after a microsleep episode, during which she pulls a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dreamworld and into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital; there, he steals some [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] to help them stay awake. At the preschool, they uncover Krueger's hidden room and evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children; he actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth.

Nancy decides the only way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and explains that he deliberately left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would be comatose. Quentin awakes and uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. They fight and Nancy uses a broken blade to kill him before she torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin safely escape. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror then disappears while Nancy screams.

''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was originally going to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements from each of the films and creating a single storyline with them.

===Development===
On January 29, 2008, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Michael Bay]] and his [[Platinum Dunes]] production company would be [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]] the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise with a [[remake]] of [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|the original 1984 film]].&lt;ref name="NightAnno"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=New Line sets up new 'Nightmare'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=January 29, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2008|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529175832/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807?refCatId=13|archivedate=May 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, producer Brad Fuller initially explained that they were following the same line they did with their [[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|''Friday the 13th'' remake&lt;!--STOP. Form and Fuller have consistently referred to the film as a "remake"!--&gt;]], by abandoning the things that made the character less scary—the film's antagonist, [[Freddy Krueger]], would not be "cracking jokes" as had become a staple of his character in later films—and focusing more on trying to craft a "horrifying movie". Fuller expressed how everyone at the studio loved the concept of being killed if you fell asleep. The producer stated that the film would be a remake of the 1984 film, but clarified that they would be borrowing certain character deaths and [[dream sequence]]s from the entire ''Nightmare'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=8835|title=Nightmare on Elm Street is Go, Shooting in Spring|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|date=December 11, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212163646/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=8835|archive-date=December 12, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Samuel Bayer]] was hired to direct the film.&lt;ref name="Director"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://riskybusiness.hollywoodreporter.com/2009/02/11/a-director-moves-onto-nightmare-on-elm-street/ |last=Zeitchik |first=Steven |title=A director moves onto (Nightmare on) Elm Street |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517041553/http://riskybusiness.hollywoodreporter.com/2009/02/11/a-director-moves-onto-nightmare-on-elm-street/ |archivedate=May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to New Line production chief Toby Emmerich, Michael Bay advocated heavily for Bayer's hiring, as Bay, Bayer, and director [[David Fincher]] came up as commercial directors together. It is Bay's opinion that Bayer had "the ability to capture the kind of seductive and unsettling imagery that would make ''Nightmare'' feel like a fresh, visually arresting moviegoing experience".&lt;ref name="LAint"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-bigpicture14-2009jul14,0,698071.story|title='Nightmare on Elm Street' returns|last=Goldstein|first=Patrick|date=July 14, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer declined Platinum Dunes' offer; twice. It was not until Bay sent the director an email "talking about the business", and explaining what kind of opportunity it would be for Bayer that he finally agreed.&lt;ref name="Bayerint"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=14330|title=1:1 With Nightmare on Elm Street's Sam Bayer|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline|date=March 2, 2010|accessdate=March 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306114246/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=14330|archive-date=March 6, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|style="text-align: left;" |— Samuel Bayer on remaking ''A Nightmare on Elm Street''.&lt;ref name="Bayerint"/&gt;
|}
In a June 9, 2009 interview, Craven expressed his displeasure in the remaking of his 1984 film, primarily because the filmmakers chose not to have him as a consultant to the film, unlike with the 2009 remake ''[[The Last House on the Left (2009 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' where he "shepherd[ed] it towards production".&lt;ref name="Cravenint"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parfitt|first=Orlando|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/992/992845p1.html|title=Craven's Elm Street Nightmare Exclusive: Original director angry over remake.|work=[[IGN Entertainment]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=June 9, 2009|accessdate=June 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612044359/http://movies.ign.com/articles/992/992845p1.html|archivedate=June 12, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Robert Englund]], who portrayed Freddy throughout the film series, felt it was time for ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' to be remade. Englund liked the idea of being able to "exploit the dreamscape" with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and other technologies that did not exist when Craven was making the original ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' in 1984.&lt;ref name="Englundint"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCabe|first=Joseph|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b15904_exclusive_robert_englund_on_jackie.html|title=Robert Englund on Jackie Earle Haley and the 'Nightmare' Remake!|work=[[FEARnet]]|publisher=Horror Entertainment|date=June 27, 2009|accessdate=June 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701121100/http://www.fearnet.com/news/b15904_exclusive_robert_englund_on_jackie.html|archivedate=July 1, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Bayer believed that the film is designed to pay homage to what Craven did in 1984, but not replicate it entirely. Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films, and that the character of Freddy Krueger was one that affected the lives of a certain generation of people. For Bayer, remaking ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was about bringing that feeling to a new generation, with a new spin on the character and story.&lt;ref name="Bayerint"/&gt;

Fuller and Form likened the new ''Nightmare'' film to their [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|2003 remake]] of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', and retracted an earlier statement when they said they did not plan to "cherry pick" the best elements of the franchise, like they did with the reboot of the ''Friday the 13th'' franchise they released in 2009. Instead, the 2010 film is more of a reimagining.&lt;ref name="setpreview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|title=Set Visit Preview: A Nightmare on Elm Street|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723081206/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|archive-date=July 23, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair also explained that ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' would have a different tone than the ''Friday the 13th'' remake. Form states, "I think a ''Friday the 13th'' movie like we made was really fun. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll, and I think a ''Nightmare'' movie is not that."&lt;ref name="SiFi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/07/join-us-behind-the-scenes.php|title=UPDATED: Behind the scenes of the new Nightmare on Elm Street|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|date=July 22, 2009|work=[[Sci-Fi Wire]]|publisher=[[SyFy]]|accessdate=July 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104221257/http://blastr.com/2009/07/join-us-behind-the-scenes.php|archivedate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked why New Line was rebooting the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series, Emmerich explained, "The ''Nightmare'' films are profoundly disturbing on a deep, human level because they're about our dreams. It's why we thought that we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture."&lt;ref name="LAint"/&gt; Overall, Bayer wanted to create a darker ''Nightmare on Elm Street'', one he felt would fit into what he describes as "a darker world". Bayer said there is subtext within the film, which is designed to get the audience to ask, "What makes a monster?" Bayer wants the audience to think about whether a monster is something that exists purely from a physical appearance—someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove on their hand—or can a monster be something that is deeper, and within the man himself without a scarred face and bladed glove?&lt;ref name="Rotint"/&gt;

===Writing===
Wesley Strick was initially hired to pen a script for a new ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'', after he impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''; the film was never produced. Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick's script before the film moved into production.&lt;ref name="LAint"/&gt; When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer, and which still "needed to be tinkered with". Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into "[Freddy] as a person [and] how he became the thing he was". Bayer expressed that, unlike the ''Friday the 13th'' remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the ''Nightmare'' remake is coming straight from the first film.&lt;ref name="Bayerint"/&gt; At one point there was a scene in an early draft of the script where some characters were playing ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Fuller explained that the scene was removed to keep the film from feeling dated. To him, if someone watched the film five years later, and ''Guitar Hero'' was not as popular as it once was, it would automatically make the film feel more dated upon viewing. At the same time, they wanted the film to feel relevant, and including things like the Internet, mobile phones, and text messaging would give the film a more timeless feel.&lt;ref name="Bloodint"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19996|title=Producer Brad Fuller Talks 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'|author=Chris Eggertsen|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=The Collective|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the remake, Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened.&lt;ref name="Bloodint"/&gt; In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19219|title=Set Visit: A Trip to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' Part One|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=The Collective|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed Robert Englund would not reprise the role of Freddy Krueger for the remake; Englund had performed the role for the eight previous films.&lt;ref name="Director"/&gt; On April 3, 2009 ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported that [[Jackie Earle Haley]] was cast to take over Englund's most well-known role.&lt;ref name="Haleyanno"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rich|first=Joshua|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/04/nightmare-haley.html|title='Nightmare on Elm Street' reboot: Jackie Earle Haley to play Freddy Krueger|work=Hollywood Insider|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=April 4, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405090144/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/04/nightmare-haley.html|dead-url=yes|archivedate=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the studio wanted to cast an unknown for the role of Freddy Krueger, but it was Haley's performance in ''[[Little Children (film)|Little Children]]'' that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions. Emmerich explained, "Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger, but he also has a hint of vulnerability, and Jackie really has all of that and more. He just seemed completely right for the part."&lt;ref name="LAint"/&gt; Bayer stated that he and producers Form and Fuller managed to acquire the screen test Haley gave as Rorschach for ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''; after viewing it, Bayer said it "blew [his] mind", and that he knew Haley would be able to go deep and create a believable character who was a "[psychopath] with a burned face and a claw".&lt;ref name="Bayerint"/&gt;

Haley said the first time he heard his name mentioned in conjunction with the character was from people suggesting his casting on the internet, which he appreciated, and then later learned that his agents were already in talks with Brad Fuller.&lt;ref name="MTVint"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1625034/story.jhtml|title='Nightmare On Elm Street' New Freddy Krueger Thanks Fans For Casting|last=Carroll|first=Larry|work=MTV|publisher=[[Viacom]]|date=October 31, 2009|accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haley stated that he was apprehensive about taking on the role of a character with such a dark past—that of a child murderer—for about a "minute and a half". Knowing the Freddy Krueger in the remake would be even darker, Haley came to the realization quickly that at the end of the day he is doing a horror film, and this is just a fictional character. Haley said that once he embraced the idea of Freddy just being a "mythical boogeyman", it became "very freeing" for him as an actor.&lt;ref name="Rotint"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=15025|title=Video Interviews: A Nightmare on Elm Street|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline|date=April 29, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504051934/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=15025|archive-date=May 4, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallner described his character as "a mess, more jittery and more 'out there' than Nancy is".&lt;ref name="prodnote"/&gt; Gallner pointed out that his character is like this because of the amount of pharmaceuticals he ingests to stay awake. Producer Brad Fuller commented that Gallner brought a sense of "humanity and relatability" to the role with his compassion and intellect.&lt;ref name="prodnote"/&gt; Other cast members include [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[Kellan Lutz]]. Cassidy performed the role of Kris. According to Cassidy, Kris becomes an emotional wreck throughout the film. Cassidy described her character's ordeal: "She is literally dragged through hell, having to crawl through dark, claustrophobic tunnels. She's always crying and freaking out as her nightmares of Freddy bleed into her everyday life. Kris suspects there's something that connects her with the others; she even confronts her mother about it, but no one's talking."&lt;ref name="prodnote"/&gt;

Dekker portrays Jesse, Kris's ex-boyfriend. According to Dekker, "Jesse kind of knows what's going on but refuses to believe it."&lt;ref name="prodnote"/&gt; Dekker explained that Jesse spends so much time trying to convince himself that Freddy is not real, that by the time he does meet Freddy face-to-face, "he's just a mess..

===Krueger's design===
[[File:Freddyremake.jpg|thumb|Haley wore prosthetic appliances on his face that were blended together to appear seamless and designed to look close to an actual burn victim. [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] was used on portions of his face—like his cheek—that appear open.]]
Discussing his physical appearance, Form and Fuller explained that Freddy would be more similar to a real burn victim.&lt;ref name="SiFi"/&gt; Form later clarified that there was a fine line they did not want to cross when it came to making Freddy look like a true burn victim. According to the producer, the crew had many reference photos of actual victims, which detailed how white the skin would appear after healing. Form did not want the audience to turn away in disgust every time Freddy was on the screen, so they opted to hold back on some of the realism. Fuller noted how horrific the images were, and how difficult they were to look at.&lt;ref name="Shockset"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14163|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|title=Set Visit: A Nightmare Reborn on Elm Street|publisher=CraveOnline|work=Shock Till You Drop|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate=May 2, 2010|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202163943/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14163|archivedate=February 2, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special effects crew that worked on ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', creating the computer-generated images (CGI) for [[Two-Face]]'s face, were brought in to work on the minimal CGI used for Freddy's face. The CGI is used in conjunction with the special effects make-up that Haley wears.&lt;ref name="Rotint"/&gt; The prosthetics used to create Freddy's physical look were designed by Andrew Clement. Haley described the experience of wearing all of the prosthetics and make-up as "pretty encumbering".&lt;ref name="fearint"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b18350_Jackie_Earle_Haley_Talks_Playing_Freddy_Krueger.html|title=Jackie Earle Haley Talks Playing Freddy Krueger|work=FEARnet|publisher=Horror Entertainment|last=Raffel|first=Lawrence P.|date=March 3, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2010|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120405123611/http://www.fearnet.com/news/b18350_Jackie_Earle_Haley_Talks_Playing_Freddy_Krueger.html|archivedate=April 5, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When production first started, Clement and his crew would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process.&lt;ref name="Shockset"/&gt; According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head all the way down his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four-and-a-half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of.&lt;ref name="fearint"/&gt; Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's "voice" for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just "sitting around the table and going, 'Let me try this voice and this voice'". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a "supernatural quality" and get it away from the voice Haley used as [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] in ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''.&lt;ref name="SDCC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=11247|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|title=SDCC Press Conference: A Nightmare on Elm Street|publisher=Crave Online Media|work=Shock Till You Drop|date=July 30, 2009|accessdate=April 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008181750/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=11247|archive-date=October 8, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum Dunes also received a thirty percent tax break for filming in the state. For a representation of human version of Krueger, the producers were looking for locations that were "old and decaying". They settled on the Ryerson Steel warehouse on the West Side of Chicago. The warehouse became the central location for the scenes involving the townspeople burning Krueger alive.&lt;ref name="10quest"&gt;{{cite news|last=Arroyave|first=Luis|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-091030-nightmare-elm-questions-pictures,0,6957467.photogallery|title=10 questions about new 'Nightmare on Elm Street' answered|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=March 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103095524/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-091030-nightmare-elm-questions-pictures,0,6957467.photogallery|archive-date=November 3, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Line contracted with two high schools in Illinois, [[Elk Grove High School (Elk Grove Village, Illinois)|Elk Grove High School]] and [[John Hersey High School]], to use their location for scenes in the remake. According to Principal Nancy Holman, of Elk Grove High, the studio contacted schools across the nation looking for one that had a swimming pool. Although filming took place at both schools, neither was identified by name. The studio also cast 200 extras for various school scenes, including one in the pool, but required that all auditioning students be at least 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zalusky|first=Steve|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=289286|title=Freddie's coming to Elk Grove, Hersey high schools|work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|publisher=Paddock Publications|date=April 27, 2009|accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; School board President Lenore Gonzales Bragaw was initially apprehensive about the deal, as she disliked the idea of the studio filming "scenes of violence" at the schools; Bragaw agreed to the filming after being assured that no one would be killed during the swimming scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graydon Megan and John Keilman|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-talk-nightmare-follomay01,0,7725616.story|title=Chicago school district won't look a gift 'Nightmare' in the mouth|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|date=May 1, 2009|accessdate=May 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504135854/http://www.chicagotribune.com:80/entertainment/chi-talk-nightmare-follomay01,0,7725616.story|archive-date=May 4, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2009, the ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film crew went on location to the city of [[Gary, Indiana]] to film scenes at a Methodist church. The studio negotiated with the city for months before finally settling on a deal. According to Ben Clement, the executive director of the Gary Office of Film and Television, the studio was looking for "an architectural style that would fit the storyline of the film". The film crew returned to Gary in June to film a dream sequence that takes place on Elm Street in one of the local streets, and in December some new scenes were shot in a diner, with new characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.thetimesonline.com/articles/2009/05/21/updates/breaking_news/doc4a158020018cd165290762.txt|title=Gary set to be backdrop for scenes in Freddy Krueger remake|work=The Times |publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/105/1053106p1.html|title=Freddy's Nightmare Continues: Casting call notice online for additional Elm Street filming|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=[[IGN Entertainment]]|publisher=News Corporation|date=December 8, 2009|accessdate=December 28, 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710061447/http://movies.ign.com/articles/105/1053106p1.html|archivedate=July 10, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fuller and Form, Warner Bros. suggested ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' be released in 3-D, with the recent surge in 3-D films showing increased box office revenue. In the opinion of the Platinum Dunes producers, if a film is not initially conceived as 3-D then it should not be converted to 3-D. In other words, given that the original ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was not a 3-D film, Fuller and Form fought with the studio to keep the remake from being converted to 3-D. The producers note that at the end of the day, Warner Bros. and Platinum Dunes came to the agreement that presenting the film in 3-D would not be presenting "the best version of the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/04/26/exclusive-interview-producers-andrew-form-and-brad-fuller-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-plus-updates-on-monster-squad-ouija-friday-the-13th-2-and-the-nightmare-blu-ray-will-have-a-6-minute-alternat/|title=Exclusive Interview: Platinum Dunes Producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller ''A Nightmare on Elm Street''|publisher=Collider|date=April 26, 2010|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">[[File:Three Men's Morris variant board.svg|thumb|'''Achi''' gameboard]]
'''Achi''' is a two-player [[abstract strategy game]] from [[Ghana]].  It is related to [[tic-tac-toe]], but even more related to [[Three Men's Morris]], [[Nine Holes]], [[Tant Fant]], [[Shisima]], and [[Dara (game)|Dara]], because pieces are moved on the board to create the 3-in-a-row.  Achi is an alignment game.

There are two versions of this game.  In one version, each player has four pieces to drop. This is the version described below.  In another version, each player has only three pieces to drop, which makes it identical to Three Men's Morris.

== Equipment ==
A 3×3 board is used.  Three horizontal lines form the three rows. Three vertical lines form the three columns.  Two diagonal lines connect the two opposite corners of the board.  The board is easily drawn on the ground or paper.

Each player has four pieces.  One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces; however, any two colors or distinguishable objects will suffice.

== Rules and gameplay ==
# The players take turns to place one of their counters on a point where lines join.  
# When all eight counters have been placed, each player can move along a line to an adjacent empty point.

The winner is the first player to create a 3-in-a-row of one's counters either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

'''Ask a Stupid Question Day''' is a [[holiday]] that is sometimes celebrated in the [[United States]], usually by school [[student]]s and [[teacher]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goofball.com/news/20010906_bizarre Bizarre National Holidays - Goofball.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080823/http://www.goofball.com/news/20010906_bizarre |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ask a Stupid Question Day's default date is September 28, in practice it is usually observed on the last school day of September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/yourlife/gallery/stupid_question/ Suggestions for 'Ask a stupid question day' - Boston.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
This holiday was created by teachers in the 1980s to encourage students to ask more questions in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.yahoo.com/thespark/8541/ask-a-stupid-question-day/ Ask a Stupid Question Day - The Spark of Yahoo!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121022824/http://dir.yahoo.com/thespark/8541/ask-a-stupid-question-day/ |date=November 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to HolidayInsights.com, "at the time, there was a movement by teachers to try to get kids to ask more questions in the classroom. Kids sometimes hold back, fearing their question is stupid, and asking it will result in ridicule."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holidayinsights.com/moreholidays/September/stupidquestionday.htm Holiday Insights : May 4 Holiday - Ask a Stupid Question Day&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International==
In 2009 ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that the day was being celebrated in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chivers|first=Tom|title=Ask A Stupid Question Day comes to British schools|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6238694/Ask-A-Stupid-Question-Day-comes-to-British-schools.html|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported as far afield as India, in ''[[The Hindu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gayathri|first=Krishnan|title=What’s the question?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/whats-the-question/article5185324.ece|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asociación de Mujeres Meretrices de Argentina''' (AMMAR) is the union of sex workers in Argentina. It is responsible for defending their rights and ensuring the interests of sex workers. It is affiliated with the CTA (Central de Trabajadores Argentinos). Among its demands is the decriminalization of abortion.

==History==
===Beginning===
The organization was founded and incorporated in March 1995 to the Central de los Trabajadores Argentinos. The Embassy of the Netherlands in the city of Buenos Aires contributed to the installation of the office that the union currently has within the building of the CTA.

In the international arena, starting in 1997 and on the basis of contacts with different organizations nearby, the Sexual Workers Network of Latin America and the Caribbean was created; In it, organizations and focal points of the different countries of the continent are articulated. [[Elena reynaga|Elena Reynaga]], as representative of Ammar, chairs this network.

Ammar's action contributed to the repeal of police edicts and the decriminalization of street prostitution in the city of Buenos Aires for a brief period, until the reform of Article 71 of the Contraventional Code on March 4, 1999, which again sanctioned the offer of sex on public roads in certain cases.

===The murder of Sandra Cabrera===
On January 27, 2004, [[Sandra Cabrera]], general secretary of AMMAR in Rosario, was murdered. Cabrera had filed complaints against some local police officers, accusing them of corruption and asking for money from local sex workers in exchange for letting them work. For this reason she received threats, both against her and her daughter. In November 2003 she was brutally beaten inside her home and threatened to stop reporting. She was shot in the head two months after. Her body was found near the bus terminal in Rosario.

===Present===
In 2003, [[Elena Reynaga]], Secretary General of Ammar, was in charge of closing the "II Meeting on HIV / AIDS in Latin America and the Caribbean," which was held in Cuba. Currently, the union has representation in more than half of the provinces of Argentina and its General Secretary is Georgina Orellano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parabuenosaires.com/georgina-orellano-los-19-elegi-el-trabajo-sexual-por-el-dinero-que-reditua/|title=Georgina Orellano: "A los 19 elegí el trabajo sexual por el dinero que reditúa" - Noticias de Buenos Aires|date=14 August 2014|website=Parabuenosaires.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the Contraventional and Misdemeanor Criminal Justice of the City of Buenos Aires, with the ruling of Court No. 8 by Dr. Natalia Molina, recognized sex work as an illegal activity, condemned the prosecution of sex workers and urged the government to regulate the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.minutouno.com/notas/357690-la-justicia-portena-reconocio-el-trabajo-sexual-y-prohibio-la-ciudad-multar-las-mujeres-que-lo-ejercen|title=Justicia reconoció el trabajo sexual y prohibió multar a quienes lo ejercen|website=Minutouno.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diarioveloz.com/notas/141056-la-justicia-la-ciudad-buenos-aires-reconocio-el-trabajo-sexual|title=La justicia de la ciudad de Buenos Aires reconoció el trabajo sexual|website=Diarioveloz.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammar.org.ar/IMG/pdf/fallo_camila.pdf|format=PDF|title=Acta De Audiencia|website=Ammar.org|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The [[capitalism|capitalist]] nation of Randa has long had a history of excellence in the creation of [[aircraft]], attracting the best of engineers in [[aerodynamics]], [[artillery]], and structuring from the world over. Once, even this interest had waned, until the creation of the air show Bakraid, in which the capabilities of the fighters could be demonstrated outside of simulations for all to see.

Around the time of the seventh Bakraid, a nearby nation, Deneb, had attained an expansionist attitude, forcibly subjugating and [[annexation|annexing]] several of its neighbors with the assistance of the Shtarterra Security Council. Recently, Deneb has asked to participate in Bakraid. Randa's defense council, perfectly aware that this is just a pretext for Deneb to get its and the SSC's engines of war into Randan borders and more easily prosecute their war from there, give their blessing. However, the council secretly contacts the other Bakraid participants, offering even more prize money than normal if they will perform in a special version of Bakraid—genuine war conditions. In other words, use their own top-of-the-line planes to shatter Deneb's schemes. In all, nine pilots accept this plan, and begin Bakraid two weeks early to catch Deneb unaware...

* '''Training''': There are less enemies and bullets, and player's fighter automatically uses a bomb when being hit. The game ends after 4 stages.
* '''Normal''': A course of medium difficulty with 6 stages.
* '''Advance''': A course with 8 stages, with increased enemy firing rate and bullet density.
* '''Special/Only Boss''': When selected without specifying stage or boss, player plays a course consists of all the boss segments of all stages. When specifying a stage or boss (by pressing left or right), player plays a course consists of the selected stage or boss twice, with second trial featuring increased difficulty. Special can be unlocked either by entering code a special code at the title screen or clearing the Advance game. However, clearing Advance game does not unlock the Special course permanently.

After choosing Normal or Advance course, Stage Edit mode allows player to choose the sequence of stages 2–5 from a set of 4 stages.

In Special/Only Boss mode, an additional Stage I is included, which consists of mid-boss battle in Cloud stage (Stage 6).

===Fighters===
There are initially 4 fighters, with extra fighters available by using unlock codes (up to 9 fighters). Pressing different buttons when choosing a fighter can alter a fighter's ability:
* Main shot power type: Press A button
* Bomber power type: Press B button
* Side shot power type: Press C button
* Speed up type: Press Start button

When using Team Edit, player can choose different fighters for successive lives after the initial fighter is destroyed. If Team Edit is unavailable, it can be unlocked by inserting a coin and press Up, Down, Up, Down Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, Start before timer passes 10.

Fighter's rapid fire rate can be increased by holding C then press A when inside a stage, or decreased by holding C then press B when inside a stage.
* Sky Dragon ([[Scha Al-Yahya]])
* Saber Tiger ([[Siti Elizad]])
* Lightning Wolf ([[Lisa Surihani]])
* Hammer Shark ([[Ayda Jebat]])

====Phase 2 fighters====
* Flame Viper ([[Sazzy Falak]])
* Steel Bat ([[Yasmin Hani]])
* Solid Ray ([[Diana Danielle]])

====Phase 3 fighters====
* Buster Lizard ([[Daiyan Trisha]])
* Blade Owl ([[Janna Nick]])

===Medal system===
Some enemies drop [[medal]]s when destroyed. In addition, medal can also be found in neutral background objects when destroyed. The medal initially worth 100 points, but the value increases when player collects all on-screen medals without missing any before another medal is revealed, up to 10000 points. When a medal is missed, the next revealed medal is worth 100 points. If there are multiple on-screen medals, player can restore medal level after missing a medal by collecting the remaining highest value medal on-screen without missing further medals, before revealing any other medal.

===Multiplier system===
Whenever a player's fighter destroys a large enemy, a score multiplier is set. The multiplier doubles every time a large enemy is destroyed before timer reaches 0, for up to 64. The multiplier timer increases whenever a large enemy is destroyed. When multiplier is in effect and the player's medal level is already at 10000 points, revealing medal causes 100000-point medal to appear instead. When multiplier timer reaches 0, the score multiplier effect simply disappears.

===Rank===
Bakraid features a dynamically adjusting rank system that makes the game harder, similar to the rank system in Armed Police Batrider and Battle Garegga. The rank increases when the player collects items, fires its weapons, or uses its bombs. The rank will only decrease when the player grazes bullets or loses lives. In Bakraid, it's easier to graze bullets and survive than in Batrider since the player sprites are larger in comparison to their hitbox.

Bakraid has a fixed moderate starting rate at the beginning of the game compared to the high starting rank of Batrider and the minimum starting rank of Battle Garegga. Still, it's no surprise players would suicide or graze bullets to decrease the rank for the game.

As rank increases, more bullets spawn, some bullets move faster, attack patterns are generally trickier to negotiate, and enemies gain health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7004">'''Beatrice Sparks''' (January 15, 1917 &amp;ndash; May 25, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[therapist]] and [[Mormon]] youth counselor who was known for producing books purporting to be the "real diaries" of troubled teenagers. The books deal with topical issues such as [[drug abuse]], [[Satanism]], [[teenage pregnancy]] or [[AIDS]], and are presented as cautionary tales. Although Sparks presented herself as merely the discoverer and editor of the diaries, records at the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] show that in fact she is listed as the sole author for all but two of them.

==Biography==
Beatrice Ruby Mathews Sparks was born in [[Custer County, Idaho|Goldburg, Custer County, Idaho]] and grew up in [[Logan, Utah]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|newspaper=Daily Herald|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/lifestyles/announcements/obituaries/beatrice-ruby-mathews-sparks/article_eb441cc1-02b8-5e10-870e-c39fc28b319e.html|title=Beatrice Ruby Mathews Sparks|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began working with teenagers in 1955, after attending the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] and [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref name="kos"&gt;"[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/02/08/1268810/-Books-So-Bad-They-re-Good-Go-Ask-Anonymous Books So Bad They're Good: Go Ask Anonymous]", ''Daily KOS'', February 8, 2014. Accessed May 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as a [[music therapy|music therapist]] at Utah State Mental Hospital and taught [[continuing education]] courses at BYU.

Critics have questioned Sparks's qualifications and experience.&lt;ref name="nilsen"&gt;Alleen Pace Nilsen, "The House That Alice Built", ''School Library Journal'', October 1979, pp. 109-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have been unable to find a record of the Ph.D. she claimed on book jackets and in her résumé.&lt;ref name="kos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nilsen"/&gt; One interviewer wrote that Sparks was "vague about specifics" when asked about her counselling qualifications and professional experience.&lt;ref name="nilsen"/&gt;

Sparks stated that her experiences working with troubled adolescents made her want to produce cautionary tales that would keep other teens from falling into the same traps. Her first work, ''[[Go Ask Alice]]'', was published under the byline "Anonymous" in 1971. In interviews conducted over the next few years, Sparks identified herself as the book's editor and related that ''Alice'' consisted partly of the actual diary of a troubled teen, and partly of fictional events based on Sparks's experiences working with other teens.&lt;ref name="nilsen"/&gt; Sparks was unable to produce the original diary for critics.&lt;ref name="yagoda"&gt;Ben Yagoda, ''Memoir: A History''. New York: Riverhead Books, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions of the book contained the standard disclaimer: "This book is a work of fiction. Any references to historical events, real people, or real locales are used fictitiously. Other names, places, characters, and incidents are the product of the author's imagination, and any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental."&lt;ref name="yagoda"/&gt;

In 1973, after the publication of ''Go Ask Alice,'' Marcella Barrett, a [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]] woman, approached Sparks to edit the journal of Barrett's deceased son Alden. Alden had suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]] and committed suicide at age sixteen and Barrett felt that his story might help other at-risk teens. The result was ''Jay's Journal,'' which tells the story of a teenage boy drawn into Satanism. Barrett's family was horrified by the book.&lt;ref name="kos"/&gt; They insisted that Alden had never been involved with the occult and that Sparks had used only 21 entries from his journal (out of 212 supposed entries that appeared in the finished book).&lt;ref name="kos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yagoda"/&gt; Sparks defended the book, claiming she got the extra material from letters and interviews with Alden's friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2004/feat_2004-06-03.cfm |author=Ben Dieterle |work=[[Salt Lake City Weekly]] |date=June 3, 2004 |title=Teen Death Diary |accessdate=July 23, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040723080129/http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2004/feat_2004-06-03.cfm |archivedate=July 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Jay's Journal,'' Sparks produced many more "real diaries," including ''It Happened to Nancy: By an Anonymous Teenager'' (dealing with AIDS), ''[[Almost Lost: The True Story of an Anonymous Teenager's Life on the Streets]]'' (gang violence), ''Annie's Baby: The Diary of Anonymous, A Pregnant Teenager'', ''Treacherous Love: The Diary of an Anonymous Teenager'' (pupil seduced by teacher), ''Kim: Empty Inside: The Diary of an Anonymous Teenager'' ([[eating disorder]]s) and ''Finding Katie: The Diary of Anonymous, A Teenager in Foster Care''.

==Bibliography==

===Diaries===

All these books were published with the byline 'Anonymous'. Some of them credit Sparks as editor; others (such as ''Go Ask Alice'') do not mention her at all. ''Almost Lost'' and ''Kim: Empty Inside'' are the only books for which Sparks does not claim copyright as author of the entire work. For both these books, Sparks lays claim only to the editing, compilation and some (unspecified) additional material. The U.S. Copyright Office record for ''Kim'' adds the note that some material is taken from a preexisting diary.

[[Image:Stage Layout Plan.jpg|thumb|right|Areas of a typical (proscenium) stage.]]  

[[File:SNL stage.jpg|thumb|right|''SNL''{{'}}s main stage, during rehearsal, 2008]]

In [[theatre]], a '''box set''' is a set with a [[proscenium]] arch stage and three walls. The proscenium opening is the [[fourth wall]]. Box sets create the illusion of an interior room on the stage, and are contrasted with earlier forms of sets in which sliding flats with gaps between them created an illusion of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76335/box-set|title=box set (theatre)|year=2009|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Box sets were introduced to the English theatre by [[Elizabeth Vestris]]. They were popularized by [[Marie Wilton]] at the [[Scala Theater|Prince of Wales's Royal Theater]]. They later became a feature of [[Realism (arts)|realist theatre]], and an example of the "fourth wall removed" principle that characterized the work of noted realists such as [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Émile Zola]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[Anton Chekhov]].

In the play style of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]], the box set of the stage was a room with either a plain black backdrop or three walls. The fourth wall was invisible, separating the characters from the audience, and the ceiling was tilted down at the far end of the stage and up toward the audience. Doors slammed instead of swinging when being shut, as in reality.

'''''Clumsy Thief''''' is a card game published by the company Melon Rind. The game was created by Jeanie Mehran in an effort to help her son with his [[addition]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;http://toysaretools.com/2014/03/state-test-taking-tips-ELA-Math.html&lt;/ref&gt; Clumsy Thief won several game awards including Academics' Choice,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academicschoice.com/games/clumsy-thief.php&lt;/ref&gt; Major Fun Award &lt;ref&gt;http://www.majorfun.com/?s=Clumsy+Thief+game&amp;x=13&amp;y=12&lt;/ref&gt; and Parents' Choice Award &lt;ref&gt;http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=32195&amp;StepNum=1&amp;award=aw 2013-10&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013.

==Cards==
84 Money cards, 6 Thief cards and 4 Jail cards

==The game==

===Objective===
The objective is to have the most money at the end of the game. Players get money by making or stealing money stacks. Players lose money if their stacks are stolen.

===Setup===
Each player is dealt seven cards face down that they pick up and review.

===Game play===
Players with two cards in their hand that add exactly to $100 must place them face up with one card on top of the other, creating a money stack. After all players have built their stacks and placed them on the table the stealing begins. On "Go" all players steal money stacks from other players using the cards in their hands.

===Money cards===
Players may steal a money stack from any player if they have a card that adds up to $100 when added to the top card of that stack. After placing the card on top, players slide the whole stack to their side of the table.

===Thief cards===
A Thief card let players steal any money stack from any player. It can also steal money stacks stolen by another thief.

===Jail cards===
A Jail card tops only a Thief card and takes the whole stack. Players can also top their own Thief card to prevent other players from stealing their stack.

===Ending the round===
When the stealing is over, each player takes another card and adds it to their hand. On "Go" a new round of stacking and stealing begins.

===Ending the game===
The game is over the instant any player is out of cards or there aren't enough new cards for every player. Anyone still holding cards turns them face down and discards them. Players add their cards. Money cards are worth their dollar value. Thief, Jail and discarded cards have no value. The player with the most money wins.

'''Cookie Jar Group''' was a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[media (communication)|media]] production and distribution company. The company was first established in 1976 as '''Cinar''', a [[Montreal]]-based studio that was heavily involved in children's entertainment. The company's business model, which included the licensing of its properties into educational markets, had a significant impact on its success; by 1999, Cinar held CDN$1.5 billion of the overall children's television market.&lt;ref name="gandm-manwhobroughtdown"&gt;{{cite web|title=The MAN who Brought Down CINAR|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-man-who-brought-down-cinar/article18423411/?page=all|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, Cinar became the subject of multiple business scandals, including accusations that the company had used offshore accounts to transfer money out of the company, had plagiarized the concept of one of its series, and had obfuscated the involvement of American screenwriters in its productions in order to continue receiving Canadian [[tax credit]]s for domestic productions. Over a decade later, these scandals would result in criminal charges, convictions, and fines for co-founder Ronald Weinberg, and three other suspects.

Cinar was sold in 2004 for [[Canadian dollar|$]]190 million to a group led by [[Nelvana]] founder [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]], and re-named Cookie Jar Group. The company went to acquire the [[United States|American]] animation studio [[DiC Entertainment]] in 2008. On August 20, 2012, [[DHX Media]] announced its intent to acquire Cookie Jar Group, in a deal that would make DHX the largest independent owner of children's television programming. The sale completed on October 22, 2012. Cookie Jar Group continues to operate as an in-name-only unit of DHX Media.

==History==
===Cinar===
[[File:CINAR.PNG|thumb|right|Cinar's logo variation used in the early 2000s.]]
After their 1976 meeting in [[New Orleans]], future spouses [[Micheline Charest]] and Ronald A. Weinberg organized an event for a women's film festival, and worked at distributing foreign films to US theatres. The couple moved to [[New York City]] and formed Cinar, a film and television distribution company.

In 1984, Cinar changed their focus from media distribution to production and moved operations to [[Montreal]], where they concentrated on children's television programming (including ''[[Animal Crackers (TV series)|Animal Crackers]]'', ''[[Emily of New Moon (TV series)|Emily of New Moon]]'', ''[[Mona the Vampire]]'', and ''[[The Wombles (1996 TV series)|The Wombles]]''), as well as the English and French dubs of the [[anime]] series ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1986 TV series)|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and the Spain-originating TV series ''[[The World of David the Gnome]]'', and the English dub of ''[[Ultra Seven]]''. As a production company, Cinar was also involved in the work of ''[[Are You Afraid of the Dark?]]'', ''[[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]]'', ''[[Madeline#Television|Madeline]]'', ''[[The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Paddington Bear]]'', ''[[Space Cases]]'', ''[[The Shoe People]]'' and its most famous work, ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', ''[[Zoboomafoo]]'' and ''[[Caillou]]''.

The firm became a [[public company]] in September 1993. By 1999, Cinar boasted annual revenues of $150 million ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]) and owned about $1.5 billion (CAD) of the children's television market. In 1996, Cinar acquired the library of the British animation studio [[FilmFair]], and closed it in 1998. In February 1999, Cinar acquired the film library of Leucadia Film Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/news/cinar-gets-library-grows-viacom-pact-1117491112/|title=Cinar gets library, grows Viacom pact|first=Brendan|last=Kelly|date=February 9, 1999|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandal====
The success of Charest, Weinberg, and Cinar ended in March 2000, when an internal audit revealed that about $122 million ([[United States dollar|US]]) was invested into [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] bank accounts without the board members' approval.&lt;ref name="swift"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cinar Co-Founders Fined $1 Million Each, Banned From Company For Five Years |last=Swift |first=Allan |date=March 15, 2002 |publisher=[[Canadian Press]] Newswire |url=http://securities.stanford.edu/news-archive/2002/20020315_Headline14_Swift.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628192516/http://securities.stanford.edu/news-archive/2002/20020315_Headline14_Swift.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cinar had also paid American [[screenwriting|screenwriters]] for work while continuing to accept federal [[grant (money)|grants]] and [[tax credit]]s for the production of [[Canadian content]]. The names of Canadian citizens (generally non-writers connected to Cinar, including Charest's sister Helene) were credited for the works. While the [[province]] of [[Quebec]] did not file criminal charges, Cinar denied any wrongdoing, choosing instead to pay a settlement to Canadian and Quebec tax authorities of $17.8 million ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]) and another $2.6 million (CAD) to [[Telefilm Canada]], a Canadian federal funding agency. The value of Cinar's [[stock market|stock]] plummeted, and the company was soon delisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/charest_micheline/| title = In Depth: Micheline Charest | work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News Online]] | date=April 14, 2004 | accessdate=September 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some speculation that Hasanain Panju, CFO was the mastermind behind the investment scheme along with John Xanthoudakis of Norshield Investment Group and Lino Matteo of Mount Real Corporation. It was alleged that Charest and Weinberg (and later Panju) used Cinar as a 'piggy bank' and schemed to transfer funds out from the company through a series of complicated transactions to their own offshore holding companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investorvoice.ca/Scandals/Norshield/Norshield40.htm |title=Norshield CEO led 'cleanup' |publisher=Investorvoice.ca |date= |accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, as part of a settlement agreement with the Commission des Valeurs Mobilières du Québec (Quebec Securities Commission) Charest and Weinberg agreed to pay $1 million each and were banned from serving in the capacity of directors or officers at any publicly traded Canadian company for five years. There was no admission of guilt and none of the allegations has been proven in court. Charest never lived to see a possible outcome, as she died on April 14, 2004.

====Aftermath====
On August 26, 2009, in a separate case, the Superior Court of Quebec ruled that Cinar had plagiarized the work of Claude Robinson for its animated series ''[[Robinson Sucroe]]''. The series was based on a concept he had pitched to Cinar in 1986, but had been turned down. Robinson was awarded $5.2 million in damages, in a suit that resolved a 14-year dispute between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cinar-to-pay-5-2m-for-plagiarizing-cartoon-1.781545|title=Cinar to pay $5.2M for plagiarizing cartoon|date=August 26, 2009|work=CBC News|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Montreal+animator+wins+copyright+battle/1932983/story.html|title=Montreal animator wins $5.2M in copyright battle|date=August 26, 2009|work=Montreal Gazette|accessdate=August 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830103721/http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Montreal+animator+wins+copyright+battle/1932983/story.html#|archive-date=August 30, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2014, former CFO Hasanain Panju pleaded guilty to undisclosed crimes. The judge noted these crimes were "disgraceful" and placed a publication ban on details surrounding the trial. Panju was sentenced to four years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former CA sentenced to four years in jail|url=http://cached.newslookup.com/cached.php?ref_id=125&amp;siteid=2117&amp;id=4560305&amp;t=1390596955|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112040057/http://cached.newslookup.com/cached.php?ref_id=125&amp;siteid=2117&amp;id=4560305&amp;t=1390596955|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=November 8, 2015|agency=The Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 2014, co-founder Ronald Weinberg, John Xanthoudakis of Norshield Financial Group and Lino Matteo of Mount Real Corp. were charged with 26 counts of fraud in Montreal Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Delean|first1= Paul|date= |title= Fraud trial of Cinar founder Ronald Weinberg and investment execs begins in Quebec Superior Court|url= http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/Fraud+trial+Cinar+founder+Ronald+Weinberg+investment+execs/9830515/story.html|dead-url= yes|newspaper= [[The Montreal Gazette]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140513021447/http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/Fraud%2Btrial%2BCinar%2Bfounder%2BRonald%2BWeinberg%2Binvestment%2Bexecs/9830515/story.html|archive-date= May 13, 2014|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were convicted on most of the counts on June 2, 2016, and in the trial Panju acted as a key Crown witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Marotte|first1= Bertrand|last2= Van Praet|first2= Nicolas|date= June 2, 2016|title= Cinar founder Ronald Weinberg, two others found guilty on fraud charges |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/the-law-page/ex-cinar-ceo-two-others-found-guilty-on-fraud-charges/article30245930/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, 2016, Weinberg was sentenced to 8 years and 11 months in prison, and the other two received sentences of 7 years and 11 months each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Marotte|first= Bertrand|date= June 22, 2016|title= Cinar founder Weinberg given nearly nine years in fraud case |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/the-law-page/cinar-founder-ronald-weinberg-two-others-sentenced/article30557421/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cinar affair was described thus by ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'':

{{cquote|
Mr. Weinberg and Ms. Charest set out to make non-violent, non-sexist children's programming because they wanted to foster socially progressive attitudes and feelings of self-worth in their own sons and a generation of kids with far too many bad TV choices.

But by the time their own kids had outgrown Cinar's shows, the couple's motivations seemed to have slid down the well-greased path of basic greed and avarice. If it took breaking the rules to enrich themselves, so be it. Success had gone to their heads. They acted (if not felt) invincible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Yakabuski|first= Konrad|date= June 23, 2016|title= The tattered Cinar legacy is a lesson in humility |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/the-tattered-cinar-legacy-is-a-lesson-in-humility/article30586354/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Cookie Jar Group===
In March 2004, Cinar was purchased for more than [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]190 million by a group led by [[Nelvana]] founder, [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]] and former Nelvana President, Toper Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2003/10/31/cinar311003.html| title= Cinar sold for $143.9 million US; new owner outlines growth strategy|work=[[CBC News]]| date=October 31, 2003 |accessdate=September 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was subsequently renamed Cookie Jar.&lt;ref name="variety-rename"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinar turns into Cookie Jar|url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/markets-festivals/cinar-turns-into-cookie-jar-1117902396/|website=Variety|accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2008, Cookie Jar Group announced a deal to acquire [[DIC Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080620.php |title=Cookie Jar and DIC Entertainment to merge, creating independent global children's entertainment and education powerhouse |work=Cookie Jar Group |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531232059/http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080620.php |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2008, the acquisition was completed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080723a.php |title=Cookie Jar Entertainment expands brands portfolio, talent and global reach with closing of DIC transaction |work=Cookie Jar Group |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531231944/http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080723a.php |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually DIC was folded into Cookie Jar's entertainment division. When Cookie Jar acquired DIC Entertainment, Cookie Jar also acquired [[Copyright Promotions Licensing Group]] and a one-third interest in international children's television channel, [[KidsCo]]. Cookie Jar now has more than 6,000 half-hours of programming as well as rights to several children's brands. Also it was announced that Cookie Jar was in negotiation with [[American Greetings]] to buy the ''[[Care Bears]]'', ''[[Strawberry Shortcake]]'', and ''[[Sushi Pack]]'' franchises. The deal was not finalized yet in late 2008 and with the current scenario, the transaction did not progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

The '''Danish Golden Age''' ({{lang-da|Den danske guldalder}}) covers a period of exceptional creative production in [[Denmark]], especially  during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="dga"&gt;Kulturnet Danmark, [http://www.guldalder.dk/composite-219.htm Guide to the Danish Golden Age] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110125312/http://www.guldalder.dk/composite-219.htm |date=2006-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Copenhagen had suffered from fires, [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombardment]] and national bankruptcy, the arts took on a new period of creativity catalysed by [[German romanticism|Romanticism from Germany]]. The period is probably most commonly associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting from 1800 to around 1850 which encompasses the work of [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]] and his students, including [[Wilhelm Bendz]], [[Christen Købke]], [[Martinus Rørbye]], [[Constantin Hansen]] and [[Wilhelm Marstrand]], as well as the sculpture of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].

It also saw the development of [[Architecture of Denmark|Danish architecture]] in the  [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]]. Copenhagen, in particular, acquired a new look, with buildings designed by [[Christian Frederik Hansen]] and [[Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll]].

In relation to [[Music of Denmark|music]], the Golden Age covers figures inspired by Danish [[romantic nationalism]] including [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann|J. P. E. Hartmann]], [[Hans Christian Lumbye]], [[Niels W. Gade]] and the ballet master [[August Bournonville]]. [[Literature of Denmark|Literature]] centred on [[romanticism|Romantic thinking]], introduced in 1802 by the Norwegian-German philosopher [[Henrik Steffens]]. Key contributors were [[Adam Oehlenschläger]], [[Bernhard Severin Ingemann]], [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] and, last but not least, [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the proponent of the modern fairytale. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] furthered philosophy while [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] achieved fundamental progress in science. The Golden Age thus had a profound effect not only on life in Denmark but, with time, on the international front too.

==Background and context==
[[File:Copenhagen on fire 1807 by CW Eckersberg.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Copenhagen on Fire by [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg|C.W. Eckersberg]] (1807)]]
The origins of the Golden Age can be traced back to around the beginning of the 19th century, which was a very rough period for Denmark. Copenhagen, the centre of the country's intellectual life, first experienced [[Copenhagen Fire of 1795|huge fires]] in 1794 and 1795 which destroyed both [[Christiansborg Palace]] and large areas of the inner city.

Copenhagen's devastation nevertheless provided new opportunities. Architects and planners widened the streets, constructing beautifully designed Neoclassical buildings offering a brighter yet intimate look. At the time, with a population of only 100,000, the city was still quite small, built within the confines of the old ramparts. As a result, the leading figures of the day met frequently, sharing their ideas, bringing the arts and the sciences together. [[Henrik Steffens]] was perhaps the most effective proponent of the Romantic idea. In a series of lectures in Copenhagen, he successfully conveyed the ideas behind [[German romanticism]] to the Danes. Influential thinkers, such as [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger|Oehlenschläger]] and [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]] were quick to take up his views. It was not long before Danes from all branches of the arts and sciences were involved in a new era of [[Romantic nationalism]], later known as the Danish Golden Age.&lt;ref name="Historical overview"/&gt;

Especially in the field of painting, change became apparent. While art had previously served to uphold the monarchy and the establishment, [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]] and his students realized that, with the arrival of industrialization, the middle classes were increasingly gaining power and influence. Grand historical art gave way to more widely appealing but less pretentious genre paintings and landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aros.dk/page.asp?sideid=134&amp;zcs=2 "Danish art before 1900"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720174041/http://www.aros.dk/page.asp?sideid=134&amp;zcs=2 |date=2011-07-20 }}, ''Aarhus Kunstmuseum''.

The Golden Age is generally believed to have lasted until about 1850. Around that time, Danish culture suffered from the outbreak of the [[First Schleswig War]] (1848–1851). In addition, political reforms involving the end of the absolute monarchy in 1848 and the adoption of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]] the following year signalled the beginning of a new era. Finally, the extension of Copenhagen beyond the old ramparts during the 1850s opened up new horizons for urban expansion.

It was not until 1890 that the Danish philosopher [[Valdemar Vedel]] first used the term ''Guldalderen'' or Golden Age to describe the period. In 1896, author [[Vilhelm Andersen]] saw the Golden Age initiated by [[Henrich Steffens]] as the richest period in the cultural history of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.dk/adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?ff_id=64&amp;p_fpkat_id=indl&amp;nnoc=#a1.3 Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur – Henrich Steffens – Forfatterportræt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022750/http://www.adl.dk/adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?ff_id=64&amp;p_fpkat_id=indl&amp;nnoc= |date=2011-07-16 }}, {{Da icon}}.

==Painting==
Around the beginning of the 19th century, the Golden Age of Danish Painting emerged to form a distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the century.  It has a style drawing on [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], especially its [[landscape painting]],&lt;ref&gt;Dutch paintings, and landscapes, dominated in the 18th century Danish collections that we have records of. North, 308-9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XGui9XJ3ObIC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=Danish+Golden+Age+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=a43wSteONozIyQTslY38AQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour.  The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more [[realism (visual arts)|realist]] than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends.  Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) although the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting [[Caspar David Friedrich]] was important in spreading its influence in Germany.

A crucial figure was [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]], who had studied in Paris with [[Jacques-Louis David]] and was further influenced towards [[Neo-Classicism]] by the sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].  Eckersberg taught at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Academy]] from 1818 to 1853, becoming director from 1827 to 1828, and was an important influence on the following generation, in which landscape painting came to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/eckersberginfo.shtm Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg.

An investigation of drawings, underdrawings, oil sketches and finished paintings by Eckersberg and his pupils Christen Købke and Constantin Hansen, using their Italian views as examples, points to a number of important aspects which shed light on the creative process in Danish Golden Age painting in the first half of the 19th century. The preliminary drawings – preferably composition drawings – which were done in front of the motif were meticulously constructed and reproduced many details. Architecture received the painters’ greatest attention, whereas vegetation, rocks and stones as well as figures in the landscape received a lower priority. The drawing done directly from the motif was squared up in several instances with a view to its transference to the painting, which was often no larger than the drawing. Some elements could be altered during the
process, but by and large the artist retained the original dispositions quite precisely.
In some cases the architecture was consciously altered so as to strengthen the forms and create harmony in the picture. In this way, we can prove that although the Italian motifs appear realistic at first sight, they were nonetheless adjusted or even manipulated by the artists.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wadum, M. Scharff, K. Monrad, "Hidden Drawings from the Danish Golden Age. Drawing and underdrawing in Danish Golden Age views from Italy" in ''SMK Art Journal'' 2006, ed. Peter Nørgaard Larsen. [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent artists of the Danish Golden Age of Painting included [[Wilhelm Bendz]] (1804–1832), remembered for his many technically accomplished portraits of fellow artists such as [[Ditlev Blunck]] and [[Christen Christensen (sculptor)|Christen Christensen]], a scene from the Academy's anatomy class, as well as the group portraits "A Tobacco Party" and "Artist in the Evening at Finck's Coffee House in Munich"; [[Constantin Hansen]] (1804–1880), deeply interested in [[literature]] and [[mythology]] and inspired by [[Niels Laurits Høyen]], who developed national [[history painting|historical painting]] based on [[Norse mythology]] and painted many portraits, including the historical The Constitutional Assembly (''Den grundlovgivende Rigsforsamling'');
[[Christen Købke]] (1810–48), influenced by [[Niels Laurits Høyen]], an art historian who promoted a nationalistic approach calling for artists to search for subject matter in the folk life of their country instead of searching for themes in other countries such as Italy; [[Wilhelm Marstrand]] (1810–1873), a vastly productive artist who mastered a remarkable variety of genres, remembered especially for a number of his works which have become familiar signposts of Danish history and culture: scenes from the drawing-rooms and streets of Copenhagen during his younger days; the festivity and public life captured in Rome; the many representative portraits of citizens and innovators; even the monumentalist commissions for universities and the monarchy; and [[Martinus Rørbye]] (1803–1848), remembered for his genre paintings of Copenhagen, for his landscapes and for his [[architectural painting]]s, as well as for the many sketches he made during his travels to countries rarely explored at the time. Among other artists, [[C.A. Jensen]] (1792–1870) specialized almost exclusively in portraits.

At the end of the period painting style, especially in landscape art, became caught up in the political issue of the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]], a vital matter for Danes, but notoriously impenetrable for most others in Europe. But it was not until the 1870s when a number of young artists defied the Academy and studied in Paris that a new style embracing [[Realist visual arts|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]] began to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Lise Svanholm, "Malerne på Skagen", {{Da icon}}, [[Gyldendal]] 2001, pp 30–43, {{ISBN|87-00-75184-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape painting===
The art historian [[Niels Laurits Høyen]] who taught at the Academy encouraged his students to turn to landscape painting. Johan Thomas Lundbye, Christen Købke, P. C.

==Sculpture==
{{main|Danish sculpture}}

[[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], strongly influenced by his lengthy stay in Rome from 1797, created many internationally recognized works in his pure [[Sculpture#Neo-Classical|Neoclassical style]]. His breakthrough was ''Jason with the Golden Fleece'' which was highly praised by [[Antonio Canova]] and purchased by [[Thomas Hope (1769–1831)|Thomas Hope]], a wealthy British art collector. Other well-known works are the large Statue of Christ in [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen Cathedral]] and the [[Lion Monument]] in Lucerne. Many of his works can be seen in Copenhagen's [[Thorvaldsens Museum]] which was not completed until 1848, four years after his death.

Other contributors to sculpture in the Golden Age include [[Hermann Ernst Freund]], whose work centred on Scandinavian gods, and [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]], who sculpted contemporary figures such as ''Landsoldaten'' (The Foot Soldier), a victory monument to the [[First Schleswig War|war of 1848–1851]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guldalder.dk/show.asp?id=267 "Sculpture", ''Guide to the Danish Golden Age''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008141732/http://www.guldalder.dk/show.asp?id=267 |date=2007-10-08 }}.

During the Golden Age, Copenhagen in particular acquired a new look as architects inspired by [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classicism]] repaired much of the damage caused by fire in 1795 and by the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|British bombardment]] of the city in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guldalder.dk/show.asp?id=260 "Architecture", ''Guide to the Danish Golden Age''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124705/http://www.guldalder.dk/show.asp?id=260 |date=2011-07-19 }}, Retrieved 28 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the experience of [[Caspar Frederik Harsdorff|C. F. Harsdorff]]
in the late 18th century, the main proponent of Classicism in the Golden age was [[Christian Frederik Hansen]] who developed a rather severe style with clean, simple forms and large, unbroken surfaces inspired by the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome. From 1800, he was in charge of all major building projects in Copenhagen where he designed the [[Copenhagen Court House|Copenhagen City Hall &amp; Courthouse]] (1805–1815) on [[Nytorv]]. He was also responsible for rebuilding the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] (''Vor Frue Kirke'') and designing the surrounding square (1811–1829).

In 1800, Hansen was also charged with rebuilding [[Christiansborg Palace]] which had burnt down in 1794. He worked with [[Gustav Friedrich Hetsch]] who completed the interiors. Unfortunately, the palace burnt down once again in 1884. All that remains is the magnificent chapel which, with its Ionic columns, conveys a sense of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guldalder.dk/show.asp?id=262 Christiansborg Palace Chapel.

[[Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll]] is remembered above all for designing [[Thorvaldsens Museum]]. In 1822, as a young man, he had experienced [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s classicism in Germany and France and had met the German-born architect and archaeologist [[Franz Gau]] who introduced him to the colourful architecture of antiquity. His uncle, Jonas Collin, who was an active art and culture official under [[Frederik VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]], awakened the King's interest in a museum for [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], the Danish-Icelandic sculptor, and asked Bindesbøll to make some sketches for the building. As Bindensbøll's designs stood out from those of other architects, he was given a commission to transform the Royal Carriage Depot and Theatre Scenery Painting Building into a museum. Emulating the construction of the [[Erechtheion]] and the [[Parthenon]] as freestanding buildings released from the traditional urban plan of closed streets, he completed the work in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Bente, and Jens Lindhe.

The 19th century also saw the emergence of a number of Danish composers who were inspired by [[Romantic nationalism]]. [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann]] (1805–1900) contributed to song and the piano repertory as well as to opera and ballet music. From 1843 until his death, he was the organist at the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] in Copenhagen. His works are not only romantic but generally inspired by the old [[Norse mythology|Nordic legends]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugle.dk/j_p_e_hartmann.html "Gamle Danske Sange – med melodi af J. P. E.

Here he had a platform for presenting a large foreign and Danish repertory, including his many waltzes and gallops. In 1839, he had heard a Viennese orchestra play music by [[Johann Strauss I|Johann Strauss]], after which he composed in the same style, eventually earning the nickname "The Strauss of the North".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/composerinfo/Hans_Christian_Lumbye/22613.htm "Lumbye, Hans Christian"], Naxos.com.

In addition to a huge stream of articles and poems, he wrote a number of books, including two histories of the world (1814 and 1817), the long historical poem ''Roskilde-Riim'' (''Rhyme of Roskilde'') (1813), and a book-sized commentary, ''Roskilde Saga''.  Grundtvig's hymn book brought about a great change in Danish church services, substituting the [[hymn]]s of the national poets for the slow measures of the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Lutheran]]s.

But Andersen also wrote a number of travel sketches, several novels including the well-received: "[[The Improvisatore]]" (1835), a series of poems, and his autobiography "The Fairy Tale of My Life" (1855).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hcanders.htm |title=Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817020546/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hcanders.htm |archivedate=17 August 2008 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Philosophy
Danish philosophy was dominated in the first half of the 19th century by the influence of Hegel and Hegelianism. [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] (1791–1860), Frederik Christian Sibbern (1785–1872), and especially [[Hans Lassen Martensen]] (1803–1884), all of whom contributed to the popularity of Hegel's idealism in various academic disciplines, though Hegel's influence significantly declined by 1850. The primary critic of Hegelianism, and the most important philosopher in Denmark at the time, was [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855), an existentialist philosopher and a theologian. Much of Kierkegaard's philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives, focusing on the priority of concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment. His principal aesthetic works include [[Either/Or]] (''Enten-Eller'') (1843), [[Philosophical Fragments]] (''Philosophiske Smuler'') (1844), [[Stages on Life's Way]] (''Stadier paa Livets Vei'') (1845) and [[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]] (''Afsluttende uvidenskabelig Efterskrift'') (1846). Opposing [[Hegel]]ian philosophy, they promote the existential approach which raises the individual's awareness of God but intensifies his despair at not being able to achieve eternal truth. His religious works include [[Works of Love]] (''Kjerlighedens Gjerninger'') (1847) and [[Practice in Christianity]] ''(Indøvelse i Christendom)'' (1850).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kierkega.htm |title=Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813–1855) |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006071356/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/kierkega.htm |archivedate=6 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophypages.com/ph/kier.htm "Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813–1855)"], ''Philosophy Pages''. Retrieved 28 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important figure in Danish philosophy was [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] (1784–1872), whose ideas became an important part of the development of Danish national identity.

==Science==
[[File:Ørsted.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Hans Christian Ørsted]]
One name stands out above all others among those who contributed to science during the Danish Golden Age, that of [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], the prominent [[physics|physicist]] and [[chemistry|chemist]] known for observing that [[electric current]]s induce [[magnetic field]]s, an important aspect of [[electromagnetism]]. He shaped [[Kantianism|post-Kantian philosophy]] and advances in science throughout the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brian, R.M. &amp; Cohen, R.S. (2007). Hans Christian Ørsted and the Romantic Legacy in Science, ''Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824, Ørsted founded ''Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse'' (SNU), a society to disseminate knowledge of the natural sciences. He was also the founder of predecessor organizations which eventually became the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] and the [[European Patent Organisation|Danish Patent and Trademark Office]]. Ørsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the [[thought experiment]]. He was convinced that all things in the universe were related, both materially and spiritually. He described this in his philosophical work ''Ånden i naturen'' (The Spirit in Nature).&lt;ref name="Ørsted"&gt;[http://www.guldalder.dk/show.asp?id=257 "Hans Christian Ørsted", ''Guide to the Danish Golden Age''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008141443/http://www.guldalder.dk/show.asp?id=257 |date=2007-10-08 }}, Retrieved 28 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ørsted contributed strongly to the Golden Age, especially through his close friendship with Hans Christian Andersen.&lt;ref name="Ørsted"/&gt;

==Impact==
The leading players in the Danish Golden Age have not only had a lasting impact in Denmark, but throughout the world. Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales have been translated into over 150 languages, more than any book apart from the Bible, and continue to be read to children everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salempress.com/store/samples/survey_world_lit/survey_world_lit_andersen.htm "Hans Christian Andersen", Magill's Survey of World Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620010117/http://salempress.com/store/samples/survey_world_lit/survey_world_lit_andersen.htm |date=2010-06-20 }}, Salem Press. Retrieved 1 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
With the exception of [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born [[Ludvig Holberg]], no Danish writer before 1870 exercised so wide an influence as [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger]]. His work was to awaken his compatriots' enthusiasm for the poetry and religion of their ancestors, to the extent that his name remains to this day synonymous with Scandinavian romance.

In architecture, when designing the Thorvaldsen Museum, Michael Bindesbøll gave special attention to liberating the building from its surroundings. His free perception of space served as a guiding principle for the cities and buildings of the future.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Bente, and Jens Lindhe, "Thorvaldsen's Museum: Architecture, Colours, Light". Copenhagen: Danish Architectural Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The choreographer, August Bournonville, resisting many of the excesses of the romantic era ballets, gave equal emphasis to male and female roles in his work at a time when European ballet emphasized the ballerina.

N. F. S. Grundtvig exerted considerable influence on education, promoting a spirit of freedom, poetry and disciplined creativity. Opposing compulsion and examinations, he advocated unleashing human creativity according to the universally creative order of life. A spirit of freedom, cooperation and discovery was to be kindled in individuals, in science, and in society as a whole. Søren Kierkegaard has also strongly influenced philosophy and literature right up to the present day. Among the many who have profited from his ideas are [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Niels Bohr]] and [[W. H. Auden]].

Hans Christian Ørsted's scientific advances contributed fundamentally to chemistry, with his work on [[aluminium]], and especially to physics, with his conclusive research on [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicool.com/elements/aluminum.html "Aluminium", ''ChemiCool'']. Retrieved 1 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, many of the works of the painters and sculptors of the period continue to be exhibited in the world's finest museums and galleries. Some, like Christen Købke, have attracted renewed interest in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/kobke {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610081720/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/kobke |date=2010-06-10 }} "Christen Købke —Danish Master of Light", ''National Gallery'', London.

'''''DeathDrome''''' is a 1996 [[third-person shooter]] game developed by [[Zipper Interactive]] and published by [[Viacom New Media]]. It was the first game to be developed by Zipper Interactive.&lt;ref name=NGen29/&gt;

== Story ==
The game takes place in 2057, where crime is rampant and jails are overpopulated. The government forms the Committee of Recreational Termination (C.O.R.T.) in order to eliminate the surplus of convicts. In this competition, convicts must take part in deathmatches in which one will survive and be declared winner.

''[[GameSpot]]'' called ''DeathDrome'' "one of the best games of its kind to arrive on the scene in quite some time." He particularly praised the creative weapons and the tension created by having the "scrub" mechanic instead of the game immediately ending when time runs out. He remarked that the fact that enemies always spawn at the center podium is too easily exploited in single-player mode, but felt the main draw is the multiplayer mode in any case.&lt;ref name=GSrev/&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' also noted the creative weapons and "truly hairbreadth escapes" as time runs out as the highlights. He also complimented how the developers maintained a decent [[frame rate]] by dividing the arenas into four sections. However, he concluded that "While ''DeathDrome'' has some interesting elements, it's hardly groundbreaking enough to be remembered a year from now."&lt;ref name=NGen29/&gt;

'''''Dragon Warrior Monsters'''''{{efn|Originally released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry no Wonderland'''''|ドラゴンクエストモンスターズ テリーのワンダーランド|lit. Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland}}}} is the first [[video game]] in the ''[[Dragon Quest Monsters]]'' series. It was released in Japan by [[Enix]] on September 25, 1998, and co-published by [[Eidos Interactive]] in Europe and North America in 2000. It was the first ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' game to be released in Europe. It was released for the [[Game Boy Color]] before the console itself was released; however, the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] is backward compatible with the older [[Game Boy]] console in [[black-and-white]] color. The game was remade for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in a compilation '''''Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2 Hoshi Furi no Yūsha to Bokujō no Nakamatachi'''''.{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2 Hoshi Furi no Yūsha to Bokujō no Nakamatachi'''''|ドラゴンクエストモンスターズ1・2 星降りの勇者と牧場の仲間たち|}}}}&lt;ref name="rpgfan" /&gt; A mobile phone incarnation titled ''Dragon Quest Monsters i'' was released in Japan on January 28, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Weiss, Justin | date=January 30, 2002 | title=Dragon Quest Monsters Hits Cell Phones | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2002/013002c.html | work=RPGamer.com | accessdate=2008-12-13 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525104326/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2002/013002c.html | archivedate=May 25, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game features the characters Terry and Milly from ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie|Dragon Quest VI]]'' when they were children, before the events in ''Dragon Quest VI''. ''Dragon Warrior Monsters'' is often compared to the ''[[Pokémon]]'' series due to their similar gameplay.&lt;ref name="jeff"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jeff Gertsmann | year=2004 | title=Dragon Warrior Monsters review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/dragonwarriormonsters/review.html | work= | accessdate=2007-10-07 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516113202/http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/dragonwarriormonsters/review.html | archivedate=2008-05-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics set the games apart by noting the in-depth breeding system seen in this game.

In May 2012, a remake of the game for the [[Nintendo 3DS]], titled '''''Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry no Wonderland 3D''''',{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry no Wonderland 3D'''''|ドラゴンクエストモンスターズ テリーのワンダーランド3D|lit.

== Gameplay ==

The game follows Terry as he attempts to save his sister. Instead of fighting in battle, Terry is able to recruit monsters into his party. When fighting [[Random encounter|random battles]], Terry can set out meat, which may coax the monster into joining the party at the end of the battle. Terry can also breed two monsters, combining them into a new, stronger monster. Excess monsters can be placed on the Farm, a storage place for monsters. They can be picked up or dropped off and there is an option to put monsters at the farm to sleep, which allows them to maintain their wilderness level, but not grow in level. There can be 19 awake and 19 asleep monsters at any one time. A monster's wilderness level lowers as Terry trains them, which makes them more likely to participate in battle. By leaving monsters at the farm awake, they become more wild.

Just like in most RPGs, monsters are able to gain [[experience points]] and level up after battles. Each monsters' requirements for experience points to level up varies, depending on their plus number or even what monster family they belong to. When they level up, they gain stats and sometimes skills. All monsters can carry a maximum of eight skills; if a monster can gain more than eight skills you have the option of replacing old skills with new ones.

The player moves around to other worlds through warp gates which are located underneath the throne room. To access these gates, the player needs to defeat a certain class ranking. There are a certain number of areas in a world and at the last one, the player needs to defeat a boss. Some bosses in the game offer to join the player's party automatically, some have to be won over with meat, and some will not join at all. Other gates are hidden throughout Great Tree, such as one in the library that is only accessible after befriending over 100 different monsters.

In this game the player fights in the arena and goes through ranks that consists of three different battles that must be won before the player can advance to the next ranking. Each rank provides harder challenges: the higher the rank, the harder the monsters. The battles you able to start at are from Rank G and go to Rank D and later in the game you are able to go from Rank C to Rank A and then Rank S. These battles open up gates for the character to explore and are necessary to progress through the story.

Tiny Medals are scattered throughout different worlds randomly and are picked up by the player. In the game, there is a man who collects these medals, who is later revealed to be the king of Great Tree, and will give certain monster eggs for how many the player gives to him. Also, Foreign Masters may appear while in other worlds. These encounters with other trainers can result in battle. There are different types of trainers that will give or do something for the player if they are defeated.  These trainers monsters may also join you if you give them meat.

The game also comes compatible with the PlayStation's [[i-mode]] adaptor, allowing players to upload monsters from the game onto the mobile phone version of ''Dragon Quest Monsters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Henninger | first=Michael | date=2002-01-19 | title=Enix to Port Dragon Quest Monsters Collection to PSone | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2002/011902a.html | work=RPGamer.com | accessdate=2008-12-13 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015181420/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2002/011902a.html | archivedate=2008-10-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breeding ===

After beating Class F in the Arena, the player can breed monsters if they are at level 10 or above at the Shrine of Starry Night, which is taken care of by the current Master Monster Tamer. Breeding requires one male and one female monster. The result of the breeding will be an egg, containing a level 1 monster which has characteristics of both parents, including skills and stats. The egg can then be left in the monster farm or hatched, which costs a small fee. The monster born will have a plus number next to it, the number generally signifying the greatness of the monster's stats, the higher being the better. It costs more money to hatch a monster with a higher plus number than one with no plus number. Also, the number beside the plus multiplied by two is added to the limit for the maximum level for the monster.

Once the Egg Evaluator is available for use, eggs can have the gender of the monster they're containing checked and changed. Both requires a small fee which is paid to the Egg Evaluator. The fee increases depending on the monster's plus number.

A monster that was created through breeding has much higher stats and many more abilities than a monster that was found in the wild, thus it is much harder to complete the game without breeding many generations.  Breeding is also the only way to acquire certain monsters.  Also, the monsters that bred to make the egg leave you.

== Story ==

In the days before ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie|Dragon Quest VI]]'', when Terry and Milly were just children, a strange monster appeared one night and snatched Milly away.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; Soon after, another monster, similar to the kidnapper, appeared and told Terry his sister was kidnapped by the evil Warubou. He informs Terry that his name is Watabou and must accompany him to the Kingdom of GreatTree. After his arrival, Terry met the King and received Slib the [[Slime (Dragon Quest)|slime]], his first monster to train. If Terry wins the Monster Trainer's Starry Night Tournament, he will be granted a wish.&lt;ref name="ga"&gt;{{cite web | author=Keplek, Patrick | date=March 8, 2000 | title=Dragon Warrior Monsters Review | url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/reviews/review.pl?sys=gameboy&amp;game=dwm | work=Gaming-Age.com | accessdate=2009-10-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BpPvQnBY?url=http://www.gaming-age.com/404.html | archivedate=October 31, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; So Terry sets out with his team to explore the many monster dungeons to win the tournament and rescue his sister.

== Nintendo 3DS remake ==

The Nintendo 3DS remake was announced in September 2011 by publisher [[Square Enix]], and was said to include new monsters, a new story, and additional monsters from ''[[Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2]] Professional''.
&lt;ref name="DQM1 remake" /&gt; The game was shown as a playable demo at Jump Magazines Jump Festa in December 2011.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

The game features include shifting from day to night, randomized dungeon layouts, combat with four opponents on each side, and a total of 609 monsters, including all the monsters from the original [[Game Boy Color]] release.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite web| title=Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry’s Wonderland 3D Will Have 500 Monsters| publisher=Siliconera| url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/12/12/dragon-quest-monsters-terrys-wonderland-3d-will-have-500-monsters/| author=Ishaan| date=December 12, 2011| accessdate=August 3, 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718231121/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/12/12/dragon-quest-monsters-terrys-wonderland-3d-will-have-500-monsters/| archivedate=July 18, 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Here’s Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry’s Wonderland 3D’s Special Nintendo 3DS| publisher=Siliconera| url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/02/28/heres-dragon-quest-monsters-terrys-wonderland-3ds-special-nintendo-3ds/| author=Ishaan| date=February 28, 2012| accessdate=August 3, 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720032419/http://www.siliconera.com/2012/02/28/heres-dragon-quest-monsters-terrys-wonderland-3ds-special-nintendo-3ds/| archivedate=July 20, 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also features an in-game Wi-Fi Store in the bazaar area.

In B3 of the Great Tree, one of the two gates there takes you to an arena where you can battle the top 3 users who've won that day's ranking battle. You can do auto commands, AI battle tactics, and use items. The users are AIs, and their data are recorded from said day's ranking battle. You get both bonus points (for Wi-Fi Ranking Battle) and gold. The other gate there takes you to a 100 battle survival course. After 50 battles, it auto saves. If you lose between 51-100, you get to start back at battle 50. These battles can only be done once every 24 hours.

''Dragon Warrior Monsters'' received mostly positive reviews, receiving an average score of 78.9% from [[GameRankings]] based on 12 reviews.&lt;ref name="gr" /&gt; The game was compared to ''[[Pokémon]]'' by critics because of its similar gameplay, many telling fans to play the game as a means of waiting for the release of [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']].&lt;ref name="jeff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ga" /&gt; GameSpot.com praised the game's visuals, music, and gameplay, stating that the game "may not have the cutesy, over-merchandised appeal of Pokémon, but the rock-solid gameplay makes it a worthwhile endeavor."&lt;ref name="jeff" /&gt; IGN stated that ''Dragon Warrior Monsters'' features many of ''Pokémon's'' mechanics, "but better," commenting on the game's large cast of monsters and battles.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; However, IGN also made a distinction between the two games, saying that ''Pokémon's'' ability to capture any wild Pokémon with a Poké Ball as opposed to taming monsters was a better idea.

RPGFan.com reviewed the game, mentioning that the game's 215 monsters gave the game a large amount of depth, and that the "bulk and the most fun aspect of the game is catching monsters and breeding them to get more powerful monsters."&lt;ref name="rpgfan"&gt;{{cite web| author=| title=RPGFan Reviews: Dragon Warrior Monsters Reviews| url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/dragonwarriormonsters/Dragon_Warrior_Monsters.html| work=RPGFan.com| accessdate=2009-01-11| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CqptVlsM?url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/dragonwarriormonsters/Dragon_Warrior_Monsters.html| archivedate=2012-12-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaming-Age.com similarly pointed out that the breeding aspect of ''Dragon Warrior Monsters'' set it apart from other monster-catching games, noting that its monsters "don't quite have the extra 'omph' that the {{sic|Poke|mon}} creatures do", but that "none of the creatures are so super cutesy that they begin to get on your nerves."&lt;ref name="ga" /&gt;

The '''Edmonton Investors Group Limited Partnership''' ('''EIGLP''') was the [[limited partnership]] that owned the [[Edmonton Oilers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[Edmonton Oil Kings]] of the [[Western Hockey League]]. With more than thirty individual shareholders, EIGLP was the largest ownership group in the NHL.  Among the four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American major sports leagues]], only the [[Green Bay Packers Foundation|Green Bay Packers]] have a larger ownership group.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The EIG were the key players for keeping the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada long term by purchasing the team from then-owner [[Peter Pocklington]] for {{dollarsign|CAD}}107 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|107000000|1998}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} Canadian dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) and preventing the team by being purchasing the team for US$90 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|90000000|1998}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} American dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) or C$127 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|127000000|1998}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} Canadian dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}).

==History==
===Pre Edmonton Investors Group===
In the mid-1990s, [[Edmonton Oilers]] owner [[Peter Pocklington]] was in a precarious financial situation. Pocklington's main creditor, the [[Alberta Treasury Branches]], were demanding repayment of millions of dollars' worth of loans that ATB had made to Pocklington in the 1980s and early 1990s. The once-popular Pocklington had a strained relationship with Edmontonians due in part to his decision to trade [[Wayne Gretzky]] as well as [[Peter Pocklington#Business Controversy|his other business and political dealings]]. As a result, attendance at [[Northlands Coliseum]] had declined – partly due to the team's declining on-ice fortunes but also due to personal animosity towards the owner.

This animosity hindered a 1996 [[season ticket]] drive that was needed to keep the team in Edmonton. It was largely due to the perseverance of future EIG partner [[Cal Nichols]], that the ''Friends of the Oilers'' ticket drive ultimately expanded the season ticket base from a dismal 6,200 to over 13,400, enough to secure the team's future for the short term. However, it was increasingly obvious that Pocklington would not be around for the long term. In early 1997, Pocklington announced his intention to sell up to 45% of the team on the [[stock market]]. Pressure from ATB forced him to abandon this plan and put the team up for sale.

When the Oilers were put up for sale, many doubted whether a local ownership could be found and believed the proud franchise would be re-located to an American city as had happened with the teams in [[Quebec Nordiques|Quebec City]] in 1995 and [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg]] in 1996. In 1997, the population of the [[Edmonton Capital Region|Edmonton metropolitan area]] was still under one million, a figure viewed by many fans to be the minimum base a North American major sports team needs to be financially viable. With the only other former [[World Hockey Association]] team in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] re-locating in 1997, many analysts predicted that the "[[domino effect]]" would be completed in 1998 with the Oilers' move.

However, the terms of Pocklington's [[lease]] at what was then known as the Edmonton Coliseum prevented him from unilaterally moving the team or selling it to someone who intended to move it. It stipulated that an ownership group willing to keep the team in Edmonton would have six weeks from the time any such intention was declared to purchase the team for US$70 million. In addition, the ATB is a [[crown corporation]] owned by the [[Alberta government]], though they treated the matter as non-political. While [[Alberta Premier]] [[Ralph Klein]] wanted to keep the Oilers in the capital, he was wary of a series of [[scandal]]s involving favouritism at the ATB that had plagued his predecessor, [[Don Getty]], in the 1980s. Klein was unwilling to make any move that might have been perceived by voters as government subsidization of a hockey club that paid multimillion-dollar salaries. However, when Klein's hometown [[Calgary Flames]] encountered financial difficulties in 2000, he immediately moved to assist them by creating a province-wide lottery.

===Cal Nichols looks for investors===
Nichols, a prominent businessman in his own right, immediately began putting together an ownership group.  At the time, the Albertan economy—driven by the [[oilpatch]]—was still recovering from price crashes in the 1980s and 1990s.  Most Albertan investors preferred to commit their money to the re-emerging oilpatch, not a "[[small-market]]" hockey team.  With no single Albertan magnate willing to commit C$100 million to purchase the team, Nichols was forced to secure smaller investments from a larger number of investors.  Lenders were willing to finance 40% of the purchase price, meaning Nichols needed to come up with about C$60 million.  Nichols had about C$35 million in investments when an offer of US$85 million (C$120 million) came from a buyer who wanted to move the team to [[Houston]].

The Oilers' sale attracted interest in from several American cities, and as Nichols was securing local investors, an offer of US$85 million (C$120 million) came from [[Leslie Alexander (businessman)|Leslie Alexander]], a [[Houston]]-based businessman and an owner of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Houston Rockets]]. Houston, who's application for an [[expansion team]] rejected by the league, was (and still is) the largest U.S. city without an NHL franchise.  Alexander's original offer was to keep the team in Edmonton on the condition that the lease be terminated, attendance remained at acceptable levels, a local ownership group was eventually found and an expansion team be granted to Alexander in Houston.  The [[Edmonton City Council]] rejected these terms, believing they gave Alexander too much discretion to move the Oilers to Texas.  The city believed the lease they negotiated with Pocklington was still the best chance they had of keeping the team in Edmonton in the long term.  Alexander then offered the ATB (which had the team in [[receivership]] by then) US$85 million (C$120 million) to purchase the team and move it to Houston, and submitted a US$5 million (C$7 million) [[deposit account|deposit]].  Nichols was given until March 13, 1998 to match the deposit and commit to purchasing the team for US$70 million (C$100 million), or the lease would be automatically terminated and the team would move.

Nichols was eventually able to assemble a group of 38 local investors.  As the deadline neared, the Edmonton Investors Group (EIG) decided to commit to the purchase by matching Alexander's deposit with a down payment of US$5 million (C$7 million).  The remainder of the US$70 million (C$100 million) was paid to ATB 40 days later. On May 5, 1998, the NHL approved the sale and the EIG officially become the NHL owners.  Although major sporting leagues generally frown upon large ownership groups controlling franchises, the NHL decided to forego putting a team in Houston and allow the Oilers' sale to EIG to proceed as they did not want to lose any more Canadian teams – this would have put their lucrative Canadian television contracts in jeopardy.

The Edmonton Investors Group Ltd. is mainly a local ownership group, but includes a few business people from outside the city as well. The Oilers sale even drew interest from Calgary-born comic book creator [[Todd McFarlane]], creator of the famous [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]] character. McFarlane and artist Brent Ashe later designed the Oilers’ third jersey.

The Oilers' new owners have maintained good relations with fans.  As a result, fans in Edmonton backed the league-imposed [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]] of 2004–05, which wiped out an entire season, and came back after the lockout was settled. In the [[2005–06 NHL season]], the Oilers sold out every home game except one, where a computer glitch prevented the release of several hundred tickets.

Following a successful 2005–06 season which saw the Oilers fall one win short of winning the [[Stanley Cup]] and a [[Alberta Advantage|boom in the Albertan economy]], fan support reached its highest levels.  A waiting list for season ticket buyers, unheard of during the days of Pocklington's ownership, was put in place after the owners were compelled to cap the number of season tickets sold.  The team has also announced that a [[lottery]] will be held for the right to purchase multi-game packages at Rexall Place.

==Daryl Katz purchase offers and sale==
In the [[2006–07 NHL season]] the Oilers sold out every home game for the first time, despite missing the playoffs by a substantial margin.  The ownership group then reportedly received a [[Canadian dollar|C$]]145 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|145000000|2007}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) offer from local [[billionaire]] [[Daryl Katz]] for the franchise, although Nichols subsequently said the team was not for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/sports/story.html?id=6bbf307d-d53b-4714-b248-292413dcf2cd&amp;k=90929 |title=Oilers not for sale but bid to buy team won 'a lot of support' |author=MacKinnon, John |publisher=[[canada.com]] |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025033550/http://www.canada.com/topics/sports/story.html?id=6bbf307d-d53b-4714-b248-292413dcf2cd&amp;k=90929 |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daryl Katz]] upped the offer to C$150 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|150000000|2007}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}), but was turned down again.

On August 7, [[Daryl Katz]] made a 3rd offer for the team of C$185 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|185000000|2007}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}). [[Cal Nichols]], spokesman for the EIG, said it amounted to a hostile takeover, and had caused divisions within the EIG.

On December 13, 2007 [[Daryl Katz]] submitted a 4th formal offer to the EIG to buy the franchise. The offer was C$188 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|188000000|2007}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) to the EIG shareholders, plus another $100 million towards the building of a new arena in downtown Edmonton, as well as a new state of the art training facility located at the [[University of Alberta]].

Before the January 21st meeting there were rumours of a rival or plan B offer led by '''Gary Gregg''', '''Bill Butler''', '''Brian Nilsson''' and '''Jakob Ambrosius'''.  These rumours were confirmed on January 23, as the rival faction would match the Katz offer either by soliciting new shareholders or taking a loan from Scotiabank using the hockey club as collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=4d282b56-cd9e-4124-8e58-5bc49e6f5464&amp;k=53067 |title=Rivals 'matching' Katz's Oilers bid |author=Barnes, Dan |publisher=[[canada.com]] |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103212953/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=4d282b56-cd9e-4124-8e58-5bc49e6f5464&amp;k=53067 |archivedate=2012-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eollywood''' is also formally referred to as [[Ethiopia]]n cinema. Eollywood is the informal term popularly used for the [[Amharic|Amharic-language]] film industry based in [[Addis Abeba]]. The film art and technology had been introduced to Ethiopian almost as equal as to Europeans,{{clarify|date=February 2017}} but the industry is in its infant stage due to several geographical, cultural, historical, and religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kindeneh Tamene [http://www.ethiopian-movies.com/articles/a-brief-overview-of-ethiopian-film-history_1.html "A brief overview of Ethiopian movie history"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cabiria poster.jpg|thumb|Italian film ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914), one of the earliest epic films and one of the most influential movies ever made]]

'''Epic films''' are a style of filmmaking with large scale, sweeping scope, and spectacle. The usage of the term has shifted over time, sometimes designating a film [[genre]] and at other times simply synonymous with big budget filmmaking. Like [[epic poetry|epics]] in the classical literary sense it is often focused on a [[hero|heroic character]]. An epic's ambitious nature helps to set it apart from other types of film such as the [[period piece]] or [[adventure film]].

Epic historical films would usually take a historical or a mythical event and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by an expansive [[film score|musical score]] with an [[ensemble cast]], which would make them among the most expensive of films to produce. The most common subjects of epic films are royalty,  and important figures from various periods in world history.&lt;ref name="filmsite"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tim Dirks |title=Epic Films |publisher=Filmsite |date=12 July 2008 |url=http://www.filmsite.org/epicsfilms.html |accessdate=12 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The term "epic" originally came from the poetic genre exemplified by such works as the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', or the ''[[Odyssey]]''. In classical literature, epics are considered works focused on deeds or journeys of heroes upon which the fate of a large number of people depend. Similarly, films described as "epic" typically take a historical character, or a [[myth]]ic heroic figure. Common subjects of epics are [[Royal family|royalty]], [[gladiators]], great military leaders, or leading personalities from various periods in world history. However, there are some films described as "epic" almost solely on the basis of their enormous scope and the sweeping panorama of their settings such as ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' or ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' that do not have the typical substance of classical epics but are directed in an epic style.

When described as "epic" because of content, an epic movie is often set during a time of war or other societal crisis, while usually covering a longer span of time sometimes throughout entire generations coming and passing away, in terms of both the events depicted and the running time of the film. Such films usually have a historical setting, although [[fantasy]] or [[science fiction]] settings have become common in recent decades. The central conflict of the film is usually seen as having far-reaching effects, often changing the course of [[history]]. The main characters' actions are often central to the resolution of the societal conflict.

In its classification of films by genre, the [[American Film Institute]] limits the genre to historical films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''. However, film scholars such as Constantine Santas are willing to extend the label to science-fiction films such as ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Responding to film: a text guide for students of cinema art |last=Santas |first=Constantine |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location= |isbn=978-0-8304-1580-9 |page=32 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn Ramey suggests that "Surely one of the hardest film genres to define is that of the "epic" film, encompassing such examples as ''Ben-Hur'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''....and more recently, ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films...none of these comes from literary epics ''per se'', and there is little that links them with one another. Among those who espouse film genre studies, epic is one of the most despised and ignored genres"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hollywood in the Holy Land: essays on film depictions of the Crusades and Christian-Muslim clashes |last=Haydock |first=Nickolas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=978-0-7864-4156-3 |page=153 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, although the ''American Movie Channel'' formally defines epic films as historical films, they nonetheless state the epic film may be combined with the genre of science-fiction and cite ''Star Wars'' as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/epicsfilms.html |title=AMC Film Site Epics/Historical Films |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistically, films classed as epic usually employ spectacular settings and specially designed costumes, often accompanied by a sweeping musical score, and an [[ensemble cast]] of [[bankable star]]s. Epics are usually among the most expensive of films to produce. They often use on-location filming, authentic period [[costume]]s, and [[Action film|action]] scenes on a massive scale. [[Biographical film]]s may be less lavish versions of this genre.

Many writers may refer to any film that is "long" (over two hours) as an epic, making the definition epic a matter of dispute, and raise questions as to whether it is a "genre" at all. As [[Roger Ebert]] put it, in his "Great Movies" article on ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20010902%2FREVIEWS08%2F109020301%2F1023 |title=Lawrence of Arabia (1962) |accessdate=2007-06-18 |author=Roger Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=2001-09-02 |work=Great Movies |publisher=suntimes.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050904211006/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20010902%2FREVIEWS08%2F109020301%2F1023 |archivedate=2005-09-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The word ''epic'' in recent years has become synonymous with ''big budget [[B-movie|B picture]].'' What you realize watching ''Lawrence of Arabia'' is that the word ''epic'' refers not to the cost or the elaborate production, but to the size of the ideas and vision. Werner Herzog's ''[[Aguirre: The Wrath of God]]'' didn't cost as much as the catering in ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', but it is an epic, and ''Pearl Harbor'' is not.}}

The comedy film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' had the joking [[tagline]] "Makes ''Ben-Hur'' look like an epic."

==History==
The epic is among the oldest of film genres, with one early notable example being [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s ''[[Cabiria]]'', a three-hour [[silent film]], about the [[Punic Wars]], that laid the groundwork for the subsequent silent epics of [[D. W. Griffith]].

The genre reached a peak of popularity in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name="allmovie"&gt;{{cite news |last=allmovie |title=Explore by genre:Epic |publisher=allmovieg |date=2008-07-12 |url=http://www.allmovie.com/genre/epic-d657 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; when  Hollywood frequently collaborated with foreign film studios (such as Rome's [[Cinecittà]]) to use relatively exotic locations in [[Spain]], [[Morocco]], and elsewhere for the production of epic films such as ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961) or ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962). This boom period of international co-productions is generally considered to have ended with ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963), ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1964), and ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965). Nevertheless, films in this genre continued to appear, with one notable example being ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'', which was released in the former [[Soviet Union]] during 1967-1968 and, directed by [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], and said to be the most expensive film ever made.

Epic films continue to be produced, although since the development of CGI they typically use computer effects instead of an actual cast of thousands. Since the 1950s, such films have regularly been shot with a wide [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] for a more immersive and panoramic theatrical experience.

Epic films were recognized in a montage at the [[78th Academy Awards|2006 Academy Awards]].

==Public reception==

===Gross revenue===
The enduring popularity of the epic is often accredited to their ability to appeal to a wide audience. Many of the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing films of all-time]] have been epics.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=All Time Box Office Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation |accessdate=2007-07-12 |author=Box Office Mojo |authorlink=Box Office Mojo |date= |work= |publisher=Box Office Mojo }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which is cited as helping to revive the genre, grossed $658 million domestically and over $2.1 billion worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of all-time behind the 2009 film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm All Time Domestic Box Office Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; another epic which grossed $2.7 billion worldwide. If inflation is taken into account, then the historical epic ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' becomes the highest-grossing film ever in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=All Time Box Office Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjusted for inflation it earned the equivalent of $1.6 billion in the United States alone.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt; Adjusted for ticket price inflation, the science fiction/fantasy epic ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' stands at number 2, with an inflated gross of $1.4 billion in the United States.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;

===Academy Awards===
So far the most Academy Awards ever won by a single film stands at 11. This feat has only been achieved by 3 movies (''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'') all of which are considered epics.

'''''FlatOut 2''''' is a [[racing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Bugbear Entertainment]] and published by [[Empire Interactive]]. It is the sequel to the 2004 game ''[[FlatOut (video game)|FlatOut]]''.

This game is themed more on the street racing/import tuner scene than its predecessor. A notable change is the tire grip; players can take more control of their car, worrying less about skidding in tight turns. The game has three car classes: derby, race, and street.

It was released in Russia on June 29, 2006, in Europe on June 30, 2006, and in North America on August 1, 2006 In 2008, an OS X version of the game was released by [[Virtual Programming]] In 2014, a Linux version of the game was released on [[GOG.com]] as part of the launch of Linux support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gog.com/news/gogcom_now_supports_linux |title=GOG.com now supports Linux! |publisher=[[GOG.com]] |date=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

===Ragdoll physics===
The ragdoll physics in the sequel have been greatly updated. During the race, the driver may be thrown out of the car if slammed into a wall at a high speed. In the numerous [[Stunt]] [[minigames]] the goal is to shoot yourself out of the car and complete objectives like knocking down a set of [[bowling]] pins, hitting the designated spots on a [[dartboard]], score a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] or fly through flaming hoops. Players must use '[[aerobatics]]' to control the driver in-flight, but overusing it will increase [[drag (physics)|drag]], which will slow the driver down and possibly prevent him/her from reaching the designated target. If the driver falls short of the target, players can use the "nudge". This gives the driver a small upward boost and slightly reduces drag. In the Stone Skipping Stunt minigame, the players must use nudge just as the driver hits the surface of the water to skip the most efficiently and reach the furthest.

==Remake==
In 2008, the game was [[Video game remake|re-released]] for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] with additional features and a new soundtrack, under the new name ''[[FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage]]'' for the Xbox 360 and PC, and ''FlatOut: Head On'' for the PSP.

A '''graphics coordinator''', '''GC''', or '''font assist''' is an individual who works, usually on a [[television]] show, as a [[Television producer|producer]] of on-air [[graphics|still]] and [[motion graphics]].  The graphics coordinator decides what content should be displayed on-air - such as on a fullpage (a full-screen graphic) or a [[lower third]] (a bar graphic appearing in the lower third of the screen).  The GC should not be confused with the [[Operator (profession)|Operator]], who usually operates a [[character generator]] (CG) and is part of a [[television crew]], or a [[broadcast designer]] who physically creates the graphics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://study.com/articles/Graphics_Coordinator_Job_Information_for_Students_Considering_a_Career_as_a_Graphics_Coordinator.html study.com Graphics Coordinator: Job &amp; Career Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

A CG ([[3D computer graphics]]) coordinator or supervisor plays an important role in [[film]] and television productions.  His or her role is to supervise, manage, and administer the [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) digital production [[computer animation]] [[workflow]] for the film or [[television show]].  He or she is also there at client meetings and [[conference call]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mymajors.com/career/graphics-coordinator/ mymajors.com Graphics Coordinator: Career]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CG supervisor generally is in charge or has senior input regarding artist management and resource planning, and also plays a senior role in digital productions.  While it is a creative role, most supervisors possess a strong technical background and are capable of making informed decisions about the most efficient and effective techniques to employ in order to solve the problem at hand.  Often, a supervisor will work in tandem with a [[visual effects producer]], [[VFX creative director]] and [[visual effects supervisor]].

Specific responsibilities vary somewhat, depending on the nature of the production; however, most supervisors:
* Handle a CG project from conception through to completion;
* Manage and direct the technical, artistic, and production staff;
* Possess a knowledge of various computer graphic techniques, with emphasis on technical aspects, pipelines, and general film knowledge; 
* Constantly improve workflow and artist training, with an eye on efficiency;
* Collaborate on the bidding and negotiation processes.

There is no union for CG supervisors; however, the [[Visual Effects Society]] is a prominent [[trade organization]] representing the interests of visual effects [[professional]]s.

{{main|AKTV}}
'''[[AKTV]]''', [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]'s former primetime sports and active lifestyle programming arm, AKTV has a block time contract with [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]] that gives it the primetime slot from 5-11 pm on weekdays and 11:00 am to 11:00 pm on weekends in the government sequestered network, it was announced that [[MediaQuest Holdings]]/TV5 chairman [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]] due to expiration contract between AKTV and IBC expires in May 2013.

The development is not expected to affect the [[PBA Commissioner's Cup|Commissioner’s Cup]] coverage since the tournament would be over by the time the [[AKTV]]-[[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]] deal expires, but the board will have to sit down again soon to discuss on which free television channel the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] games will be aired next.

With [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC-13]] being eyed for [[privatization]] by the government, the station can no longer agree to any long-term contract with blocktimers due to high costs and poor ratings, while [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] is currently loaded with programing during its primetime slot, including an hour-long newscast.

'''''J.U.L.I.A. Among the Stars''''' is a 2014 [[video game]] by CBE Software. It is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of ''[[J.U.L.I.A.]]'', featuring improved graphics, a different gameplay and an expanded story.&lt;ref name=AG&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Katie|title=J.U.L.I.A. Among the Stars review|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/27375 |website=Adventure Gamers |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
J.U.L.I.A. is an interfaced based [[point and click adventure]] game. Throughout the game the player controls various computer interfaces and a reconnaissance robot for planetary exploration.

== Plot ==
In 2430, the expedition was sent to a distant star system. Rachel Manners, an astrobiologist who is part of the expedition, is awakened from cryogenic sleep by the ship's artificially intelligent computer J.U.L.I.A. when the ship is damaged by asteroids. It is revealed that all other members of the expedition were awakened 60 years ago and died due to unknown circumstances.

Rachel and J.U.L.I.A. start to investigate what happened. The exploration of planets is provided by MOBOT, an exploration lunar robot. They reveal that before all incidents that killed the crew happened, there was an incident during which the crew attacked an inhabited planet, Ambrosia, that suffers from a poisoned lake that kills their planet. The crew then decided to cover up the incident by destroying Ambrosians with advanced weapon. Rachel is shocked by this fact. They eventually find a temple where they meet a member of a race of stone-like beings that oversees balance in the universe. They are told about a race of Ancients that humiliated Ambrosians for their advanced culture and destroyed their home world before exiling them to Ambrosia. Ancients then poisoned the lake on Ambrosia, which kills the environment.

Rachel, MOBOT and J.U.L.I.A. are tasked with defeating Xir, a monster on planet Xenophon. The decide to use the weapon originally supposed to cover up the crew's failure. MOBOT eventually meets Xir and is attacked by him but MOBOT avoids Xir. Xir is destroyed in the end by the weapon and is revealed to be a weapon. Rachel then finds a new planet. It was a home world of Ancients before stone-like beings destroyed them. Rachel finds out that the crew was killed by J.U.L.I.A. who tried to protect Ambrosians. She is shocked but in the end she reconciles with this fact. They also find a way to help Ambrosians but they need to use resources necessary to get home.

If player decides to get back on Earth J.U.L.I.A. puts Rachel to cryogenic sleep and departs to Earth. If player decides to help the Ambrosians, the lake is purified and Rachel wants to live with Ambrosians but MOBOT and J.U.L.I.A. reveal that she would be slain by them. They depart for new adventures. The game ends with Rachel doing some job as a stone-like creature is shown to watch her. After the final credits, MOBOT is seen enjoying his time on a Planet Zenobia.

==Development==
The original game was released in 2012 by Lace Mamba. It gained mixed reviews from players and CBE Software got into trouble as the publisher didn't pay the amount prescribed by the contract. It got CBE Software into financial trouble that the company eventually handled by launching an [[Indiegogo]] campaign for the Enhanced Edition of ''[[J.U.L.I.A.]]''. The required amount was $5,000 but developers raised $14,200 and the game was also Greenlighted for [[Steam (software)|Steam]] release. The project eventually transformed into a full-fledged remake and was released in October 2014.&lt;ref name=jkavan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Böke|first1=Ingmar|title=Jan Kavan - J.U.L.I.A.

The game was also sold directly by the developers via their own [[DRM-free]] webshop, additionally to [[gog.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.cbe-software.com/index.php CBE software DRM free store] on cbe-software&lt;/ref&gt; They had to stop direct sale due to a changed [[EU VAT]] legislation in 2015.

'''Japanese traditional dance''' has a long history, the oldest known ones may be among those transmitted through the ''[[kagura]]'' tradition, or folk dances relating to food producing activities such as planting rice (''[[dengaku]]'') and fishing, including rain dances.&lt;ref name="frederic1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Japan Encyclopedia|first= Louis |last=Frederic |page=147 |publisher=Harvard University Press |edition=new  |date=6 May 2005|isbn=978-0674017535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are large number of these traditional dances, which are often subfixed -''odori'', -''asobi'', and -''mai'', and may be specific to a region or village.&lt;ref name="frederic1"/&gt;  ''Mai'' and ''Odori'' are the two main groups of Japanese dances, and the term ''[[Buyō]]'' (舞踊) was coined in modern times as a general term for "dance", by combining ''mai'' (舞, which can also be pronounced ''bu'') and ''odori'' (踊, can also be pronounced ''yō'').&lt;ref name=oshima&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wtkm3O3nWXkC&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture |first=Mark|last=Oshima|editor= Sandra Buckley |publisher=Routledge |date=29 June 2009|isbn=978-0415481526 |page=75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mai'' is a more reserved genre of dance that often has circling movements, and dances of the [[Noh]] theatre are of this tradition.&lt;ref name=oshima /&gt;  A variation of the ''Mai'' style of Japanese [[dance]] is the Kyomai or [[Kyoto]]-style dance.  Kyomai developed in the 17th century [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] cultural period. It is heavily influenced by the elegance and sophistication of the manners often associated with the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  ''Odori'' has more vigorous stepping movements and is more energetic, and dances of the [[kabuki]] theatre belong to this category.&lt;ref name=oshima /&gt;

There are several types of traditional Japanese dance..

===Kabuki===
[[File:Renjishi by Heisei Nakamura-za during the APEC Summit week.jpg|thumb|upright||A ''[[Renjishi]]'' performance]]
{{main|Kabuki}}  
{{Nihongo|Kabuki|歌舞伎}} is a classical [[Japan]]ese [[dance]]-[[drama]]. Kabuki theatre is known for the stylization of its drama and for the elaborate [[make-up]] worn by some of its performers.

The individual [[kanji]] [[Ideogram|character]]s, from left to right, mean ''sing'' (歌), ''dance'' (舞), and ''skill'' (伎). Kabuki is therefore sometimes translated as "the art of singing and dancing". These are, however, ''[[ateji]]'' characters which do not reflect actual [[etymology]]. The kanji of 'skill' generally refers to a performer in kabuki theatre. Since the word ''kabuki'' is believed to derive from the verb ''kabuku'', meaning "to lean" or "to be out of the ordinary", ''kabuki'' can be interpreted as "avant-garde" or "bizarre" theatre.&lt;ref name="Frederic"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Japan Encyclopedia|first= Louis |last=Frederic |pages=441&amp;ndash;442 |publisher=Harvard University Press|edition=new |date=6 May 2005|isbn=978-0674017535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression ''kabukimono'' (歌舞伎者) referred originally to those who were bizarrely dressed and swaggered on a street.

The history of kabuki began in 1603, when [[Izumo no Okuni]], possibly a miko of [[Izumo Taisha]], began performing a new style of dance drama in the dry riverbeds of Kyoto, and they were then called "strange" or "unusual" (Kabuki).&lt;ref name="Frederic"/&gt; This new form of dance drama is thought to have been derived from folk-dances performed only by women, ''Furyū-ō Odori'' and ''Nembu Odori''.&lt;ref name="Frederic"/&gt; Kabuki became a common form of entertainment in the [[ukiyo]], or [[Yoshiwara]], the registered red-light district in Edo. During the Genroku era, kabuki thrived. The structure of a kabuki play was formalized during this period, as were many elements of style. Conventional character types were established,the types were established because of the emperor at the time Kharun the worshiped.

===Noh Mai===
{{main|Noh}}
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=August 2014}}
The origin of the Noh Mai can be traced back to as far as the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="The Noh"&gt;[http://www.the-noh.com/en/world/dance.html Introducing the world of Noh : Noh Dance]. The-noh.com. Retrieved on 2012-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-staff.it.uts.edu.au/~don/pubs/noh.html Noh Dancing]. Don Herbison-Evans (2009-05-07). [https://web.archive.org/web/20090702002320/http://www-staff.it.uts.edu.au/~don/pubs/noh.html archived] at the [[Wayback Machine]], 2009-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Noh Mai is a dance that is done to music that is made by flutes and small hand drums. At some points they dance to vocal and percussion music, these points are called kuse or kiri. Noh Mai dances are put together by a series of forms.&lt;ref name="The Noh" /&gt; Forms are patterns of body movements that are done elegantly and with beauty.

There are several types of  Noh Mai dances. A type that is neither slow nor fast is called Chu No Mai. A female usually performs this type of dance. A slower type of dance is the Jo No Mai. A female does this dance as well and can dress up as either a ghost of a noble woman, a spirit or deity. A male’s dance is Otoko Mai. The performer does not wear a mask in this dance and is portraying the character as being heroic. Another male dance is Kami Mai, where the dancer acts as though he is a deity. This is a very fast dance. The female version of this would be Kagura and can be performed in various ways. Gaku is a dance that is imitates music played by the imperial court and is usually done by the main character. These six types make up the Noh Mai dance and help give the dance its beauty.

Costumes are a huge part of Noh Mai. Sometimes a dance or play may start out very slowly, so the actors create very flamboyant costumes to keep the audience interested. They also dress to fit the region in which they represent, such as a bamboo hat worn during a play would represent country life. The most important part of the costume is the mask. The Noh Mai masks are thought to be the most artistic masks in Japan. The masks are only worn by the main characters.&lt;ref&gt;Ishii, 1994, pg. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the masks have neutral expressions so it is the job of the actor to bring the character to life.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt Rivers Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nihon Buyō===
[[File:Japan-Kyoto-Geisha.jpg|thumb|Two [[maiko]] performing a dance]]
{{main|Buyō}}
Nihon Buyō is different from most other traditional dances.&lt;ref name="nihonbuyou"&gt;[http://www.nihonbuyou.or.jp/english/nihonbuyo.htm The Japanese Classical Dance Association Inc.｜What is nihon buyo?].

Nihon Buyō is a refined dance that has been improved throughout four centuries.&lt;ref name="nihonbuyou" /&gt; There are four parts to Nihon Buyō, the most significant part being Kabuki Buyō.&lt;ref name="nihonbuyou" /&gt; Nihon Buyō was created directly from Kabuki Buyō before it became theater. The second part of Nihon Buyō is Noh.&lt;ref name="nihonbuyou" /&gt; Nihon Buyō takes a few key elements from Noh such as the circular movements and the tools used in its dances. The third part of these dances comes from the folk dances; the spinning and jumping used in folk dances was incorporated into Nihon Buyō. The last part came from a mixture of European and American culture that is found in Japan today.&lt;ref name="nihonbuyou" /&gt; Today, with the combination of these dances we have Nihon Buyō, a refined dance that has become an art form made for entertainment on stage.{{POV statement|date=August 2014}}

===Folk dances===
[[File:Culture Day Parade (Nagoya, Japan).jpg|thumb|Dancers in Nagoya]]
There are a wide variety of folk dances in Japan. Folk dances are often the basis from which other dance forms developed. An example of a Japanese folk dance is the {{Nihongo|sparrow dance|雀踊り|suzume odori}} is a dance based upon the fluttering movements of the [[Eurasian tree sparrow]].&lt;ref name="aoba"&gt;[http://www.aoba-matsuri.com/english/e-suzume.html Sendai Suzume Odori (Sendai Sparrow Dance )].

The emblem of the [[Date clan]] incorporates two tree sparrows. The sparrow dance is now performed yearly in [[Sendai]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]] at the Aoba festival in mid-May.&lt;ref name="aoba" /&gt; School children in Miyagi prefecture learn and perform the sparrow dance, especially during the Obon Festival.

'''John Howe''' (born August 21, 1957) is a Canadian book [[illustrator]], living in [[Neuchâtel]], Switzerland.{{when|date=August 2013}} One year after graduating from high school, he studied in a college in [[Strasbourg]], France, then at the [[Haute école des arts du Rhin|École des arts décoratifs]] in the same town.

He is best known for his work based on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s worlds. Howe and  Tolkien artist [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]] served as chief conceptual designers for [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' movie trilogy]], and Howe also did the illustration for the [[Lord of the Rings (board game)|''Lord of the Rings'']] [[board game]] created by Reiner Knizia. Howe also re-illustrated the maps of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in 1996&amp;ndash;2003. His work is however not limited to this, and includes images of myths such as the Anglo Saxon legend of [[Beowulf]] (he also illustrated Knizia's board game ''[[Beowulf: The Legend]]''). Howe illustrated many other books, amongst which many belong to the fantasy genre ([[Robin Hobb]]'s books for instance.) He also contributed to the film adaptation of ''[[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]]. In 2005 a limited edition of [[George R. R. Martin]]'s novel ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' was released by [[Meisha Merlin]], complete with numerous illustrations by Howe.

Howe has illustrated cards for the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' collectible card game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.john-howe.com/portfolio/gallery/categories.php?cat_id=56&amp;page=2 |title=Portfolio |publisher=John Howe|accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' films, original director [[Guillermo del Toro]] and replacement director [[Peter Jackson]] both consulted with Howe and fellow conceptual artist [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]] to ensure continuity of design.

Howe is a member of the [[living history]] group the [[Company of Saynt George]], and has considerable expertise in ancient and medieval armour and armaments.

==Biography==
John Howe was born in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia. He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help. Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art classes full, and left him in classes like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology class though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for classmates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]], and [[Bernie Wrightson]]. In his adolescence, Howe read ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. He said he got "a real spark" from the [[Brothers Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt calendars]], which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.john-howe.com/biography |title=Biography |publisher=John Howe |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106004532/http://www.john-howe.com/biography/ |archivedate=6 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alexis Metzinger et John Howe.jpg|thumb|John Howe]]
A year after his high school graduation, Howe found himself in [[Strasbourg, France]] attending college. The following year, he enrolled into the [[Haute école des arts du Rhin|École des arts décoratifs]]. He cites his experience of this period as follows:

{{quote|The first year was spent not understanding much, the second at odds with what I did manage to understand, and the third eager to get out, although in retrospect I certainly owe whatever clarity of thought I possess to the patience of the professor of Illustration.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;}}

Throughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was "simultaneously ancient and novel." He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his "The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of [[Barad-dûr]]", a piece inspired by Tolkien's, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe's earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of "his" in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

Projects in which Howe worked include ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s Books and Merchandise, ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Robin Hobb]]'s books, ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe]]'', Cards for ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''. Howe has also written and illustrated children's books.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

The Lingerie Basketball League held its inaugural season in 2011 with four [[Los Angeles]] based teams. The L.A. Beauties won the first championship.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The LBL held a second season in 2012, but there was no championship game. A championship game between the L.A. Divas and L.A. Glam was announced, but never held.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The LBL did not play in 2013 and is currently inactive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6454">'''Moments''' ({{lang-es|Instantes}}) is the title of a text wrongly attributed to [[Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. It was widely spread through articles, compilations, posters and [[email]] [[chain letters]], mainly in Spanish.

Spanish versions, with some variations, consist of a first person narrated poem about an 85-year-old person who regrets not having enjoyed some simple pleasures during his life and instead having focused on safety and correctness. 

The vocabulary, syntax and style do not match those of Borges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetaleph.com/detail/showdetail.asp?objtype=4&amp;objid=4&amp;langid=en&amp;pid=74 Internetaleph], Martin Hadis' site on The Life &amp; Works of Jorge Luis Borges. Retrieved January 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original text and author ==
The first known version of the text was authored by American humorist and cartoonist [[Don Herold]], and published by [[College_Humor_(magazine)|College Humor]] before 1935, or perhaps early that year, under the title "I'd Pick More Daisies". &lt;ref&gt;Excerpts from Herold's text are found in 
{{cite journal

}} Portions of this article, including attribution of the quoted passages, can be [https://books.google.com/books?ei=FJsYVKGYH-jhsATNlIAo&amp;id=_RdMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22i%27d+pick+more+daisies%22+%22college+humor%22&amp;q=%22daisies%22&amp;redir_esc=y read from Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Herold's text is in prose, and it lacks the melancholic tone of the Spanish poem. E.g.:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I had my life to live over, I'd try to make more mistakes next time. I would relax. I would limber up. I would be sillier than I have been this trip. I know of very few things that I would take seriously. I would be crazier. I would be less hygienic. I would take more chances. I would take more trips. I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers. I would burn up more gasoline. I would eat more ice cream and less bran.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Herold published a revised version in the October 1953 number of [[Reader's Digest]].&lt;ref name="borges.pitt.edu"&gt;[http://www.borges.pitt.edu/bsol/iainst.php University of Pittsburgh, Borges Center] ''Jorge Luis Borges, autor del poema "Instantes"'', by Iván Almeida. Retrieved January 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinglifefully.com/flo/floidpickmoredaisies.htm I'd Pick More Daisies], full text, Living Life Fully Retrieved January 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== English and Spanish apocryphal versions ==
Another English version, attributed to one Nadine Stair or Nadine Strain, starts:&lt;ref name="borges.pitt.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;A text with the title If I Had My Life to Live Over is attributed to "Nadine Stair" in a compilation of works under the same title by Sandra Martz, {{ISBN|978-0-918949-25-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I Had My Life to Live Over I'd dare to make more mistakes next time. I'd relax, I would limber up. I would be sillier than I have been this trip. I would take fewer things seriously. I would take more chances. I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers. I would eat more ice cream and less beans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This version, supposedly written by Nadine Stair, is the most common version in North America. However it is doubtful that Nadine Stair ever existed. Just how Nadine Stair came to attributed as the author is unknown. Nonetheless, what is known, is that Sandar Martz produced an anthology of poems dealing with women and aging &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In this anthology she attributes Don Herold's poem, with some modifications, to a certain Nadine Stair. This was likely done because the anthology was sold as being written by women, for women—and consequently, a poem written by a man would not have appealed to female readers.            

One of the most spread Spanish versions wrongly attributed to Borges starts with the following verses:

{|
|-
|
:'''Spanish apocryphal text'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borges.pitt.edu/bsol/iainst.php|title=Jorge Luis Borges, autor del poema "Instantes"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:'''English translation'''
|-
|
:''Si pudiera vivir nuevamente mi vida''
:''En la próxima trataría de cometer más errores''
:''No intentaría ser tan perfecto, me relajaría más''
:''Sería más tonto de lo que he sido, de hecho''
:''tomaría muy pocas cosas con seriedad''
:''Sería menos higiénico''
|
:''If I could live my life again''
:''Next time I would try to make more mistakes''
:''I would not try to be so perfect, I would relax more''
:''I would be sillier than I was, in fact''
:''I would take very few things seriously''
:''I would be less hygienic''
|}

== Most important wrong attributions ==
Spanish versions with the shape of a poem were wrongly attributed to Borges by literary magazines like Mexican ''Plural'' (May 1989, pages 4–5)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Almeida, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; and books (such as [[Elena Poniatowska]]'s "Todo México", page 144).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Almeida, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2005, Irish pop singer [[Bono]], read in Spanish some of the lines of the poem on Mexican TV show [[Teletón (Mexico)|Teletón México 2005]] and attributed them to the "Chilean poet Borges."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/318997.html Envía Bono, de U2, mensaje de aliento durante Teletón], [[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] online, December 3, 2005. Retrieved January 10, 2011. Bono was interviewed by telephone&lt;/ref&gt; 

The attribution error was so extended that even the poet and scholar [[Alastair Reid]] translated one of the Spanish versions into English under the belief that it was a work from Borges. Reid's translations starts,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:If I were able to live my life again,
:next time I would try to make more mistakes.
:I would not try to be so perfect. I would be more relaxed.
:I would be much more foolish than I have been. In fact,
:I would take very few things seriously.
:I would be much less sanitary.&lt;ref&gt;"Moments", translated by Alastair Reid. Queen’s Quarterly 99.3, Fall 1992. Cited by [http://www.borges.pitt.edu/bsol/iainst.php Iván Almeida]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amanda D. Lotz]], the '''multi-channel transition''' began in the early 1980s and lasted about 20 years. Many changes happened during this transition such as the invention of the [[remote control]], the [[video cassette]] player, and [[Analog television|analog cable systems]] expanded viewer's choice and control. This era gave viewers more choice and control over what and when they wanted to view a program. Viewers were able to defy the networks' schedules, because they could record the program and watch it whenever they wanted, using the VCR and later the DVR. Producers adjusted to the government regulations and networks were forced to give up some of the control they had over program creation. [[Pay television|Subscription channels]] emerged with no advertisements and the method for measuring audiences grew with the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] People Meter.

== Background ==
New broadcast networks emerged such as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1986, [[The WB]] in 1995 and the [[UPN]] in 1995 and all added great competition to the original networks, [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[CBS]]. The percentage of people who watched network television dropped from 90% to 64% in the 1980s. During the 1990s, in spite of the new broadcast competitors, viewers carried on to switch from prime time viewing to cable, even though the rate wasn't as high as before. Still, broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, The WB, and UPN) gathered an average of only 58 percent of those watching television at the end of the 1999-2000 season, and only 46 percent in the final of the 2004-2005 season.&lt;ref name=Lotz&gt;Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) "The Television Will Be Revolutionized". New York, NY: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The remote control became standard on most [[television set]]s in the 1980s and that helped the viewers break away from the network era. The [[Video cassette recorder|VCR]] further helped viewers to break away from the network era by enabling them to record a program and view it when they wanted to. The VCR also allowed people to build personal libraries. All of these new technologies allowed the viewer greater choice and control over specific media.

The emergence of so many new networks and channels changed the type of programming produced in order to gain more [[ratings point]]s. Producers and advertisers were now able to target specific people and appeal to a narrower group. The ability for [[cable channel]]s to succeed with smaller audiences made broadcasters' mission more difficult, because viewers now had the option to choose which program would satisfy their needs. Even though cable was readily available, that didn't mean that the viewer would receive every channel they wanted. Cable was then broken down into separate tiers and cable companies offered different packages for different geographic areas. Cable allowed viewers to have special interest in certain programs. The viewers found what channels or shows they liked best once cable was introduced.

During the [[network era]] there were only three networks [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[CBS]]. The elimination of the [[fin-syn]] rules allowed networks greater involvement in production. With so few networks to choose from they (first three networks) held the upper hand in negotiations with studios. With the multi-channel transition production companies now had the upper hand with more networks to buy their shows. Where once the networks had control the production companies now held control.

==New distribution during the multi-channel transition==
During the multi-channel transition, distribution windows expanded to include [[cable network]]s, direct sale on [[VCR]] tapes, and then [[DVD]] and [[Video on demand|VOD]] ([[Video On Demand]]). More recently they have also come to encompass [[Internet]] websites, where episodes can be downloaded or streamed. There has been such a high growing variety of ways for networks to reach viewers, which has also decreased some of the risk of unconventional programs, because new distribution routes provide opportunities to make money on shows that fail to achieve high ratings during [[Television network|network]] runs. [[Internet]] distribution also provides a venue for additional and supplemental programming.&lt;ref name="Lotz"/&gt;

Before the multi-channel transition, only signals broadcast over the air could be received on [[television]] in the home. Later, a range of possibilities developed. [[Cable television]] and [[satellite television]] became common mechanisms of delivery, and companies such as [[AT&amp;T]] and [[Verizon]] also joined the competition of distribution during the mid-2000s. In 2006, [[broadband]] internet distribution of video became overwhelmingly popular, which diminished the domination of cable and satellite as the only source for most channels to be able to reach the home.&lt;ref name="Lotz"/&gt;

'''''Netherworld''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] published by Hewson in 1988. It was originally developed by [[Jukka Tapanimäki]] for the [[Commodore 64]], and original music was composed by Jori Olkkonen.

==Summary==
The object is to fly a small spacecraft and collect as many diamonds as possible from the level. Once enough diamonds are collected, the craft must reach a teleporter to go to the next level before the time runs out. Aside of the time limit, there are various obstacles, ranging from monsters to items which can damage the craft or block the path. The ship can destroy some obstacles by shooting, sometimes turning them to diamonds as well.

The game [[cover art]] features Tapanimäki's face.{{fact|date=July 2017}} The cover art was done without his knowledge and approval. There was friction between the original cover artist and Tapanimäki; Unbeknownst to him, this led to the art getting shelved and new version was made. Tapanimäki did not see the final version until the press conference in London where the game was released, giving him a big shock.

Many{{which?|date=July 2017}} game magazines published a [[cheat code]] that only works in a work-in-progress version; this, along with some published [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]]s, indicated that the game was leaked to pirates some six months before the release.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1119">'''Patati Patatá''' are a pair of [[clown]]s characters that were quite popular performing for [[Brazil]]ian children in the late 2000s. They are a pair of clowns singers who appear on children's [[DVD]]s and [[compact discs|CDs]]. They started their career in 1985 as children's entertainers and as the time went by they became increasingly well known, their popularity peaking between 2010 and 2012. In 2011, they started their own children's TV show in the television network [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]] with high audience ratings for a long time. Their program was similar to the former TV show ''[[Bozo the Clown]]''.

In 2013 the TV show received a redesign, but has low ratings and was canceled in the same year. On October 5, 2015 a new TV show debuted in preschool channel [[Discovery Kids (Latin America)]]: ''[[Parque Patati Patatá]]''.

'''Pintel''' and '''Ragetti''' are recurring characters in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series, primarily providing [[comic relief]] throughout each film. Pintel and Ragetti are portrayed by [[Lee Arenberg]] and [[Mackenzie Crook]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Scott |first1=A. O. |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest - Review - Movies |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/movies/07pira.html |accessdate=June 17, 2018 |date=July 7, 2006 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first appearance occurred in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', when they served under [[Hector Barbossa]] upon the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Pintel and Ragetti, along with Barbossa and the crew of the ''Black Pearl'', share in the Aztec curse and are immortal for the majority of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article680334.ece|title=The Office boy cuts a new dash|publisher=The Times|accessdate=2009-02-27 | location=London | date=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Pintel and Ragetti serve under Captain [[Jack Sparrow]], again providing comic relief and additionally the occasional important insight into other characters. They join the ever-lengthening list of people who want the Dead Man's Chest, hoping to "remove temptation" from the other characters' path and make a profit themselves.

In ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'', Ragetti and Pintel play a more significant part in the plot while still supplying comic relief. In this installment, they serve under Hector Barbossa in the journey to rescue Jack, and then serve in the joint effort by Barbossa and Sparrow to defeat the East India Trading Company. Barbossa uses Ragetti's wooden eye as his "Piece of Eight" (one of a group of nine sacrificial Pieces of Eight used to free Calypso), so Pintel covers his empty eye socket with an eye patch.

In the video game ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow]]'' Pintel and Ragetti are both voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]].

==Fictional biography==

===Early life===
Little is known about the background of either Pintel or Ragetti. According to ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide'', prior to serving as cannoneers aboard the ''Black Pearl'', Ragetti and Pintel spent a year as naval sailors, press-ganged into service for the [[Royal Navy]] before deserting to escape the bad food and abusive treatment. As part of a backstory worked out by both Arenberg and Crook, their characters' full names are Terry Ragetti and Abner Pintel, and that Ragetti was the son of Pintel's sister, and they shared half a brain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuGis4LaRvE Pirates of The Caribbean Pintel And Ragetti – Lee Arengberg Interview – YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; Arenberg also claims Ragetti is the son of a prostitute.{{Fact|date=November 2014}}

===''The Curse of the Black Pearl''===
{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl}}
The two pirates served aboard the ''Black Pearl'' under Captain Sparrow until first mate [[Hector Barbossa]] turned them against him. The crew maroons Jack on an island and leave him to die (though he eventually escapes). Later Captain Barbossa becomes "Captain" much to Bootstrap Bill's fury. Bootstrap was the only one that vouched for Jack during the mutiny and sent a coin to his son Will in order to keep the crew cursed for betraying Jack. Barbossa in response tied a cannon to Bootstrap and threw him overboard the ''Pearl'' only to discover that Bootstrap is needed to lift their curse. They are first seen in ''The Curse of The Black Pearl'' when they invade the governor's house and take [[Elizabeth Swann]] prisoner. In the sea battle between the ''Black Pearl'' and the ''H.M.S. Interceptor'', they fire the chainshot that smashes the ''H.M.S. Interceptor''{{'}}s foremast, making pursuit impossible. They also facilitated the cursed pirates boarding Commodore Norrington's ship, the ''Dauntless'', by dressing in women's clothing to attract the attention of the men on the ship. Their characters provide comic relief during the movie's more intense scenes and provide storyline information. When the curse is broken and the pirates defeated, they are captured and jailed. They serve as secondary antagonists of the movie.

A [[running gag]] throughout the first movie involves characters surrendering themselves to Ragetti and Pintel while invoking the right of "[[parley]]". At first they are pleased with invoking parley but according to the story's premise parley guarantees a prisoner will be escorted unharmed to the captain in order to conduct negotiations. Then they become irritated when all their captures invoke parley especially when Jack Sparrow invokes parley after he was discovered alive. At one point, Pintel snarls at his captives, "If any of you so much as thinks of the word 'parley', I'll have your guts for garters!". After they are captured, Pintel attempts unsuccessfully to invoke parley himself.

There are also frequent gags involving Ragetti's wooden false eye, which causes discomfort and is often knocked out of its socket and has him frantically searching for it; one of Ragetti's professed desires is to have a real ''glass'' eye. It is not known how he lost his real one, though in ''At Worlds End'', it is revealed that the wooden eye is one of the nine "pieces of eight" the Brethren Court used to imprison Calypso in her human form. Barbossa, a pirate lord, gave it to Ragetti for safekeeping. At the end of ''At Worlds End'', Ragetti can be seen carving a new eye. There are also jokes about the two characters' feelings of closeness. Whenever they do, they become embarrassed or angry, and the moment quickly passes; therefore director [[Gore Verbinski]] jokingly described the two as more of a "married couple".

===''Dead Man's Chest''===
{{main|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}

In the sequel, the pair have escaped jail and are rowing a boat to Pelegosto island, along with the dog who holds the keys to the jail cells, whom they have named "Poochie". Ragetti has become somewhat religious, telling Pintel, "Since we're not immortal no more, we gotta take care of our immortal souls" when attempting to read the [[Bible]] (unsuccessfully, holding the book upside down). When they find the ''Black Pearl'' run aground on the island, Pintel convinces Ragetti that taking the ship would be salvage, and that salvaging would be saving it. Although they attempted to steal the ''Black Pearl'', Jack magnanimously, if unintentionally, allows them to rejoin his crew. Although they become more or less loyal members of his crew, the writers state in the DVD commentary that Jack considers them, as well as [[James Norrington]], as the most expendable crew members.

Later, when Jack is searching for Davy Jones's heart and a fight breaks out between himself, Norrington, and [[Will Turner]], Pintel and Ragetti once again have an opportunity to steal something valuable; to convince his partner, Pintel tells Ragetti they will be "removing temptation from their paths" by stealing the Dead Man's Chest. They take it, but do not get far before Elizabeth catches up to them. Pintel greets Elizabeth much as he greeted her when they first met by saying, in an eerie tone, "'ello, poppet". Before they can do anything to her, however, Davy Jones's crew attacks and they drop the chest. When the ''Flying Dutchman''{{'}}s crew overtakes them, they fight alongside Elizabeth, with whom they share the two swords that Ragetti and Pintel had.

Despite their fighting success, they quickly hand their swords to Elizabeth and take off with the chest again, which they promptly lose. When cornered by Jones's men, they still fight with various objects used as improvised weapons.

The two pirates are not without loyalty or humanity. When the Kraken attacks the ''Black Pearl'', Ragetti saves Elizabeth from its deadly tentacle. Both Ragetti and Pintel shed genuine tears of respect and grief over Jack's demise and join the pledge to resurrect their fallen captain; this is ironic, considering they supported and participated in Barbossa's mutiny against Jack and marooned him on the island (the change seems to have come from the fact that he came back for and "sacrificed" himself for his crew, including them).

The comic duo (especially Ragetti) can unexpectedly engage in erudite and intelligent discussions. In these discussions, Ragetti often proves that he is more educated than he appears, even though he is illiterate, though Ragetti argues the point. When [[Tia Dalma]] says that something vexed Davy Jones so much that he abandoned land for an eternal life at sea, Ragetti asks whether this was "the [[dichotomy]] of [[good and evil]]", causing Pintel and [[Joshamee Gibbs|Gibbs]] to give him astonished looks. The two also engage in a debate over the proper pronunciation of "[[Kraken]]", with Pintel saying he believes the correct pronunciation is "kray-ken" while most say "krack-en". Ragetti explains that the derivation of the word is from original [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], and thus should be pronounced "krah-ken". Pintel points out they are not "Original Scandinavians", to which Ragetti retorts, "It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants!". Ragetti also displays a knack for knowing things he should not, such as the reasons for which Jack, Will, and Norrington each want the heart of [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] (Jack to control Jones and protect himself, Will to free his father from the less-than-friendly bond between the [[Flying Dutchman]] and her crew, and Norrington to restore his honor). This tendency had earlier appeared in ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'', wherein Ragetti compares a ruse used by himself and Pintel to the ruse of the [[Trojan Horse]] while they were distracting the Royal Navy by pretending to be women: "It's just like what the Greeks done at Troy... 'cept they was in a horse, not dresses. Wooden horse".

===''At World's End''===
{{main|Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End}}

Before the movie was released, the actors announced that the characters of Ragetti and Pintel would play roles of some importance to the plot. In an interview with Empire magazine (Australia) Mackenzie Crook says "You sort of discover that Lee (Arenberg) and I are there for more than just comic relief in the third movie. It turns out that we do have a purpose in the grand scheme of things". As seen in the trailer and in the movie itself, the two throw swords up through floorboards of Sao Feng's bathhouse to Elizabeth and Barbossa, allowing them to defend themselves when both Feng and the East India Trading Company attack.

In Davy Jones' Locker, when Jack is "choosing" his crew members, he refuses Ragetti, saying, "Don't need you, you scare me", though he comes anyway. When Barbossa asks 'Where you would be going Jack?' with the charts in his hands, clearly alluding to the fact that he, and not Jack ought to be the captain, Pintel and Ragetti are seen standing behind Barbossa with a sadistic smile in their faces, indicating that once they have learnt that contrary to what they had been thinking up to then, Jack hadn't really ′sacrificed′ himself to Kraken to save their lives, but was rather pushed into it courtesy Elizabeth, they are no longer loyal to Jack.  When Jack asks the crew if anyone saved him because they missed him and not to serve their own ends, the two are among the few (including Jack the Monkey) to raise their hands. Later, when Barbossa and Sparrow arguing over who is ''Black Pearl's'' captain, Pintel yells at them to stop arguing, leaving the two briefly stunned into silence. Realizing his precarious position, he apologizes, saying he is under the impression that the position of captain is open to election. Ragetti consoles his old friend by saying "I would have voted for you".

Ragetti's eye is used in a ritual to free Calypso; when Barbossa fails to release her, Ragetti steps in, correctly delivering the incantation "as if to a lover", triggering the spell in a well-deserved 'shining moment' for his character.

At the film's end, the two serve aboard the ''Black Pearl'', which Barbossa has again commandeered from Jack.  Pintel says about the matter: "Some of the men don't feel entirely ''settled'' about leaving Captain Jack behind again". When Barbossa asked if that was so, Pintel says "It would make us feel a whole lot better, regarding our fortunes, if we could see that ''item'' you told us about.", the item meaning the [[Fountain of Youth]]  (This mirrors Barbossa asking for the coordinates of the Chest of Cortes while planning a mutiny.)  When Barbossa shows them the charts, a big hole appears where the map's crucial component was removed by Sparrow. Ragetti is also seen making a new wooden eye for himself.

In the third installment, Ragetti again shows that he is more educated than he appears when he says ''"Actually, it's a [[cephalopod]]"'' after Pintel calls the dead Kraken a "stupid fish".

===''On Stranger Tides'' and ''Dead Men Tell No Tales''===
Pintel and Ragetti are not seen or mentioned in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]'', as the "Black Pearl" is attacked and taken by [[Blackbeard]]. Barbossa was able to survive the attack. Their further fate is currently unknown. During the production of the fourth film, they were originally supposed to make an appearance, but director [[Rob Marshall]] opted out of the idea as he feared their roles would be cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordplayer.com/archives/rossio10.Sail.Tide.html Wordplayer.com: WORDPLAY/Archives/"We Sail With the Tide" by Terry Rossio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also are not seen or mentioned in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''. However, since [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Murtogg and Mullroy|Murtogg]], [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Murtogg and Mullroy|Mullroy]], and [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Marty|Marty]] returned to the series, despite having previously been implied to be either trapped in Blackbeard's bottle or slain in battle, it is possible that Pintel and Ragetti could return in a future installment.

Both Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook commented on the possibility of returning as Pintel and Ragetti. Arenberg confirmed in several interviews that, despite wanting to return to the fourth film, he hoped to reprise his role as Pintel. In an interview on November 7, 2014, Crook confirmed that he had received a call of availability from Disney for the film, although stated that he was uncertain about whether he wanted to reprise his role. Crook declined to reprise his role ultimately, in order to focus on his television series ''[[Detectorists]]''. He said he felt "pangs of nostalgia," when the cast and crew filmed the film without him. Furthermore, shortly before filming started, Arenberg announced on Twitter that he would not reprise his role as well, despite having been interested in doing so.

==Characteristics==

===Behavior===
Pintel and Ragetti appear and act nearly always together; therefore their roles in the film series have been compared with those of [[Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd]] in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''.
Several scenes that feature them became recurring jokes/motifs in the series with the release of the sequel. For example:
*In the first movie, during a scene where Ragetti and Pintel are manning a cannon, Ragetti's removable eye was hit by a fork (which is being used as a replacement for a cannonball by the hijacked ''Interceptor'''s crew), Ragetti and Pintel look at the fork and then slowly look through the cannon gunport at the ''Interceptor''. This scene is repeated in the second movie (with exactly the same camera angles) when Ragetti and Pintel look out at the Kraken's tentacle, which is pressed against the ''Pearl''. The shot is repeated a third time in the final movie, wherein they have loaded the cannon with Jack the Monkey.
*The scene where Ragetti looks frantically for his eye (the first movie it is during the fight against Norrington's fleet, and in the second it is as they are attempting to steal the ''Pearl'') is repeated with the same camera angles.
*In the first movie, when Ragetti and Pintel find Elizabeth, Pintel says "'ello, Poppet". This scene is repeated in the second movie; when both turn on Elizabeth for the treasure, Pintel repeats that line. Towards the end of ''At World's End'', Pintel says "Goodbye, Poppet" to Elizabeth as she leaves the ship.
*Their first scene in ''Dead Man's Chest'' involves them travelling into a rowing boat; large waves causes the boat to capsize, knocking the two into the sea. This is repeated briefly in ''At World's End'', wherein the two are attempting rowing to the shore of an uninhabited island, their boat capsizing again.

They are the [[wikt:counterpart|counterpart]]s to the two Royal Marines Murtogg and Mullroy. The two [[comic relief]] pairs are united at the end of the movie, where [[List of minor characters in Pirates of the Caribbean#Mullroy and Murtogg|Murtogg and Mullroy]], disguised as pirates, celebrate the victory of the pirates after running away from their posts after they failed to keep Davy Jones' heart safe.

By the second movie, Ragetti becomes very religious. He is seen trying to read a Bible upside down, even when Pintel reveals that Ragetti cannot read (to which Ragetti retorts, "It's the Bible, you get credit for tryin'."). His reason for doing so is the idea that, having lost his immortality, he is worried about the afterlife of his [[soul]]. Viewers can also see his new look on life in the scene in Tia Dalma's Swamp, wherein he suggests that the thing that vexes all men is "the dichotomy of [[good and evil]]". We can again see his religious/philosophical/intellectual side in the third movie, when the crew is frost-covered and he calmly contemplates aloud, "There must be a good reason for our suffering".  This may have also been a sarcastic complaint/question to Barbossa. Also in this film, when Pintel sees the kraken's body at the beach, he calls it a "''Stupid fish!''", but Ragetti reminds him that the Kraken is a cephalopod, thus making another joke about the contrast of his intellect over his ragged appearance.

===Exterior===
Like most pirates, Pintel and Ragetti wear old, threadbare clothes. According to ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide'', Ragetti's green jacket was stolen from a French nobleman, Pintel's trousers are washed with [[urine]] in an attempt to remove bloodstains, and Ragetti's trousers are covered with [[tar]] to make them waterproof – both of which were real methods used in the days of piracy. It also was mentioned in ''The Visual Guide'' that Pintel spends hours in front of a mirror in order to practice his famous gloomy face expression. Their coats are similar to that of Jack Sparrow.

==Abilities==
Pintel and Ragetti are skilled fighters; both before and after their immortality is lost, they are shown standing up to many times their number. Normally, they both fight with [[cutlass]]es, but in a scene in ''Dead Man's Chest'', when Elizabeth had taken their swords from them, they continue fighting with incredible efficiency using only the chest, an oar, and a net. They also use flintlock pistols, while it should be noticed that Pintel uses a double-barrelled one, which you can see clearly as he points it at Jack Sparrow in the ''Curse of the Black Pearl''. In ''At World's End'', Ragetti uses the butt of a pistol as a club. They are skilled gunners during sea battles; in the battle between the ''Black Pearl'' and the ''H.M.S. Interceptor'', they serve at the cannons. Similar to Barbossa, they seem not to have any moral issues about murdering innocent people, like Elizabeth's Butler or the Royal Marine and switch to the right side quickly, but against the other cursed crew of the Black Pearl (like the brutal Bo'sun or the nasty Koehler), they seem to have good hearts, more or less.

==Merchandise==
Both Pintel and Ragetti were made into [[Action Figure]]s in [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]]'s Series 2 of the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' series and also in [[Zizzle]]'s 1:18 scale ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Secrets of the Deep'' toy line. NECA would make them into Action Figures once again in Series 1 of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]] Series, and [[Zizzle]] included them as part of their own ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' series .

==In popular culture==

===Commercials===
* In 2006, the duo were part of an ad campaign for [[VISA (credit card)|VISA]] [[credit card]]s, in which they try multiple ways to "get [[treasure]]" out of a VISA card.
* Ragetti was mentioned in an [[M&amp;M's]] commercial where he plays himself, suggesting to the Yellow M&amp;M that he use the other hand to eat the White Chocolate M&amp;M's (as his right one was a hook), but it is a peg leg.{{clarification needed|date=June 2017}}
* The duo also appear on the Disney website game "Talk Like A Pirate", wherein both Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg reprise their roles.
* In a commercial for Walmart, a fighting sequence from the film involving a battle between the crew of the Black Pearl and an unidentified group of pirates begins.  During the fight, Jack, Captain Barbossa's pet monkey, takes possession of Captain Jack Sparrow's enchanted compass, to which Pintel utters the quote, "You bring that back or I'll use your guts for garters!", to which the monkey drops to the deck.  As this occurs, a young boy, accompanied by his mother and father, enters the scene in real time, picks up a toy version of Captain Sparrow's compass, and with his mother's approval, places it inside a Walmart shopping cart.

===Games===
* Ragetti and Pintel appear as playable "Chamber Card" characters in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean Trading Card Game]], acting together as one composite character.  
* Ragetti and Pintel appear as boss characters in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] platforms; both are voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]].
* Pintel and Ragetti appear on the same card in the Top Trumps deck for Pirates of the Caribbean.
* Pintel and Ragetti appear as cameos in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]]. With Pintel the player practices sword skills taught by Barbossa. Ragetti gives some information about the port the player is currently in. They also appear in the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PS3]] versions of the game as playable characters.
* Pintel and Ragetti are non-playable characters in the video game ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]''.

===Theme parks===
* Arenberg and Crook appear as Pintel and Ragetti in purpose-filmed "pop-up" video vignettes in the [[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island]] attraction at Disneyland and other Disney parks.

A '''production team''' is the group of technical staff who produce a play, [[television show]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], or film.  Generally the term refers to all individuals responsible for the technical aspects of creating of a particular product, regardless of where in the process their expertize is required, or how long they are involved in the project.  For example, in a theatrical performance, the production team includes not only the [[running crew]], but also the [[theatrical producer]], [[designer]]s and [[theatre direction]].

A [[production company]] in [[filmmaking]] is composed of a [[film crew]] and a [[television crew]] in [[video production]].

In music, the term ''production team'' typically refers to a group of individuals filling the role of "[[record producer]]" usually reserved for one individual. Some examples of musical production teams include [[Matmos]] and [[D-Influence]].

'''''Quiz Show''''' is a 1994 American [[historical film]] produced and directed by [[Robert Redford]], and written by [[Paul Attanasio]],&lt;ref name="Quiz Show"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18825/Quiz-Show/full-credits.html|title=Quiz Show|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|accessdate=July 4, 2016|location=[[Atlanta]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Richard N.

The film chronicles the ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]] of the 1950s, the rise and fall of popular contestant [[Charles Van Doren]] after the fixed loss of [[Herb Stempel]] and Congressional investigator [[Richard N. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]]'s subsequent probe. Goodwin co-produced the film. The film received generally positive reviews and was nominated for several awards, including a [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]] nomination and several [[Golden Globe Award]]s. It had a disappointing box office return.

==Plot==
In 1958, the questions and answers to be used for the latest broadcast of [[NBC]]'s popular quiz show ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' are transported from a secure bank vault to the studio. The evening's main attraction is [[Queens]] resident [[Herb Stempel]] ([[John Turturro]]), the reigning champion, who correctly answers question after question. However, both the network and the program's corporate sponsor, the supplementary tonic [[Geritol]], find that Stempel's approval ratings are beginning to level out, meaning the show would benefit from new talent.

Producers [[Dan Enright]] ([[David Paymer]]) and Albert Freedman ([[Hank Azaria]]) are surprised when [[Columbia University]] instructor [[Charles Van Doren]] ([[Ralph Fiennes]]), son of a prominent literary family, visits their office to audition. Realizing that they have found an ideal challenger for Stempel, they offer to ask the same questions during the show which Van Doren correctly answered during his audition. He refuses, but when he comes within reach of a game-winning 21 points on the show, he is asked one of the questions from his audition. After a moment of moral indecision, he gives the correct answer. Stempel, having been promised a future on television if he takes a dive, deliberately misses his chance at reaching 21 by incorrectly answering one of the show's easiest questions.

In the weeks that follow, Van Doren's winning streak makes him a national celebrity, but he buckles under the pressure and allows Enright and Freedman to start giving him the answers. Meanwhile, Stempel, having lost his prize money to an unscrupulous [[bookie]], begins threatening legal action against NBC after weeks go by without his return to television.  He visits New York County District Attorney [[Frank Hogan]], who convenes a [[grand jury]] to look into his allegations.

[[Richard N. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]] ([[Rob Morrow]]), a young [[United States Congress|Congressional]] lawyer, learns that the grand jury findings have been sealed and travels to New York City to investigate rumors of rigged quiz shows. Visiting a number of contestants, including Stempel and Van Doren, he begins to suspect that ''Twenty-One'' is a fixed operation. However, Stempel's volatile personality damages his credibility, and nobody else seems willing to confirm that the show is fixed. Fearing Goodwin will give up the investigation, Stempel confesses that he was fed the correct answers during his run on the show, and insists that Van Doren must have been involved as well. Another former contestant gives Goodwin quiz show answers he mailed to himself by registered post two days before the show, presumably as blackmail against Enright and Freedman.

Van Doren deliberately loses. He is rewarded by NBC with a lucrative contract to appear as a special correspondent on the morning ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show. The House Committee for Legislative Oversight convenes a hearing, at which Goodwin presents his evidence of the quiz show's corruption. 

During the hearing, Stempel's testimony fails to convince the committee. Both NBC network head [[Robert Kintner]] ([[Allan Rich]]) and Geritol executive Martin Rittenhome ([[Martin Scorsese]]) deny any knowledge of ''Twenty-One'' being rigged. After being subpoenaed by Goodwin, Van Doren testifies before the committee and admits his role in the deception. After the hearing adjourns, he learns from reporters that he has been fired from ''Today'' and that Columbia's trustees are going to ask for his resignation.

Goodwin believes he is on the verge of a victory against Geritol and NBC, but realizes that Enright and Freedman will not jeopardize their own futures in television by turning against their bosses. He silently watches the producers' testimony, vindicating the sponsors and the network from any wrongdoing, and taking full responsibility for rigging the show.

===Writing===
Journalist [[Ken Auletta]], in a 1994 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', noted that Redford conceded at a screening of the film that summer that "[[dramatic license]]" was taken in making ''Quiz Show''. Redford made no apologies for the liberties, which included telescoping three years of scandal into one. Redford stated that he had tried "to elevate something so that people can see it ... otherwise, you might as well have a documentary."&lt;ref name="auletta"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ken | last=Auletta | title=The $64,000 Question | journal=The New Yorker | date=September 19, 1994 | page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redford noted there had already been a documentary on the scandal, referring to the [[Julian Krainin]]-produced work for a 1992 installment of the [[PBS]] series ''[[American Experience|The American Experience]]''.&lt;ref name="auletta" /&gt;

In a July 2008 edition of ''The New Yorker'', Van Doren writes about the events depicted in the film, agreeing with many of the details but also saying that he had a regular girlfriend (who eventually became his wife) at the time he was on ''Twenty-One'', who is not present in the film depiction. Van Doren also notes that he continued teaching, contrary to the film's epilogue which states he never returned to doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Charles | last=Van Doren | title=All The Answers | url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/28/080728fa_fact_vandoren | work=The New Yorker | date=July 28, 2008 | accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/quiz-show-1994 "Quiz Show"]. September 16, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Web critic [[James Berardinelli]] praised the "superb performances by Fiennes", and said "John Turturro is exceptional as the uncharismatic Herbie Stempel."&lt;ref&gt;James Berardinelli. [http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/q/quiz.html "Quiz Show"]. ReelViews.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]],'' [[Owen Gleiberman]] highlighted the supporting performance of Paul Scofield as Mark Van Doren, stating that "it’s in the relationship between the two Van Dorens that ''Quiz Show'' finds its soul."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Gleiberman.

'''Simon Lovell''' (born 1957 in [[Manchester]]) is an English comedy [[Magician (illusion)|magician]], [[card sharp]] actor, and con man. His trademark pieces are finding an audience member's card in his mouth and a humorous [[straitjacket]] escape. Lovell appeared on VH1's popular reality show Celebracadabra, on which he and other magicians trained celebrities to perform magic for audiences.

The author of sixteen books, including ''Billion Dollar Bunco'', which covers cons and scams, Lovell starred in a one-man [[off-Broadway]] show called '''Strange and Unusual Hobbies.''' It ran for over eight years at the [[SoHo Playhouse]], and the Wall Street Journal complimented it as "a dazzling 70-minute show."&lt;ref&gt;|Kaufman, Joanne. "A Con Man Goes Straight into show Business." Wall Street Journal: D.10. ABI/INFORM Research. 27 July 2005. Web. 20 June 2011 &lt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/398951872&gt;. {{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-reviewed show combined Lovell's off-the-wall sense of humor with demonstrations of his uncanny card cheating and "jaw-dropping" magic.

Formerly residing in New York City, Simon was a regularly featured performer in "Monday Night Magic", the oldest running off-Broadway show featuring an evening of magicians and related performers.

He was the consultant con man as of season 2 for Matt Bomer in the show White Collar.

==Children's Magic==
Simon Lovell has also partnered up with Fantasma Magic, to help young magicians begin on the path toward becoming magicians. Some of the tricks performed in Fantasma's products include the Linking Rings, the Cups &amp; Balls, Vanishing Silk and 250 more tricks using props from the kit or everyday items from around the house. Fantasma's training DVD also includes scenes from well-known magicians such as [[Harry Houdini]] and [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]].

{{nihongo|'''''Suikoden V'''''|幻想水滸伝V|Gensō Suikoden Faibu|{{Audio|EN-us-Suikode.ogg|(listen)}}|lead=yes}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Konami]] and [[Hudson Soft]] and published by [[Konami]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game console]] and the fifth main installment of the ''[[Suikoden]]'' video game series. It was released in 2006, and has sold around 200,000 copies in Japan.&lt;ref name="Creativeuncut" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creativeuncut.com/topsell06.html |title=Game Sales Best Sellers 2006 (Best Selling Console Games in Japan 2006) |publisher=Creative Uncut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loosely based on a classical Chinese novel, ''[[Water Margin|Shui Hu Zhuan]]'' by [[Shi Nai'an]],{{fact|date=February 2016}} ''Suikoden V'' centers on the political struggles of the Queendom of Falena, and takes place 6 in-universe years before the events of the first ''[[Suikoden (video game)|Suikoden]]''. The player controls the Prince of Falena and travels the world, acquiring allies and dealing with the problems of the nation. The game features a vast array of characters, with over sixty characters usable in combat and many more able to help or hinder the Prince in a variety of ways.

==Gameplay==
{{unreferencedsect|date=January 2018}}
''Suikoden V'' is a role-playing video game and thus features many of the usual traits. The player controls the Prince and travels with him around the world map, advancing the plot by completing tasks and talking with other characters. The Prince can also recruit new characters to his cause, which often involves a short [[sidequest]]. In towns, the player can gather information, sharpen character's weaponry, learn new skills and buy equipment; wilderness areas generally feature random encounters with monsters.

The battle system to ''Suikoden V'' features six person parties in combat rather than the four person parties of ''[[Suikoden IV]]'', reversing a much-decried change.  Each character is individually controllable, as well (as opposed to ''[[Suikoden III]]''). A variety of statistics in ''Suikoden V'' determine in-game combat ability. Like in ''Suikoden III'', there exists a skill system in ''Suikoden V''; for instance, the "Stamina" skill increases a character's [[hit point]]s. Different characters have affinities for different skills. Only two skills can be equipped to each character, though they can be switched at any time between battles. If all six characters lose all their hit points and are thus incapacitated, it is [[game over]] and the player must restart. Exceptions exist for certain plot battles in which winning is optional; the player can lose and the plot continues on, albeit in a slightly different fashion.

The characters can be set up in a variety of fighting [[Tactical formation|formations]] across a roughly 6x4 grid. Each formation allows the party to gain increased statistics, such as increased defense or increased attacks, occasionally offset by decreased stats in other categories, as well as a special attack based on the formation. New formations are acquired over the course of the game. Like in previous games, some characters have special cooperative attacks that can potentially do more damage. These attacks often do more damage than normal and cannot miss, but they also cannot receive critical damage bonuses and cannot hit targets multiple times. An auto-battle function is enable as well for quickly breezing through easy battles.

Characters that don't participate directly in combat usually offer other services to the Prince, such as running a shop, giving clues for potential recruits, or aiding in the strategic war battles. Additionally, up to four characters may be kept in reserve of the current party; some non-combat characters, when in the reserve, offer minor benefits such as healing after battle or a greater chance of finding a special item after battle.

Runes, the source of all [[magic (gaming)|magic]] in the world of ''Suikoden'', are handled similarly to other ''Suikoden'' games.  Characters have a certain number of spell usages per "spell level;" for instance, a character with four level 1 spell slots and a Water Rune could cast "Kindness Drops" (the level 1 Water Rune spell) four times.  Other runes offer different benefits, and some may be used as often as desired.

The strategic war battles from earlier ''Suikoden''s return for major army clashes, in [[Real-time strategy|real-time]] with more freedom of movement than the hex and square based earlier installments.  Instead, the battlefield is now continuous.  Both land and naval battles exist in ''Suikoden V''; some battles even combine both elements.  The system is analogous to [[Rock, Paper, Scissors]], where [[cavalry]] beats [[infantry]], infantry beats [[archery|archers]], and archers beat cavalry; at sea, [[Ram (ship)|ram ships]] are strong against archery ships, infantry ships defeat rams, and archery ships beat infantry ships.  There are also additional benefits to having certain characters in certain units, such as magical attacks using runes or leadership bonuses.  A few special units exist as well in beaver units and dragon cavalry units, which can travel on both sea and land.

''Suikoden V'' also contains a number of [[minigame]]s, including, but not limited to, fishing, accessible through the character [[List of characters in Suikoden V#Raftfleet|Subala]], and Blind Man's Bluff, a card game that [[List of characters in Suikoden V#Other Falenans|Linfa]] plays.

==Story==
{{unreferencedsect|date=January 2018}}
===Setting===
''Suikoden V'' takes place in the Queendom of Falena, portraying the events of that region of the ''Suikoden'' world eight years before the events in ''[[Suikoden (video game)|Suikoden]]'' and 142 years after the events in ''[[Suikoden IV]]'' (~IS 449). The Queendom of Falena is a relatively rich land sustained by the Feitas River, which connects its disparate parts and enables trade and communication. It is ruled by Queen Arshtat and her husband Ferid, who have been a balancing and steady force since the demise of her somewhat rash mother. However, the tensions of the past have not been entirely settled. Arshtat's mother and aunt had been engaged in a covert struggle for power over the succession. Falena's government also has powerful [[nobility|nobles]] who maintain their own separate forces, loyal to them. Arshtat's hand in marriage was seen as key to gaining power in the future by the nobles; a civil war was narrowly averted when Ferid, a neutral outsider, won the Sacred Games and thus the right to marry Arshtat.

Arshtat and Ferid begat two heirs, the Prince (named by the player, called Freyjdour in the manga) and Lymsleia. At the beginning of ''Suikoden V'', the time has come for Lymsleia's Sacred Games, a gladiatorial tournament in which the winner may ask for the future Queen's hand in marriage. (As a Queendom rather than a [[Monarchy|Kingdom]], the first-born female is in line for the throne.) Aside from the many freelancers, suitors, and independent nobles who desire this prize, the two most powerful noble houses both bear a special interest in it; like with Arshtat's Sacred Games, Lymsleia's hand could prove a crucial advantage. The Godwins believe that Falena needs to be more centralized, powerful and perhaps expansionistic. The Barows seek more to rebuild and trade with foreign nations. The Barows faction has of late been somewhat on the decline, though they are still powerful; a recent war with the neighboring New Armes Kingdom was fought on Barows-allied lands, while the Godwins remained safe and untouched in the west of Falena, perhaps explaining the Barows wish to not further antagonize Armes. The royal family and others worry that if a Godwin or Barows were to win, it might well trigger another struggle.

A key part of the ''Suikoden'' setting is the existence of Runes, the source of all [[magic (gaming)|magic]]. Any person can have a rune inscribed on them, although some people are more talented in their use, and others can inscribe more than one rune (with three as the general maximum). In turn, all power from individual carved runes ultimately descends from the powerful 27 True Runes, which created the world in ''Suikoden''{{'}}s mythology. Falena's national treasure is the Sun Rune, a True Rune which can both bring prosperity and growth as well as destruction and calamity. Falena also controls the "child" runes of the Sun Rune, the Dawn Rune and Twilight Rune.

However, Falena's grip on the runes has gone somewhat awry. Two years prior to the start of ''Suikoden V'', residents of Lordlake rioted and charged the East Palace, near the capital of Sol-Falena. In the confusion, the Dawn Rune, which was housed there, was stolen. Lordlake had previously been considered the most loyal of all the towns to the royal government and granted special privileges. With this seeming act of high treason by Lordlake, Arshtat took the Sun Rune upon herself, normally stored in Sol-Falena's palace on a pedestal, and used the Rune's power to scorch Lordlake's vegetation, wildlife and river, killing its leader Lord Rovere in the process. Since bearing the Sun Rune, the normally compassionate Arshtat has grown more and more erratic in behavior, prone to mood swings and wild fits of vengeance.

===Characters===
As with previous ''Suikoden'' titles, there are "[[108 Stars of Destiny (Suikoden)|108 Stars of Destiny]]" to recruit in the game. While some characters join as per the story's requirements, others require that the Prince recruit them either at a specific time, or by fulfilling particular conditions. As such, certain characters can be missed entirely.

Some of the characters from ''Suikoden V'' appeared in earlier ''Suikoden'' games; as ''Suikoden V'' takes place before ''I''–''III'', their experiences in Falena are a prequel of sorts for them. Notably, Georg Prime and Lorelai both play important roles in ''Suikoden V'' and appear in other games, while Viki, Jeane and Leknaat continue their run of all ''Suikoden'' games to date.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=October 2015}}
Two years after Lordlake was razed by her Sun Rune, Queen Arshtat dispatches her son the Prince, her sister Sialeeds, and their royal bodyguards Lyon and Georg Prime to inspect the state of the ruined town. The player as the Prince sees the grim state of the dried-up town and report on it, but Arshtat scorns this; she declares that Lordlake's citizens deserve their desolation for stealing the Dawn Rune. Arshtat's husband Ferid pulls her back to her senses, and she dismisses the inspection party with a whisper.

The next issue of contention is the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held somewhat early for the ten-year-old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing themselves with a champion, hail from rival noble houses: the foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fiancé, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified.

However, Lord Marscal Godwin, Gizel's father, is less than impressed with Gizel's activities, thinking that he has made an enemy of the Prince and the royal family as a whole with his plotting. Additionally, the royal family took Zegai, the Barows champion, into their own personal custody, who could perhaps help reveal the Godwins cheating and offer an excuse to annul the engagement. Thus, the Godwins launch a preemptive attack at the engagement ceremony in Sol-Falena, Falena's capital. Arshtat and Ferid had anticipated and prepared for the attack, but not the involvement of the elite Nether Gate assassins, who overwhelm the palace's defenses. The struggle culminates in Arshtat and Ferid's deaths, while Lymsleia finds herself a captive. The Prince (whose irrelevance to the line of succession made him the lowest-priority target), Lyon, Georg and Sialeeds are forced to flee.

The Prince searches first for a sanctuary, then for a way to fight back. He finds both (temporarily) as a guest of the influential noble Salum Barows, Lord Godwin's long-time rival. Salum (with his son Euram alongside) clearly plans to be the senior partner in his alliance with the Prince, but the Prince must take what allies he can find. Reluctantly, Sialeeds suggests bringing in help in the form of the legendary tactician Lucretia Merces, whom the Prince frees from prison. With her intelligence and vast network of contacts, Lucretia finds out that the Barows were behind the theft of the Dawn Rune – an act of high treason. With this revelation, the Prince is able to convince the Barows' allies to join him personally, including even Salum's daughter Luserina. The recovered Dawn Rune picks the Prince as its new bearer, even though the Prince can never inherit the throne.

Lucretia guides the Prince and his army in establishing a headquarters, forging alliances, restoring Lordlake, and winning a long streak of battles. The Godwins crown Lymsleia Queen and claim to fight in her name, but lose the public relations war due to the Prince's resistance, the claims of a coup, the restoration of Lordlake (thus fixing a mistake of Arshtat's rule), and the Godwins' army commanders foolish brutality. The civil war almost comes to a close when Lymsleia takes the field personally, officially due to the Godwin's failure to put down the "rebellion", but actually to be rescued by her brother. The Prince and his forces defeat her bodyguards and attempt to capture Lymsleia back; without Lymsleia, the Godwin's government would collapse. At this juncture, however, Sialeeds defects to Gizel's side, spiriting Lymsleia away and prolonging the conflict. Lyon is seriously wounded, preventing the party from pursuing Lymsleia. Meanwhile, Sialeeds takes up the Twilight Rune, the counterpart to the Dawn Rune held in Godwin territory.

The Godwins enjoy a brief reversal in fortunes with new army levies and an alliance with a faction of Falena's neighbor Armes. However, Falena's normally neutral Dragon Cavalry enters the war on the Prince's side due to Armes' involvement, and the Godwins are driven back once more. Sialeeds ensures that the Prince's forces must capture Stormfist, the seat of Godwin power, and thoroughly erase any possible strongholds of Godwin sympathy. Despite seemingly being affiliated with the Godwins, however, Sialeeds incinerates a Godwin ambush of the Prince's force. Sialeeds later murders Salum Barows in Gizel's name, leaving the whimpering Euram alive with the venomous taunt that the Barows faction will surely fall to ruin with an idiot like him in charge.

Only the capital city of Sol-Falena remains under Godwin control. The battle for it claims the lives of both Sialeeds and Gizel. As she expires, Sialeeds hints at her motives (which her maids confirm, if the player speaks with them later): she knew that, if the Prince had rescued Lymsleia when he first had the chance, things only would have returned to the way they were before, with the same corrupt nobility holding power struggles. The only way, in her mind, to secure the royal family's hold on the Queendom was to prolong the war such that the nobility would be completely and utterly ruined. By doing it in the Godwins' name, the Prince and Lymsleia could be rid of them without getting their hands dirty. As Gizel dies, felled by the Prince in a duel, he declares that Sialeeds was the only real winner. Lord Marscal, the only remaining Godwin, retreats with the Sun Rune to a nearby mountain range, where he meets the Prince in a showdown to prove that the royals can rule without the power of the Sun Rune. He draws the Rune's power into himself for the final battle with the Rune incarnation.

In the ending, Lymsleia re-assumes the throne and dissolves the Senate, though a new representative parliament is created to replace it and advise the Queen. Depending on the player's choices and performance, several endings are possible. If very few optional stars of destiny were recruited, Lyon dies of the wounds she received earlier and the Prince wanders off alone in despair. If most but not all of the stars were recruited, the Prince travels the world with Georg. If all 108 Stars were recruited, Lyon survives. If the Prince chose to be nice when interacting with Lymsleia, he has the further option of staying in Falena and becoming the new Commander of the Queen's Knights, with Lyon by his side.

==Development==
{{unreferencedsect|date=January 2018}}
''Suikoden V'' was directed by Takahiro Sakiyama, a newcomer to the ''Suikoden'' franchise, and written by Kazuyoshi Tsugawa, who served as the writer for ''[[The Sword of Etheria]]'' and worked on the battle system design for ''[[Skies of Arcadia]]''. The game started out as a ''[[gaiden]]'' to the series, with development beginning even before that of ''[[Suikoden IV]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} However, as the content that the team came up with grew, it eventually evolved into a main installment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Soundtrack==
{{unreferencedsect|date=January 2018}}
The music to ''Suikoden V'' was composed by [[Norikazu Miura]] and Konami veteran [[Miki Higashino]].  Miura, however, did all of the arrangement.  The opening movie piece, "Wind of Phantom," was composed, conducted, and produced by [[Yuji Toriyama]]; he arranged for it to be played by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]].  The soundtrack includes a large number of remixes and references to Higashino's work in ''Suikoden'' and ''Suikoden II'', ending with "Into a World of Illusions."

The complete ''Genso Suikoden V OST'', featuring all the music from the game in original form, was released on March 24, 2006.  A shorter "Limited Edition" demo disc with 10 tracks had been released earlier.

Anyone have American Sales figures?

''Suikoden V'' had disappointing sales compared to earlier PlayStation 2 ''Suikodens''.  In 2006 in Japan, the game sold 194,780 copies,&lt;ref name="Creativeuncut"/&gt; down from ''Suikoden IV''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 303,069.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-BestSell2004.shtml |title=2004 Top 100 Best Selling Japanese Console Games |publisher=The Magic Box}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one seven for a total of 32 out of 40.&lt;ref name="fam"/&gt;

Elsewhere, the game received "generally favorable reviews" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt; The plot received praise for the depth of its political maneuverings, even if the game starts off somewhat slowly: [[GameSpy]] said, "''Suikoden V'' has a robust, well-done plot that doesn't telegraph every twist or conform to embarrassing clichés."&lt;ref name="gspyreview"/&gt;  Most reviewers also found the cast of characters engaging, as well; [[GameSpot]] said that "''Suikoden''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s always been great at making the stars evince unique personalities with just a few exchanges of conversation, and there's lots of interesting people to meet and lure to your forces."&lt;ref name="gsreview"/&gt; ''Suikoden V'' also reversed some of the unpopular changes of ''Suikoden IV'' (such as 4-person parties), and offered some tie-ins to ''Suikoden'' and ''Suikoden II'' for fans of the original PlayStation games.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The graphics and loading times were generally criticized, however.  [[IGN]] wrote, "there's a ton of loading everywhere you turn. Moving from one area to another means 2-5 second loads; initiating a battle means 7-10 second loads; winning a skirmish brings 4-6 second loads afterwards."&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]] said of the graphics that "Army battles and in-engine cut scenes look blocky and raw, but the CGI cut scenes are beautiful and detailed. Towns look great, but dungeons are horrid, bland, maze-like nightmares."&lt;ref name="gamerev"/&gt;

''Suikoden V'' won IGN's 2006 award for Best Story on the PlayStation 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestof.ign.com/2006/ps2/26.html |title=Best of 2006: Best Story (PlayStation 2) |publisher=IGN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110100839/http://bestof.ign.com/2006/ps2/26.html |archivedate=January 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also won the Danish gaming magazine ''[[Gamereactor]]''{{'}}s award for Best Story overall, and was named the 9th best game of the year by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Editors |date=December 28, 2006 |url=http://www.gamereactor.se/artiklar/9347/%C5rets+spel+2006/ |title=Årets spel 2006 |trans-title=Game of the Year 2006 |publisher=''[[Gamereactor]]'' |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6236">'''{{nihongo|Takagari|[[:ja:鷹狩|鷹狩]]|}}''' is [[Japan]]ese [[falconry]], a sport of the noble class, and a symbol of their nobility, their status, and their warrior spirit.

In Japan, records indicate that falconry began in the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Rekidai"&gt;Nihon Rekishi Daijiten (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; According to a passage in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720), falconry was introduced by the [[Baekje]] noble Sakenokimi in 359 during the reign of [[Emperor Nintoku]].&lt;ref name="Sakamoto"&gt;Sakamoto (1965:408-410)&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, the central Court and local lords both enjoyed hawking, with the former trying to monopolize falconry, sometimes with banning orders. Central power, however, as seen in the repetition of prohibiting orders, had no complete control over local falconry until the 17th century. In the 13th century, hawking became popular among the rising [[samurai]] class as well as among court nobles (''[[kuge]]'').  At that time, the practice of hawking was a means of resolving struggles over land ownership among lords.  Buddhist temples, who were also land owners, opposed falconry based on their ideology against killing.  Falconer lords, on the other hand, devised a Buddhist rationale or resorted to [[Shinto]] justifications.  Several falconry schools or styles (''ryū'') were formed in the process.

The falconry methods employed in Japan had originally been Sino-Korean ones.&lt;ref name="Rekidai" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakamoto" /&gt; Based on Chinese texts and practice, ''Shinshū Yōkyō'' was edited in 818 as a falconry textbook.  From the 13th century on, nobles left falconry texts as evidence of their authority in falconry. The establishment of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] in [[Kyoto]] allowed mutual influence between ''kuge'' and samurai on the development of the sport. Samurai falconers also began to write falconry texts in the 16th century.

The sport had always been a status symbol, as a very expensive pastime, involving not only the rarity and cost of the haggards, passages and [[eyass]]es, and the costs of housing, raising, and training them, but it also required access to a large amount of space, and a lot of time and effort, things presumably denied to all but the most fortunate of the common classes. With the opening of the [[Tokugawa period]], the wars of the [[Sengoku period]] came to an end, and falconry became one of the primary outlets for the militaristic energies of the samurai class, along with [[Kyūdō|archery]], [[kendo|swordplay]], and [[keiba|horse racing]].

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] enjoyed falconry very much himself, and used it as a symbol of his authority, and of his plans for the country, transforming the violence of his conquest into a peacetime system of laws. He banned traditional falconry by ''kuge'', who had been holders of the art since the first introduction of falconry. He established restrictions on which ranks of creatures a samurai or ''[[daimyō]]'' (feudal lord) could hunt, from [[geese]] and [[duck]]s up to the more valuable [[swan]]s. He also set up certain lands as ''takaba'' (鷹場), or falconry fields; practicing the sport on all other lands was forbidden. Many of these designated lands were farmers' lands; the peasant farmers were forced to provide labor for the hunt, which often took days or even weeks, and were forbidden from interfering with the [[prey]] creatures of their lands, despite the damage geese and other animals might do to crops.

[[Northern Goshawk|Goshawk]]s, and other [[birds of prey]], increasingly became symbols of status, and in the early Edo period, many paintings were commissioned by samurai. While the first images of [[hawk]]s and [[eagle]]s in Japan appeared in the 13th century, since the 14th and 15th centuries, paintings with hawks as the main subject appeared, under the influence of imported Chinese paintings. As the visibility and popularity of falconry grew, at the beginning of the Edo period, images of the hunt, of [[mews]], of wild [[birds of prey]], and even portraits of favored individual birds were increasingly commissioned. While common people were kept out of falconry, their interest in it gave rise to some [[ukiyo-e]] art by [[Hokusai]], [[Hiroshige]] and [[Kawanabe Kyōsai]].

Falconry flourished throughout the Edo period, with only a short interruption imposed by [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]].  With the [[Meiji Revolution]], the monopoly on falconry by samurai ended.  Falconry was released to the public, but in the process of modernization, its prosperity faded.  While the [[Imperial Household Ministry]] gathered ex-falconers and tried to keep their tradition, some methods were lost, and others were handed down to private enthusiasts. Hawk-eagle austringers in northeastern Japan have also emerged in the process, although their origin is somewhat uncertain.

After [[World War II]], the Imperial Household Agency suspended the practice of hawking, and the tradition of ''takagari'' is today kept by clubs formed by enthusiasts.

'''''The Brainies'''''  is a [[puzzle game]] released on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] console and [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Apple IIgs]], [[Macintosh]], and [[Amstrad CPC]] computers. Even though its European title is '''''Tiny Skweeks''''', the connection to the popular ''Skweek'' series was made late.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:TheBrainiesSNES3DViewScreenshot.png|175px|left|thumb|Using the 3D mode in the Super NES version of the game; taking advantage of the [[Mode 7]].]]

The gameplay revolves around [[Mexican jumping bean]]s (referred to in game as ''Brainies'') as they navigate 101 levels to solve the puzzles that are in their way.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/brainies| title = Additional release information/overview | publisher = [[MobyGames]]| date = | accessdate = 2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] is in effect; running out of time means losing a life.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; Players can only control the direction in which a Brainy will walk; taking care not to bump into another Brainy or an obstacle.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; There are four difficulty levels and the object is to return the Mexican jumping beans safely home. Items can be picked up; they may be beneficial or detrimental to the Brainy depending on certain factors.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; Arrows can also force a Brainy to change directions; rendering him helpless for a while and possibly messing up a carefully solved puzzle.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt;

==Reception==
''[[GamePro]]'' gave the Super NES version a generally positive review, criticizing that "the icons are too small", but praising the brain-stretching and addictive gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=The Brainies|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=67|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1995|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Super NES version of the video game was reviewed in one of the first 50 issues of ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

==Plot==
&lt;!-- DO NOT EXPAND PLOT ANY FURTHER! It currently is within the Guidance parameters for Feature Film plots, in terms of it containing between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
In the Lego Universe, [[Batman]] continues to protect [[Gotham City]] and fight crime. During his latest mission to stop [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from destroying the city, he hurts his arch-rival's feelings by telling him he is not as important in his life as he thinks he is, leading Joker to seek the ultimate revenge on him. The following day, Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, attends the city's winter gala, which is celebrating both the retirement of [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] and the ascension of his daughter [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara]] as the city's new [[police commissioner]], only to be infuriated by Barbara's plans to restructure the police to function without the need of Batman. Without warning, Joker crashes the party with the city's [[List of Batman Family adversaries|other villains]], all of whom surrender, with the exception of [[Harley Quinn]] who disappears during the confusion.

Suspecting his arch-rival is up to something, Batman plots to steal [[Superman]]'s [[Phantom Zone]] Projector, a device that can banish anyone to the Phantom Zone which houses some of the most dangerous villains in the Lego multiverse. Just as he plans his heist of the device, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] intervenes and advises him to take charge of [[Dick Grayson]], whom Bruce unwittingly adopted as his ward during the gala. Reluctantly agreeing to do so, Batman fosters Dick as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], whereupon the pair successfully recover the Projector from the [[Fortress of Solitude]], and break into [[Arkham Asylum]] to send Joker to the Phantom Zone. Suspecting that the Joker wanted to be sent there, Barbara locks up Batman and Robin for their reckless actions.

While the Projector is being seized as evidence, Harley steals it back as part of Joker's plan and frees him, allowing him to return to Gotham with all the villains he had recruited in the Phantom Zone, including [[King Kong]], the [[Gremlins]], the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and her [[Flying Monkeys]], a [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] and a [[Velociraptor]], [[Lord Voldemort]], [[Sauron]], the [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] shark, the [[Dalek]]s, Lord Vampyre, The Evil Mummy, Swamp Creature, [[Medusa]], [[Agent Smith]] and his clones, [[Skeleton (undead)|Skeleton Warriors]], [[General Zod]], and the [[Kraken]]. Realizing that the city does need him, Barbara releases Batman and Robin and teams up with them and Alfred to stop the Joker. Although Batman finds himself able to trust and rely on his new team upon reaching [[Wayne Manor|Wayne Island]], he chooses to send them away rather than losing them like his parents. Upon facing him alone, Joker believes that Batman is incapable of change and zaps him to the Phantom Zone before stealing the [[Batcave]]'s stash of confiscated bombs. Arriving in the Phantom Zone, Batman witnesses the harm his selfishness has caused to everyone and slowly accepts his greatest fear. Making a deal with the Zone's gatekeeper Phyllis, a talking Lego brick, to be allowed back to Gotham in order to retrieve the Zone's escaped prisoners, Batman arrives in time to save his teammates, apologizing to them for his actions, and requesting their help to stop Joker.

Realizing that Joker plans to use the explosives he took to destroy the city's Energy Facility, thus causing the city to come apart and be destroyed, Batman turns Barbara into [[Batgirl]], before he, his team, and Gotham City's other villains, who felt neglected by Joker, manage to successfully send the escaped villains back to the Phantom Zone. However, the group fail to stop Joker's bombs going off as the explosion begins to tear the city apart at the plates beneath it. Knowing this was his fault, Batman reluctantly convinces Joker that he is the true reason for being the hero he is before they, their friends and allies, and the city's inhabitants, chain-link themselves together and pull the plates back together, saving the city.

With the city saved, Batman prepares to be taken back into the Phantom Zone to fulfill his bargain only to be rejected by Phyllis who chooses to let him remain after seeing how much he had changed in order to save everyone. Batman allows Joker and the rest of his rogues gallery to temporarily escape with the confidence that whenever they return, they will be no match for the Batman family.

==Production==

After the success of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] gave the green light to further multiple Lego movies being produced, including ''The Lego Batman Movie''; Chris McKay, who co-directed ''The Lego Movie'', was brought on board to direct the film, marking this as his solo directorial debut.&lt;ref name="Denofgeekjerry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaye|first1=Don|title=Lego Batman Director Chris McKay on Making the Jerry Maguire of Batman Movies|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/the-lego-batman-movie/262125/lego-batman-director-chris-mckay-on-making-the-jerry-maguire-of-batman-movies|website=Denofgeek|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview about his work on the film, McKay stated that working on the film was "a very mixed blessing" owing partly to the film's hectic time schedule for its production, remarking that the two and half years allocated to the film made it difficult to fit in everything that he wanted for the movie, considering his earlier work on ''The Lego Movie''.&lt;ref name="Denofgeekjerry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartoonbrewinterview"/&gt; His work on ''The Lego Batman Movie'' was influenced by the comedy portrayed in both ''[[The Naked Gun]]'' and ''[[Airplane!]]'' film series, with his pitch for the film to the studios being described as like "''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' as directed by [[Michael Mann]]".&lt;ref name="Cartoonbrewinterview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Failes|first1=Ian|title=Q&amp;A: Chris McKay Goes Full Caped Crusader on ‘The Lego Batman Movie’|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/qa-chris-mckay-goes-full-caped-crusader-lego-batman-movie-148431.html|website=Cartoonbrew|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal to combine all the Batman eras featured in the comic book series and various media formats, including movies and comic series, despite a couple of issues—the total inconsistency inherent to such a task, and Lego rejecting some of the characters he proposed to include in the film—was based on his desire of how to portray Robin within the film's setting. In an interview regarding his version of the superhero duo, McKay stated:&lt;ref name="Cartoonbrewinterview"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was thinking that we were basically taking the [[Burt Ward]] [[Batman (TV series)|Robin]] and sticking him in the Batmobile with the [[Zack Snyder]]/[[Ben Affleck]] Batman, or the [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] Batman. And putting these two different energies together. Somebody who’s like the grumpiest, dark grittiest, broodiest Batman with the most positive, indefatigable kid."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Batman and pop culture references==
As part of its production, the movie was designed to make numerous references to previous ''Batman'' movies, cartoons and comics. These include: the 1940s [[Batman and Robin (serial)|''Batman'' serials]]; the films ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966), ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997), ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008), ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012), ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), and ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016); the television shows ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (1960s), ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (1990s), ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' (2000s), and ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' (2000s); and the comics ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27 (Batman's introductory story), ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986), and ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="ign refs"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/14/the-lego-batman-movie-easter-eggs-and-references | title = The Lego Batman Movie Easter Eggs and References | first = Joshua | last=  Yehl | date = February 14, 2017 | accessdate = February 14, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other references include previous costumes worn by Batman and Robin, and the various Batmobiles used. In most cases, their appearances in the movie are done in a Lego style, with the exception being footage from a live-action shot of [[Adam West]]'s depiction of Batman in the 1960s ''Batman'' show and a picture of Batman's suit from ''Batman and Robin''. Climactic events from past Batman films including the Joker have been mentioned, including "that time with the parade and the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] music" (1989's ''Batman'') and "the two boats" (''The Dark Knight'').&lt;ref name="ign refs"/&gt;

Alongside Joker, the main antagonist of the film's story, and Superman, who features heavily and has notable links to the [[Christopher Reeve]] films ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and its sequel ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980), many other DC characters, both villains associated with Batman and other DC superheroes, feature in the film. The film's villains who have been featured in Batman comics, films and cartoons include: [[Man-Bat]]; [[Captain Boomerang]]; [[Egghead (DC Comics)|Egghead]]; [[Crazy Quilt]]; [[List of Batman Family enemies#Foes of lesser renown|Eraser]]; [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Polka-Dot Man|Polka-Dot Man]]; [[List of Batman Family enemies#Foes of lesser renown|Mime]]; [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]]; [[King Tut (comics)|King Tut]] from the 1960s series; [[Killer Moth]]; [[List of Batman Family enemies#Foes of lesser renown|March Harriet]]; [[List of Batman Family enemies#Foes of lesser renown|Zodiac Master]]; the [[List of Batman Family enemies#Foes of lesser renown|Mutant Leader]] from ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''; [[Doctor Phosphorus]]; [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Magpie|Magpie]]; [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]]; [[Hugo Strange]]; an unidentified version of [[Red Hood]]; the Kabuki Twins from ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''; [[Orca (comics)|Orca]]; [[Gentleman Ghost]]; [[Clock King]]; [[Calendar Man]]; [[Kite Man]]; [[Catman (comics)|Catman]]; [[Zebra-Man]]; and a variation of [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Condiment King|Condiment King]] from ''Batman: The Animated Series''.&lt;ref name="ign refs"/&gt; The other DC heroes who feature, both from the Justice League and ''[[Super Friends]]'', include: [[Wonder Woman]]; [[Aquaman]]; [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]; [[Green Arrow]]; [[Black Canary]]; [[Hawkman]]; [[Hawkgirl]]; [[Martian Manhunter]]; [[Apache Chief]]; [[Black Vulcan]]; [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]]; [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]]; [[Wonder Dog (Super Friends)|Wonder Dog]]; the [[Wonder Twins]]; and [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]]. Although not part of the DC franchise, [[Iron Man]] from [[Marvel Comics]] is referenced in the movie as part of a small joke about Batman's password for entering the Batcave in reference to the famous rivalry between DC and Marvel.&lt;ref name="ign refs"/&gt;

The film also features characters from other notable franchises and movie series, with them following the same narrative of ''The Lego Movie'' in that they came from worlds that co-exist alongside others of the Lego Universe, which are made up of Lego playsets of the various media franchises. These additional characters include: [[Medusa]] from [[Lego Minifigures]]; the Swamp Creature, Evil [[Mummy (monster)|Mummy]], and Lord Vampyre from ''[[Lego Monster Fighters]]''; [[King Kong]]; the [[Dalek]]s from ''[[Doctor Who]]''; the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and her [[Winged monkeys|flying monkeys]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''; the [[Kraken]] from ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]''; [[Agent Smith]] and his clones from ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]''; the [[great white shark]] from ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''; [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] from ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]''; [[Sauron]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''; the [[Tyrannosaurus]] and [[Velociraptor]]s from ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''; The [[Skeleton (undead)|Skeleton Warriors]] from ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''; and the [[Gremlins]].&lt;ref name="ign refs"/&gt;&lt;ref name=giz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/02/everything-is-batman-all-the-easter-eggs-and-references-in-the-lego-batman-movie/|title=Everything is Batman: All the Easter Eggs and References We Spotted in The Lego Batman Movie|author=Tom Pritchard|date=February 5, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017|work=[[Gizmodo]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which the Gremlins attack a plane references ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]".&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/p/lego-batman-movie-easter-eggs-references-best/4207680|title=Holy References Batman!

The film also includes Batman watching the scene from ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' where [[Tom Cruise]] says "You complete me"; this line had previously been quoted by [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|The Joker]] in ''The Dark Knight''.&lt;ref name="ign refs"/&gt; When Batman discusses possible team names, he mentions "Fox Force Five," which was the name of a failed television pilot mentioned in ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''.&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/batman/262089/the-lego-batman-movie-references-and-easter-egg-guide|title=The Lego Batman Movie References and Easter Egg Guide|author=David Crow|date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=April 11, 2017|work=[[Den of Geek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's use of [[Cutting Crew]]'s "[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]" is a nod to the [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Never Been Kissed]]''.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; The film's other references include ''[[Gleaming the Cube]]'' and ''[[Gymkata]]''.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;

A scene from ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' was reused in the film, where Emmet is going down the portal to the real world.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 281 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Lego Batman Movie'' continues its block-buster franchise's winning streak with another round of dizzyingly funny—and beautifully animated—family-friendly mayhem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lego_batman_movie|title=The Lego Batman Movie (2017)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ranked the 14th best superhero movie of all time on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-superhero-movies-of-all-time/|title= 64 Best Superhero Movies of All Time|work= Rotten Tomatoes|publisher= Fandango Media|access-date= October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lego-batman-movie|title=The Lego Batman Movie Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Ryan of ''[[Uproxx]]'' gave the film a positive review, praising its comedy, and saying: "''The LEGO Batman Movie'' isn’t the same experience as watching ''The LEGO Movie'', but I also don’t think it's trying to be. It’s trying to be a fun superhero movie with clever callbacks to previous Batman films (every single Batman movie all the way back to the 1940s serials are referenced) that can, at least, provide DC superhero fans with a taste of fun amidst all the doom and gloom. (That can either be a reference to 'the real world' or the current [[DC Extended Universe|DC Cinematic Universe]] films, you can choose either one you want or both.) And at that, ''The LEGO Batman Movie'' succeeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ryan|first=Mike|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/the-lego-batman-movie-review/ |title=‘The LEGO Batman Movie’ Succeeds As, Finally, A ‘Fun’ DC Superhero Movie |website=Uproxx |date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B+" and wrote, "''LEGO Batman'' revs so fast and moves so frenetically that it becomes a little exhausting by the end. It flirts with being too much of a good thing. But rarely has corporate brainwashing been so much fun and gone down with such a delightful aftertaste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/02/09/lego-batman-movie-ew-review/ |title=The LEGO Batman Movie: EW review |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Chang of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was positive in his review, saying, "In its best moments, this gag-a-minute Bat-roast serves as a reminder that, in the right hands, a sharp comic scalpel can be an instrument of revelation as well as ridicule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chang|first=Justin|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-lego-batman-review-20170203-story.html |title='The Lego Batman Movie' is the best Batman movie since 'The Dark Knight' |website=Los Angeles Times |date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the film for its heart, humor, and action which, "snap together, with a satisfying click."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-lego-batman-movie-even-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-many-parts/2017/02/09/6a20f20c-ed50-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html |title=‘The Lego Batman Movie’: Even greater than the sum of its many parts. |website=Washington Post |date=February 9, 2017|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Perfect Gift''' is a 2009 spinoff of the 2005 [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Drama film|drama movie]] ''[[The Perfect Stranger (film)|The Perfect Stranger]]'', and its first sequel, ''[[Another Perfect Stranger]]''. It stars Christina Fougnie, Amy Hess, Matt Wallace and [[Jefferson Moore]] once again as [[Jesus Christ]]. It was filmed almost entirely in [[Kentucky]], where the first two movies in the series were not. 

== Plot ==
Maxine Noelle Westray (Christina Fougnie) is a beautiful and wealthy girl, yet she is incredibly spoiled and bratty. Born on [[Christmas]], she only sees that day as a time for lavish and expensive gifts. Her overworked executive mother (Amy Hess) is struggling to provide "suitable" gifts for her young children. A disillusioned young [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] (Matt Wallace) does not see Christmas as a minister should. Then one day a drifter ([[Jefferson Moore]]) comes into town and changes these three people's lives forever by teaching them the true meaning of Christmas and that the best gift of all doesn't come in wrapping.

'''Upsy Downsy''' is a [[brand]] developed by [[Mattel]]. It concerns two races of strange beings, one that lives rightside-up (The Upsys), the other upside-down (The Downsys).&lt;ref name="Christmas Wishes"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ayb2AwZ7erMC&amp;lpg=PA1972-IA2&amp;dq=Upsy%20Downsy&amp;pg=PA1972-IA2#v=onepage&amp;q=Upsy%20Downsy&amp;f=false | title=Christmas Wishes | publisher=Stackpole Books | author=Hollis, Tim | year=2010 | pages=1972 | isbn=9780811742184}}&lt;/ref&gt; These psychedelic creatures and their fantasy world were featured in a short-lived line of colorful [[toy]]s and story [[book]]s for young children in 1969.

==The Toy Line==
[[Image:Upsydownsy.jpg|frame|right|Pudgy Fudgy, an Upsy, and Pocus Hocus, a Downsy]]The toys were small [[plastic]] characters with [[textile|fabric]] clothing and synthetic [[yarn]] hair, all in fantastic, garishly bright colors. Each came with a fold-out cardboard Playland mat, a "Magic Bridge Clip" to link one mat to another, some wild (and often quite fragile!) accessories, a mode of transportation, and a name that summed up their character in a few nonsensical words. All of the individual Playland mats were designed to be placed together using the Bridge Clips to make the "Happidiculous World" of The Upsys and Downsys. The Upsy figures were approximately 2-1/2" tall, basically humanoid in shape, with tiny bodies and huge oversized heads topped with a large bright yarn pompom for hair. The Downsys, on the other hand, were more [[cartoonish]] beings, about 4" in height with wild, goofy faces in the middle of a large, rounded body. Downsys' hands are positioned on the tops of their heads, to allow them to stand upside-down.

==The toys==

===Upsys===
* Flossy Glossy - The Upsy Fire-Chiefess and her Elewetter Fire Engine
* Tickle Pinkle - The Upsy Beauty and her Bugabout Car
* Pudgy Fudgy - The Upsy Eat-Too-Mucher and her Piggybus
* Baby So-High - The Upsy Hero and her Airo-Zoomer Plane

Like many things in Upsy Downsy Land, the gender of little Baby So-High, the infant pilot, appears a bit confused. In most instances, including all of the books and even the back of the toy's original packaging, Baby is referred to as a "she". But the bright billboard that came in that same package proclaims:

"Air Show Today!
See Baby So-High Fly ''his'' Airo-Zoomer!" (emphasis added)

===Downsys===
* Downy Dilly - The Downsy Mischief-Maker and her Footmobile
* Pocus Hocus - The Downsy Mixed-Up Magician and his Dragon Wagon
* Mother What Now - The Downsy Frazzled Mom and her Go-Getter Car
* Miss Information - The Downsy Opposite Directions Teller and her Miss Information Booth

For reasons that remain unclear, the name of Miss Information's Round-Eared, Three-Wheeled, Orange and Turquoise Conveyance has been popularly misnamed by many sources as "Booth Moose". While most of the Upsy vehicles seem to have been based on a particular animal (Piggybus springs to mind), the Downsy rigs are not so designed or constrained. And seeing that The Miss Information Booth hasn't anything remotely resembling antlers, this writer cannot see the remotest basis for this incorrect name.

===Wiz-z-zers===
Wiz-z-zers are gyro-powered toy tops that spin crazily when their tips are wound. Produced in many incarnations by Mattel during the late 1960s and well into the '1970s, these wild whirring tops were a perfect fit for the Upsy Downsy line, and were adapted as a pair of bizarre spinning vehicles, each coming with its own exclusive pilot character. Mattel inadvertently reversed the names of the two Wiz-z-zer-riding characters in the group cast picture shown on the backs of the toy Play Mats, making the whole endeavor all the more confused.
  
* The Furry Hurry Wiz-z-zer with Hithery Thithery  (Upsy)
* The Hairy Hurry Wiz-z-zer with Skelter Helter (Downsy)

===Playsets===
* HAPPY GO-ROUND
The Happy Go-Round Playset features a dazzling three-car carousel. The cars in question are Bugabouts (similar to Tickle Pinkle's car, but in different colors), which are connected to the central umbrella support by a three-way axle, so that all the cars rotate around the wobbly platform at once. The Set also includes an extra-large Playland Mat, a Magic Bridge Clip, a streetlamp, a fence, an Upsy Downsy Daisy, and most importantly, exclusive Upsy patrons Foozie Woozie and Tingle Dingle.

* FUNNY FEEDER
The Funny Feeder is the Downsy Land Hamburger Stand. The strange contraption features a spring-loaded tongue sticking out of its huge, grinning mouth (the better to toss plastic hamburgers towards customers with). The Feeder is manned by Downsy cook Short Order and Gooey Chooey, who has been characterized as either Short Order's waitress, or his best customer, or possibly BOTH (the books were kinda vague). The Set came with an oversized Playland Mat, a Magic Bridge Clip, a fence, a streetlamp, a Billboard (Advertising "Downside-Up Burgers"), a serving tray, and three of the afore-mentioned burgers, ready for launching.

==The Book Line==
Eight of the main Upsy Downsy characters were spotlighted in a series of lush, colorful (and slightly psychedelic) Storybooks that chronicled their crazy adventures.

There was also a larger book, ''Welcome to Upsy Downsy Land'', which introduced the Happidiculous World and its inhabitants as a whole.

This book told of the surreal origins of the Upsys and Downsys. They were once merely flowers, covering an entire world made of fuzzy dandelions. A sentient wind called The Great Huff passed by this world long ago, and, having his nose tickled by the dandelions, blew them all away. As the dandelions fell back to earth, some of them fell through a rainbow, and were magically changed into rightside-up beings known as Upsys. Other dandelions fell through a storm cloud, and became upside-down creatures called Downsys. The two factions, despite each being the others' polar opposite, got along famously, and developed their own little civilization, which came to be known as "Upsy Downsy Land".

===The Storybooks===

* "Welcome To Upsy Downsy Land"
* "Flossy Glossy and The Hard-to-find Fire"
* "Tickle Pinkle and The Beautiful Birthday Party"
* "Pudgy Fudgy &amp; The Whirl-around Picnic"
* "Baby So-High and The Just-Right Pet"
* "Downy Dilly and The Monster Trick"
* "Pocus Hocus and The Magic House-Tree"
* "Mother What Now and The Mixed-up Treasure"
* "Miss Information and The Upsy Downsy Circus"
* There was also a 14-Page Upsy Downsy Coloring Book, which was apparently a free give-away item intended to promote the line. Dated 1970, this Coloring Book utilized artwork from "Welcome To Upsy Downsy Land", and recounted the groups' origin.

===Other elements of the brand introduced in the books===

====Other characters mentioned in the books====

* Wooly Booly &amp; Moo Choo Engine—Wooly Booly, an Upsy Engineer, was featured prominently in Downy Dilly's story book. And his bovine locomotive, The Moo Choo, helped to further the plot of Miss Information's story. With these fully developed ancillary characters at the ready, it is interesting to speculate if Mattel might have produced an Upsy Downsy train set, had the line been more successful.
* Splasha Lotta the Sea Monster &amp; his Mamma (In DD)
* What-Nut the Squirrel (in PH)
* Bunny Funny (in PH)
* Chatter-Chitter the Chipmunk (in PH)
* Red-tailed Downsy-peckers (in PH)
* Morning Bird (in PF)
* Upsy Downsy Daisies (in PF)
* Pinkle Poodle – TP’s pet (in BSH)
* Spotless the Firedog – FG’s pet (in BSH)
* Yow-Me the Downsy Kitten (in BSH)
* Lovebirds – MWN’s pet (in BSH)
* Blossom Apple the Skunk – DD’s pet (in BSH)

====Upsy Downsy Land geographical landmarks mentioned in the books====
* Lake Fishabit
* Wetter Better Desert
* Daisy Hill
* Candy Factory
* Sleepy Deepy River
* Pocus Hocus' Nutbeech House-Tree on the bank of the Sleepy Deepy River
* Mother What Now’s cottage on the bank of the Sleepy Deepy River
* Flat-as-a-Mat Mountains
* The Fall-Up Falls, an inexplicable (but quite normal in Downsy Land) reverse waterfall, was mentioned on a Billboard sign that came packaged with Miss Information.
* Happidiculous Hill—Mattel even planned to market a Playset/Carrying Case for the toys based on this landmark. It was, however, never produced. In the books, Downy Dilly's inverted mushroom house was located at the top of Happidiculous Hill.

'''''Year Hare Affair''''' ({{lang-zh|c=那年那兔那些事/那年那兔那些事儿|l=The story of that rabbit happened at that year}}) is a Chinese [[webcomic]] by Lin Chao (Chinese: 林超).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_9bccd9b80101eydp.html|title=漫画《那年那月那兔》向志愿军致敬版 微博上转了两万条_中国兔子乌拉_新浪博客|website=blog.sina.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comic uses animals as an allegory for nations and sovereign states to represent political and military events  in history. The goal of this project was to promote nationalistic pride in young people, and focuses on appreciation for China's various achievements since the beginning of the 20th century. It was originally not intended for foreign audiences, but when the animated series gained popularity after its first season, the creators stopped planning episodes in strict chronological order so as to be able to portray countries with the most screen time in a positive light more often.

An animated adaptation of the series started airing on the Internet in March 2015&lt;ref name="animation"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1XhkOr1J7U|title=Year Hare Affair 01 （ English Sub） 那年那兔那些事儿01|date=7 March 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[free-to-play]] [[strategy video game]] based on it was released on iOS and Android in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://shouyou.178.com/nnnt/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet bear has a symbol — the [[hammer and sickle]] of [[Communism]] — on his stomach, which later becomes more like a character, "父", meaning "father" in Chinese.
|-
| [[Russia]] || [[Russian Bear]] with a single separated hair || To differentiate with the Soviet Union. This bear has a character "大" on his stomach, meaning that he is the "eldest son" of the USSR.  The hair stands for the common [[North China|Northern Chinese]] nickname for Russians "毛子" ("hairy ones", referring to the comparatively higher [[body hair]] count in [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]).
|-
| [[United States]] || [[Bald eagle]] || Bald eagle is the national bird of the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, E.A. (1990). "Symbol of a Nation: The Bald Eagle in American Culture". ''The Journal of American Culture'' 13 (1): 63–69&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Japan]] || [[Crane (bird)|Crane]] / [[Chicken]] || The crane is an important part of the Japanese culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:タンチョウ#.E6.97.A5.E6.9C.AC]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The chicken is used as an insult based on the similar appearance of crane and chicken and the traditional Chinese slang term ''[[xiao riben]]''.
|-
| [[South Korea]] || [[Gaoli bangzi]] with helmet || ''Bangzi'' is an [[ethnic slur]] used in [[Northeast China]] as a reference of Koreans.&lt;ref name="sourceOfBangzi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/weekinreview/the-world-china-and-north-korea-not-so-best-of-friends.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=THE WORLD; China and North Korea: Not-So-Best of Friends |date=April 11, 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To differentiate with North Korea, a US-style [[combat helmet]] is added to the appearance of South Korea.
|-
| [[North Korea]] || [[Gaoli bangzi]] with red star hat || ''Bangzi'' is an ethnic slur used in Northeast China as a reference of Koreans.&lt;ref name="sourceOfBangzi"/&gt;  To differentiate with South Korea, a Communist-style [[red star]] [[ski cap]] is added to the appearance of North Korea.
|-
| Multiple countries in [[Southeast Asia]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]] || [[Monkey]] || Monkey is commonly seen in the tropical jungles of Southeast Asia.  It is also used as an ethnic slur in China for areas without modern development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbs.tianya.cn/m/post-worldlook-1062478-1.shtml|title=金猴献瑞，蛮夷来朝|work=tianya.cn|accessdate=17 October 2015|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Pakistan]] || [[Markhor]] || Markhor is commonly seen in Pakistan and the national animal of this country.  In the animation the Markhor is called ''Ba Ba Yang'' ("Pak Goat") and sometimes nicknamed "Little Ba" by the Hare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/markhor-the-national-animal-of-pakistan/|title=Markhor: the national animal of Pakistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[India]] || [[White elephant (animal)|White elephant]] || White elephant is commonly seen in India as an important part of Hindu mythology.  In the animation the author chooses it rather than the [[bull]] which is sacred in Hindu to represent India because bull has already been used to represent the UK. 
|-
| United Kingdom || [[Bull]] || "[[John Bull]]" is a national personification of England and the United Kingdom in general.
|-
| [[France]] || [[Gallic rooster]] || Gallic rooster is an unofficial national symbol of France.
|-
| [[Germany]] || [[Tiger]]/[[Cat]] || [[Tiger II]] and other Tiger series of tanks are the most famous German heavy tank.&lt;ref&gt;Jentz, Thomas; Doyle, Hilary (1993). Kingtiger Heavy Tank 1942–45. Osprey Publishing. p. 23. {{ISBN|185532282X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  So in the assumption of the comic this animal called Hans was at first a tiger. But after World War II, Germany has been restricted to use military force, and thus after the war both East and West Germany become cats — a "downsized" tiger.
|-
| Multiple countries in Africa&lt;br /&gt;[[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Tanzania]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Sudan]]&lt;br /&gt;[[South Sudan]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Eritrea]] || [[Hippopotamus]] || Hippo is a large, mostly [[herbivorous]] mammal in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/hippopotamus|title=Hippopotamus|work=awf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both in the comic and the animation, nearly all mentioned African countries are represented by hippopotamus, except for Uganda under the [[Idi Amin]] regime. Also, Colonel Ka the Hippo sometimes symbolizes [[Muammar Gaddafi]] himself other than the country. Sudan and South Sudan only appear in the end of Episode 3, Season 2 of the animation.
|-
| [[Uganda]] || [[Duck]] || "Uncle Crazy Duck" is, in fact, the nickname of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi among Chinese netizens.  The appearance of "Uncle Crazy Duck" in the comic is based upon [[Count Duckula]] and has screws on his head, meaning that his brain is different from other Africans; he wears the skin of a hippo.  In the animation, Uncle Crazy Duck even shouts "Banana!" as the [[Minions (film)|Minions]] do during the speech.
|-
|Multiple countries in the Arab world&lt;br /&gt;[[Afghanistan]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Iraq]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Iran]] || [[Camel]]s || Camel is commonly seen and used as transportation in the desertous Arab world.  Both in the comic and the animation, nearly all mentioned Arabic countries are represented by camels, but they have different appearance — [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] camel wears a scarf and is bearded; [[Saudi Arabia]]n camel wears a scarf and lots of diamonds; [[Iraq]]i camel under the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime wears a beret; and [[Iran]]ian camel during the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] has a throne on his head.
|-
|-
| [[Iran]] || [[Asiatic lion|Persian lion]] || Persian lion is the symbol of ancient Iran and the [[Persian Empire]].  The religious reform of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] made Iran quite different from its Arabic neighbours, and so the author chooses the symbol of ancient Persia to represent it.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The comic expresses the modern history of [[China]] and its international relations in a fun way.&lt;ref name="funway" /&gt; It has sparked patriotism in China's younger generations.

Hare (Chinese: 我兔. ''lit. We the rabbit'') is now used as positive [[Internet slang]] referring to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#newwindow=1&amp;q=%E6%88%91%E5%85%94+%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD|title=Google|work=google.com|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===

Creators of an anti-''Year Hare Affair'' [[Facebook]] community page&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/YearHareAffair|title=Year Hare Affair|work=facebook.com|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe this comic is a sign of rising of Chinese [[chauvinism]] and [[Sinocentrism]], thus mocking the titular "That Rabbit" by calling him "Nazi Rabbit" caused by the identical pronunciation of "that" and the abbreviation for the word "Nazi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wu |first= Haiyun|url=http://www.sixthtone.com/news/782/new-national-mascot-burrows-netizens%20-patriotic-mindset|title=New National Mascot Burrows into Netizens’ Patriotic Mindset|publisher=Sixth Tone|date=April 27, 2016|access-date= August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical vision, provided in first two seasons of ''Year Hare Affair'', came under heavy criticism in an overview on the Russian website South China Insight, especially [[Sino-Soviet relations]]. Though it is admitted that relations with Russia "occupy a leading place" in reflecting of Chinese history, but with a "complete disregard for historical facts", such as Soviet involvement in the CPC's foundation and the [[Red Army]]'s [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|liberation of Manchuria]] from Japanese forces. It was also noted that the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] has been completely left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.south-insight.com/node/218192 |title="Дела зайца в те годы" - как китайцы видят отношения с Россией в одном из самых популярных мультфильмов Китая |trans-title="Year Hare Affair" - how the Chinese view relations with Russia in one of the most popular cartoons of China| website=South-insight.com |date=May 7, 2016 |access-date= August 7, 2017 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oiwan Lam of [[Global Voices Online]] finds [[racism]] in portraying the African as a hippopotamus, which she considers "a lazy and stupid animal". In that regard, "China's aid for Africa has also been simplified as a last resort because 'the [[First World|first world]] refused to play with us'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lam| first= Oiwan|url=https://globalvoices.org/2016/06/01/why-some-chinese-fail-to-see-racism-in-qiaobis-viral-detergent-commercial/| title=Why Some Chinese Fail to See Racism in Qiaobi's Viral Detergent Commercial|publisher=[[Global Voices Online]]|date=June 1, 2016|access-date= August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
The second and third season received 8.6 and 8.4 points out of 10 on [[Douban]].&lt;ref name="ChinaDaily five"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Li|first1=Hongrui|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/2017-03/16/content_28581355_3.htm|title=Five popular new Chinese animation series|work=[[China Daily]]|date=March 16, 2017|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
