[[File:Hermonax amphora in Würzburg 2.jpg|thumb|Detail with the preliminary sketching visible underneath the shield]]
The '''Amphora of Hermonax in Würzburg''' is a neck [[amphora]] which was made by the early [[Classical Greece|classical]] [[Attica|Attic]] vase painter [[Hermonax]] in the [[red figure]] style of [[Greek vase painting]] around 450 BC.The amphora was found in an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] grave in [[Vulci]]. Originally kept in the [[Feoli Collection]], it now belongs to the antiquity collection of the [[Martin von Wagner Museum]] in [[Würzburg]], where it is on display with a lid which probably does not belong to it.&lt;ref&gt;Inventary number HA 117 (= L 504); [[Beazley Archive]] Database Number 205438.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Both the execution of the potter's work and the imagery are typical for vases of this period. There are hundreds of slight variations of the theme of the [[arming scene]] depicted on the amphora. However the painting on this amphora, which was attributed to Hermonax by [[John Beazley]], is of a higher quality than most depictions of this theme.

On the front there is a young woman, who helps a young man to arm himself. Both wear only a [[chiton]], normally the young man would also have a two-part shirt and skirt. While the young man stoops slightly to put on his sword (though it was normal to put the [[greave]]s on first), the woman passes him his helmet, which has moveable cheek-plates and face plate. She also hold his [[round shield]], which has the emblem of a snake on it as an emblem.  Body armour, greaves, and spear are absent. Since the [[Persian Wars]], the items were common for Athenian [[hoplite]]s. Although at the time when the vase was created, the Athenian fleet was acquiring an ever more significant part in Athenian warfare, the hoplite remained the ideal citizen in arms and was depicted in an idealised form for a long time. Also long hair was no longer in fashion at the time of the creation of the vase and referred back to the Late Archaic, heroic period of the Persian Wars.

==Interpretation==
There are two theories about who is depicted here. On the one hand it has been suggested that the young man is [[Achilles]] receiving from his mother [[Thetis]] the weapons made by [[Hephaistos]] during the [[Trojan War]] and that the image derives from a scene in book 19 of [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' 19.10&lt;/ref&gt; A detail of this vase supports this theory: under the shield there are several lines from the vase painter's preliminary sketches. These sketches were engraved in the half dried clay before the firing in the slip with which it was covered before being fired. In these it can be seen that the female figure was originally intended to be naked. Generally the only women who were depicted naked in Greek art were goddesses, mythological figures like [[Maenad]]s or [[Nymph]]s, and prostitutes.

A second theory sees the young man, in Athenian custom at this age probably not yet married, simply as a Greek warrior, preparing for a campaign. Such a scene could only be set in a domestic environment. The woman depicted in the scene is too young to be his mother, so she must therefore be the young man's sister. Possibly a distinction has been consciously created by Hermonax between the divine and human spheres. Another factor in favour of the second theory is the fact that the people and the weapons look very dainty and hardly divine.

The reverse of the vase shows a man with a spear in the process of leaving, receiving a [[patera]] from a woman who fills it from a jug. This might signify the religious aspect of the departure to war, the departure offering.

In '''''Barclays Bank v Anderson''''', an important case in the [[South African law of succession]], the court said that conditions excluding the [[jurisdiction]] of the court are against [[public policy]] and are thus invalid. Furthermore, it was stated that the appropriate way to resolve [[Bad faith#In law|bad-faith]] attacks is to grant a costs order against the party who acted in bad faith. in clause 12(b) of the will it was provided that every beneficiary "shall....personally, permanently and beneficially occupy" the land bequeathed to him/her. In clause 12(c) it was provided that should a beneficiary fail to occupy his/her land , he/she would lose all right and claim to his/her portion of the farm.

'''''Beck v. Alabama''''', 447 U.S. 625 (1980), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that a jury must be allowed to consider [[lesser included offense]]s, not just capital offense or [[acquittal]].

==Background==
Beck was participating in a robbery when his accomplice intentionally killed someone. Beck was tried for [[capital murder]]. Under the Code of Alabama, Section 13-11-2 (1975), the requisite intent to kill could not be supplied by the felony murder doctrine. Felony murder was thus a lesser-included offense of the capital crime of robbery with an intentional killing. Under the statute, the judge was specifically prohibited from giving the jury the option of convicting for the lesser-included offense. Absent the statutory ban on such an instruction, Beck's testimony would have entitled him to an instruction on felony murder

==Lower Courts==
In the lower courts, Beck attacked the ban on the grounds that the Alabama statute was the same as the mandatory [[death penalty]] statutes that the Court had been striking down in recent holdings.

==Decision of the Supreme Court==
Though the lower courts disagreed, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the death sentence may not constitutionally be imposed after a jury verdict of guilt of a capital offense where the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included offense.&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite web|title=Beck.

==Dissent==
[[Justice Rehnquist]] wrote the dissenting opinion for the court, [[Byron White|Justice White]] joined in Rehnquist's dissent

'''CIBI Information, Inc.''' or '''CIBI''', formerly known as '''Credit Information Bureau, Inc.''', is the first and the only local [[credit bureau in the Philippines]]. CIBI started as a government entity under the [[Central Bank of the Philippines]] Department of Loans and Credit to initiate a [[credit (finance)|credit]] information exchange system in the country. Founded in 1982, CIBI was established through the power of Presidential Decree 1941 created under Central Bank of the Philippines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dirp3.pids.gov.ph/ris/wp/pidswp9024.pdf|format=PDF|title=Central Bank Policies and the Behaviour of the Money Market|website=Dirp3.pids.gov.ph|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; now [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (BSP);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov.edgekey.net/gsearch/pilipinas%20cibi%20character%20background%20investigation] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/250938/sec-approves-credit-rating-accreditation-prsc|title=SEC approves credit rating accreditation of PRSC|author=Zinnia B.

In 1997, Credit Information Bureau, Inc. was incorporated and transformed into a private entity and became '''CIBI Information, Inc.''' CIBI is a provider of information to businesses and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competitive.org.ph/node/715|title=Philippines Soars 30 Notches in the IFC 2014 Doing Business Report - National Competitiveness Council|website=Competitive.org.ph|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also supplies compliance reports before accrediting agencies, industry partners and even hiring professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/142269/rp%C2%92s-biggest-credit-research-firms-form-alliance|title=RP&amp;#146;s biggest credit research firms form alliance|website=Philstar.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, CIBI Information, Inc. was one of the four credit bureaus and the only local firm accredited by the [[Credit Information Corporation]] (CIC) as a Special Accessing Entity. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/03/14/16/philippines-oks-6-credit-bureaus|title=Philippines OKs 6 credit bureaus|author=Michelle Ong|website=News.abs-cbn.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1981, [[Ferdinand Marcos]], then President of the Republic of the [[Philippines]], issued a Letter of Instructions No. 1107 mandating the Central Bank of the Philippines to analyze the probability of establishing and funding the operation of a [[credit bureau]] due to the disturbing increase of failures on corporate borrowers.

In adherence to the order, Central Bank of the Philippines organized the ''Credit Information Exchange System'' under the department of Loans and Credit. It was created to engage in collating, developing and analyzing credit information on individuals, institutions, business entities and other business concerns. It aims to develop and undertake the continuing exchange of credit data within its members and subscribers and to provide an impartial source of credit information for debtors, creditors and the public. This will also cooperate and guide government agencies in their [[credit information]] requirements.

On April 14, 1982, Credit Information Bureau, Inc. was incorporated as a non-stock, non-profit corporation. (See: Presidential Decree No. 1941  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno1941.html#.VaN-RPmqqko|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|author=Ronald Echalas Diaz|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Incorporation===
[[CIBI]] was created pursuant to LOI No. 1107 dated February 16, 1981 and was further strengthened by PD No. 1941 which recognizes and supports CIBI as a suitable [[credit bureau]] to promote the development and maintenance of rational and efficient credit processes in the [[financial system]] and in the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/144047/centralized-credit-bureau-seen-to-open-in-dec-14|title=Centralized credit bureau seen to open in Dec. ’14|first=Doris C.|last=Dumlao|website=Business.inquirer.net|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/06/09/09/pse-appointments-raise-conflict-interest-concerns|title=PSE appointments raise conflict-of-interest concerns|author=Judith Balea|website=Abs-cbn.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, CIBI Information, Inc. expand its coverage of background checking in national and international spectrum through groundwork and affiliations with local and foreign information and credit companies. Commercial operations as a separate entity commenced on April 1, 1999.

CIBI Information, Inc. became the partner of many corporate industries throughout the Philippines in applying measures for risk management by setting capability, compliance and legitimacy outlines for trade associates and suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayniladwater.com.ph/supplier-accreditation.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103046/http://www.mayniladwater.com.ph/supplier-accreditation.php |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CIBI also validates personal information of their clients’ current and potential human resources.

===CIBI Foundation, Inc.===
CIBI Foundation, Inc. is a founding member of the [[ASEAN]] Forum of Credit Rating Agencies (AFCRA), established on November 5, 1993 in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].

On April 11, 2008, the [[Board of Directors]] (BOD) approved the amendment of the Company’s [[Articles of Incorporation]] to include the development and operation of a [[call center]] business and similar services by providing customer management services through various channels and media, including but not limited to, telephone, cable, facsimile, electronic mail, web chat and all allied or related services as its primary activities. The BOD also approved for the company to formally engage in the business of providing services for outsourced business processes.

On June 16, 2008, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|SEC]] approved the Company’s Amended Articles of Incorporation. The company is 75% owned by Go Kim Pah Foundation and 25% owned by CIBI Foundation, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com:8080/business/2016/03/14/1562871/philippines-oks-first-6-credit-bureaus] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Text from the Chronicle of Morea.png|300px|thumb|right|Text from the Chronicle of the Morea &lt;ref name="Bury"&gt;J.B. Bury, in page 386, Appendix of volume 9, Notes by the Editor, in the (New York: Fred de Fau and Co., 1906) edition of ''Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776)'', ed. J.B. Bury with an Introduction by W.E.H. Lecky.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Chronicle of the Morea''''' ({{lang-el|Το χρονικόν του Μορέως}}) is a long 14th-century history text, of which four versions are extant: in [[French language|French]], [[Medieval Greek|Greek]] (in verse), [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]].  More than 9,000 lines long, the ''Chronicle'' narrates events of the [[Crusades|Franks]]' establishment of [[feudalism]] in mainland [[Greece]].  West European Crusaders settled in the [[Peloponnese]] (called [[Morea]] at the time) following the [[Fourth Crusade]].  The period covered in the ''Chronicle'' was 1204 to 1292 (or later, depending on the version).  It gives significant details on the civic organization of the [[Principality of Achaia]].

==The extant texts of the ''Chronicle of the Morea''==
The Greek text is the only text written in verse.  The French, Italian and Aragonese texts are written in prose.&lt;ref name="Polet"&gt;Jean-Claude Polet, ''Patrimoine littéraire européen'', De Boeck Université, 1995, {{ISBN|2-8041-2077-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek text===
The verses of the Greek text are written in a 15-syllable [[political verse]]. The verses are accented but not rhymed.&lt;ref name="WSmith"&gt;William Smith, ''A History of Greece'', R. B. Collins, 1855, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in the spoken Greek of the time, with the inclusion of several French words.

There are two parallel Greek texts, as well as three copies:
*Ms Havniensis 57 (14th&amp;ndash;15th century, in [[Copenhagen]]) 9219 verses
**Ms Taurinensis B.II.I, library of [[Turin]], closely related to the Copenhagen text
*Ms Parisinus graecus 2898 (15th&amp;ndash;16th century, at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], [[Paris]]) 8191 verses
**Ms Parisinus graecus 2753 and
**Ms [[Bern]] 509 grec, both copies of the Paris version.

The oldest text is that held in Copenhagen, the language of which is more archaic. The Parisian, more recent, text is simpler in language and has fewer foreign words.  The transcriber omitted several anti-Hellenic references, so the overall text expressed less contempt of Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kolonaros, ''Το Χρονικόν του  Μορέως (The Chronicle of Moreas)'', Athens 1940, page η'&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference of about one century between the Copenhagen and Parisian version shows a considerable number of linguistic differences due to the rapid evolution of the Greek language. The text of the Copenhagen version describes events until 1292.

===French text===
*[[Royal Library of Belgium]] No 15702
This text is known under the title: "The Book of the Conquest of Constantinople and
the Empire of Roumania and the country of the Principality of Morea", since in the [[incipit]], it is indicated "C'est le livre de la conqueste de Constantinople et de l'empire de Romanie, et dou pays de la princée de la Morée"

There are also other copies of the French text:
**National Library, [[Paris]], No. 2753
**University Library of [[Bern]], No.509

Information in this text reaches until the year 1304.

===Italian text===
*''Cronaca di Morea'', is a summary that was compiled later than the previous texts and contains several mistakes. Its source is the text found in the Greek manuscript held in Turin.

===Aragonese text===
*''Libro de los fechos et conquistas del principado de la Morea'', was compiled at the end of the 14th century (around 1395), from the Greek version and other later sources, at the request of the Grand Master [[Jean Fernandez de Heredia]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedic Dictionary'', entry on "Χρονικόν Μωρέως", Eleftheroudakis ed., 1931 (''in Greek'')&lt;/ref&gt; It covers events to 1393.

==Which text is the original? Which version came out first?==
It appears that the original text of the ''Chronicle of the Morea'' has been lost.&lt;ref name="Polet"/&gt; Although the [[Aragon]]ese and Italian texts have been clearly identified as later texts, there is no widely accepted consensus on the priority of the Greek or French text.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jeffreys, The Chronicle of the Morea: Priority of the Greek version, BZ 68 (1975) 304-350&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Panagiotis, Study Medieval Greek, Museum Tusculanum Press, 1992, {{ISBN|87-7289-163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril A. Mango, The Oxford History of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-814098-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Topping/&gt;

==The Author==
The author of the original text of the chronicle appears to be a Franc or a ''[[Gasmouloi|gasmoule]]'' (a French-Greek, born from a mixed French-Greek marriage, the word seems to have an etymology from ''garçon'' (boy) and ''mule''). He appeared to admire the Franks (Crusaders) and have contempt of the local population and the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]]. Notably, the author respects the citizenship of the [[Byzantine Greeks]], calling them [[Rhomaioi|Romans (Ρωμαῖοι)]] (especially in verses 1720-1738).

==The significance of the ''Chronicle''==
The ''Chronicle'' is famous in spite of certain historical inaccuracies because of its lively description of life in the feudal community and because of the character of the language which reflects the rapid transition from Medieval to Modern Greek.

Polet&lt;ref name="Polet"/&gt; explains that since the author admired the Franks and had contempt for the Byzantine culture, the ''Chronicle of Morea'' did not become part of popular culture and history after the Franks left the Peloponnese.

Numerous administrative laws and practices of the [[Principality of Achaia]] are  mentioned in the Chronicle, making it a significant source on the Frankish period in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;P. Zepos, "Το δίκαιον εις το Χρονικόν του Μορέως (The Law in the Chronicle of the Morea)", ''Επετηρίς Εταιρείας Βυζαντινών Σπουδών (Annals of the Society for Byzantine Studies)'' 18(1948), 202-220, ''in Greek''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language of the ''Chronicle''==
Since the year of the Fall of Constantinople, 1453, marks the symbolic boundary between [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] and [[Modern Greek]], the ''Chronicle of the Morea'' is generally classified under Medieval Greek.&lt;ref&gt;R. Browning ''Medieval and modern Greek''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Horrocks ''Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers'', London &amp; New York 1997, p. 276-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tonnet&gt;H. Tonnet ''Histoire du grec modèrne'', chapter “la langue médievale” )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmanuel Kriaras|Kriaras]] in the ''Dictionary of Greek Medieval Vernacular Literature'' includes the Chronicle in his sources {{cite web |url=http://195.251.48.156/greekLang/medieval_greek/bibliographies/sources/contents.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928140041/http://195.251.48.156/greekLang/medieval_greek/bibliographies/sources/contents.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Chronicle of the Morea'', along with the [[Ptochoprodromic poems]] and [[acritic songs]] are considered as the beginnings of [[modern Greek literature]].  They are classified as part of both "Byzantine / medieval vernacular" and "(early) modern Greek" literature.
&lt;ref name=Tonnet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Andriotes - History of the Greek language&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first editions in print==
The first printed edition of the ''Chronicle'' was published in 1840 by J.A. Buchon.  It contained the Greek text from Paris.&lt;ref name="Bury"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Buchon, ''Chroniques etrangères relatives aux expéditions françaises pendant le xiii siécle'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt;

Buchon named the book ''Βιβλίον της κουγκέστας του Μωραίως'' (Book of the conquest of Morea), a different title than the text.  The second printed edition of the Chronicle was that of the Greek text from Copenhagen, published by Buchon in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Buchon, ''Recherches historiques sur la principauté française de Morée et ses hautes baronies'' (1845)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1889 John Schmitt published both texts of the Copenhagen and Paris manuscripts side by side.

The OpenDocument format (ODF), an abbreviation for the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications, is an [[open format|open]] and [[free file format|free]] (excluding maintenance and support)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=335446&lt;/ref&gt; [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[chart]]s, and presentations.  This standard was developed by the [[Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards|OASIS]] industry consortium, based upon the [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]]-based file format originally created by [[OpenOffice.org]], and ODF was approved as an OASIS standard on May 1, 2005. It became an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard, ISO/IEC 26300, on May 3, 2006, ''see main article [[OpenDocument]].

==OpenDocument Format version in exported files==

Root elements in ODF files take an office:version attribute, which indicates which version of OpenDocument Format specification it complies with. The version number is in the format revision.version. If the file has a version known to an XML processor, it may validate the document. Otherwise, it is optional to validate the document, but the document must be well formed. Informations from OpenDocument specification &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office|OpenDocument specification]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following table contains list of ODF specification version attribute office:version="1.X" used in files exported from OpenDocument software.

Tested sample documents contained one simple sentence (text documents), 10 rows with numbers (sheets), 2 slides (presentation documents). Validation was tested in two different ODF validators.&lt;ref name="opendocumentfellowship"&gt;http://opendocumentfellowship.com/validator&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="openoffice.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.services.openoffice.org/odfvalidator/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026030022/http://tools.services.openoffice.org/odfvalidator/ |archivedate=2008-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Content Management Interoperability Services''' ('''CMIS''') is an [[open standard]] that allows different [[content management systems]] to inter-operate over the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemistry.apache.org/project/cmis.html|title=Apache Chemistry - What is CMIS?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, CMIS defines an [[abstraction layer]] for controlling diverse [[document management system|document management systems and repositories]] using [[World Wide Web|web]] [[Communications protocol|protocols]].

== Concept ==
CMIS defines a [[domain model]] plus bindings that can be used by applications to manipulate content stored in a repository.

CMIS provides a common data model covering typed files and folders with generic properties that can be set or read. There is a set of services for adding and retrieving documents ('objects'). There may be an access control system, a checkout and version control facility, and the ability to define generic relations. Three protocol bindings are defined, one using [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] and [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]], another using [[AtomPub]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first= Robin|last= Cover|title=Vendors Publish Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) Standard|publisher= The Cover Pages|date=2008-09-10| url = http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2008-09-10-a.html| accessdate = 2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a last browser-friendly one using [[JSON]]. The model is based on common architectures of document management systems.

The CMIS specification provides an API that is [[Language-independent specification|programming language-agnostic]], as [[REST]] and [[SOAP]] are implemented in many languages.

== Reasoning ==
Many of the original contributors to the specification believed 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Müller |first1=Florian  |last2=Brown |first2=Jay |last3=Potts |first3=Jeff |isbn=978-1-617-29115-9 |date=2013 |title=CMIS and Apache Chemistry in Action |chapter=foreword 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a simplified and standardized way to access unstructured content across all vendors would increase the adoption of [[Enterprise content management|ECM]] products, but only if the standard could remain compatible with existing deployed systems, much the way that ODBC [[Open Database Connectivity]] did for the relational database market in the 1990s.

== History ==
The initial work of developing the momentum and use cases that led to the CMIS proposal was conducted by the iECM Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiim.org/ResourceCenter/Archive/Article.aspx?ID=31483|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100506121033/http://www.aiim.org/ResourceCenter/Archive/Article.aspx?ID=31483|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-06|title=Sorry, the requested URL was not found on this server.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
sponsored by [[AIIM]]. This ongoing project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiim.org/Standards/article.aspx?ID=29284|title=Sorry, the requested URL was not found on this server.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228105956/http://www.aiim.org/standards/article.aspx?ID=29284|archivedate=2008-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to foster interoperability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiim.org/ResourceCenter/Archive/Article.aspx?ID=30301|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100506121015/http://www.aiim.org/ResourceCenter/Archive/Article.aspx?ID=30301|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-06|title=Sorry, the requested URL was not found on this server.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among ECM systems is supported by the collaborative efforts of governmental, commercial, vendor, and consulting organizations.

Although initiated by [[Association for Information and Image Management|AIIM]], CMIS is now administered by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]], a web standards consortium. Participants in the process include [[Adobe Systems Incorporated]], [[Alfresco (software)|Alfresco]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]], eXo, [[FatWire]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[ISIS Papyrus]], [[Liferay]], [[Microsoft]], [[Nuxeo]], [[Open Text Corporation|OpenText]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Newgen Software Technologies Limited|Newgen OmniDocs]] and [[SAP AG|SAP]]. The standard is available for public comment at OASIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author = Mary P McRae|title = Proposed Charter for OASIS Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) TC|publisher = The Cover Pages|date =2008-09-10|url = http://xml.coverpages.org/OASIS-CMIS-CharterProposal.html|accessdate = 2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OASIS approved CMIS as an OASIS Specification on May 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/cmis/CMIS/v1.0/os/cmis-spec-v1.0.pdf |title=The CMIS v1.0 OASIS Standard Specification}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CMIS 1.1 has been approved as an OASIS specification on December 12, 2012.&lt;ref name="oasis-open.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/content-management-interoperability-services-cmis-version-1-1-approved-and-publis|title=Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) Version 1.1 approved and published - OASIS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specification is currently approved as [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] CMIS v1.1 standard.&lt;ref name="oasis-open.org"/&gt;

There are public discussion lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/search/?q=list:org.oasis-open.lists.cmis|title=Search results for list:org.oasis-open.lists.cmis - MarkMail|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Technical Committee (TC) includes the following organizations:
[[Adobe Systems Incorporated]], [[AIIM]], [[Alfresco (software)|Alfresco Software]], [[ASG Software Solutions]], [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], Content Technologies, [[dotCMS]], [[Ektron]], [[EMC Corporation]], Entropysoft, [[Exalead|Exalead, Inc.]], [[FatWire]], [[Fidelity Investments]], [[GX Software]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[ISIS Papyrus]], [[Microsoft Corporation]], [[Nuxeo]], [[Open Text Corporation]], [[Oracle Corporation]], Quark, [[Pearson PLC]], [[SAP AG]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[WeWebU Software AG]] and Zia Consulting.

== Criticism ==
There is some discussion on the name of CMIS. Some blogs and authors say that it should be named "DMIS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dotcms.com/blog/post/ignore-the-spec-cmis-1-0-is-for-web-content-management-too|title=Ignore the Spec - CMIS 1.0 is for Web Content Management too|first=|last=dotCMS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asserttrue.blogspot.de/2009/06/cmis-or-dmis.html#|title=CMIS, or DMIS?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; D for Document since it is more targeted on ECM.

From the CMIS Specification 1.1, page:&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.oasis-open.org/cmis/CMIS/v1.1/cs01/CMIS-v1.1-cs01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "[...] this data model does not cover all the concepts that a full-function ECM repository [...] transient entities (such as programming interface objects), administrative entities (such as user profiles), and extended concepts (such as compound or virtual document, work flow and business process, event and subscription) are not included."

== List of implementations ==

=== CMIS Servers ===
A CMIS server stores content, and offers access via the CMIS protocol. Some servers also allow access via other protocols.

====Capabilities====
Each CMIS server declares a set of capabilities. For instance, servers that allow documents to be filed in different places declare the capability "Multifiling". This mechanism allows clients to interact differently with servers that support or don't support a particular operation.

Some server products allow certain capabilities to be disabled or enabled by configuration. the table below lists maximum capabilities.

'''''Counselman v. Hitchcock''''', 142 U.S. 547 (1892), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court ruled that not incriminating an individual for testimony was not the same as not requiring them to testify at all. The court reasoned that as long as evidence arising from the compelled testimony could incriminate the individual in any way, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] guarantee against self-incrimination was not satisfied. The court then passed the broader "transactional immunity" statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Cohen|author2= John Kaplan|title=Constitutional law: civil liberty and individual rights|year=1981|publisher=Foundation Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8EG5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=constitutional+law+civil+liberty+and+individual+rights&amp;dq=constitutional+law+civil+liberty+and+individual+rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Counselman v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10741">The "'''Epistola de litteris colendis'''" is a well-known letter addressed by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] to Abbot Baugulf of Fulda, probably written sometimes in late 780s to 800s (decade), although the exact date is still debatable. The letter is a very important witness to the Carolingian educational reforms during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] from late 8th century to 9th century. The letter shows Emperor [[Charlemagne]]'s interest in promoting learning and education within his empire.&lt;ref name=FU&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlemagne: Letter to Baugaulf of Fulda, c. 780-800|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/carol-baugulf.asp|work=Fordham University: Medieval Sourcebook|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest existing copy of this letter comes from the 18th century. Another version dates back to the 11th century. The older of the two surviving manuscripts is located at Wuerzburg and offers the original text addressed to Abbot Baugulf. The more recent manuscript (Metz, bibl mun fourth. o nr 226,.. SAEC XI, burned in 1945), whose text is preserved by older editions, is the revised version offered for Angilram, who was charged with the further dissemination.

The Epistula de litteris colendis is the earliest, and one of the most important, sources promoting the advance of educational reforms throughout Charlemagne's Empire. It was followed by the more detailed [[Admonitio generalis]].

In the letter, Charlemagne expresses his concern about the literacy of monks and priests, many of whom were illiterate or only partially literate. Charlemagne expresses concern that their poor literacy may lead them to make errors or interpret the bible and scriptures incorrectly.&lt;ref name=FU/&gt;

==Authorship==
The well-known letter is addressed by Emperor [[Charlemagne]], also known as Charles I. Charlemagne became the King of the Franks in 768 and the King of Italy in 774. He would later become the Emperor of the Carolingian Empire. Charlemagne carried on his father [[Pepin the Short]]’s policy with the papacy and viewed himself as its protector. Charlemagne’s admiration for learning led to his interest in scholarship. He encouraged his children to be well-educated and studied under [[Peter of Pisa]], [[Alcuin of York]], and [[Einhard]]. Charlemagne’s greatest weakness however, according to Einhard was his inability to write. Even his ability to read has been called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Paul Edward, Charlemagne's Mustache&lt;/ref&gt;

This letter was presumably written by Alcuin of York, not by Charlemagne himself. Alcuin was Charlemagne’s teacher for rhetoric, logic, and astronomy. Alcuin wrote several theological and philosophical treatises. Alcuin, the director of the palace school at Aachen at the time, was encouraged by Charlemagne to introduce [[Carolingian minuscule]], a script to standardize the Latin alphabet to be recognized by literate classes from one region to another. The letter was argued to contain literary elements that were Alcuinisms, indicating Alcuin's heavy influence.&lt;ref name=LW&gt;Luitpold Wallach. “Charlemagne’s De litteris colendis and Alcuin: A Diplomatic-Historical Study”. Speculum, vol. 26, No. 2 (Apr., 1951), pp. 228-305. Medieval Academy of America&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content/Summary==
De litteris colendis is the second Carolingian document to urge the formation of schools. The scope of teaching advocated suggests a broader view than that in the Admonitio generalis. Here the text embraces all ancient learning and complete understand of the Bible as a primary goal.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Forscher Weiss, Russell E, Cynthia J. Cyrus. Music Education in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Indiana University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the letter, Charlemagne express his views on knowledge and conduct, stating that because knowledge precedes conduct, people must study about the goals he wishes to accomplish without making any errors. Errors should be shunned by men and avoided at all cost so that these chosen people can become the servants of truth. Charlemagne refers the mind and the tongue to be uneducated on account of the neglect of study and therefore unable to express the truth in letters. Charlemagne worries that lack of literate skills in monks and priests at the time may lead to a lack of understanding of the Holy Scriptures. Errors of understanding are a greater danger than errors of speech because misunderstanding of the Holy Scriptures can result in divine punishment, such as [[damnation]]. Charlemagne encourages these soldiers of the church to never neglect the study of letters in order to correctly uncover the meanings of Scripture. Those who teach letters are chosen for this because of their ability in learning and instructing others. Charlemagne’s view on teaching shows his concerns about the education of monks and priests at the time and advocated the need for better understanding of the original source, the Bible. At the end of the letter Charlemagne wishes for the wide spread of this letter to all the monasteries and into the hands of fellow-bishops.&lt;ref name=FU/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The wisdom for understanding the Holy Scriptures might be much less than it rightly ought to be. And we all know well that, although errors of speech are dangerous, far more dangerous are errors of the understanding.&lt;ref name=FU/&gt; --[[Charlemagne|Emperor Charlemagne]], De Litteris Colendis&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background information==
[[Charlemagne]]’s views on education displayed in this letter, among many works, encourage Carolingian schoolmasters to seize the opportunity to teach many ancient works, books such as Martianus Capella’s ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' and Boethius’s ''De institutione musica''.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;Charles M. Atkinson. The Critical Nexus: Tone-System, Mode, and Notation in Early Medieval Music. Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was written at a time that saw the organization and transformation of the Frankish Kingdom into a large Christian state. The new Christian culture within the Carolingian realm was acquired with relative ease because late-antique Christian writers suggested various ways to integrate secular arts into Christian education.&lt;ref name=NH&gt;Nils Holger Petersen, Claus Clüver, Nicilas Bell. Signs of Change: Transformation of Christian Traditions and Their Representation in the Arts, 1000-2000. New York, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Charlemagne wanted to control and oversee a strong relationship between the states of learning and the Christian faith. De litteris colendis, along with [[Admonitio generalis]], is a statement of the king's religious faith and obligations. After the expansion of the Carolingian realm, Charlemagne recognized the need for reform to promote the correct use of Latin language and correct understanding of Christian faith and text. This was a way to enhance Frankish identity. Literacy was required and rewarded during Charlemagne's reign.&lt;ref name=M/&gt;

[[Alcuin]], the suspected author of the letter, expressed views on the intrinsic Christian value of the liberal arts that were not widely accepted by many. However, Alcuin influenced some of the most sophisticated Carolingian thinkers of the first half of the 9th century.&lt;ref name=NH/&gt; The original letter by Charlemagne was likely written to Baugulf, but the text would reach Baugulf at a later time after the written date.&lt;ref name=LW/&gt;

The ability to read and write was not very common in the Frankish Kingdom during the late 8th century, and Charlemagne wanted to create an education system to provide training for future administrators in both sacred and secular realms. [[Alcuin]], along with [[Paulinus of Aquileia]], [[Peter of Pisa]], [[Theodulf of Orleans]] was one of many intellectuals invited by Charlemagne to implement the king’s program of education reform. Alcuin was appointed to take over the direction of the palace school. Alcuin's program is reflected by his established program at St. Martin of Tours, where Alcuin put emphasis on writing, reading, and grammar;&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; elements the Epistola de litteris colendis heavily advocated. The existence of the palace school has been called into question.&lt;ref name=M&gt;McKitterick, Rosamond. Charlemagne : The Formation of a European Identity. Cambridge University Press. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating the Letter==
Many historians make the assumption that the letter was sent directly to an unknown archbishop based on the mentions of the co-bishops, but the abbot could very well be the actual recipient of this letter. The letter belongs to the tradition of Anglo-Saxon humanism. The request at the end of the letter extends to monks as lower clerics. Luitpold Wallach argues that coincidental similarities with the Capitulare Francofurtense contained in this letter suggest 794 as the earliest possible year when this letter to Baugulf was written. The letter is also paralleled by a letter written by Alcuin to Fulda after 800. Because of Alcuin’s letter to Fulda from Tours at a later date, this would mean that De litteris colendis couldn’t not have been written at a time when Alcuin was already at St Martin’s at Tours. More specifically, the letter addressing Baugulf is most likely written between June of 794, the period between the Synod of Frankfurt, and 796, Alcuin’s arrival as abbot of St Martain at Tours.&lt;ref name=LW/&gt; Another possible date of the Letter was as early as 784/5.&lt;ref name=M/&gt;

'''Desktop organizer''' software applications are applications that automatically create useful organizational structures from desktop content from heterogeneous types of content including email, files, contacts, companies, RSS news feeds, photos, music and chat sessions. The organization is based on a combination of automated scanning of [[metadata]] similar to [[data mining]] and manual tagging of content. The metadata stored in applications is correlated based on a structure for the data type handled by the organizer tool. For example, the email address of a sender of an email allows the email to be filed in a [[virtual folder]] for the author and company the author works for or a music file is filed by the musician and album label. The resulting visualization simplifies use of desktop content to navigate, search, and use related information stored on the desktop computer. The data in desktop organizer tools is normally stored in a [[database]] rather than the computer's [[file system]] in order to produce virtual folders where the same item can appear in multiple folders to the user based on its relationship to the folder.

Desktop organizers are related to [[desktop search]] because both sets of tools allow users to locate desktop resources. The primary differences between the two are that desktop organizers perform post-search functionality related to the primary purpose of the organizer, offer manual [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] creation and tagging by the desktop user, and help gather additional related resources for taxonomy or related content from Internet resources.

==Communications organizers==
Organization tools of contacts and correspondences involve the tracking and management of information stored in multiple communications tools. Due to the rise of computers for use in communications including [[email]], [[VoIP]] applications like [[Skype]], [[online chat|chat]], [[web browser]]s, [[blog]]s, [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] and [[Customer Relationship Management|CRM]] content relating to companies and contacts is often spread across multiple applications. Desktop communications organizers collect and correlate information stored in these applications.

Common features of communications organizers include:
* Connectivity through scanners and listeners to communications tools including email, chat, bookmarks, and VoIP
* RSS newsfeed subscriptions
* Filing of desktop files and documents
* Connectivity to [[desktop search]] or desktop search capabilities
* Virtual folders to locate the same item in multiple locations
* Workflow utilities to mark items for follow-up and annotate items

==Picture organizers==
{{More|Image organizer}}

Also referred to as [[image viewer]]s, picture organizers provide utilities to file and view pictures in folders and to tag pictures with metadata for future use. Picture organizers may also integrate with [[photo sharing]] sites that also organize pictures but through a [[social network]]. 

There are two classes of picture organizers:
* Automatic picture organizers.  These are software packages that read data present in digital pictures and use this data to automatically create an organization structure.  Each digital picture contains information about the date when the picture was taken. It is this piece of information that serves as the basis for automatic picture organization.  The user usually has little or no control over the automatically created organization structure.  Some tools create this structure on the hard drive (physical structure), while other tools create a virtual structure (it exists only within the tool).  
* Manual picture organizers.  This kind of software provides a direct view of the folders present on a user's hard disk. Sometimes referred to as [[image viewer]]s, they only allow the user to see the pictures but do not provide any automatic organization features.  They give maximum flexibility to a user and show exactly what the user has created on his hard drive.  While they provide maximum flexibility, manual organizers rely on the user to have his/her own method to organize their pictures.  Currently there are two main methods for organizing pictures manually: tag and folder based methods.  While not mutually exclusive, these methods are different in their methodology, outcome and purpose. 

Presently, many commercial image organization software offer both automatic and manual picture organization features. A [[comparison of image viewers]] reveals that many freely available software packages are available that offer most of the organization features available in commercial software.  However, not all [[image viewer]]s offer organizational tools. Popular picture organizers include [[Google]]'s [[Picasa]], [[DigiKam]], [[Adobe Systems]]'s [[Adobe Photoshop Elements|Elements]], [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iPhoto]], [[Phase One (company)|Phase One]]'s [[Media Pro 1]] and [[Novell]]'s [[F-spot]].

Common key organizational tools provided by picture organizers are:
* Organization by date or date range
* Tagging of pictures with attributes including location, people, and 
* Storing the same picture in multiple virtual folders
* Rating of pictures

==Music organizers==
Music contains unique attributes such as artist, album, genre, era, and song title used to organize the songs. The desktop organization of music is primarily embedded into [[audio player (software)|audio player]]s and [[media player (application software)|media player]]s like [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]], [[Rhythmbox]], [[Banshee (music player)|Banshee]], [[MediaMonkey]], [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]], [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iTunes]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Media Player]] or [[Zune]]. Organization is used to create playlists, or to organize the media collection into a folder hierarchy, by specific artists, albums, or genres. 

Another type of the music organizers allows user to organize his media collection directly without listening of music.

By connecting the audio players to databases of tagged music to compare a collection with a professionally organized and tagged collection of music, MP3 collections can be enhanced with metadata corrections to support the organization process when metadata is not complete in the original items.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4618">'''Edwin Gentzler''' is a Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and former Director of the Translation Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

==Biography==

Gentzler first obtained his BA in English at [[Kenyon College]], [[Gambier, Ohio]] in 1973. From 1974-77, he studied [[Germanistic]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. From 1978-83, Gentzler worked as a translator and administrator at the [[International Writing Program]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. He obtained his [[PhD]] in [[Comparative Literature]] in 1990 at the [[Vanderbilt University]], [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. He was a guest professor at [[Utrecht University]] in Holland and [[Warwick University]] in England in the early 1990s. Since 1994 Gentzler has worked at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], Department of Comparative Literature, where he lectured in Translation Technology, [[Translation Studies]], [[Postcolonial Theory]], and [[Comparative Literature]]. He also directed the Translation Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/hfa/faculty/profiles/edwingentzler.html Gentzler faculty profile at UMassAmherst]&lt;/ref&gt;, which provides translation services to business, hospitals, and social service agencies in New England. He has translated works of German authors, including [[Manfred Jendreschik]], [[Axel Schulze]], [[Elke Erb]], [[Sarah Kirsch]], [[Helga Novak]], and [[Eberhard Panitz]], into English. He retired in 2017.

He is a founding member of the [[American Translation and Interpreting Studies Association]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atisa.org/officers ATISA]&lt;/ref&gt;, served on the Executive Committee of the [[Nida Institute]], and was co-editor (with [[Susan Bassnett]]) of the Topics in Translation Series for [[Multilingual Matters]].

==Thought==
Gentzler is the author of ''Translation and Rewriting in the Age of Post-Translation Studies'' (Routledge, 2017), ''Translation and Identity in the Americas'' (Routledge, 2008), and ''Contemporary Translation Theories'' (Routledge, 1993), reissued in revised second edition (Multilingual Matters, 2001) and translated into Italian, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Arabic, Persian, Chinese, and Greek. He is the co-editor (with Maria Tymoczko) of ''Translation and Power'' (University of Massachusetts Press, 2002). In his work ''Contemporary Translation Theories'' (1993) Gentzler examines modern approaches to translation studies, such as the translation workshop, the science of translation, [[translation studies]], [[polysystem theory]], and [[deconstruction]], all of which began in the mid-1960s and continue to be influential today. He explores the strengths and weaknesses of each method, tracing the connections among the different schools of thought. Illustrating the importance of translation theory to the current debates in [[cultural studies]], Gentzler raises theoretical questions challenging assumptions of the leading translation theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iberlibro.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=3848283098&amp;searchurl=an%3DEdwin%2BGentzler Review of ''Contemporary Translation Theories'' at Iberlibro]&lt;/ref&gt;. In ''Translation and Identity in the Americas'', Gentzler looks at the development of translation in Brazil, Latin America, Canada, and the Caribbean, suggesting that translation is integral to cultural construction and identity formation in the Americas.  In ''Translation and Rewriting in the Age of Post-Translation Studies'', he argues that texts no longer simply move across borders, but circulate internationally and intersemiotically into multiple languages, media, and forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8570">In the [[Jewish mysticism]] set forth in the [[Book of Enoch]] and [[Book of Jubilees]] that was carried on by groups including the religious community of [[Qumran]] that produced the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the '''Elioud''' (also transliterated '''''Eljo''''')&lt;ref&gt;Multiple theories exist regarding the etymology of these terms. ''See'' Eibert J.C. Tigchelaar, "Prophets of old and the Day of the End: Zechariah, the Book of watchers, and apocalyptic" (Brill 1996) at pgs. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; are the [[antediluvian]] children of the [[Nephilim]] and are considered a part-[[angel]] hybrid race of their own.&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 7:1-15. Book of Jubilees 7:21-25&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Nephilim, the Elioud are exceptional in both ability and wickedness. 
==Canonicity==

The texts that use the term Elioud are non-canonical in modern [[Rabbinic Judaism]], Western Christianity and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, but are considered canonical by [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Christians and [[Beta Israel]] Jews (i.e. certain Ethiopian Jews).  The canonical [[Book of Genesis]] mentions [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], the putative source of this revelation about the Elioud only in passing (as a long-lived ancestor of Noah),&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 5:18-24&lt;/ref&gt; and while it notes that Nephilim had children, it does not assign a name to them.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 6:1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another canonical Bible passage concerning a [[Giant (mythology)#Abrahamic mythology|giant]] at Gath and his children is sometimes alleged to refer to the Elioud (who in that account have six fingers on each hand and each foot), although in context, these references to giants appear to refer instead to the [[Philistines]].&lt;ref&gt;1 Chronicles 20:6–8.  See, e.g., CK Quarterman, "The Elioud Race" (November 3, 2011) http://www.fallenangels-ckquarterman.com/the-elioud-race/&lt;/ref&gt;

Early fathers of the Christian church&lt;ref&gt;The Ante-Nicene Fathers (ed. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson; vol 4.16: On the Apparel of Women (De cultu foeminarum) I.3: "Concerning the Genuineness of 'The Prophecy of Enoch'")&lt;/ref&gt; and the bodies that formed the modern Rabbinical Jewish canon&lt;ref&gt;Emanuel Tov and Craig Evans, Exploring the Origins of the Bible: Canon Formation in Historical, Literary, and Theological Perspective, Acadia 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies, Scribes and Schools: The Canonization of the Hebrew Scriptures London: SPCK, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; were aware of 1 Enoch and the Book of Jubilees in which these accounts were contained, but chose to omit these texts from the canon of Western Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism respectively.

==Relevance to Christian theology==
Less literal readings of Genesis 6:4 see the reference in that passage to the intermarriage of "sons of God", meaning the godly descendants of [[Seth]] or to people faithful to God generally, with "daughters of men", meaning the godless descendants of Cain, or to people who are not faithful to God generally.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., The New Scofield Study Bible, New American Standard Edition (1988) at page 13, footnote 2 (commentary on Genesis 6:4).&lt;/ref&gt;  This less literal reading is the one adopted, in contrast to 1 Enoch and the Book of Jubilees, by the [[pseudepigraphic]] second part of the [[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan|Book of Adam and Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Second Book of Adam and Eve 11:1-4 http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/fbe/fbe095.htm translated by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., "The Forgotten Books of Eden" (1926): "1 AFTER the death of Adam and of Eve, Seth severed his children, and his children's children, from Cain's children. Cain and his seed went down and dwelt westward, below the place where he had killed his brother Abel. 2 But Seth and his children, dwelt northwards upon the mountain of the Cave of Treasures, in order to be near to their father Adam. 3 And Seth the elder, tall and good, with a fine soul, and of a strong mind, stood at the head of his people; and tended them in innocence, penitence, and meekness, and did not allow one of them to go down to Cain's children. 4 But because of their own purity, they were named "Children of God," and they were with God, instead of the hosts of angels who fell; for they continued in praises to God, and in singing psalms unto Him, in their cave--the Cave of Treasures."&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of 1 Enoch that references the race of Elioud precludes less literal readings of the term "sons of God", for example, by enumerating the names of particular angels who choose to have children with human women.&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 7:3-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrepancies in the tradition==
In some readings of the non-canonical texts, the Nephilim are children whose father is an angel and whose mother is a human and they are the "giants" (also known as [[Gibborim (biblical)|Gibborim]]) referred to in the canonical [[Book of Numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 13:32-33&lt;/ref&gt;  In others, angels and human women produce children who are Gibborim, and the Nephilim have fathers who are Gibborim and human mothers.  This ambiguity is also found in the non-canonical [[Book of Giants]], fragments of which were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Davila, "Summary of Book of Giants" (2002) at http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/rt/otp/abstracts/bgiants/&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, according to one account, there is a discrepancy between [[Aramaic]], [[Ge'ez]] (i.e. Ethiopian) and [[Koine|Greek]] translations of 1 Enoch 7:2 and 7:10-11.&lt;ref&gt;"The Reluctant Messenger" http://www.reluctant-messenger.com/1enoch01-60.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 And when the angels,* the sons of heaven, beheld them, they became enamoured of them, saying to each other, Come, let us select for ourselves wives from the progeny of men, and let us beget children.
:* An Aramaic text reads "[[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]]" here (J.T. Milik, Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4 [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976], p. 167). . . .
:10 Then they took wives, each choosing for himself; whom they began to approach, and with whom they cohabited; teaching them sorcery, incantations, and the dividing of roots and trees.
:11 And the women conceiving brought forth giants,
:* The Greek texts vary considerably from the Ethiopic text here. One Greek manuscript adds to this section, "And they [the women] bore to them [the Watchers] three races–first, the great giants. The giants brought forth [some say "slew"] the Naphelim, and the Naphelim brought forth [or "slew"] the Elioud. And they existed, increasing in power according to their greatness."

The 1913 translation of R.H. Charles of the Book of Jubilees 7:21-25&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced at http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/index.htm and currently in the public domain.&lt;/ref&gt; reads as follows (note that "Naphil" is an alternative transliteration form of "Nephilim"):

:21 For owing to these three things came the flood upon the earth, namely, owing to the fornication wherein the Watchers against the law of their ordinances went a whoring after the daughters of men, and took themselves wives of all which they chose: and they made the beginning of uncleanness.
:22 And they begat sons the Naphidim, and they were all unlike, and they devoured one another: and the Giants slew the Naphil, and the Naphil slew the Eljo, and the Eljo mankind, and one man another.
:23 And every one sold himself to work iniquity and to shed much blood, and the earth was filled with iniquity.
:24 And after this they sinned against the beasts and birds, and all that moves and walks on the earth: and much blood was shed on the earth, and every imagination and desire of men imagined vanity and evil continually.
:25 And the Lord destroyed everything from off the face of the earth; because of the wickedness of their deeds, and because of the blood which they had shed in the midst of the earth He destroyed everything.

There are possible references to the Elioud in the non-canonical [[Book of Giants]], fragments of which were found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but a definitive reading is difficult because no complete version of this sacred text is available to modern researchers and the available fragments are in six different archaic languages.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Henning, "The Book of Giants", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. XI, Part 1, 1943, pp. 52-74 at page 69, note 5 http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/giants/giants.htm#page_69_fr_5&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Enciclopedia României''''' is an encyclopedia published between 1938 and 1943. Only four of the projected six volumes were published.&lt;ref name="cp2011-12-09"&gt;[http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/opinii/enciclopedia-romaniei-ca-forma-de-recuperare-a-memoriei~ni71vf Enciclopedia Romaniei ca forma de recuperare a memoriei], 10/02/2011, Doru TOMPEA, ziaruldeiasi.ro, accesat la 9 decembrie 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dimitrie Gusti]] planned the encyclopedia in three section in its proposed six volumes.&lt;ref name="Marea Enciclopedie a României"&gt;[http://www.art-emis.ro/eveniment/188-marea-enciclopedie-a-romaniei.html Marea Enciclopedie a României]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The first two volumes covered political-administrative organization. Vol. 1 The State. Vol. 2 Counties and cities.&lt;ref name="Marea Enciclopedie a României"/&gt;
**Volume 1 is entitled ''State'' and is dedicated to the history, geography, political system, legal system, administrative, religion, diplomacy of Romania&lt;ref name="Biblioteca digitală"&gt;[http://www.cimec.ro/Biblioteca-Digitala/Biblioteca.html Biblioteca digitală]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Volume 2 is entitled ''Romanian Country '' and concerns the [[administrative divisions of Romania]].&lt;ref name="Biblioteca digitală"/&gt;
*The second two volumes covered economics. Vol. 3 National economy. Vol. 4 Business and Economic Institute.&lt;ref name="Marea Enciclopedie a României"/&gt;
** Volume 3 is entitled ''National Economy'' and follows a description of economic geography, the population, economic legislation and production.&lt;ref name="Biblioteca digitală"/&gt;
** Volume 4 is entitled ''The domestic economy. Circulation , distribution and consumption''; themes included transportation, communications, domestic and foreign trade, units and securities, credit, public finances and consumption.&lt;ref name="Biblioteca digitală"/&gt;
*The last two volumes were to cover culture. Vol. 5 National culture. Vol. 6 Cultural institutions and personalities.&lt;ref name="Marea Enciclopedie a României"/&gt;

The encyclopedia was edited by the Scientific Association under the patronage of His Majesty [[Carol II of Romania]], work was coordinated by Professor Dimitrie Gusti. Contributors included [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Virgil Madgearu]], [[Constantin C. Giurescu]], [[Mircea Vulcănescu]], [[Dan Botta]], [[Constantin Moisil]] sau [[Cezar Petrescu]].&lt;ref name="cp2011-12-09" /&gt;

The work consists of more than 5,000 pages, 800 color plates, 800 maps, 6,000 photographs and drawings.&lt;ref name="Biblioteca digitală"/&gt;

The encyclopedia was republished at the end of 2010, in the context of a project supported by [[Petre Andrei University of Iași|University Petre Andrei]].&lt;ref name="cp2011-12-09"/&gt;

'''Ethnic option''' is a term coined by sociologist [[Mary C.

'''Extension mechanisms for DNS''' ('''EDNS''') is a specification for expanding the size of several parameters of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) protocol which had size restrictions that the [[Internet]] engineering community deemed too limited for increasing functionality of the protocol. The first set of extensions was published in 1999 by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] as {{IETF RFC|2671}}, also known as '''EDNS0'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|2671}}, ''Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)'', P. Vixie, The Internet Society (August 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
The [[Domain Name System]] was first developed in the early 1980s. Since then, it has been progressively enhanced with new features, while maintaining compatibility with earlier versions of the protocol. 

The restrictions in the size of several flags fields, return codes and label types available in the basic DNS protocol prevented the support of some desirable features. Moreover, DNS messages carried by [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] were restricted to 512 bytes, not considering the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) and [[transport layer]] headers.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1035, ''Domain Names - Implementation and Specification'', P. Mockapetris (November 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Resorting to a [[virtual circuit]] transport, using the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), would greatly increase overhead. This presented a major obstacle to adding new features to DNS. In 1999, [[Paul Vixie]] proposed extending DNS to allow for new flags and response codes, and to provide support for longer responses in a framework that is backwards compatible with previous implementations.

==Mechanism==
Since no new flags could be added in the DNS header, EDNS adds information to DNS messages in the form of ''pseudo-[[Domain_Name_System#DNS_resource_records|Resource Record]]s ("pseudo-RR"s)'' included in the "additional data" section of a DNS message.  Note that this section exists in both requests and responses.

EDNS introduces a single pseudo-RR type: &lt;code&gt;OPT&lt;/code&gt;.

As pseudo-RRs, OPT type RRs never appear in any zone file; they exist only in messages, fabricated by the DNS participants.

The mechanism is [[backward compatible]], because older DNS responders ignore any RR of the unknown OPT type in a request and a newer DNS responder never includes an OPT in a response unless there was one in the request.  The presence of the OPT in the request signifies a newer requester that knows what to do with an OPT in the response.

The OPT pseudo-record provides space for up to 16 flags and it extends the space for the response code. The overall size of the [[UDP packet]] and the version number (at present 0) are contained in the OPT record. A variable length data field allows further information to be registered in future versions of the protocol. The original DNS protocol provided two label types, which are defined by the first two bits in DNS packets (RFC 1035): 00 (standard label) and 11 (compressed label). EDNS introduces the label type 01 as ''extended label''. The lower 6 bits of the first byte may be used to define up to 63 new extended labels.

==Example==
An example of an OPT pseudo-record, as displayed by the ''[[Domain Information Groper]]'' (dig) utility tool:

 ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
 ; EDNS: version: 0, flags: do; udp: 4096

The result of "EDNS: version: 0" indicates full conformance with EDNS0.&lt;ref&gt;
  Network Working Group of the IETF,
  August 1999,
  RFC 2671: Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0),
  page 3,
  Full conformance with this specification is indicated by version "0."
&lt;/ref&gt; The result "flags: do" indicates that "DNSSEC OK" is set.&lt;ref&gt;
  Network Working Group of the IETF,
  December 2001,
  RFC 3225: Indicating Resolver Support of DNSSEC,
  page 3,
  The mechanism chosen for the explicit notification of the ability of the client to accept (if not understand) DNSSEC security RRs is using the most significant bit of the Z field on the EDNS0 OPT header in the query.  This bit is referred to as the "DNSSEC OK" (DO) bit.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
EDNS is essential for the implementation of DNS Security Extensions ([[DNSSEC]]).&lt;ref&gt;RFC 4035, ''Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions'', R. Arends, Telematica Instituut, 2005. Section 4.1 EDNS Support&lt;/ref&gt; EDNS is also used for sending general information from resolvers to name servers about clients' geographic location in the form of the EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7871|title=RFC 7871: Client Subnet in DNS Queries|last=Contavalli|first=Carlo|date=|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are proposals for using EDNS to set how much padding should be around a DNS message&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7830|title=RFC 7830: The EDNS(0) Padding Option|last=Mayrhofer|first=Alexander|date=|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for indicating how long a TCP connection should be kept alive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7828|title=RFC 7828: The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option|last=Wouters|first=Paul|date=|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Issues==
In practice, difficulties can arise when using EDNS traversing firewalls, since some firewalls assume a maximum DNS message length of 512 bytes and block longer DNS packets.

The introduction of EDNS made the [[DNS amplification attack]] feasible, a type of [[reflected denial-of-service attack]], since EDNS facilitates very large response packets compared to relatively small request packets.

The IETF DNS Extensions working group (dnsext) has finished work on a refinement of EDNS0, which has been published as RFC 6891.

== Company history ==

=== Pre-FORREC ===

==== 1961-1965: Sasaki, Strong &amp; Associates ====
Japanese-American landscape architect, [[Hideo Sasaki]] partnered with Richard Strong to form the Toronto-based firm Sasaki, Stong and Associates in 1961. Working mainly in Canada, they master planned Toronto’s Queen’s Park Complex&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://robertmoffatt115.wordpress.com/tag/sasaki-strong-associates/|title=Sasaki Strong Associates {{!}} Toronto Modern|website=robertmoffatt115.wordpress.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/a-magnet-for-architects/article20386759/|title=A magnet for architects|last=Leblanc|first=Dave|date=August 22, 2008|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed [[Nathan Phillips Square|Nathan Philips Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tclf.org/pioneer/richard-strong|title=Richard Strong {{!}} The Cultural Landscape Foundation|website=tclf.org|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1965-1970: Richard Strong Associates Ltd. ====
Richard Strong founded Richard Strong Associates in 1965 but continued to partner with Hideo Sasaki on numerous projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1980|title=Richard Strong - University of Calgary|url=https://searcharchives.ucalgary.ca/richard-strong-fonds;ead?sf_format=xml|journal=Canadian Architectural Archives|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they designed [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]], the amusement park for [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valois|first=Nicole|date=2013|title=Expo 67: A Watershed for Canadian Landscape Architecture|url=http://lacf.ca/sites/default/files/86-88_CSLQ0413_Expo%2067_Nicole%20Valois%20_%20ENlong.pdf|journal=Landscapes|volume=|issue=Fall 2013|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1970-1973: Merged to form Strong Moorhead Sigsby, Ltd. ====
Merging with Australian landscape architecture professor, Donald Guy Sigsby,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architecture: 1985 Faculty Handbook|last=|first=|publisher=The University of New South Wales|year=1985|issn=0811-7594|location=Kensington, New South Wales, Australia|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Toronto-based landscape architect Steven Moorhead, Richard Strong became president of Strong Moorhead Sigsby, Ltd. The firm was expanded, with offices in Toronto and [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. As Strong Moorhead Sigsby Limited the group published numerous academic articles and studies, as well as the following books:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/identities/nc-strong%20moorhead%20sigsby%20ltd/|title=Most Widely Held Works by Strong Moorhead Sigsby|last=|first=|date=|website=OCLC WorldCat Identities|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gros Morne National Park]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Atlantic Region (1971)
* Fathom Five Provincial Park (1973)

==== 1973-1977: Name Change to Richard Strong - Steven Moorhead ====
Upon Sigsby's departure to start his own firm in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/search~S2?/aDonald+Sigsby+Associates./adonald+sigsby+associates/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/exact&amp;FF=adonald+sigsby+associates&amp;1%2C2%2C|title=State Library New South Wales|last=|first=|date=1973|website=Donald Sigsby Associates|publisher=Research and Collections|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a partnership formed between Strong and Moorhead. Most of the work from these 5 years was based in [[Ontario]]. During this time the company focused on urban renewal, recreational land planning, and landscape design for urban parks, like [[Ryerson University#Ryerson Square|Devonian Square]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tclf.org/landscapes/devonian-square|title=Devonian Square {{!}} The Cultural Landscape Foundation|website=tclf.org|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Toronto. One of their largest projects was The [[Thunder Bay]] Waterfront Park Study plan. This 28-page report was well received and was used as the basis of development for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thunderbay.ca/City_Government/City_Records_and_Archives/Web_Exhibits/Waterfront_History/Reports/Thunder_Bay_Waterfront_Park_Study_1975.htm|title=Thunder Bay Waterfront Park Study 1975|website=www.thunderbay.ca|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair continued to produce industry related books and articles, including:

==== 1977-1984: Moorhead Fleming Corban Inc. then Moorhead, Fleming, Corban, and McCarthy ====
Strong moved to [[Calgary]], Alberta in 1977 and established his practice there as Richard Strong Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asc.ucalgary.ca/collections/architectural/biographies|title=Biographies {{!}} Basic page|website=asc.ucalgary.ca|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of employee promotions and company mergers adjusted the name and management make-up of the company for almost a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://locongress.com/conference-speaker-bios-2014#ronmccarthy|title=Conference Speaker Bios 2014: Landscape Ontario Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=locongress.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the firm designed [[Canada's Wonderland|Canada’s Wonderland]], the country’s first major theme park and later, in 1981, the [[World Waterpark|World Water Park]] at [[West Edmonton Mall]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinfocusmagazine.com/2012/12/building-dreams/|title=Building Dreams {{!}} Business In Focus|website=www.businessinfocusmagazine.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluetoad.com/article/Design+Interview+With+Ron+Holbrook/688754/0/article.html|title=Design Interview With Ron Holbrook|language=en|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As FORREC ===
The increase of theme park and water park focused work led to the company's final name change in 1985 to FORREC, a shortened version of "For recreation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2007-05-25/news/28471042_1_forrec-irppl-shopping-mall|title=It’s Realty: Forrec entertaining all|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's business model also became a [[Privately held company|private]] limited with share capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.duedil.com/company/02422344/moorhead-fleming-corban-and-partners-limited|title=Moorhead Fleming Corban &amp; Partners Limited {{!}} DueDil|website=www.duedil.com|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice to incorporate FORREC was unusual for a [[Design|design firm]], where [[partnership]]s are more the norm. To keep ownership fluid, a policy was created that required [[shareholder]]s to begin selling their shares at age 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/talent/i-engineered-my-own-ousting-heres-why/article31128447/|title=I engineered my own ousting. Here's why|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1985-1992: A North-American focus ====
During this time, FORREC’s projects were mostly in Canada but they attracted a lot of international attention. They were hired by [[USAA]] Real Estate Company, a subsidiary of the USAA insurance company, and [[Ryman Hospitality Properties|Gaylord Entertainment Company]], a company which owned [[Opryland USA]], to assist in the design of a theme park in [[San Antonio]], at the time known as [[Six Flags Fiesta Texas#History|Fiesta Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/Trends/ERA/ERAStudyFiesta.html|title=Theme Park Development Case Study - Fiesta Texas / Economics Research Associates / 1999|website=www.hotel-online.com|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] hired FORREC to design their theme park in [[Florida]], which opened in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/the-services-industry-canadas-secret-economic-playground/|title=The services industry: Canada's secret economic playground? - Macleans.ca|date=2015-04-01|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garratt v Ikeda''' [2002] 1 NZLR 577 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding where a contract is cancelled under the Contractual Remedies Act 1979, if the deposit has not been paid, it is still payable, despite section 8(3)(a).

==Background==
Garratt agreed to purchase Ikeda's property for $1.83 million, with a 10% deposit, payable in 3 instalments.

After paying the first two instalments totaling $50,000, Garratt defaulted on the final $130,000 payment due on the deposit. As a result, Ikeda cancelled the sale, and resold the property to another party for $400,000 more than Garratt had agreed to purchase the property.

With the sale now cancelled, Garratt requested Ikeda to refund the $50,000 he had paid on the deposit. Ikeda refused, despite the fact that he had resold the property for a $400,000 profit.

Garratt eventually sued for his deposit back.

==Held==
The court ruled that section 8(3)(a) did not apply here, as the deposit was a performed obligation at the date of the cancellation. Relief under section 9 for the $400,0000 resale profit, was also refused.

[[File:Versailles - plan of premier étage of Enveloppe - Berger 1985 Fig12 (King's apartment in yellow).jpg|thumb|Plan of Versailles before the third building campaign, with the King's grand apartment in yellow]]

The '''''grand appartement du roi''''' is the King's grand apartment of the [[Palace of Versailles]].

As a result of [[Louis LeVau]]’s envelope of [[Louis XIII’s château]], the king and queen had new apartments in the new addition, known at the time as the ''château neuf'' (new palace).  The State Apartments, which are known respectively as the ''grand appartement du roi'' and the ''[[grand appartement de la reine]]'', occupied the main or principal floor of the château neuf.  LeVau’s design for the state apartments closely followed Italian models of the day, as evidenced by the placement of the apartments on the next floor up from the ground level — the [[piano nobile]] — a convention the architect borrowed from 16th- and 17th-century Italian palace design.

Le Vau’s plan called for an [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of seven rooms, each dedicated to one of the then-known planets and their associated titular Roman deity.  LeVau’s plan was bold as he designed a heliocentric system that centered on the salon d’Apollon.  The salon d’Apollon originally was designed as the king’s bedchamber, but served as a [[throne room]].&lt;ref&gt;During the reign of Louis XIV (until 1689), a solid silver throne stood on a [[Persian rug|Persian carpet]] covered dais on the south wall of this room.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original arrangement of the enfilade of rooms was thus:

# Salon de Diane ([[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], Roman goddess of the hunt; associated with the Moon)&lt;ref&gt;This room originally served as the west landing of the Ambassadors’ Staircase and formed the main entrance to the grand appartement du roi.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Salon de Mars (Mars, Roman god of war; associated with the [[Mars|planet Mars]])
# Salon de Mercure (Mercury, Roman god of trade, commerce, and the Liberal Arts; associated with the [[Mercury (planet)|planet Mercury]])
# Salon d’Apollon (Apollo, Roman god of the Fine Arts; associated with the Sun)
# Salon de Jupiter (Jupiter, Roman god of law and order; associated with the [[Jupiter|planet Jupiter]])
# Salon de Saturne (Saturn, Roman god of agriculture and harvest)
# Salon de Vénus (Venus, [[Venus (mythology)|Roman goddess of love]]; associated with the [[Venus|planet Venus]])

The configuration of the grand appartement du roi conformed to contemporary conventions in palace design.&lt;ref&gt;Baillie, Hugh Murray.  "Etiquette and the Planning of State Apartments in Baroque Palaces," Archaeologia CI (1967): 169-199.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, owing to Louis XIV’s personal tastes&lt;ref&gt;and with the apartment’s northern exposure, Louis XIV found the rooms too cold and opted to live in the rooms previously occupied by his father.&lt;/ref&gt; the grand appartement du roi was reserved for court functions — such as the thrice-weekly appartement evenings given by Louis XIV.

The rooms were decorated by [[Charles LeBrun]] and demonstrated Italian influences (LeBrun met and studied with the famed Tuscan artist [[Pietro da Cortona]], whose decorative style of the [[Palazzo Pitti|Pitti Palace]] in Florence LeBrun adapted for use at Versailles&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Malcolm.  ''Pietro da Cortona at the Pitti Palace''.  (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1977.)
&lt;/ref&gt;).  The quadratura style of the ceilings evoke Cortona’s sale dei planeti at the Pitti, but LeBrun’s decorative schema is more complex.  In his 1674 publication about the grand appartement du roi, André Félibien described the scenes depicted in the coves of the ceilings of the rooms as allegories depicting the “heroic actions of the king.”&lt;ref&gt;André Félibien, ''Description sommaire du chasteau de Versailles'', (Paris, 1674).&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, one finds scenes of the exploits of [[Augustus]], [[Alexander the Great]], and [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] alluding to the deeds of Louis XIV.  For example, in the salon d’Apollon, the cove painting “Augustus building the port of Misenum”&lt;ref&gt;Located in the western cove of the salon d’Apollon and painted by [[Charles de La Fosse|Charles de LaFosse]] ca. 1674.&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to the construction of the port at [[La Rochelle]]; or, depicted in the south cove of the salon de Mercure is “Ptolemy II Philadelphus in his Library”, which alludes to Ptolemy’s construction of the [[Library of Alexandria|Great Library of Alexandria]] and which accordingly serves as an allegory to Louis XIV’s expansion of the Bibliothèque du roi.&lt;ref&gt;Located in the southern cove of the ceiling of the salon de Mercure and painted by Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne ca. 1674.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a more detailed discussion regarding the ceiling decor of the grand appartement du roi, see Gérard Sabatier, “Versailles, ou la figure du roi,” (Paris: Albin Michel, 1999).  For an analysis of the symbolism in the decor of the grand appartement du roi, see Edward Lighthart, “Archétype et symbole dans le style Louis XIV versaillais: réflexions sur l’imago rex et l’imago patriae au début de l’époque moderne,” (Doctoral thesis, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Complementing the rooms’ decors were pieces of massive silver furniture.  Regrettably, owing to the War of the League of Augsburg, in 1689 Louis XIV ordered all of this silver furniture to be sent to the mint, to be melted down to help defray the cost of the war.

LeVau’s original plan for the grand appartement du roi was short-lived.  With the inauguration of the [[History of the Palace of Versailles#Third building campaign|third building campaign]], which suppressed the terrace linking the king and queen’s apartments and the salons of Jupiter, Saturn and Venus for the construction of the Hall of Mirrors, the configuration of the grand appartement du roi was altered.  The decor of the salon de Jupiter was removed and reused in the decoration of the salle des gardes de la reine; and elements of the decoration of the first salon de Vénus, which opened onto the terrace, were reused in the salon de Vénus that we see today.&lt;ref&gt;Originally, the room that is known today as the salon de Vénus formed part of the apartment of the king’s mistress, [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]].  Owing to her involvement with [[Poison affair|Affair of the Poisons]], during which time it was alleged she had been giving the king love potions, she fell from grace in 1678 and her apartments were taken over by Louis XIV at which time the new salon de Vénus was installed.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1678 to the end of Louis XIV’s reign, the grand appartement du roi served as the venue for the king’s thrice-weekly evening receptions, known as les soirées de l’appartement.  For these parties, the rooms assumed specific functions:

* Salon de Vénus: buffet tables were arranged to display food and drink for the king’s guests.
* Salon de Diane: served as a [[billiard room]].
* Salon de Mars: served as a ballroom.
* Salon de Mercure: served as a gaming (cards) room.
* Salon d’Apollon: served as a concert or music room.

In the 18th century during the reign of Louis XV, the grand appartement du roi was expanded to include the salon de l’Abondance — formerly the entry vestibule of the [[petit appartement du roi]] — and the [[salon d’Hercule]] — occupying the tribune level of the former chapel of the château.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2003">In '''''Joel Melamed and Hurwitz v Cleveland Estates (Pty) Ltd; Joel Melamed and Hurwitz v Vorner Investments (Pty) Ltd''''', Joel Melamed and Hurwitz was a firm of attorneys. The senior partner, Joel Melamed, and his partner, Hurwitz, held financial interests in certain townships which were in the process of being established and exploited. In 1961, Melamed met Harry Galaun who, through the defendant companies, was interested in certain land and sought the firm’s advice. The firm, through a separate company, TMC, was appointed as the management company of the township development of Galaun. This appointment was terminated in 1979. Joel Melamed and Hurwitz claimed damages based on the fees they would have earned from the conveyancing work had the appointment not been allegedly unlawfully terminated.

The crux of the main cause of action was that Melamed alleged to have contracted with himself in two different capacities: i.e. as a partner in the firm of attorneys and as managing director of TMC.

On the question of whether a person may, as representative of another, contract with himself, either in his personal capacity or as representative of a third person, the court held that it was legally competent for Melamed, in his capacity as managing director of TMC, to make a contract with himself, in his other capacity as partner in the firm of attorneys, in terms whereof the latter was appointed as conveyancer for all the erven in the townships.

The court held that the mere description of a relationship as one of agency is not sufficient; one must look to the substance of the relationship.

==Biography==
Kobal was born in [[Linz]], Austria, but the family emigrated to Canada when Kobal was ten&lt;ref name="JKF"/&gt; and settled in Ottawa.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Charles Hagen [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/30/arts/john-kobal-51-compiled-collection-of-hollywood-lore.html?pagewanted=1 "John Kobal, 51; Compiled Collection Of Hollywood Lore",] ''New York Times'', 30 October 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Kobal had a short-lived career as an actor in early 1960s London. He was an inveterate collector: magazines, postcards, pictures, any movie memorabilia. It was a chance encounter with [[Marlene Dietrich]] in Montreal, Canada in the late 1950s that led Kobal to develop his affection for the Golden Age of Hollywood. He used his contacts from a BBC appointment in New York from 1964 to acquire Hollywood related photographs,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; eventually numbering about 4,500 images dating from the end of the silent era to about 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Brett Johnson [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2008/Aug/7/glitz-glamour-and-glossies/ "Here's how a star-struck fan saved Hollywood history from the trash heap",] ''Ventura County Star'', 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The material was then considered of little value and regularly dumped. 

The author of 30 books, Kobal was responsible for organizing the first exhibition of Hollywood related photographs at London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Scarlet Cheng [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/25/entertainment/et-kobal25?pg=2 "The lost art of glamour",] ''Los Angeles Times'', 25 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[John Russell Taylor]] has described Kobal's contribution to film studies as "unique".&lt;ref name="JKF"/&gt; A gay man, Kobal died aged 51 of [[HIV]]-related pneumonia in London. Three months before his death he completed his final opus "The Lost World of DeMille" a story of Cecile B. DeMille, one of the greatest directors.  It tells the story of the providential meeting with Samuel Goldwyn, a glove salesman, Jesse Lasky, a disillusioned gold seeker, DeMille, a stage actor, how they forged a partnership to form Paramount. The book is expected to be published in 2019.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316331,00.html "AIDS 1991",] ''Entertainment Weekly'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

==The John Kobal Foundation==
The John Kobal Foundation, to which he donated his collection, was established as a registered charity at the end of 1992&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-john-kobal-foundation--independent-on-sunday-photographic-portrait-award-a-photographic-portrait-prize-in-memory-of-john-kobal-1471455.html "The John Kobal Foundation photographic portrait award: A photographic portrait prize in memory of John Kobal",] ''The Independent on Sunday'', 7 February 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and presented an annual award in Portrait Photography between 1993 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnkobal.org/the_john_kobal_portrait_award.php John Kobal Photographic Portrait Award 1993-2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616103255/http://www.johnkobal.org/the_john_kobal_portrait_award.php |date=2009-06-16 }}, John Kobal Foundation page&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection is split between the London and New York offices of The Picture Desk and now consists of more than 200,000 images. The Collection also continues the exhibition work begun by John Kobal, mounting several exhibitions commissioned by the International Festival du Film, Cannes, and prestigious department stores in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picture-desk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Walter Scott''' (November 2, 1845 &amp;ndash; January 4, 1919) of [[New York City]], was originally from [[England]], but he emigrated to the [[United States]] to take part in the [[California Gold Rush]]. Unsuccessful at the prospecting trade, Scott began to sell [[postage stamp]]s for collectors and in a short period of time became the nation's leading [[stamp dealer]]. During his lifetime, he was known as "The Father of American Philately" by his fellow stamp collectors.

==Philatelic literature==
Scott published the first significant stamp journal in America in 1868, entitled ''American Journal of Philately''. Also, in 1868, he issued his first multi-paged postage stamp catalog, ''A Descriptive Catalogue of America and Foreign Postage Stamps, Issued from 1840 to Date''. In a short period of time, his ''[[Scott catalog]]'' became the leading stamp catalog in the United States. In 1885, he sold the rights to his business to the Calman brothers who renamed it the Scott Stamp and Coin Company.

Scott continued his stamp business after a legal battle over the use of his name (which he won) and continued publishing [[philatelic literature]], such as ''The Metropolitan Philatelist'', the ''J. W. Scott &amp; Co., Ltd. Weekly News Letter'', and the ''John W. Scott's Junior Weekly Letter'', later renamed the ''John W. Scott's Weekly Bulletin''.

[[File:J. W. Scott 1869.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait label of Scott|70px|Portrait of Scott used on a label produced for his stamp album of 1869]]

In 1869 he issued his first [[stamp album]]  with spaces for specially printed labels showing world leaders and himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Postage Stamp Album'' Second edition 1870, produced by J. W. Scott &amp; Co. , 34 Liberty Street, New York, "Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1869, by J. W. Scott &amp; Co., in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United State for the Southern District of New York"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philatelic auctions==
Scott was innovative in business methods, and conducted the first postage stamp auction ever held (May 28, 1870, in New York City). This was a success and he continued to organize and conduct auctions in the United States and in [[Europe]]. He also was the first, in 1882, to issue an auction catalog with full color plates of the stamps on sale. He was also the first to sell a postage stamp to collectors for over one thousand dollars.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Philatelic activity==
Scott was active in organizing philatelic exhibitions and, in general, "selling" the stamp collecting hobby. He was one of the founding members of the [[Collectors Club of New York]] (1896) and active in the [[American Philatelic Society]] where he was president from 1917 to 1919.

==Honors and awards==
Scott was named to the [[American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame]] in 1941.

==Legacy==
The continued existence and growth of the ''[[Scott catalog]]'' used by American stamp collectors assures Scott's legacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3179">The Right Reverend [[Archimandrite]] Dr. '''Jules C. E. Riotte''' (1901 – May 6, 2000), was a priest of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] [[Eparchy]] of Saint Nicholas in [[Chicago]], and a researcher at the [[Bishop Museum|Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum]] in [[Honolulu]].  He was born in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] of mixed French and [[Lusatia]]n [[Sorbs|Sorb]] heritage. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he was active in the resistance movement against the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and he was briefly interned in a concentration camp. He escaped to [[England|Great Britain]] and worked for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] as a translator of [[German language|German]] and [[Slavic languages]]. 

He became a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] priest and moved to [[Canada]], where he served in many different parishes and missions, including St Michael's Ukrainian Catholic Parish in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. He was an advocate for Ukraine's independence from Soviet tyranny. A research associate at the Department of Entomology at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] Riotte eventually published over 100 papers in the field. 

In 1975, Riotte moved to Hawai‘i, where he worked as a researcher in entomology at the Bishop Museum.  He resided at [[Saint Anthony Catholic Church in Honolulu|St. Anthony Roman Catholic Church in Kalihi]] and also served as pastor and [[episcopal vicar]] to [[Eastern Rite Catholic]]s in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu]], Hawai‘i, conducting daily [[Divine Liturgy]] in the Kalihi church.  Later, a permanent [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] church was built in [[Waianae|Wai‘anae]] and dedicated under the title of [[Sophia the Martyr|Saint Sophia]]. 

He was a prolific author of papers in Hawaiian [[entomology]]. After his death his remains were returned to Kingston, Ontario, where he was buried in St Mary's Roman Catholic cemetery thanks to the support of the Ukrainian Canadian Club of Kingston and the Kingston Branch of the League of Ukrainian Canadians; a marker recalling his contributions as a man of faith and of science is maintained in that cemetery by the Ukrainian Canadian community there.

{{Falangism sidebar}}
'''La Falange''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "The Phalanx", also known as '''FE/La Falange''') is a Spanish political party registered in 1999. The party originated as a split of the [[Falange Española de las JONS (1976)|Falange Española de las JONS]], led by Gustavo Morales and Jesús López. Ideologically the party claims to be a successor of the original [[Falange Española]] of the 1930s, and follower of the ideas of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], [[Ramiro Ledesma Ramos]], [[Onésimo Redondo]] and [[Julio Ruiz de Alda]].

==History==
FE/La Falange was founded in 1999 after a split in [[Falange Española de las JONS (1976)|FE-JONS]], that was the result of an internal conflict between the faction of Diego Márquez Horrillo and the faction of Gustavo Morales. Finally, the first one won and the sector that supported Morales left [[Falange Española de las JONS (1976)|FE-JONS]]. In the local elections of 1999 the party gained three town councillors. Since 2000-2001 the party adopted more [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] positions, in contrast to traditional falangism, which did not hold [[Racism|racist]] or white supremacist ideas. Due to this ideological changes, a sector known as [[Falange Auténtica]] split in 2002.

In 2005 the party split into two factions: one led by José Fernando Cantalapiedra, known as the [[National Front (Spain, 2006)|National Front]], and other led by Manuel Andrino, that was called Frente Español. From 2005 to 2009, both factions will be participate in the elections with those brands, leaving the brand La Falange virtually dead. Finally, in 2009, the court ruled in favor of the Andrino faction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispaniainfo.es/web/2009/04/02/el-ultimo-que-cierre-la-falange-de-cantalapiedra-se-despide/ El último que cierre… La Falange de Cantalapiedra se despide.]&lt;/ref&gt; which started using again the original name.

Since 2013 the organization is part of the political movement and election coalition La España en Marcha (LEM), inspired by the success of [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] in [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2013-09-14/los-ultras-de-blanquerna-al-habla-con-amanecer-dorado-para-copiar-su-exito_28414/ Los ultras de Blanquerna, al habla con Amanecer Dorado para copiar su éxito.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is extremely hostile to [[Basque independence|Basque]] and [[Catalan independentism]]. In 2013 members of the organization participated in an assault against a Catalan cultural centre during the celebrations of the [[National Day of Catalonia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publico.es/politica/primer-acusado-declarar-caso-blanquerna.html Caso Blanquerna.]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has also participated in [[Spanish unionism|unionist]] demonstrations and burned [[Estelada|estelades]] (Catlan independentist flags).

Electorally the party only has (and has had) elected representatives at the local level. Currently the party has 2 town councillors elected in the lists of the Independent Party of Becerril de la Sierra. This party is actually a coalition between FE/La Falange, [[National Democracy (Spain)|National Democracy]] and local independents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falange-espanola.com/comunicado_elecciones.htm ELECCIONES MUNICIPALES: CANDIDATURAS EN LA SIERRA DE MADRID.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasexta.com/programas/mas-vale-tarde/noticias/quienes-estuvieron-detras-ataque-dia-diada_2013091357273a194beb28d44602c6c0.html ¿Quiénes están detrás del ataque contra la Diada en Madrid?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lazzat Un Nisa''''' (from {{lang-ar|'''لذّتُ النّسا'''}} '''''The Pleasure of Woman''''') is an erotic Indian anecdote&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/07/10/stories/2003071000390100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jfine"&gt;''Lazzat Un Nisa'',translated by Jane Fine, 2002, Classex Books Private Limited, {{ISBN|81-7858-003-9}}, 121 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/07/10/stories/2003071000390100.htm The Hindu's article about Lazzat Un Nisa] retrieved Dec 06, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lazzat un-niso'' Nur publisher, 1991 {{ISBN|5-640-01094-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Persian language]]. It depicts the art of sex through the role of jewellery and perfume in [[lovemaking]], erotic writing as literature, and [[pornography]] as [[aphrodisiac]]. The Book was hand-illustrated and hand-copied in Urdu and Persian in 1850 by writer Mohammed Abdul Latif Muzdar Mehdune.

==History==
The original manuscript dates back to the [[Qutb Shahi]] period. In the fifteenth century, the court of [[Bidar]] patronized such erotic works as the [[Bhog bal]], [[Thadkirat al-Shahawat]] (List of aphrodisiacs) and [[Srngaramanjari]] (erotic Bouquets). Lizzat Un Nisa is one of the few surviving erotics works from the period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/019579334X/ Scent in the Islamic Garden: A Study of Deccani Urdu Literary Sources] {{ISBN|0-19-579334-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another Kitab ul-Laddhat un-nisa which was written for a certain vizir Kukapondat by the same content and translated from Parsi into Russian. Actually the book itself has no pornographic or explicit sexual bias. It gives instructions how to classify women from their outer aspect starting from their apparel and ending with some parts of their body. In the Middle Ages Central Asia was the most important urbanized complex of cities and the area thrived of scientific research especially in the medical and terapeutic sciences (Avicenna and Rhazes were born there) and therefore it is very interesting to read which, maybe for a man living in these frantic cities, unexpected defaults could show up in the sexual life when making acquaintance with ladies and how he/she could recur to be treated by a doctor and by which special medical recipes. Lately this book became available in Italian with historical comments as per attached bibliography.

==Story==
The main subject of the story is a man named Harichand, who under orders of a king, embarks on a journey to collect exotic gifts and beautiful women for the pleasures of the king. The manuscript provides advice on various [[sexual techniques]].  It has a section on how to arouse a woman and observations based on sizes of a woman's vagina &lt;ref name="jfine"/&gt; and also a brief list of lengths of the phallus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1407">A '''liability waiver''' is a [[Legal instrument|legal document]] that a person who participates in an activity may sign to acknowledge the [[risk]]s involved in his or her participation. By doing so, the company attempts to remove [[legal liability]] from the [[business]] or [[person]] responsible for the activity. The [[Unenforceable|enforceability]] of such a [[waiver]] depends on [[state law]], a [[jury]], and the language of the waiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.forc.org/Public/Journals/2005/VOL_16_Fall_2005_Edition.aspx |last=Low |first=Michael J. |year=2005|volume=16|number=3 |title=It's the end of the world as we know it ... and I feel fine: The new rules for drafting liability waivers in Arizona |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=''forc.org'' |publisher=Federation of Regulatory Counsel, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liability waivers include pre-accident [[Legal release|releases]] and [[model release]]s (for pictures).

'''nsupdate''' is a computer network maintenance utility used by network administrators to instruct the [[name server]] of a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] zone to update its database.  The name server might be local to a domain or, with appropriate authentication and permission provided by [[DNSSEC]], an internet name server.

[[BIND]] 8 and later supports this feature.

'''OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Incorporated''' [[d/b/a]] '''OCLC'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/reports/rwservlet?imgc12g&amp;Din=E862_1177|title=Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation of OCLC, Inc. and Amended Articles of Incorporation of OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Incorporated|date=February 6, 1981|publisher=[[Ohio Secretary of State]]|access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American nonprofit [[cooperative]] organization "dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world's information and reducing information costs".&lt;ref name="oclc_about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oclc.org/en/about.html|title=About OCLC|publisher=OCLC|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1967 as the '''Ohio College Library Center'''. OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain [[WorldCat]], the largest [[online public access catalog]] (OPAC) in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries have to pay for its services (around $200&amp;nbsp;million annually {{as of|2016|lc=yes}}).&lt;ref name="2015-16annualreport" /&gt; OCLC also maintains the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] system.

== History ==
OCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for libraries in the state of [[Ohio]]. The group first met on July 5, 1967 on the campus of [[the Ohio State University]] to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization,&lt;ref name="In the beginning"&gt;{{cite web |title=In the beginning |url=http://www.oclc.org/us/en/about/history/beginning.htm |website= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hired [[Frederick G. Kilgour]], a former [[Yale University]] medical school librarian, to design the shared cataloging system.&lt;ref name="tech"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Intner|first=Sheila|date=March–April 2007|title=The Passing of an Era|journal=Technicalities|issn=0272-0884|volume=27|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management, bringing libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world's information in order to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the [[Alden Library]] at [[Ohio University]] on August 26, 1971. This was the first online cataloging by any library worldwide.&lt;ref name="In the beginning" /&gt;

Membership in OCLC is based on use of services and contribution of data. Between 1967 and 1977, OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio, but in 1978, a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join. In 2002, the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of library and information sciences|editor-last=Bates|editor-first=Marcia J|editor-last2=Maack|editor-first2=Mary Niles|date=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849397127|oclc=769480033|location=Boca Raton, Florida|page=3924|volume=V|edition=3rd|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio, it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with "networks", organizations that provided training, support and marketing services. By 2008, there were 15 independent United States regional service providers. OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance, with networks electing delegates to serve on the OCLC Members Council. During 2008, OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels; at the same time, the council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees severing the tie between the networks and governance. In early 2009, OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailey-Hainer|first=Brenda|date=October 19, 2009|title=The OCLC Network of Regional Service Providers: The Last 10 Years|journal=Journal of Library Administration|volume=49|issue=6|pages=621–629|doi=10.1080/01930820903238792|issn=0193-0826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
OCLC provides [[bibliographic]], [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] and full-text information to anyone.

OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain [[WorldCat]]—the OCLC Online Union Catalog, the largest [[online public access catalog]] (OPAC) in the world. WorldCat has holding records from public and private libraries worldwide. The Open WorldCat program, launched in late 2003, exposed a subset of WorldCat records to Web users via popular Internet search, bibliographic, and bookselling sites;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Neill|first=Nancy|date=Nov–Dec 2004|title=Open WorldCat Pilot: A User's Perspective|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/201889986|journal=Searcher|language=English|volume=12|issue=10|pages=54–60|oclc=201889986|issn=1070-4795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open WorldCat later morphed into WorldCat.org. In October 2005, the OCLC technical staff began a [[wiki]] project, WikiD, allowing readers to add commentary and structured-field information associated with any WorldCat record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/wikid.html|title=WikiD|publisher=OCLC|language=en-US|access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiD was later phased out.

The Online Computer Library Center acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] System when it bought Forest Press in 1988. A browser&lt;ref name="oclc.dewey"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deweybrowser.oclc.org/ddcbrowser2/|title=OCLC DeweyBrowser|website=deweybrowser.oclc.org|access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for books with their Dewey Decimal Classifications was available until July 2013; it was replaced by the Classify Service.

Until August 2009, when it was sold to Backstage Library Works, OCLC owned a preservation microfilm and digitization operation called the OCLC Preservation Service Center,&lt;ref name="oclc-p"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oclc.org/preservation/default.htm|title=Preservation Service Center|publisher=OCLC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031229033224/http://www.oclc.org/preservation/default.htm|archivedate=December 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its principal office in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].

The reference management service QuestionPoint&lt;ref name="oclc.questionpoint"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oclc.org/en/questionpoint.html|title=QuestionPoint|publisher=OCLC|language=en-US|access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides libraries with tools to communicate with users. This around-the-clock reference service is provided by a cooperative of participating global libraries.

Starting in 1971 OCLC produced [[catalog card]]s for members alongside its shared online catalog; the company printed its last catalog cards on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oclc.org/en/news/releases/2015/201529dublin.html|title=OCLC prints last library catalog cards|date=October 1, 2015|website=www.oclc.org|language=en|access-date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
OCLC commercially sells software, such as CONTENTdm for managing [[digital collection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oclc.org/en/contentdm.html|title=CONTENTdm|publisher=OCLC|language=en-US|access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
OCLC has been conducting research for the library community for more than 30 years. In accordance with its mission, OCLC makes its research outcomes known through various publications.&lt;ref name="oclc.res"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyatt|first=Shirley|last2=Young|first2=Jeffrey A.|title=OCLC Research Publications Repository|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march05/hyatt/03hyatt.html|journal=D-Lib Magazine|volume=11|issue=3|doi=10.1045/march2005-hyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; These publications, including journal articles, reports, newsletters, and presentations, are available through the organization's website.
* OCLC Publications – Research articles from various journals including Code4Lib Journal, OCLC Research, [[Reference and User Services Quarterly|Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly]], [[College &amp; Research Libraries News]], Art Libraries Journal, and [[National Education Association]] Newsletter. The most recent publications are displayed first, and all archived resources, starting in 1970, are also available.&lt;ref name="oclc.pubs"&gt;{{cite web |title=OCLC Publications |url=http://www.oclc.org/research/publications/default.htm |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Membership Reports – A number of significant reports on topics ranging from virtual reference in libraries to perceptions about library funding.&lt;ref name="oclc.reports"&gt;{{cite web |title=OCLC Membership Reports |url=http://www.oclc.org/us/en/reports/default.htm |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Presentations – Presentations from both guest speakers and OCLC research from conferences, webcasts, and other events. The presentations are organized into five categories: Conference presentations, Dewey presentations, Distinguished Seminar Series, Guest presentations, and Research staff presentations.&lt;ref name="oclc.pres"&gt;{{cite web |title=OCLC Presentations |url=http://www.oclc.org/community/presentations/default.htm |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==

Advocacy has been a part of OCLC's mission since its founding in 1967. OCLC staff members meet and work regularly with library leaders, information professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, political leaders, trustees, students and patrons to advocate "advancing research, scholarship, education, community development, information access, and global cooperation."&lt;ref name="De Rosa 2009 719–726"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosa|first=Cathy De|date=October 22, 2009|title=Advocacy and OCLC|journal=Journal of Library Administration|volume=49|issue=7|pages=719–726|doi=10.1080/01930820903260572|issn=0193-0826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheG2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jan/22/library-search-engines-books|title=Why you can't find a library book in your search engine|last=Grossman|first=Wendy M.|date=January 21, 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WebJunction&lt;ref name="oclc.webjunction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oclc.org/webjunction.en.html |title=WebJunction |publisher=Oclc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a division of OCLC funded by a grant from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], which provides training services to librarians.

OCLC's advocacy campaign "Geek the Library", started in 2009, highlights the role of public libraries. The campaign, funded by a grant from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], uses a strategy based on the findings of the 2008 OCLC report, "From Awareness to Funding: A study of library support in America".&lt;ref name="advocacy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Advocacy: From Awareness to Funding, the next chapter |url=https://www.oclc.org/en/reports/funding.html |website= |publisher= |date= 2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other past advocacy campaigns have focused on sharing the knowledge gained from library and information research. Such projects have included communities such as the [[Society of American Archivists]], the [[Open Archives Initiative]], the [[Institute for Museum and Library Services]], the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[National Information Standards Organization]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]], and [[Internet2]]. One of the most successful contributions to this effort was the [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Initiative, "an open forum of libraries, archives, museums, technology organizations, and software companies who work together to develop interoperable online [[metadata standards]] that support a broad range of purposes and business models."&lt;ref name="De Rosa 2009 719–726" /&gt;

OCLC partnered with search engine providers in 2003 to advocate for libraries and share information across the broadest possible Internet landscape. Google, [[Yahoo!]], and [[Ask.com]] have all collaborated with OCLC to make the WorldCat records searchable through those search engines.&lt;ref name="De Rosa 2009 719–726" /&gt;

==Online database: WorldCat==
{{Main article|WorldCat}}
OCLC's WorldCat database is used by librarians for cataloging and research. Contributions to WorldCat are made via the Connexion computer program, which was introduced in 2001; its predecessor, OCLC Passport, was phased out in May 2005.

WorldCat contains records in MAchine Readable Cataloging ([[MARC standards|MARC]]) format contributed by library catalogers worldwide who use OCLC as a cataloging tool, and these MARC format records can also be downloaded into other libraries' local catalog systems. This allows libraries to find and download records for materials they are adding to their local catalog, without having to undergo the lengthy process of creating a new catalog entry from scratch for each new item.

In December 2017, WorldCat contained over 400 million bibliographic records in 491 languages, representing over 2.6 billion physical and digital library assets,&lt;ref name="statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oclc.org/en/worldcat/inside-worldcat.html |title=Inside WorldCat |publisher=Online Computer Library Center |accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the WorldCat persons dataset ([[Data mining|mined]] from WorldCat) included over 100 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data strategy [WorldCat] |website=oclc.org |url=https://www.oclc.org/en/worldcat/data-strategy.html |accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WorldCat is available to the public for searching via a subscription web-based service called FirstSearch,&lt;ref name="firstsearch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oclc.org/firstsearch/ |title=First search |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as through the publicly available WorldCat.org.&lt;ref name="worldcat"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.worldcat.org/ |title=Open WorldCat |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifiers and linked data==
OCLC assigns a unique control number (referred to as an "OCN" for "OCLC Control Number") to each new bibliographic record in the WorldCat. Numbers are assigned serially, and as of mid-2013 over a billion OCNs had been created. In September 2013, the OCLC declared these numbers to be in the [[public domain]], removing a perceived barrier to widespread use of OCNs outside OCLC itself.&lt;ref name="oclc.public"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallis |first=Richard |title=OCLC Declare OCLC Control Numbers Public Domain |work= |publisher= |date=September 24, 2013 |url=http://dataliberate.com/2013/09/oclc-declare-oclc-control-numbers-public-domain/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The control numbers link WorldCat's records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record across libraries.&lt;ref name="oclc.control"&gt;{{cite web |title=OCLC Control Number |url=http://www.oclc.org/batchload/controlnumber.en.html |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCNs are particularly useful as [[identifier]]s for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have [[ISBN]]s (e.g., books published before 1970). OCNs are used as identifiers often in Wikipedia and [[Wikidata]]. In October 2013, it was reported that out of 29,673 instances of [[Infobox]] Book in Wikipedia, "there were 23,304 ISBNs and 15,226 OCNs"; and regarding Wikidata: "of around 14 million Wikidata items, 28,741 were books. 5403 Wikidata items have an ISBN associated with them, and 12,262 have OCNs."&lt;ref name="oclc.wild"&gt;{{cite web |author=HangingTogether.org |title=OCLC Control Numbers in the Wild |work= |publisher= |date=October 11, 2013 |url=http://hangingtogether.org/?p=3379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCLC also runs the [[Virtual International Authority File]] (VIAF), an international name authority file. VIAF numbers are broadly used as standard idenfitiers.

==Company acquisitions==
[[File:Schipholweg 99, Leiden.JPG|{{largethumb}}|OCLC offices in [[Leiden]] (the Netherlands)]]

OCLC acquired [[NetLibrary]], a provider of electronic books and textbooks, in 2002 and sold it in 2010 to [[EBSCO Industries]].&lt;ref name="oclc.2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oclc.org/services/content/lettertomembers2010.htm |title=Letter to members 2010 |last=Jordan |first=Jay |date=March 17, 2010 |publisher=OCLC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326140956/http://www.oclc.org/services/content/lettertomembers2010.htm |archivedate=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OCLC owns 100% of the shares of [[OCLC PICA]], a [[library automation system]]s and services company which has its headquarters in [[Leiden]] in the Netherlands and which was renamed "OCLC" at the end of 2007.&lt;ref name="lj.ca6495514"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6495514.html |title=CLC/OCLC Pica Merge |first=Michael |last=Rogers |newspaper=Library Journal |date=October 30, 2007 |location=New York |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028205604/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6495514.html |archivedate=October 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the [[Research Libraries Group]] (RLG) merged with OCLC.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, Lizabeth; Neal, James; Jordan, Jay (October 2006).

It has also acquired [[OAIster]]. The process started in January 2009 and from October 31, 2009, OAIster records are freely available via WorldCat.org. In January 2015, OCLC acquired Sustainable Collection Services (SCS). SCS offered consulting services based on analyzing library print collection data to help libraries manage and share materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.infodocket.com/2015/01/13/print-collections-oclc-acquires-sustainable-collection-services/|title = Print Collections: OCLC Acquires Sustainable Collection Services|date = January 13, 2015|accessdate = March 6, 2015|website = Infodocket|publisher = |last = Price|first = Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, OCLC acquired Relais International, a library interlibrary loan service provider based in Ottawa, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oclc.org/en/news/releases/2017/201702dublin.html|title=OCLC agrees to acquire Relais International to provide library consortia more options for resource sharing|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2017|website=|access-date=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

OCLC has been criticized for [[Monopoly|monopolistic]] practices.&lt;ref name="oclc.2008"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/11701/1/radcat.pdf|title=Radical Cataloging: Essays at the Front|last=Beall|first=Jeffrey|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2008|isbn=0786435437|editor-last=Roberto|editor-first=K.R.|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=85–93|chapter=OCLC: A Review|oclc=173241123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, the company was sued by SkyRiver, a rival startup, in an [[Competition law|antitrust suit]].&lt;ref name="kc.201007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kcoyle.blogspot.com/2010/07/skyriver-sues-oclc-over-anti-trust.html |first=Karen |last=Coyle |title=SkyRiver Sues OCLC over Anti-Trust |publisher=Karen Coyle |date=July 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Library automation company [[Innovative Interfaces]] joined SkyRiver in the suit.&lt;ref name="lj.264"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/886099-264/skyriver_and_innovative_interfaces_file.html.csp |title=SkyRiver and Innovative Interfaces File Major Antitrust Lawsuit Against OCLC |first=Marshall |last=Breeding |work=[[Library Journal]] |date=July 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802044208/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/886099-264/skyriver_and_innovative_interfaces_file.html.csp |archivedate=August 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was dropped in March 2013, however, following the acquisition of SkyRiver by Innovative Interfaces.&lt;ref name="id.20130304"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infodocket.com/2013/03/04/innovative-interfaces-integrates-all-skyriver-services-and-withdraws-antitrust-lawsuit-against-oclc/ |title=III Drops OCLC Suit, Will Absorb SkyRiver |first=Gary |last=Price |work=[[Library Journal]] |date=March 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2018, at least three groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 Titanic relics that were an asset of the bankrupt company in the case titled ''RMS Titanic Inc., 16-02230, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville)''. &lt;ref&gt;https://app.courtdrive.com/filings/flmbke_1210288-3-16-bk-02230-rms-titanic-inc&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the offers for the collection were just under US $20 million, including one by museums in England and Northern Ireland, with assistance by [[James Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawn McCarty, Jef Feeley, Chris Dixon|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/07/news-titanic-uk-belfast-bankruptcy-cameron/|publisher=National Geographic|date=2018-07-24 |accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oceanographer [[Robert Ballard]] told the news media that he favored this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in [[Belfast]] and in [[Greenwich]]. A decision as to the outcome was to be made by Paul M. Glenn, a [[United States district court]] judge in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawn McCarty, Jef Feeley, Chris Dixon|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-31/bankrupt-titanic-exhibitor-sets-biggest-sale-ever-of-ship-relics|title=Bankrupt Titanic exhibitor sets biggest sale of ship relics|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2018-08-31 |accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
"After facing legal challenges and the early closure of its 'Saturday Night Live' exhibition, Premier filed for bankruptcy protection" in June 2016, according to Fortune.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farber|first1=Madeline|title=Company Behind 'Bodies' Exhibitions Attempts to Sell Titanic Artifacts|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/23/company-to-sell-titanic-artifacts-bankruptcy/|accessdate=8 September 2017|website=Fortune.com|publisher=Time Inc.|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RMS Titanic Inc.==
RMS Titanic Inc. has been the wreck's legal salvager since 1994. Starting in 2009 they changed their approach to that of closer co-operation with Titanic preservation and regulatory bodies, an approach in place circa 2012.&lt;ref name = "NationalGeographic2012"&gt;'The lights are finally on'.  ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine, April 2012, Hampton Sides.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2018, the 5,500 artifacts from the Titanic were all for sale after the bankruptcy filing of Premier Exhibitions in the United States. The [[National Maritime Museum]], [[National Museums Northern Ireland]], Titanic Belfast and Titanic Foundation Limited had joined together as a consortium that raised money to purchase the artifacts. They intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy court which set the minimum bid at US$21.5 million (£16.5m). The consortium did not have enough funding to meet that amount and was unable to place a bid on the specified date, 11 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45766021 Titanic: Salvaged treasure may not return to Belfast BBC 5 October 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/the-basch-report-titanic-artifacts-finally-to-be-sold-at-auction Bankrupt Premier Exhibitions Inc. owns 5,500 items from the ill-fated ocean liner The Basch Report 3 October 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romanization''' or '''Latinization''' (or '''Romanisation''' or '''Latinisation'''), in the historical and cultural meanings of both terms, indicate different historical processes, such as [[acculturation]], [[social integration|integration]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of newly incorporated and peripheral populations by the [[Roman Republic]] and the later [[Roman Empire]]. 
Ancient Roman [[historiography]] and Italian [[historiography]] until the [[fascist]] period used to call the various processes the "[[civilizing]] of [[barbarians]]".

==Characteristics==
[[File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Roman Empire]] at its greatest extent]]
[[Acculturation]] proceeded from the top down, with the upper classes adopting Roman culture first and the old ways lingering for the longest among peasants in outlying districts.&lt;ref&gt;The identification of countryfolk as ''pagani'' is discussed at [[paganism]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hostages played an important part in this process, as elite children, from [[Mauretania]] to [[Gaul]], were taken to be raised and educated in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard A. Curchin, ''The Romanization of Central Spain: complexity, diversity, and change in a Provincial Hintellrfreshsrland'', 2004, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Roman [[historiography]] and traditional Italian [[historiography]] confidently identified the different processes involved with a "[[civilization]] of [[barbarians]]". Modern historians take a more nuanced view: by making their peace with Rome, local elites could make their position more secure and reinforce their prestige. New themes include the study of personal and group values and the construction of identity, which is the personal aspect of [[ethnogenesis]]. The transitions operated differently in different provinces; as Blagg and Millett point out&lt;ref&gt;T. F. C. Blagg and M. Millett, eds., ''The Early Roman Empire in the West'' 1999, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; even a [[Roman province]] may be too broad a canvas to generalize.

One characteristic of cultural Romanization was the creation of many hundreds of [[colonia (Roman)|Roman coloniae]] in the territory of the Roman Republic and the subsequent Roman Empire. Until [[Trajan]], colonies were created by using retired veteran soldiers, mainly from the Italian peninsula, who promoted Roman customs and laws, with the use of [[Latin]].

{{Quote|''About 400 towns (of the Roman Empire) are known to have possessed the rank of colonia. During the empire, colonies were showcases of Roman culture and examples of the Roman way of life. The native population of the provinces could see how they were expected to live. Because of this function, the promotion of a town to the status of "Colonia civium Romanorum" implied that all citizens received full citizen rights and dedicated a temple to the Capitoline triad: Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, the deities venerated in the temple of Jupiter Best and Biggest on the Capitol in Rome.'' Livius &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/concept/colonia/ Coloniae]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been estimated that at the beginning of the empire, about 750,000 Italians lived in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Scheidel, "Demography", 49&amp;ndash;50, 64, 64 n. 114, citing P. A. Brunt, ''Italian Manpower 225 B.C.–A.D. 14'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), 263.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]], [[Mark Antony|Mark Anthony]] and [[Octavian]] settled many of their veterans in colonies: in Italy, and the provinces. The colonies that were established in Italy until 14 BCE have been studied by Keppie (1983). In his account of the achievements of his long reign, ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', Augustus stated that he had settled 120,000 soldiers in twenty colonies in Italy in 31 BCE, then 100,000 men in colonies in Spain and southern Gaul in 14 BCE, followed by another 96,000 in 2 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Southern - The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History (2006/Oxford Uni.)&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Campbell also states "From 49 to 32 BCE about 420,000 Italians were recruited", which would thus be the veteran (citizen) stock that was largely sent to the provinces (colonies) during Augustus. The Lex Calpurnia, however, also allowed citizenship to be granted for distinguished bravery. For example, the 1,000 socii from Camerinum after [[Battle of Vercellae|Vercellae]] 101 BCE (Plutarch Mar. XXXVIII) and the auxiliary (later [[Legio XXII Deiotariana]]) after [[Battle of Zela|Zela]], got Roman citizenship. By the time of Augustus, the legions consisted mostly of ethnic Latins/Italics and Cisalpine Gauls.&lt;ref&gt;B. Campbell The Roman Army, 31 BC–AD 337 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
All that led to many gradual developments.

The very existence is a source of contention among modern [[archaeologists]].&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, D. J., 2004, "Being Roman: Expressing Identity in a provincial setting", ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' Vol. 17, pp 5–26&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first approaches, which now can be regarded as the "traditional" approach, was taken by [[Francis Haverfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Haverfield, F., 1912, ''The Romanization of Roman Britain'', Oxford: Claredon Press&lt;/ref&gt; He saw this process beginning in primarily post-conquest societies (such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Gaul]]), where direct Roman policy from the top promoted an increase in the Roman population of the province through the establishment of [[veteran]] colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1086829|title = Roman Colonization|journal = Phoenix|volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 139|last1 = MacKendrick|first1 = P. L|doi = 10.2307/1086829|year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''coloniae'' would have spoken [[Latin]] and been citizens of Rome following their army tenure (See [[Roman citizenship]]). Haverfield thus assumes this would have a Romanising effect upon the native communities.

This thought process, fueled though it was by early 20th century standards of [[imperialism]] and cultural change, forms the basis for the modern understanding of Romanization. However, recent scholarship has devoted itself to providing alternate models of how native populations adopted [[Roman culture]] and has questioned the extent to which it was accepted or resisted.

#'''Non-Interventionist''' Model&lt;ref&gt;Millet, M., 1990, "Romanization: historical issues and archaeological interpretation", in Blagg, T. and Millett, M. (Eds.), ''The Early Roman Empire in the West'', Oxford: Oxbow Books, pp. 35–44&lt;/ref&gt; – Native elites were encouraged to increase social standing through association with the powerful conqueror be it in dress, language, housing and food consumption. That provides them with associated power. The establishment of a civil administration system is quickly imposed to solidify the permanence of Roman rule.
#'''Discrepant Identity'''&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, D. J., 2004, "Being Roman: Expressing Identity in a provincial setting", ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' Vol. 17, pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt; – No uniformity of identity that can accurately be described as traditional Romanization. Fundamental differences within a province are visible through economics, religion and identity. Not all provincials supported Rome and not all elites wanted to be like the Roman upper classes.
#'''Acculturation'''&lt;ref&gt;Webster, J., 1997 "Necessary Comparisons: A Post-Colonial Approach to Religious Syncretism in the Roman Provinces", ''World Archaeology'' Vol 28 No 3, pp. 324–338&lt;/ref&gt; – Aspects of both Native and Roman cultures are joined together., as can be seen in the Roman acceptance, and adoption of, non-[[Classical antiquity|Classical]] religious practices. The inclusion of [[Isis]], [[Epona]], [[Britannia]] and [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Dolichenus]] into the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] are evidence.
#'''Creolization'''&lt;ref&gt;Webster, J., 2001, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' Vol 105 No. 2, pp. 209–225,&lt;/ref&gt; – Romanization occurs as a result of negotiation between different elements of non-egalitarian societies and so material culture is ambiguous.

==Legacy==
[[File:Latin Europe.png|thumb|400px|right|Romance languages in Europe]]
[[Roman names]] were adopted.

The Latin language was spread, which was greatly facilitated by the fact that many cultures were mostly oral (particularly for the [[Gaul]]s and [[Iberians]]). Anyone who wanted to deal (through writing) with the bureaucracy and/or with the Roman market had to write in Latin. The extent of the adoption is subject to ongoing debate, as the native languages were certainly spoken after the conquests. Moreover, in the eastern half of the Empire, Latin had to compete with [[Koine Greek|Greek]], which largely kept its position as [[lingua franca]] and even spread to new areas. Latin became prominent in certain areas around new [[colonies in antiquity|veteran colonies]] like [[Beirut|Berytus]].

The ancient tribal laws were replaced by [[Roman law]], with its institutions of property rights.

Typically-Roman institutions, such as [[thermae|public baths]], the emperor cult and [[gladiator]] fights, were adopted.

Gradually, the conquered would see themselves as Romans. The process was supported by the [[Roman Republic]] and then by the [[Roman Empire]].

The entire process was facilitated by the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin of most of the languages and by the similarity of the gods of many ancient cultures. They also already had had trade relations and contacts with one another through the seafaring Mediterranean cultures like the [[Phoenicians]] and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].

Romanization was largely effective in the western half of the empire, where native civilizations were weaker. In the Hellenized east, ancient civilizations like those of [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Judea]] and [[Syria]], effectively resisted all but its most superficial effects. When the Empire was divided, the east, with mainly Greek culture, was marked by the increasing strength of specifically Greek culture and language to the detriment of the Latin language and other Romanizing influences, but its citizens continued to regard themselves as Romans.

While [[Roman Britain|Britain]] certainly was Romanized, its approximation to the Roman culture seems to have been smaller than that of Gaul. The most romanized regions, as demonstrated by Dott. Bernward Tewes and Barbara Woitas of the computing center of the Catholic University Eichstätt-Ingolstadt, were [[Italy]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Gaul]], southern [[Germany]] and [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epimap.html|title=Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss Slaby EDCS, unter Mitarbeit von Anne Kolb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanization in most of those regions remains such a powerful cultural influence in most aspects of life today that they are described as "Latin countries". That is most evident in European countries in which [[Romance languages]] are spoken and former colonies that have inherited the languages and other Roman influences. According to [[Theodor Mommsen]], cultural Romanisation was more complete in those areas that developed a "neolatin language" (like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). The same process later developed in the recent centuries' colonial empires.

The '''School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University''' (also known as the '''Museum School''' or '''SMFA at Tufts'''; formerly the '''School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston''') is one of the schools that [[Tufts University]] comprises, located in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The school offers undergraduate and graduate degrees dedicated to the [[visual arts]]. It is affiliated with the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]].  SMFA is also a member of the [[Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design]] (AICAD), a [[consortium]] of several dozen leading art schools in the United States.

== Overview ==
The school does not have a foundations program, but it does require all new students to take a freshman seminar. Encouraged to build an individual program of interdisciplinary study, students are not asked to declare a major, but by choosing among in-depth courses in a dozen disciplines, students are free to concentrate in a medium of their choice.

One of the unique attributes of SMFA is that students are required to participate in a "Review Board" which is a review of all of the art work that a student has done during the semester. Review Boards are led by two faculty members, one of whom is the students' choice, and two fellow students. There are many opportunities for students to exhibit their artwork at both the main building and the [[Mission Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Mission Hill]] building.

Opportunities to exhibit works include the annual Art Sale and the juried "Student Annual Exhibition". Various galleries and spaces that are available to students around the school buildings include Bag Gallery, Hallway Gallery, Bathroom Gallery, Underground Gallery, as well as the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].

The School's main [[campus]] is adjacent to and just to the west of the Museum of Fine Arts. Most classroom space is located there, as well as the Cafe des Arts, the library, the School's store and the Grossman Gallery. The [[Mission Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Mission Hill]] building, located about a quarter mile from the main building, recently has been renovated and includes studio spaces for graduate and post-baccalaureate students as well as classrooms, workshops, and the Writing Center.

== History ==
[[File:Smfa-atrium.jpg|thumb|left|The Weems Center, part of [[Graham Gund]]'s expansion, looking down from the third floor]] 
From 1876 to 1909, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, was housed in the basement of the original Museum building in [[Copley Square]]. When the Museum moved to Huntington Avenue in 1909, the School moved into a separate, temporary structure to the west of the main building. The permanent building, designed by Guy Lowell, was completed in 1927. The {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} red brick building provided improved classroom, studio and library facilities. In 1945 the Museum School and Tufts College collaborated to develop their first joint degree teacher training granting program. The creation of additional programs between the two institutions followed soon after.

In 1987, a newly renovated and expanded school building, designed by architect [[Graham Gund]], more than doubled the size of the existing structure and provided an auditorium, enlarged library, expanded studios and classrooms, a spacious new entrance, cafeteria, and increased gallery and exhibition spaces. Gund's expansion included the central [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], known as the Katherine Lane Weems Atrium, that connects the two buildings.

In December 2015 it was announced that the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (SMFA) would become a part of [[Tufts University]] and on June 30, 2016 the integration was completed.

'''Société des anciens textes français''' (SATF) is a learned society founded in [[Paris]] in 1875 with the purpose of publishing all kinds of medieval documents written either in [[langue d'oïl]] or [[occitan|langue d'oc]] (''Bulletin de la SATF'', 1 (1875), p.&amp;nbsp;1). Its founding members are Henri Bordier, Joseph de Laborde, A. Lamarle, [[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]], Léopold Pannier, [[Gaston Paris]], Auguste-Henry-Édouard, marquis de Queux de Saint-Hilaire, baron Arthur de Rothschild, baron [[Edmond de Rothschild]], baron James N. de [[Rothschild]] and [[Natalis de Wailly]].

From 1875 to 1936, the SATF published a yearly bulletin distributed to its members only.

Since its foundation, the SATF have also published a series of critical editions and even, sometimes, facsimile editions, a series that amounts today to approximately 180 volumes.

'''Stone stele records of imperial examinations of the Lê and Mạc dynasties''' ({{lang-vi|Bia đá các khoa thi tiến sĩ triều Lê và Mạc|link=no}}) is a collection of 82 stone [[stele|stelae]] that contain the names and related information of doctoral laureates who passed the [[imperial examination]]s during the reign of the [[Lê dynasty|Lê]] and [[Mạc dynasty|Mạc]] dynasties from 1442 to 1779. Preserved in good condition in the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] of [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], the collection became an inscription of the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]] on March 9, 2010.&lt;ref name=Memo2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=29638&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=First inscription from Macao on Memory of the World Register at MOWCAP 4 |publisher=Memory of the World Programme |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150314125121/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=29638&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archivedate=2015-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The 82 stelae were made from stone in the form of [[Bixi|tortoise-mounted tablet]] since tortoise was traditionally considered a symbol of longevity and everlastingness in [[Vietnamese culture]]. There are three principal types of stele corresponding with three different periods of the Lê and Mạc dynasties, besides each stele was decorated with diverse patterns from [[Taoism|Taoist]]-influenced design to everyday images such as farmer or animals.&lt;ref name=ttvh1003/&gt; According to the researcher [[Nguyễn Vinh Phúc]], there is possibly an 83rd stele in the collection since people discovered a stone tortoise at the bottom of the lake in the Temple of Literature.&lt;ref name=ttvh1003/&gt;

After each examination, a new stele was erected with detailed information about the process of the examination, number of participants and profiles of all laureates.&lt;ref name=vietnamnet1108/&gt; Besides, engraved in each stele is a statement describing the meaning of education and talent for the country and reflecting the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy and tradition of Vietnam. This public recognition of the achievements of the laureates was meant to encourage other students to serve the society in similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vietnam: education financing |author=World Bank |publisher=World Bank Publications |year=1997 |page=3 |isbn=0-8213-4023-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most cited statements is the engraving of the first stele which was redacted by [[Thân Nhân Trung]] in 1484 for the 1442 imperial examination during the reign of [[Lê Thái Tông]]:&lt;ref name=vietnamnet1502&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/education/201002/Ancient-institution-of-learning-continues-to-educate-894692/ |title=Ancient institution of learning continues to educate |date=2010-02-15 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:BiaTienSi1442.jpg|thumb|right|The first stele of the collection.]]
In total, there are 2,313 names of laureates that were carved in the stelae, they were recognized after passing [[imperial examination]] between 1484 and 1780 organized by the Lê, Mạc, [[Trịnh lords|Trịnh]] and [[Nguyễn dynasty|Nguyễn]] dynasties.&lt;ref name=vietnamnet1108&gt;{{cite web |title=VN’s historical exam results court UNESCO status |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2009/08/862875/ |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |date=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one was erected in 1484 during the reign of [[Lê Thánh Tông]] with the record of the 1442 imperial examination while the last stele was made in 1780 for the 1779 examination.&lt;ref name=ttvh0903&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethaovanhoa.vn/133N2010030910274108T0/bia-tien-si-tai-van-mieuquoc-tu-giam-la-di-san-tu-lieu-the-gioi.htm |title=Bia tiến sĩ tại Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám là Di sản tư liệu thế giới |date=2010-03-09 |publisher=''[[Thể thao &amp; Văn hóa]]'' |language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the names engraved in the collection are many well-known figures in the [[history of Vietnam]] such as the historian [[Ngô Sĩ Liên]], the scholar [[Lê Quý Đôn]] or the diplomat [[Ngô Thì Nhậm]].&lt;ref name=ttvh0903/&gt; Some of those names during the period of Trịnh lords were afterwards crossed out by orders of the Nguyễn emperors since the laureates had participated in activities considered against the Nguyễn lords.&lt;ref name=ttvh1003/&gt; Since the stelae were partly damaged during the war between the [[Tây Sơn dynasty]] and the troops of [[Nguyễn Ánh]], the emperor [[Nguyễn Quang Toản]] wanted to restore the collection but could not complete the work because of the collapse of the Tây Sơn dynasty in 1802.&lt;ref name=vietnamnet1502/&gt; After the establishment of the Nguyễn dynasty, the emperor [[Gia Long]] decided to transfer the capital from [[Hanoi]] to [[Huế]], thus a new Temple of Literature was built in Huế where new stelae were placed. The total number of stelae in Huế is 32 with the last one dated in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Arts du Vietnam: la fleur du pêcher et l'oiseau d'azur |author=Catherine Noppe, Jean-François Hubert |publisher=Renaissance Du Livre |year=2002 |isbn=2-8046-0638-4 |page=120 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection is appreciated as a national treasure of Vietnam because it provides not only information about the education during 300 years of dynastic Vietnam but also the details about the system of imperial examinations of the past dynasties.&lt;ref name=vietnamnet1108/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2009/03/838791/ |title=Van Mieu stone steles nominated as world documentation heritage |date=2009-03-28 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory of the World==
Initially, the Vietnamese nominations in 2007 and 2008 for the Memory of the World Programme were the [[Woodblocks of the Nguyễn Dynasty]] and a collection of old photographs of [[Indochina]]. While the former was quickly registered by UNESCO in 2009, the latter was finally replaced by the collection of stone stelae of the Lê and Mạc dynasties which was considered more original and intact.&lt;ref name=ttvh1003&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethaovanhoa.vn/133N20100310101738199T0/bia-tien-si-duoc-unesco-vinh-danh.htm |author=Nguyễn Mỹ |title=Bia tiến sĩ được UNESCO vinh danh |date=2010-03-10 |publisher=''[[Thể thao &amp; Văn hóa]]'' |language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nomination was ultimately accepted by UNESCO at its meeting in [[Macau]] on March 9, 2010 and thus the collection of stele records became the second entry of Vietnam in the list of the Memory of the World.&lt;ref name=Memo2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=vietnamnet1003&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/201003/Temple-of-Literature%E2%80%99s-steles-recognized-as-world-heritage-documents-898141/ |title=Temple of Literature’s steles recognized as world heritage documents |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |date=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symphony No. 9''' in [[D minor]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 125, is the final complete symphony by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], composed between 1822 and 1824. It was first performed in Vienna on 7 May 1824. One of the best-known works in [[Common practice period|common practice music]],&lt;ref name=NCookblurb&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|loc=Product description (blurb). "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is regarded by many critics and musicologists as one of Beethoven's greatest works and one of the supreme achievements in the history of western music.&lt;ref name=NCookblurb /&gt;&lt;ref name=TomServiceSymphGuide&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/sep/09/symphony-guide-beethoven-ninth-choral-tom-service|title=Symphony guide: Beethoven's Ninth ('Choral')|first=Tom|last=Service|authorlink=Tom Service|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 September 2014|quote=the central artwork of Western music, the symphony to end all symphonies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, it stands as one of the most performed symphonies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/11/02/lansing-symphony-orchestra-perform-joyful-beethovens-th/93156368/ "Lansing Symphony Orchestra to perform joyful Beethoven’s 5th"] by Ken Glickman, ''[[Lansing State Journal]]'', 2 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gfsymphony.org/beethoven-s-ninth-ode-to-joy "Beethoven's Ninth: 'Ode to Joy'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081120/https://www.gfsymphony.org/beethoven-s-ninth-ode-to-joy |date=1 December 2017 }}, Great Falls Symphony, 2017/18 announcement&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was the first example of a major composer using voices in a symphony&lt;ref name="bonds24837"&gt;Bonds, Mark Evan, "Symphony: II. The 19th century", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition'' (London: Macmillan, 2001), 29 vols. {{ISBN|0-333-60800-3}}, 24:837.&lt;/ref&gt; (thus making it a [[choral symphony]]). The words are sung during the final movement by four vocal soloists and a [[choir|chorus]]. They were taken from the "[[Ode to Joy]]", a poem written by [[Friedrich Schiller]] in 1785 and revised in 1803, with text additions made by the composer.  

In 2001, Beethoven's original, hand-written manuscript of the score, held by the [[Berlin State Library]], was added to the [[United Nations]] [[Memory of the World Programme]] Heritage list, becoming the first musical score so designated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/ludwig-van-beethoven-symphony-no-9-d-minor-op-125/ Memory of the World (2001) – Ludwig van Beethoven: Symphony No 9, D minor, Op. 125]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
The [[Philharmonic Society of London]] originally commissioned the symphony in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maynard Solomon|Solomon, Maynard]]. ''Beethoven''. New York: Schirmer Books, 1997, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The main composition work was done between autumn 1822 and the completion of the autograph in February 1824.&lt;ref&gt;[[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel|Breitkopf]] [[Urtext edition|Urtext]], Beethoven: [http://www.breitkopf.com/feature/download/3738/3667 Symphonie Nr. 9 d-moll] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401012840/http://www.breitkopf.com/feature/download/3738/3667 |date=1 April 2012 }}, op. 125, pbl.: Hauschild, Peter, p. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony emerged from other pieces by Beethoven that, while completed works in their own right, are also in some sense "sketches" (rough outlines) for the future symphony. The Choral Fantasy Opus. 80 (1808), basically a [[piano concerto]] movement, brings in a choir and vocal soloists near the end for the climax. The vocal forces sing a theme first played instrumentally, and this theme is reminiscent of the corresponding theme in the Ninth Symphony (for a detailed comparison, see [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]).

Going further back, an earlier version of the Choral Fantasy theme is found in the song "Gegenliebe" (Returned Love) for piano and high voice, which dates from before 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (1981, 249)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert W. Gutman, Mozart's K. 222 Offertory in D minor, "Misericordias Domini", written in 1775, contains a melody that foreshadows "Ode to Joy".&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Gutman, ''Mozart: A Cultural Biography'', 1999, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premiere===
Although his major works had primarily been premiered in Vienna, Beethoven was keen to have his latest composition performed in Berlin as soon as possible after finishing it, as he thought that musical taste in Vienna had become dominated by Italian composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]].&lt;ref name="The Ninth"&gt;[[Harvey Sachs|Sachs, Harvey]] (2010), ''The Ninth: Beethoven and the World in 1824'', [[Faber and Faber|Faber]]&lt;/ref&gt; When his friends and financiers heard this, they urged him to premiere the symphony in Vienna in the form of a petition signed by a number of prominent Viennese music patrons and performers.&lt;ref name="The Ninth" /&gt;

[[File:Kärntnertortheater 1830.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|The [[Theater am Kärntnertor]] in 1830]]

Beethoven was flattered by the adoration of Vienna, so the Ninth Symphony was premiered on 7 May 1824 in the [[Theater am Kärntnertor]] in Vienna along with the overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' ({{lang|de|Die Weihe des Hauses}}) and three parts of the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' (the Kyrie, Credo, and Agnus Dei). This was the composer's first onstage appearance in 12 years; the hall was packed with an eager audience and a number of musicians.&lt;ref name="Levy David"&gt;Levy, David Benjamin. ''Beethoven: The Ninth Symphony''. Yale University Press 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere of Symphony No. 9 involved the largest orchestra ever assembled by Beethoven&lt;ref name="Levy David" /&gt; and required the combined efforts of the Kärntnertor house orchestra, the Vienna Music Society ([[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]]), and a select group of capable amateurs. While no complete list of premiere performers exists, many of Vienna's most elite performers are known to have participated.&lt;ref name="First Nights"&gt;[[Thomas Forrest Kelly|Kelly, Thomas Forrest]] (2000). ''First Nights: Five Musical Premiers'' (Chapter 3). Yale University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[soprano]] and [[alto]] parts were sung by two famous young singers: [[Henriette Sontag]] and [[Caroline Unger]]. German soprano Henriette Sontag was 18 years old when Beethoven personally recruited her to perform in the premiere of the Ninth.&lt;ref&gt;Elson, Louis, Chief Editor. ''University Musical Encyclopedia of Vocal Music''. University Society, New York, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Life of Henriette Sontag, Countess de Rossi. (Various Authors) Stringer &amp; Townsend, publishers. New York, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; Also personally recruited by Beethoven, 20-year-old [[contralto]] Caroline Unger, a native of Vienna, had gained critical praise in 1821 appearing in [[Rossini]]'s ''[[Tancredi]]''. After performing in Beethoven's 1824 premiere, Unger then found fame in Italy and Paris. Italian composers [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were known to have written roles specifically for her voice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] and Bourne, Joyce (1996). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music''. Oxford University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Haizinger]] and [[Joseph Seipelt]] sang the [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] parts, respectively.

[[File:CarolineUngher.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Caroline Unger]], who sang the contralto part at the first performance and is credited with turning Beethoven to face the applauding audience.]]

Although the performance was officially directed by [[Michael Umlauf]], the theatre's [[Kapellmeister]], Beethoven shared the stage with him. However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a [[dress rehearsal]] of his opera ''[[Fidelio]]'' ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the almost totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the tempos. He was turning the pages of his score and beating time for an orchestra he could not hear.

There are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was underrehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist [[Joseph Böhm]] recalled:

{{quote|Beethoven himself conducted, that is, he stood in front of a conductor's stand and threw himself back and forth like a madman. At one moment he stretched to his full height, at the next he crouched down to the floor, he flailed about with his hands and feet as though he wanted to play all the instruments and sing all the chorus parts. – The actual direction was in [Louis] Duport's{{refn|group=n|Presumably, Böhm meant the conductor Michael Umlauf}} hands; we musicians followed his baton only.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the audience applauded—testimonies differ over whether at the end of the [[scherzo]] or symphony—Beethoven was several measures off and still conducting. Because of that, the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to the critic for the ''Theater-Zeitung'', "the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience acclaimed him through [[standing ovation]]s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for the following orchestra. These are by far the largest forces needed for any Beethoven symphony; at the premiere, Beethoven augmented them further by assigning two players to each wind part.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Wheelock Thayer|Thayer, Alexander Wheelock]].

Beethoven changes the usual pattern of [[Classical music era|Classical]] symphonies in placing the [[scherzo]] movement before the slow movement (in symphonies, slow movements are usually placed before scherzi).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1999, 26; Stein 1979, 106&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time he did this in a symphony, although he had done so in some previous works, including the [[String Quartet No. 5 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 18 no. 5]], the [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|"Archduke" piano trio Op. 97]], the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' piano sonata Op. 106]]. [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 2|String Quartet No. 30 in E{{music|flat}} major]].

=== I. Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso ===
The first movement is in [[sonata form]] without an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] [[Repeat sign|repeat]]. It begins with [[open fifth]]s (A and E) played ''[[Dynamics (music)#Dynamic markings|pianissimo]]'' by [[tremolo]] strings, steadily building up until the first main theme in [[D minor]] at m. 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

        a'8-. g-. e-. a-.
        d,8.\sf
    }
&lt;/score&gt;

The opening, with its perfect fifth quietly emerging, resembles the sound of an orchestra [[Musical tuning|tuning up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180757068|title=Beethoven's Symphonies: A Guided Tour|last=Young|first=John Bell|publisher=Amadeus Press|year=2008|isbn=1574671693|location=New York|pages=|oclc=180757068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outset of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] (which repeats the main melodic themes) in m. 301, the theme returns, this time played ''fortissimo'' and in D ''major'', rather than D ''minor''. The movement ends with a massive [[Coda (music)|coda]] that takes up nearly a quarter of the movement, as in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical performance lasts about 15 minutes.

=== II. Molto vivace ===
The second movement is a [[scherzo|scherzo and trio]]. Like the first movement, the scherzo is in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' piano sonata]], written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven specifies one downbeat every three measures—perhaps because of the fast tempo—with the direction ''ritmo di tre battute'' (rhythm of three beats) and one beat every four measures with the direction ''ritmo di quattro battute'' (rhythm of four beats). Beethoven had been criticized before for failing to adhere to standard Classical form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Normally, a scherzo is in [[Triple metre|triple time]]. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time but punctuated it in a way that, when coupled with the tempo, makes it sound as if it is in [[Duple and quadruple metre|quadruple time]].

While adhering to the standard [[Ternary form#Compound ternary or trio form|compound ternary design]] (three-part structure) of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition (the statement of the main melodic themes) starts out with a [[fugue]] in D minor on the subject below.

:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
    \relative c''' {
        \set Staff.midiInstrument = #"violin"
        \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 2. = 116
        \key d \minor
        \time 3/4
        \set Score.currentBarNumber = #9
        \bar ""

        f e d
        c b a
        gis a b
        a gis a
    }
&lt;/score&gt;

For the second subject, it modulates to the unusual key of [[C major]]. The exposition then repeats before a short [[development section]], where Beethoven explores other ideas. The recapitulation (repeating of the melodic themes heard in the opening of the movement) further develops the exposition's themes, also containing timpani solos. A new development section leads to the repeat of the recapitulation, and the scherzo concludes with a brief [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]].

The contrasting trio section is in [[D major]] and in duple time. The trio is the first time the trombones play. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.

The duration of the movement is about 12 minutes, but this may vary depending on whether two (frequently omitted) repeats are played.

=== III. Adagio molto e cantabile ===
The third movement is a lyrical, slow movement in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] – a [[minor sixth]] away from the symphony's main key of D minor. It is in a [[Double variation|double variation form]], with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melodic ideas. The first variation, like the theme, is in {{music|time|4|4}} time, the second in {{music|time|12|8}}. The variations are separated by passages in {{music|time|3|4}}, the first in D major, the second in [[G major]], the third in [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], the fourth in [[F-sharp major|F{{music|sharp}} major]], and the fifth in [[B major]]. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud [[fanfare]]s from the full orchestra are answered by octaves by the first violins. A prominent French horn solo is assigned to the fourth player.

A typical performance lasts about 16 minutes.

===IV. Finale===
The famous choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of universal brotherhood based on the '[[Ode to Joy]]' theme and is in theme and [[Variation (music)|variations]] form.

        fis fis( g a) | a( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2
    }
  }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The movement starts with an introduction in which musical material from each of the preceding three movements – though none are literal quotations of previous music&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; – are successively presented and then dismissed by [[Recitative#Instrumental recitative|instrumental recitatives]] played by the low strings. Following this, the 'Ode to Joy' theme is finally introduced by the cellos and double basses. After three instrumental variations on this theme, the human voice is presented for the first time in the symphony by the baritone soloist, who sings words written by Beethoven himself: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!' Sondern laßt uns angenehmere anstimmen, und freudenvollere''.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; ("Oh friends, not these sounds! Let us instead strike up more pleasing and more joyful ones!").

   \addlyrics { O Freun- de, nicht die- se Tö- ne! }
&lt;/score&gt;

At about 24 minutes in length, the last movement is the longest of the four movements. Indeed, it is longer than some entire symphonies of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. Its form has been disputed by musicologists, as [[Nicholas Cook]] explains:

{{Quote|Beethoven had difficulty describing the finale himself; in letters to publishers, he said that it was like his Choral Fantasy, Op. 80, only on a much grander scale. We might call it a [[cantata]] constructed round a series of variations on the 'Joy' theme. But this is rather a loose formulation, at least by comparison with the way in which many twentieth-century critics have tried to codify the movement's form. Thus there have been interminable arguments as to whether it should be seen as a kind of sonata form (with the [[Turkish music (style)|'Turkish' music]] of bar 331, which is in B{{music|flat}} major, functioning as a kind of second group), or a kind of [[Concerto|concerto form]] (with bars 1–207 and 208–330 together making up a double exposition), or even a conflation of four symphonic movements into one (with bars 331–594 representing a Scherzo, and bars 595–654 a slow movement). The reason these arguments are interminable is that each interpretation contributes something to the understanding of the movement, but does not represent the whole story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cook gives the following table describing the form of the movement:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with Cook's remarks, [[Charles Rosen]] characterizes the final movement as a symphony within a symphony, played without interruption.&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;[[Charles Rosen|Rosen, Charles]]. ''The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven''. p. 440. New York: Norton, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This "inner symphony" follows the same overall pattern as the Ninth Symphony as a whole:
* First "movement": [[Theme and variations]] with slow introduction. The main theme, first in the cellos and basses, is later recapitulated by voices.
* Second "movement": [[Scherzo]] in a {{music|time|6|8}} military style. It begins at ''Alla marcia'' (m. 331) and concludes with a {{music|time|6|8}} variation of the main theme with [[Choir|chorus]].
* Third "movement": Slow meditation with a new theme on the text "''Seid umschlungen, Millionen!''" It begins at ''Andante maestoso'' (m. 595).
* Fourth "movement": [[fugue|Fugato]] finale on the themes of the first and third "movements". It begins at ''Allegro energico'' (m. 763).

The movement has a thematic unity in which every part is based on either the main theme, the "Seid umschlungen" theme, or some combination of the two.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Indeed, Rosen also notes that the movement can also be analysed as a set of variations and simultaneously as a concerto sonata form with double exposition (with the fugato acting both as a development section and the second tutti of the concerto).&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

====Text of the fourth movement====
The text is largely taken from [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s "[[Ode to Joy]]", with a few additional introductory words written specifically by Beethoven (shown in italics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raptusassociation.org/ode1785.html|title=Beethoven Foundation – Schiller's "An die Freude" and Authoritative Translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text, without repeats, is shown below, with a translation into English.&lt;ref&gt;The translation is taken from the [[BBC Proms]] 2013 programme, for a concert held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2013/august-11/14710 Prom 38, 11 August 2013]). This concert was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and later on BBC4 television on 6 September 2013, where the same translation was used as subtitles.&lt;/ref&gt; The score includes many repeats.

Towards the end of the movement, the choir sings the last four lines of the main theme, concluding with "Alle Menschen" before the soloists sing for one last time the song of joy at a slower tempo. The chorus repeats parts of "Seid umschlungen, Millionen!", then quietly sings, "Tochter aus Elysium", and finally, "Freude, schöner Götterfunken, Götterfunken!".&lt;ref name=dew /&gt;

==Reception==
Music critics almost universally consider the Ninth Symphony one of Beethoven's greatest works, and among the greatest musical works ever written.&lt;ref name=NCookblurb /&gt;&lt;ref name=TomServiceSymphGuide /&gt; The finale, however, has had its detractors: "[e]arly critics rejected [the finale] as cryptic and eccentric, the product of a deaf and aging composer."&lt;ref name=NCookblurb /&gt;

==Performance challenges==
[[File:Beethoven Ninth Symphony.png|thumb|300x300px|Handwritten page of the fourth movement]]

===Metronome markings===
Conductors in the [[historically informed performance]] movement, notably [[Roger Norrington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norrington|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Norrington|title=In tune with the time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/14/beethoven|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 March 2009|accessdate=15 May 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used Beethoven's suggested tempos, to mixed reviews. [[Benjamin Zander]] has made a case for following Beethoven's metronome markings, both in writing&lt;ref name="Zander" /&gt; and in performances with the [[Boston Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Philharmonia Orchestra of London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/11/arts/concert-beethoven-9th.html "Concert: Beethoven 9th, Benjamin Zander and the Boston Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall"] by Bernhard Holland, ''The New York Times'', 11 October 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Symphony-No-Dominique-Labelle/dp/B00000IGQ6 Recording of the Beethoven 9th] with Benjamin Zander, Dominique Labelle, D'Anna Fortunato, Brad Cresswell, David Arnold, the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chorus Pro Musica&lt;/ref&gt; While one account holds that Beethoven's metronome still exists and was tested and found accurate,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5-9Cdy-Y-M8C&amp;pg=PA34 Gunther Schuller, ''The Compleat Conductor'']&lt;/ref&gt; a 2013 mathematics paper finds that his metronome was likely damaged and out of calibration.&lt;ref&gt;Sture Forsén, Harry B. Gray, L. K. Olof Lindgren, and Shirley B. Gray. October 2013. [http://www.ams.org/notices/201309/rnoti-p1146.pdf "Was Something Wrong with Beethoven’s Metronome?"], ''Notices of the [[American Mathematical Society]]'' 60(9):1146–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hold Beethoven's markings to be accurate if interpreted metrically, i.e. in relation to the indicated note values halved. They take this interpretation to be the standard also for Beethoven's contemporaries.&lt;ref name="Weller 2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weller |first1=Wolfgang |title=Internationales Tempo-Giusto-Symposion 2009 (German) |url=http://www.wellermusik.de/Tempo_Giusto/Internationales_Tempo--Giusto_Symposion_2009_Kongressbericht.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-orchestrations and alterations===
A number of conductors have made alterations in the instrumentation of the symphony. Notably, [[Richard Wagner]] doubled many woodwind passages, a modification greatly extended by [[Gustav Mahler]],&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;Raymond Holden, "The iconic symphony: performing Beethoven's Ninth Wagner's Way" ''[[The Musical Times]]'', Winter 2011&lt;/ref&gt; who revised the orchestration of the Ninth to make it sound like what he believed Beethoven would have wanted if given a modern orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natalie Bauer-Lechner|Bauer-Lechner, Natalie]]: ''Erinnerungen an Gustav Mahler'', p. 131. E.P. Tal &amp; Co. Verlag, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's Dresden performance of 1864 was the first to place the chorus and the solo singers behind the orchestra as has since become standard; previous conductors placed them between the orchestra and the audience.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

====2nd bassoon doubling basses in the finale====
Beethoven's indication that the 2nd bassoon should double the basses in measures 115–164 of the finale was not included in the [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] parts, though it was included in the full score.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Del Mar|Del Mar, Jonathan]] (1981) ''Orchestral Variations: Confusion and Error in the Orchestral Repertoire'' London: Eulenburg Books, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable performances and recordings==
The British premiere was presented on 21 March 1825 by its commissioners, the [[Philharmonic Society of London]], at its [[Argyll Rooms]] conducted by [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]] and with the choral part sung in Italian. The American premiere was presented on 20 May 1846 by the newly formed [[New York Philharmonic]] at [[Castle Garden]] (in an attempt to raise funds for a new concert hall), conducted by the English-born [[George Loder]] with the choral part translated into English for the first time.

[[Richard Wagner]] conducted the symphony many times in his career. His last performance took place in 1872 at a concert to mark the foundation stone for the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]]. Wagner later published an essay entitled "The rendering of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony" in which he described the changes he made to the orchestration (see above) for the 1872 performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|pp=51–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[London Philharmonic Choir]] debuted on 15 May 1947 performing the Ninth Symphony with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] under the baton of [[Victor de Sabata]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/933316|title=London Concerts|journal=[[The Musical Times]]|volume=88|issue=1250|author=Anon.|date=April 1947| page=139|publisher=Musical Times Publications Ltd.|jstor=933316}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] and the [[Bayreuth Festival]] Orchestra reopened the Bayreuth Festival with a performance of the symphony, after the Allies temporarily suspended the Festival following the Second World War.&lt;ref name="PhilBeet"&gt;{{cite web

American conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] made his first of three recordings of the Beethoven Ninth in 1964 with the [[New York Philharmonic]], for [[Columbia Masterworks]], with soloists [[Martina Arroyo]] (soprano), [[Regina Sarfaty]] (mezzo), Nicholas di Virgilio (tenor), Norman Scott (bass), and the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] Chorus. It was later reissued on CD.

Bernstein made his second recording of the piece with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] for [[Deutsche Grammophon]], in 1979. This featured [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] (soprano), [[Hanna Schwarz]] (mezzo), [[René Kollo]] (tenor), and [[Kurt Moll]] (bass), with the chorus of the [[Vienna State Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/disc_other.php?disc_other_php=&amp;disc_other.php=&amp;page=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernstein conducted a version of the Ninth at the [[Konzerthaus Berlin|Schauspielhaus]] in East Berlin, with {{Lang|de|Freiheit}} (Freedom) replacing {{Lang|de|Freude}} (Joy), to celebrate the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] during Christmas 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Makell (2002), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; This concert was performed by an orchestra and chorus made up of many nationalities: from both Germanies, the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] and Chorus, the Chorus of the [[Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin)|Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra]], and members of the [[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]], the Philharmonischer Kinderchor Dresden; from the Soviet Union, members of the orchestra of the [[Kirov Theatre]]; from the United Kingdom, members of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]; from the USA, members of the New York Philharmonic; and from France, members of the [[Orchestre de Paris]]. Soloists were [[June Anderson]], soprano, [[Sarah Walker (mezzo-soprano)|Sarah Walker]], mezzo-soprano, [[Klaus König]], tenor, and [[Jan-Hendrik Rootering]], bass.&lt;ref name="Naxos 2072038"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=2072038 |title=Ode To Freedom – Beethoven: Symphony No. 9|accessdate=26 November 2006 |author=Naxos |authorlink=Naxos Records |year=2006 |work=Naxos.com Classical Music Catalogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last time that Bernstein conducted the symphony; he died ten months later.

Sir [[Georg Solti]] recorded the symphony with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Chicago Symphony Chorus]] on two occasions: first in 1972 with soloists [[Pilar Lorengar]], [[Yvonne Minton]], [[Stuart Burrows]], and [[Martti Talvela]]; and again in 1986 with soloists [[Jessye Norman]], Reinhild Runkel, Robert Schunk, and [[Hans Sotin]]. On both occasions, the chorus was prepared by [[Margaret Hillis]]. The second recording won the [[Grammy Awards of 1988|1987 Grammy Award]] for Best Orchestral Performance.&lt;ref&gt;

There have been various attempts to record the Ninth to come closer to what Beethoven's contemporaries would have heard, i.e., with [[Historically informed performance|period instruments]]:
* [[Roger Norrington]] conducting the [[London Classical Players]] recorded it with period instruments for a 1987 release by [[EMI Records]] (rereleased in 1997 under the [[Virgin Classics]] label).
* [[Benjamin Zander]] made a 1992 recording of the Ninth with the [[Boston Philharmonic Orchestra]] and noted soprano Dominique Labelle (who first performed the work with Robert Shaw), following Beethoven's own metronome markings. Following further research, Zander released a second recording  with the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] in 2018 and paired it with a 3-hour audio lecture defending his new interpretation.
* [[Philippe Herreweghe]] recorded the Ninth with his period instrument [[Orchestre des Champs-Élysées]] and his [[Collegium Vocale Gent|Collegium Vocale]] chorus for [[Harmonia Mundi]] in 1999.
* Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]] recorded his period instrument version of the Ninth Symphony,&lt;ref&gt;Makell (2002), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; conducting his [[Monteverdi Choir]] and [[Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique]] in 1992. It was first released by [[Deutsche Grammophon]] in 1994 on their early music Archiv Produktion label as part of his complete cycle of the Beethoven symphonies. His soloists included [[Ľuba Orgonášová]], [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], [[Anthony Rolfe Johnson]] and Gilles Cachemaille.
* An additional period instrument recording by [[Christopher Hogwood]] and the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] was released in 1997 under the label [[Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre]].

At 79 minutes, one of the longest Ninths recorded is [[Karl Böhm]]'s, conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1981 with [[Jessye Norman]] and [[Plácido Domingo]] among the soloists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Symphony-No-Ludwig-van/dp/B000001GN4/ref=sr_1_1 Beethoven: Symphony No. 9], [[Karl Böhm]] conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]]; [[Jessye Norman]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Brigitte Fassbaender]], [[Walter Berry (bass-baritone)|Walter Berry]]  (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Haus-UngargasseNr5-Tafel2.jpg|thumb|343x343px|Plate installed at Building Ungargasse No. 5. It says: "In this house Ludwig van Beethoven finished his Symphony No. 9 during winter 1823/24. In memorial of the centenary of the world premiere on May, 7 1824 the plate was dedicated to the master and his work by the Wiener Schubertbund on May 7, 1924."]]Many later composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]] and beyond were influenced by the Ninth Symphony.

An important theme in the finale of [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 1 in C minor]] is related to the "Ode to Joy" theme from the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. When this was pointed out to Brahms, he is reputed to have retorted "Any fool can see that!" Brahms's first symphony was, at times, both praised and derided as "Beethoven's Tenth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2650 Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68]. The Kennedy Center, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Symphony influenced the forms that [[Anton Bruckner]] used for the movements of his symphonies. His [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 3]] is in the same D-minor key as Beethoven's 9th and makes substantial use of thematic ideas from it. The colossal slow movement of Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7]], "as usual", takes the same A–B–A–B–A form as the 3rd movement of Beethoven's symphony and also uses some figuration from it.&lt;ref name=taruskin&gt;{{Cite book| first=Richard |last=Taruskin |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |year=2010 |title=Music in the Nineteenth Century |series=The Oxford History of Western Music |volume=3 |pages=747–51 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-538483-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opening notes of the third movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9 (''From the New World'')]], [[Antonín Dvořák]] pays homage to the scherzo of this symphony with his falling fourths and timpani strokes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Steinberg, Michael]]. ''The Symphony: a listeners guide''. p. 153. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, [[Béla Bartók]] borrows the opening [[Motif (music)|motif]] of the scherzo from Beethoven's Ninth symphony to introduce the second movement scherzo in his own Four Orchestral Pieces, Op. 12 (Sz 51).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Orrin|title=About the Piece {{!}} Four Orchestral Pieces, Op. 12|url=http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/four-orchestral-pieces-op-12-bela-bartok|publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic|accessdate=27 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608004144/http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/four-orchestral-pieces-op-12-bela-bartok|archive-date=8 June 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartók|first=Béla|title=4 Pieces, Op. 12 – Violin I – (Musical Score)|year=1912|publisher=Universal Edition|pages=3|url=http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8b/IMSLP54751-PMLP46172-Bartok-Op12.Violin1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One legend is that the compact disc was deliberately designed to have a 74-minute playing time so that it could accommodate Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. [[Kees Immink]], Philips' chief engineer, who developed the CD, recalls that a commercial tug-of-war between the development partners, Sony and Philips, led to a settlement in a neutral 12-cm diameter format. The 1951 performance of the Ninth Symphony conducted by [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|Furtwängler]] was brought forward as the perfect excuse for the change,&lt;ref name="Immink2"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Use as anthem===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Anthem of Europe (US Navy instrumental short version).ogg|title=Anthem of Europe (short version)}}
During the division of Germany in the [[Cold War]], the "Ode to Joy" segment of the symphony was played in lieu of an anthem at the Olympic Games for the [[United Team of Germany]] between 1956 and 1968. In 1972, the musical backing (without the words) was adopted as the [[Anthem of Europe]] by the [[Council of Europe]] and subsequently by the [[European Communities]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/anthem/index_en.htm|title=The European Anthem|publisher=Europa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/anthem/index_en.htm Europa – The EU at a glance – The European Anthem&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Ode to Joy" was used as the national anthem of [[Rhodesia]] between 1974 and 1979, as "[[Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cHBmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XosNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6475,5011881&amp;dq "Rhodesia picks Ode to Joy"], ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', 30 August 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the Presbyterian pastor [[Henry van Dyke]] wrote the hymn "[[The Hymn of Joy|Joyful, Joyful, we adore thee]]" while staying at [[Williams College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Dyke|first=Henry|title=The poems of Henry van Dyke|year=2004|publisher=Fredonia Books|location=Netherlands|isbn=1410105741|url=https://www.amazon.com/Poems-Henry-van-Dyke/dp/1410105741}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn is commonly sung in English-language churches to the "Ode to Joy" melody from this symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Corey F. O'Brien, "[http://www.northprospectchurch.org/Sermons/s081109.pdf November 9, 2008 sermon]" at North Prospect Union United Church of Christ in Medford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Year-end tradition===
The [[Trade unions in Germany|German]] [[workers' movement]] began the tradition of performing the Ninth Symphony on New Year's Eve in 1918. Performances started at 11pm so that the symphony's finale would be played at the beginning of the new year. This tradition continued during the Nazi period and was also observed by East Germany after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hr-online.de/servlet/de.hr.cms.servlet.File/11-006.pdf?enc=d3M9aHJteXNxbCZibG9iSWQ9MTE5NDAzNDkmaWQ9NDA3NDE2MTkmZm9yY2VEb3dubG9hZD0x "Beethovens 9. Sinfonie – Musik für alle Zwecke – Die Neunte und Europa: "Die Marseillaise der Menschheit"], by Niels Kaiser, [[hr2]], 26 January 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Symphony is traditionally performed throughout Japan at the end of the year. In December 2009, for example, there were 55 performances of the symphony by various major orchestras and choirs in Japan.&lt;ref name="Brasor"&gt;Brasor, Philip, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101224r1.html Japan makes Beethoven's Ninth No. 1 for the holidays]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 24 December 2010, p. 20, retrieved on 24 December 2010; {{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;Uranaka, Taiga, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19991201a5.html Beethoven concert to fete students' wartime sendoff]", ''The Japan Times'', 1 December 1999, retrieved on 24 December 2010. {{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was introduced to Japan during World War I by German prisoners held at the [[Bandō prisoner-of-war camp]]. Japanese orchestras, notably the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], began performing the symphony in 1925 and during World War II, the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial government]] promoted performances of the symphony, including on New Year's Eve. In an effort to capitalize on its popularity, orchestras and choruses undergoing economic hard times during Japan's reconstruction, performed the piece at year's end. In the 1960s, these year-end performances of the symphony became more widespread, and included the participation of local choirs and orchestras, firmly establishing a tradition that continues today.

'''''The Angriest Dog in the World''''' is a [[comic strip]] created by film director [[David Lynch]].

==Background==
The strip was conceived by Lynch in 1973 during a period when he was experiencing feelings of great anger.&lt;ref name="City"/&gt; First published in the ''[[Los Angeles Reader|LA Reader]]'', the strip ran from 1983 until 1992.&lt;ref name="City"&gt;{{cite web | last =The City of Absurdity| title =The Angriest Dog in the World | url =http://thecityofabsurdity.com/dog.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also serialised in the comics anthology ''[[Cheval Noir (comics)|Cheval Noir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cheval-noir-20/4000-34354/&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip is introduced with a small caption:
{{quote|The [[dog]] who is so angry he cannot move. He cannot eat. He cannot sleep. He can just barely growl. Bound so tightly with tension and anger, he approaches the state of [[rigor mortis]].}}

Visually each strip is the same. The first three identical panels feature the black dog growling, tied to a post in a yard by a chain. He is between a tree on the left and one wall of a house with a window on the right. The fourth panel is the same, but at night with a circle of light coming from the house's window.

In a short essay on Lynch's ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'', Objectif Cinema notes:
:David Lynch has of course used animals within his back catalogue of work before. Dogs for instance feature in nearly every one of his movies usually as a visual prop: who could forget the scene in ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' in which our canine friend scampers away with the Bank teller's severed hand? Or the mewling pups in Mary X's living room in ''[[Eraserhead]]''? Indeed a dog, albeit in cartoon form, took centre stage in Lynch's cartoon series for the ''LA Reader'', ''The Angriest Dog in the World''. But it is here on his website that Lynch seems to be opening up more to the wonders of nature: Bees, Coyotes and Dead Mice all have a part to play in various guises and manifestations within www.davidlynch.com, and as part of the pay-per-view series, the Rabbit has been given the starring role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objectif-cinema.com/davidlynch/analyses/0004a.php Objectif Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt;

A word balloon appears in one or more of the panels, indicating speech from a member of one of the house's unseen family, either Bill, Sylvia, Pete or Billy, Jr. Usually the speech is in the form of an [[aphorism]] or a [[non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequitur]]. Such sayings include: "If everything is real... then nothing is real as well." and "It doesn't get any better than this."

&lt;!-- bordering trivia section--&gt;
* In 2003, the strip was parodied by cartoonist [[Ted Rall]] with his comic ''The Angriest Liberal in the World''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lindholm.jp/pix/clipart/tr030614.gif The Angriest Liberal in the World, 6-12-03]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2004, the clip-art comic ''[[Dinosaur Comics]]'', which similarly uses the same sequence of illustrations in every strip, made a direct reference to ''The Angriest Dog in the World''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=393 Dinosaur Comics, September 21 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' episode "[http://homestarrunner.com/ween16.html Later That Night...]" had The Cheat dressed as The Angriest Dog in the World.

'''''The Museum of Eterna's Novel''''' (original [[Spanish-language]] title: '''''Museo de la Novela de la Eterna''''') is an avant-garde [[experimental novel]] by the Argentine writer [[Macedonio Fernández]]. The book has been described as Fernández' masterwork.&lt;ref name="latimes2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/16/entertainment/la-ca-macedoniol-fernandez-20100516|title=Book review: ''The Museum of Eterna's Novel'' (The First Good Novel)'|author=Jim Ruland|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 16, 2010|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Frouman-Smith | first1 = E. | jstor = 20119193| title = Macedonio Fernández and the Spanish American New Novel | journal = Latin American Literary Review | volume = 8 | issue = 15 | pages = 42–44 | year = 1979 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fernández started writing it in 1925, and continued working on it for the rest of his life. It was published posthumously in 1967, 15 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/016_05/5016|title=Borges's Father|date=February 2010|author=Matthew Ladd|publisher=Bookforum|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fernández is widely regarded as a major influence on [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and its writing style bears some resemblance to Borges'. It has been described as an "anti-novel".&lt;ref name="latimes2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.openletterbooks.org/authors/16|author=Margaret Schwartz|title=The Museum of Eterna's Novel|publisher=Open Letter|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book is written in a non-linear style, as a set of multi-layered diversions, discursions and self-reflections, with over fifty prologues before the "main" text of the novel begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/argentina/fernandm.htm|title=The Museum of Eterna's Novel (The First Good Novel)  by Macedonio Fernández|author=M.A.Orthofer|date=21 February 2010|publisher=The Complete Review|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wait-listing service''' (WLS) provided by a [[domain name registry]] provides the ability to option a [[domain name]] that is already registered. The option-holder then has the ability to have first rights to that domain name if the current registrant should cancel their registration.

Taking such an option is no guarantee a person will be able to register the domain name, merely that the person will be able to if the domain name becomes otherwise available. If the existing holder continues to renew his domain name, the option-holder will never get the domain through the procedure.

A move to introduce this service by [[ICANN]] accredited registries drew fire in 2003 as anti-competitive. Currently [[domain name registrar]]s provide a similar, non-guaranteed service by continually querying the registry if a domain name is available. If it should become available, the registrar quickly tries to register the domain to the new party. The consequence of this process is that, if multiple registrars are vying for the domain, the beneficiary of the new domain name may come down to luck and circumstance.

The '''Warburg Haus, Hamburg''' is a German interdisciplinary forum for art history and cultural sciences and primarily for political iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clio-online.de/site/lang__de/ItemID__3926/mid__10392/57/default.aspx |title=Forschungsstelle Politische Ikonographie [Warburg-Haus Hamburg&amp;#93; - Eintrag im Clio-online Web-Verzeichnis Geschichte |publisher=Clio-online.de |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sts.tu-harburg.de/projects/WEL/english/entry.html |title=Warburg Electronic Library |publisher=Sts.tu-harburg.de |date= |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dedicated to the life and work of [[Aby Warburg]] and run by the [[University of Hamburg]] as a semi-independent seminar. "It issues a series of art historical publications directly modeled on the original institution's studies and lectures, and is a sponsor of the reprinted 'Study Edition' released through the Akademie Verlag in Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sks.sirs.bdt.orc.scoolaid.net/cgi-bin/hst-article-display?id=SNY5703-0-8374&amp;artno=0000134897&amp;type=ART|author= J. Duncan Berry|title="THE FORTUNES OF ABY WARBURG"|journal=New Criterion|date=November 2000|pages=29-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1926 for the ''Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg'' (KBW) in Heilwigstraße 116, [[Eppendorf, Hamburg|Eppendorf]], [[Hamburg]], the Warburg Haus was a center of interdisciplinary research and global exchange in the humanities during the [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbkultur.uni-hamburg.de/ks/ueber-das-institut/warburg-haus.html |title=Warburg-Haus : Über das Seminar : Universität Hamburg |publisher=Fbkultur.uni-hamburg.de |date= |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Warburg Haus helped to shape the thought and work of some of the greatest scholars of the first half of the twentieth century, from [[Fritz Saxl]] and [[Erwin Panofsky]] to [[Ernst Cassirer]]. In 1933, the house was closed and its library shipped to London in order to escape the clutches of the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/home/aboutthewarburginstitute/history/migration/ |title=The Warburg Institute: Migration |publisher=Warburg.sas.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original library is now part of the [[Warburg Institute]] in London.

In 1993, the house was acquired by the city of Hamburg and renovated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephan Schirmer - Schirmer Medienservice |url=http://www.kulturkarte.de/hamburg/15036abiw |title=Aby Warburg Haus in Hamburg auf Kulturkarte.de - Kultur-Stadtplan von Hamburg (Adresse, Standort, Anfahrt, Telefon, Homepage und Foto) |publisher=Kulturkarte.de |date=2007-07-09 |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, the building of the "cultural studies library" is used for artistic and cultural research, and art historical seminars, workshops, and colloquiums. In 2001, the archive of the Hamburg-born art historian, [[William S. Heckscher]] (1904-1999), was shipped from Princeton to the Warburg Haus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbkultur.uni-hamburg.de/ks/einrichtungen/archive/warburg-archiv.html |title=Warburg-Archiv mit Heckscher-Archiv : Archive : Universität Hamburg |publisher=Fbkultur.uni-hamburg.de |date= |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sehepunkte.de/2010/01/14629.html|author=Johannes Rößler, Charlotte Schoell-Glass / Elizabeth Sears|title= Verzetteln als Methode: Der humanistische Ikonologe William S. Heckscher|journal=Sehepunkte|volume=10|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the German art historian [[Martin Warnke (art historian)|Martin Warnke]] directed the Center for Political Iconography at the Warburg Haus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/article107206802/Das-unbewusste-Bildgedaechtnis-der-Menschheit.html |title=Politische Ikonografie: Was der Hamburger Kunsthistoriker Martin Warnke im Warburg-Haus wiederbelebt hat - Das unbewusste Bildgedächtnis der Menschheit - Kultur &amp; Live - Hamburger Abendblatt |publisher=Abendblatt.de |date= |accessdate=2015-04-15|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
